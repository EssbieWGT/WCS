In this article, the authors review the Trump administration's recent efforts with respect to the critical minerals industry that may be the kick-start the U.S. critical minerals sector needs to strengthen the supply chain and build domestic resiliency.

Those in the critical minerals industry have been waiting to see what President Donald Trump's next move would be after his ""Unleashing American Energy"" executive order on January 20, 2025 (the January Executive Order),1 the recent executive order launching the 232 investigation to determine the effect that copper imports have on national security,2 and the potential 25% proposed copper tariff on copper imports.

Then, on March 20, two months after the January executive order, the White House released a new executive order, ""Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production"" (the EO),3 leaving no doubt about President Trump's plans (and ability) to spur domestic critical mineral production and reduce reliance on foreign critical minerals and processing capabilities. Importantly, the EO requires immediate action to ""facilitate domestic mineral production to the maximum possible extent.""

The first major item to note is that the EO confirms what industry players have been demanding for several years; the EO includes copper as a ""mineral"" and supports the development of US copper projects. Those following this topic will be aware that copper was not deemed a ""critical mineral"" by the Secretary of the Interior in its 2022 Critical Mineral List,4 and was only deemed a ""critical material"" by the Department of Energy in 2023. Because copper is so vital to the energy infrastructure and energy technology, this inclusion by President Trump is critical when focusing on U.S. mineral production and supply chain resiliency.

This EO also defined ""mineral"" to include ""a critical mineral, as defined by 30 U.S.C. 1606(a)(3), as well as includes uranium, copper, potash, gold, and any other element, compound or material as determined by the chair of the National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC)."" The EO specifically identifies uranium, potash, and gold as minerals, which were all excluded from the 2022 Critical Mineral List.

Also, this definition of ""mineral"" allows the Trump administration flexibility in determining which minerals are included under the act as the chair of the NEDC or the Secretary of the Interior (using power under 30 U.S.C. 1606(c)) can determine which mineral productions should be increased.

Notably, despite the inclusion of copper, gold, potash, and uranium as ""minerals"" under the EO, the EO does not amend the Secretary of the Interior's 2022 Critical Mineral List to include these additional minerals as ""critical minerals"" thereunder, nor does it allow for these minerals to otherwise qualify for eligibility under Section 45X of the Internal Revenue Code (a means by which critical mineral producers and others in the critical mineral space can monetize tax credits for certain eligible components).

The EO also defined ""mineral production"" as ""the mining, processing, refining, and smelting of minerals, and the production of processed critical minerals and other derivative products."" This broad definition of mineral production suggests that the Trump administration intends to increase and support mining at all stages, from the extraction phase – which was not supported under the Inflation Reduction Act until October of 2024 – to the refining and smelting phases, processes in which the United States is severely lacking. CREATIN

CREATING PRIORITY PROJECTS LISTS

The Trump administration instructed the head of each executive department and agency involved in the permitting of mineral production in the United States to provide, within 10 days of the EO, a list of all mineral production projects for which a plan of operation, permit application, or other application for approval has been submitted to that agency. 10 days after these first lists are submitted, those same agency heads must work with the chair of the NEDC to make a ""priority list of projects,"" and must take all necessary or appropriate actions to expedite and issue the relevant permits or approvals.

15 days later, the chair of the NEDC must submit, to the executive director of the Permitting Council, mining projects for consideration to the FAST-41 program for expedited and transparent permitting review and approval.

FAST-41 project timelines for such project must be set forth by no later than 15 days after getting such initial list. Currently, there is only one mining project in the FAST-41 program, as it has been argued that the program's requirements for public transparency with a mining project's plans and operations discourages participation. It will be interesting to see if this new process required by this EO will encourage more participation.

While the need for efficiency and expediency with the U.S. permitting timelines is long overdue, it is unclear if these federal agencies and departments can produce these lists and ramp up their approval processes so quickly. Perhaps this is a step in the right direction to encourage that process. Finally, the EO also requested industry feedback on regulatory bottlenecks and other strategies for expediting domestic mineral production.

ADDRESSING THE MINING ACT OF 1872

The Trump administration is also proposing to address the Mining Act of 1872, by requiring recommendations to clarify the treatment of waste rock, tailings, and mine waste disposal under the Act.

LOCATING FEDERAL LAND FOR NEW LAND MINERAL PROJECTS

By no later than 10 days after the EO, the Secretary of the Interior must provide a list of all Federal lands known to currently hold mineral deposits and reserves, and then the Secretary of the Interior shall designate the mining of these minerals the primary use of such lands, and any related land use plans under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act for these designated lands shall be amended or revised if necessary, so that the intent of the EO can be carried out on such lands.

Further, the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, and Secretary of Energy are, required to, within 30 days of the EO, identify sites on federal land that may be suitable for leasing or development for the construction and operation of critical mineral projects. These sites on which these projects could be fully permitted and operational as soon as possible are to be prioritized. The EO also requires these agencies to enter into extended-use leases with private entities to advance the installation of commercial mineral production enterprises on the lands identified.5 The Trump administration has also instructed agencies that provide financing or capital assistance to mining companies or their project sponsors to ensure favorable terms and conditions for these parties entering into mineral production leases.

FINANCING OF DOMESTIC MINING PROJECTS

The Secretary of Defense has been granted the president's authority under the Defense Production Act Section 303 – which is generally used for defense needs – and the Secretary of Defense (and in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of the Interior and others), can use this authority to progress the advancement of domestic critical mineral production for strategic resources. The Secretary of Defense shall also focus on pairing providers of private capital with mining companies.

Agencies empowered to make loans, equity investments, grants, etc. are instructed to rescind policies6 that require applicants to include disclosures required by Regulation S-K part 1300. The Trump administration has also waived the requirements of 50 U.S.C. 4531(d)(1)(a)(ii), 4332(d)(1)(B), and 4553(a)(1)-(a)(6). President Trump has also delegated to the chief executive officer of the United States International Development Finance Corporation certain authority of the president under the Defense Production Act.

Finally, the EO also requires that, within 30 days:

The DFC and the Secretary of Defense develop a proposal for a dedicated mineral production fund for domestic investments;

The Export-Import Bank release a program for the use of mineral production financing tools to support domestic mineral production and to secure the United States' offtake of foreign raw minerals; and

The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy is tasked with organizing mineral buyers and establishing a system for bids from critical mineral producers to supply the minerals.

The EO implements several rapidly approaching deadlines on various governmental agency heads showing that the Trump administration is highly prioritizing the domestic production of critical minerals. These requirements aim to expedite the domestic permitting process, expand the scope of minerals and types of mining processes for those critical to energy security, remove bottlenecks and barriers for the projects, and support government and private capital into the critical minerals market. It is clear the programs and timelines set forth by the Trump administration are aggressive, but it may be the kick-start the U.S. critical minerals sector needs to strengthen the supply chain and build domestic resiliency.

“Due to policy and market uncertainty, we are pausing construction at our South Carolina facility at this time,” AESC said in a recent statement.
South Carolina Gov.
The company had earlier scaled back plans to build two plants in South Carolina, saying one would suffice to meet BMW’s projected demand.
Despite AESC’s construction pause, BMW confirmed it will proceed with the opening of its $700 million battery assembly plant in Woodruff, South Carolina, by 2026.","Faced with shifting US policy and trade risks, AESC — a Japan-based battery maker majority-owned by China’s Envision Group — has paused its $1.6 billion battery cell factory project in South Carolina, originally intended to supply BMW electric vehicles.

The move underscores Korean battery firms as potential alternatives for the German automaker, given their accelerated push to expand US-based production.

“Due to policy and market uncertainty, we are pausing construction at our South Carolina facility at this time,” AESC said in a recent statement. While no timeline was given, the company said it would “resume construction once circumstances stabilize” and reiterated its pledge to invest $1.6 billion and create 1,600 jobs.

South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster noted that AESC is navigating potential fallout from the loss of federal EV subsidies and tax incentives, as well as tariff risks linked to US President Donald Trump’s return to power.

AESC said it has already invested $1 billion in the Florence facility — its second US production site after an ongoing project in Kentucky. The company had earlier scaled back plans to build two plants in South Carolina, saying one would suffice to meet BMW’s projected demand.

Despite AESC’s construction pause, BMW confirmed it will proceed with the opening of its $700 million battery assembly plant in Woodruff, South Carolina, by 2026. The automaker had originally planned to use AESC’s 46-series cylindrical cells — 46 millimeters in diameter — in its next-generation EV lineup, including the “BMW Vision Neue Klasse.” By 2030, BMW aims to produce at least six all-electric models in the US.

Industry insiders say the disruption in AESC’s US supply could open doors for Korean battery makers. Among them, Samsung SDI began supplying the larger cylindrical batteries to a US carmaker for the first time in March. LG Energy Solution is set to begin mass production in the latter half of this year, while SK On has completed its development process.

“AESC, acquired by Hong Kong’s Envision Group in 2018, managed to bypass US trade barriers targeting the Chinese EV supply chain due to its Japanese origins,” said Park Cheol-wan, an automotive engineering professor at Seojeong University. “Its pause could signal a cautious approach amid trade tensions — or a strategic pullback by BMW in its US EV plans.”

Yang Min-ho, an energy engineering professor at Dankook University, noted, “Given BMW’s commitment to the US market and the likelihood that it will need to expand local production under Trump’s protectionist trade stance, the automaker will likely seek to fill the gap in its battery supply chain.”

He added that BMW could turn to LG Energy Solution or SK On, both of which have US production sites and carry less tariff risk. As of June, LG Energy Solution and SK On are operating or building seven and four facilities, respectively, in North America, including joint ventures with major automakers.

Before the Trump administration’s shifting tariff policies targeting both allies and adversaries, BMW’s US EV strategy relied on importing vehicles assembled in Europe — primarily Germany — while ramping up its production capacity in North America.

BMW’s key battery suppliers in Europe, Samsung SDI and China’s CATL, signed long-term contracts in 2019 extending through 2031. These deals played a crucial role in BMW’s European EV push and allowed the automaker to allocate part of its European output to the US.

Meanwhile, BMW had also looked to cost-competitive battery producers like AESC for US supply. But after facing a 27.5 percent tariff on passenger cars imported from EU countries, the company has been under growing pressure to increase domestic production.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently announced plans to offset US tariffs by equalizing the value of automobile trade. The proposal would allow duty-free imports of US-made cars into Germany in exchange for equivalent tariff waivers on German cars shipped to the US.

However, based on the recent US–UK tariff arrangement — which limits 10 percent tariffs to just 100,000 vehicles from the UK — Germany’s roughly 400,000 annual car exports to the US may only benefit from partial tariff relief.

“Even though Germany has more at stake than the UK, Trump is unlikely to offer full waivers on German cars,” said Yang.

Why it matters: More clean energy projects could follow if the Senate's version of the reconciliation bill passes.

The Senate draft bill would slash tax credits for EVs, solar rooftops, utility solar and wind, leading to more manufacturers pulling back.

Zoom in: A report from research group E2 said that the year's cancelled factories and projects would have created nearly 12,000 jobs.

The May cancellations included Cleveland-Cliff's plan to convert a West Virginia factory to make electric transformers, OneD Battery Science's planned pilot facility in Washington, GM's designs for an EV factory in New York, and Meyer Burger's planned solar modular factory in Arizona.

The cancelled projects also included battery recycling company Li-Cycle's development of plants in New York, Arizona and Alabama.

Stunning stat: Republican districts accounted for more than 9,000 of those jobs and $9 billion of the $15.5 billion total.

The intrigue: Rivian, GTI Energy, Prolec GE Waukesha and Damera were among companies that announced nearly $450 million in new investments for solar, grid and EV factories in May, but those fell well short of offsetting the losses.

The big picture: The surge in cancellations this year versus the previous two years came as manufacturers responded to the Trump administration's pivot from low-carbon energy.

But the new permit application seems to show that the developer, Delaware River Partners, still wants to build the terminal.
Under the Trump administration, federal agencies including the EPA, Fish & Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have lost many long-time employees, and with them institutional knowledge that is hard to replace, the source said.
The Trump administration has not made its intentions clear on the future of fracking in the watershed.","On June 11, all four states represented by the Delaware River Basin Commission approved a plan by the agency’s federal member, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, to end any future funding for programs on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and climate change.

For the Trump administration’s critics, the resolution was the latest sign of the shifting role of the federal government in the watershed’s management and the Trump administration’s push to promote fossil fuels, dismantling environmental protection, and attempting to deny climate change.

That the Army Corps, as a part of the Trump administration, should propose such a cut is less surprising than the unanimous agreement of the states — New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware — to a plan that would fuel the federal government’s attacks on science in the Delaware River’s urban estuary and beyond.

“It was an appalling capitulation to the Trump Administration’s attempts to wipe out diversity, equity, and inclusion and to ignore the crisis we are all experiencing, including in the watershed, with climate change impacts,” said Tracy Carluccio, deputy director of Delaware Riverkeeper Network, an environmental nonprofit.

“Not only is it impossible to ignore the reality that our overburdened communities are suffering from environmental racism that must be corrected through actions and policies by the states and independent agencies like DRBC, it is ludicrous to pretend there isn’t a climate crisis that must be addressed,” Carluccio said.

The resolution said: “In recognition of policies of the current federal administration, from this point forward and for as long as these policies remain in effect, federal funds awarded hereafter to the Commission through the United States Army Corps of Engineers shall not be used directly or indirectly to support programs or policies that advance the principles of ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ or the concept of ‘climate change.’”

New political reality

The Delaware River Basin Commission is facing a new political reality since NJ Spotlight News explored the threats and promises of the watershed and its ecosystem in its “Water’s Edge” project in 2023.

At the time, the river’s urban estuary especially — running from Cape May to Trenton — faced profound threats both natural and human-caused, yet progress in addressing them was also evident. Now programs underpinning that progress are threatened by an administration in Washington seemingly bent on gutting such programs.

The commission’s vote for the federal funding cut earlier this month was the latest example of the threats. The vote came as somewhat of a surprise, as it was not on the meeting agenda ahead of time, fueling suspicions that the commission was seeking to hide the vote from public view.

“No agency should hide the proverbial football by having a resolution that is not publicly available ahead of the meeting,” said Doug O’Malley, director of the nonprofit Environment New Jersey, who attended the meeting. “There was no detail given until the actual vote occurred.”

Beth Brown, a spokeswoman for the commission, declined to say what the withdrawal of federal funding would mean for the agency’s policies on DEI and climate change, but she said the commissioners’ vote will mean the Army Corps continues to cooperate with the commission’s management of the region’s water resources.

“The action taken by the Commission at its June 11, 2025, business meeting will ensure that the commission can continue to provide trusted, effective, and coordinated management of the Basin’s shared water resources with the full participation of the United States,” Brown said in a statement.

The resolution does not affect other sources of federal grant funding from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, she said.

The federal spending cut cited by the resolution is “limited to potential future funding provided through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,” Brown said. She noted that the federal government paid its scheduled yearly dues of $715,000 to the commission for both the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years but not for fiscal year 2025, which ends on June 30. For fiscal year 2026, the federal dues are “not guaranteed” and will depend on the passage of a federal budget, Brown said.

“If DRBC does not receive federal signatory funding for FY 2026, the Commission can seek other sources of support, such as competitive grants, that align with its mission of managing, protecting and improving the shared water resources of the Delaware River Basin,” she said.

Climate change

In 2019, the commission set up the Advisory Committee on Climate Change to identify “potentially significant” impacts on the basin from climate change-related impacts such as salinity from sea-level rise in the Delaware River’s tidal section, and impacts to stream flow because of changes in precipitation. The committee’s 18 members include appointees by the DRBC’s executive director, water company executives and academics.

Since 1996, the federal government has contributed to the DRBC’s approximately $8 million annual budget only three times: that year, plus in 2023 and 2024. Its accumulated shortfall is $17.1 million since agreeing in 1988 to pay 20% of the agency’s annual running costs, commission data shows.

Some funding that was initially cut from groups that work on the estuary has now been restored but other sources have been irrevocably lost, forcing those groups to cut their environmental work.

The Delaware River Basin Commission, which oversees water quality and supply in the basin, represents the water interests of its four member states, plus the federal government. It was set up by the administration of President John F. Kennedy in 1961.

In Trenton, a statement from the office of Gov. Phil Murphy did not say why his representative on the commission voted for the funding cut, but said it would only apply to Army Corps funding for DEI and climate programs.

“The prohibition on ‘directly or indirectly’ using funds awarded by the US Army Corps for DEI/Climate projects is specifically limited to US Army Corps funds,” and does not affect any funding for those programs from New Jersey or other states, the statement said.

Pressure from Congress

Pressure on the DRBC and its management of water resources in the Delaware River Basin is also coming from Congress, where U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan, a new Republican member for part of northeast Pennsylvania, sponsored a bill calling for a federal review of the commission and two other mid-Atlantic river basin commissions.

The bill, introduced on May 15, would require the U.S. Comptroller General to investigate the ethics, practices and funding of each commission, and recommend any reforms.

Bresnahan’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the reasons for the bill. Carluccio of the Delaware Riverkeeper Network called the measure an effort to disempower an agency that protects the public, rather than any attempt to uncover waste and fraud.

“This is a thinly veiled attempt to probe the DRBC and the other two commissions to find out how to bring them into compliance with the dysfunctional systems the Department of Government Efficiency is creating with its destructive actions,” she said, referring to the controversial agency set up by President Donald Trump to reduce government spending and jobs, and initially led by Tesla boss Elon Musk.

Critics of the Trump administration’s actions in the Delaware River estuary also cite a last-minute order by the U.S. Department of Energy to keep an aging power plant at Eddystone near Philadelphia running beyond its scheduled retirement on the grounds that its power is needed to meet higher summer demand. The plant, built in the 1960s, generates electricity using oil and gas, and therefore contributes to the atmospheric warming that helps to boost demand.

The plant had been scheduled to close permanently on May 31 but was directed by the DOE only one day before to continue providing power to the grid at times of peak demand for at least 90 days. The plant’s owner, Constellation Energy Corp., said it had decided to close the plant for economic reasons after an earlier determination by the grid operator PJM Interconnection that a shutdown would not hurt grid reliability. But after the DOE order, Constellation said it would retain the staff needed to continue operations safely and reliably.

Liquefied natural gas

Further evidence of the administration’s promotion of fossil fuels in the urban estuary, critics say, is the recent advocacy for a proposed export terminal for liquefied natural gas on the Delaware River near Philadelphia by the new Republican U.S. senator for Pennsylvania, Dave McCormick. The senator, who was endorsed by then-candidate Trump in the campaign, narrowly defeated Bob Casey, a three-term Democrat, in 2024.

In March, McCormick met with Franc James, chief executive of Penn America Energy Holdings, which plans to build the $7 billion terminal, which would also be at Eddystone, Pa.

“This massive, proposed project in southeastern Pennsylvania has the potential to generate billions in economic impact over the next 20 years, create 3,000 good-paying jobs, and produce $30-$40 million per year in tax revenue for this community,” McCormick said in a statement on his website. His office did not respond to a request for further comment for this story.

‘The impacts of fracking on watersheds are indisputable. Landmark protections require eternal vigilance, and clearly the industry is still looking to drill in the watershed.’ — Doug O’Malley, director, Environment New Jersey

In early June, James met officials at the White House to “provide intelligence” about the project, Reuters reported on June 5.

Across the river in Gibbstown, New Jersey, another proposed LNG export terminal awaits a decision from the DRBC on whether to extend a construction permit for another three years. That project looked doomed after the Biden administration withdrew a permit that would have allowed the transportation of LNG to Gibbstown by rail. But the new permit application seems to show that the developer, Delaware River Partners, still wants to build the terminal.

At the same site beside the Delaware River, the company also plans to build giant caverns to store liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) including butane and propane produced by the natural gas industry active in Pennsylvania’s giant Marcellus Shale, one of the world’s biggest natural gas formations. New Jersey regulators issued a draft approval for the project and are expected to issue a final decision in coming months after a public comment period that ended on June 16.

Federal funding cuts

At a grassroots level, work to protect the river and its urban estuary as far upstream as Trenton has been hurt by millions of dollars in recent direct and indirect federal funding cuts, according to the leader of one nonprofit who spoke on condition of anonymity because she fears that any public criticism of funding cuts would provoke retaliation from the Trump administration.

Some funding that was initially cut from groups that work on the estuary has now been restored but other sources have been irrevocably lost, forcing those groups to cut their environmental work. Under the Trump administration, federal agencies including the EPA, Fish & Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have lost many long-time employees, and with them institutional knowledge that is hard to replace, the source said.

While many of those employees have left voluntarily, others may still be laid off, fueling fears that even if certain federal grants survive the bloodletting, there won’t be anyone left at some agencies to hand out the money.

Still, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plans to continue its funding for the congressionally mandated Delaware Watershed Conservation Fund, and expects to announce grantees in August or September. “We are moving forward with our grant cycle as planned for this fiscal year,” said FWS spokeswoman Bridget MacDonald.

Meanwhile, unconfirmed reports say the DRBC’s hard-fought ban on fracking for natural gas in the Delaware Basin is under pressure from both state and federal Republican lawmakers, including Pennsylvania’s Bresnahan, and perhaps from the head of the EPA, Lee Zeldin.

The fracking ban, finalized in 2021 after being unofficially in place for about a decade, was a landmark decision that protects the Delaware watershed from an industry that could otherwise contaminate aquifers supplying drinking water to some 13 million people, said O’Malley of Environment New Jersey.

The Trump administration has not made its intentions clear on the future of fracking in the watershed. But any lifting of the ban would be consistent with the administration’s support for fossil fuels, he said.

“No one, including the federal government, gets to wave a wand and reverse decisions by the DRBC,” O’Malley said. “The impacts of fracking on watersheds are indisputable. Landmark protections require eternal vigilance, and clearly the industry is still looking to drill in the watershed.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/06/Delaware-River-estuary-at-Chester-Marcus-Hook.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 01:02:00.786110

GOP districts see $9 billion in investments; 10,000 jobs disappear due to cancelled or delayed projects so far

$444 million in new investments announced in May don’t offset cancellations

WASHINGTON – As the U.S. Senate prepares to vote on massive tax and spending bill that would increase taxes on clean energy factories and projects, businesses canceled another $1.4 billion in new factories and clean energy projects in May, according to E2’s latest monthly analysis of clean energy projects tracked by E2 and Clean Economy Tracker.

The latest cancellations – including battery, electric vehicle and solar panel factories in West Virginia, New York, Alabama, Arizona and Washington – mean $15.5 billion in new factories and electricity projects have been cancelled since January 1. The cancelled projects were expected to create nearly 12,000 new jobs.

Republican congressional districts are losing the most. More than $9 billion in investments and almost10,000 jobs have been cancelled, delayed or closed in Republican districts so far in 2025.

The $1.4 billion in projects cancelled in May were expected to create at least 1,000 new jobs. Another 600 workers were laid off across five closures announced last month. May’s cancellations also include GM’s decision to cancel plans for an EV factory in Tonawanda plant in New York and instead shift its investments there to build 8-cylinder gas vehicles.

Following is a statement from MICHAEL TIMBERLAKE, E2 COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:

“The consequences of continued policy uncertainty and the expectation of higher taxes on clean energy businesses are becoming painfully clear. Businesses are reacting to the Senate’s proposal—like the House’s— that would drastically scale back the very tax credits that had been driving an American energy and manufacturing boom.

“These cancellations are just the first shoe to drop. With renewable energy supplying more than 90 percent of new electricity in America last year, canceled projects will likely mean less available energy and higher electricity prices for consumers and business alike.”

Amid the cancellations, businesses in May also announced nearly $450 million in investments for new solar, EV and grid and transmission equipment factories across five states – including a $120 million investment by electric vehicle maker Rivian to build 1.2 million-square-foot supplier park in Illinois that is expected to create 100 new jobs. Separately, Prolec-GE Waukesh announced plans for a $140 million electricity transformer manufacturing facility in North Carolina expected to create 330 new jobs. Combined, the eight projects announced in May are expected to create at least 1,310 new permanent jobs if completed.

Through May, 62 percent of all clean energy projects announced—along with 71 percent of all jobs and 82 percent of all investments —are in congressional districts represented by Republicans.

According to a separate report from the Clean Energy Buyers Association, average household utility bills would rise by more than $110 per year and businesses would see at least a 10 percent increase in energy costs if Congress goes forward with its plans to repeal clean energy tax credits.

May’s announcements bring the overall number of major clean energy projects tracked by E2 to 397 across 42 states and Puerto Rico. Companies have said they plan to invest nearly $132 billion in these projects and hire 123,000 permanent workers. (These figures reflect ongoing revisions and updates).

Since federal clean energy tax credits were passed by Congress in August 2022, a total of 53 announced projects have been cancelled, closed, or downsized. More than 21,000 jobs and $18.2 billion in investments were connected with the abandoned projects.

“This technology overcomes the shortcomings of supercapacitors by using single-walled carbon nanotubes and conductive polymers,” said Dr. Bon-Cheol Ku of KIST.","Developing next-generation energy storage technologies that can deliver both high power and high capacity at the same time.

A research team led by Dr. Bon-Cheol Ku and Dr. Seo Gyun Kim from the Carbon Composite Materials Research Center at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), along with Professor Yuanzhe Piao of Seoul National University (SNU), has developed a high-performance supercapacitor that may represent the next generation of energy storage.

Their breakthrough addresses key limitations of current supercapacitors by using an advanced fiber structure made from single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and the conductive polymer polyaniline (PANI).

Supercapacitors charge faster and offer higher power density than traditional batteries, with minimal performance loss even after tens of thousands of charging cycles. However, their lower energy density limits how long they can operate, which has made them less practical for extended-use applications like electric vehicles and drones.

Innovative CNT‑PANI fiber structure

To address this challenge, the researchers chemically bonded single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), known for their high conductivity, with polyaniline (PANI), a low-cost and easily processed conductive polymer. By combining these materials at the nanoscale, they created a complex fiber structure that improves the movement of both electrons and ions. This results in a supercapacitor capable of storing more energy and releasing it more quickly.

The new supercapacitor has demonstrated stable performance through over 100,000 charge and discharge cycles and remains effective even in high-voltage environments. Because of its durability and efficiency, the technology can serve as either a replacement or an enhancement to current battery systems. In electric vehicles, it could deliver fast-charging power that boosts both driving range and performance.

Drones and robots may also benefit from longer operation times and improved reliability. Additionally, the CNT-PANI composite fiber is highly flexible, allowing it to be rolled or folded for use in next-generation electronics like wearable devices.

Mass production and cost reduction

Another major achievement of the research is the reduction of production costs and the possibility of mass production. Despite their excellent properties, single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been difficult to commercialize due to their high production costs, but the researchers solved this problem by compounding them with the low-cost conductive polymer polyaniline (PANI).

Furthermore, they have laid the foundation for mass production through a simple process, and recently succeeded in developing film-like structures based on this technology, further advancing commercialization. In the future, it will be utilized as a key enabling technology for the transition to a carbon-neutral society across various industries such as electric vehicles, robots, drones, and wearable devices.

“This technology overcomes the shortcomings of supercapacitors by using single-walled carbon nanotubes and conductive polymers,” said Dr. Bon-Cheol Ku of KIST. “We will continue to develop and industrialize ultra-high-performance carbon fibers based on carbon nanotubes.”

Energy Northwest’s Columbia Generating Station was expected to start powering down on Sunday before disconnecting from the grid and then addressing the problem.

After the Eastern Washington plant returned to service, turbine vibration readings increased to higher that expected.

As the plant reached 80% power, turbine vibration levels reached a point that require a turbine balancing procedure to reduce vibration and support full-power operation, Energy Northwest said late Sunday afternoon.

Siemens Energy has provided technical guidance, and Energy Northwest workers will install balance weights on the main turbine, Energy Northwest said.

“Balancing the turbine is a precise process and it’s important for the long-term reliability of our equipment to provide power to the region,” said Bob Schuetz, Energy Northwest chief executive officer, in a statement.

The time the plant will be disconnected from the Northwest electric grid is expected to be brief.

Once balancing is done and the plant is back on the grid, the turbine will be closely monitor.

If vibration levels are again too high, an additional balancing procedure may be required, Energy Northwest said.

A similar turbine balance was performed in December 2021 during a planned maintenance outage that also required temporary disconnection from the grid.

Columbia Generating Station’s turbine system includes three low-pressure turbines and one high-pressure turbine, with a combined rotating mass of approximately 1.2 million pounds. Precise alignment and balance are essential for reliable operation, as the turbines drive the main generator to produce electricity for the region.

The plant, which usually supplies enough electricity around the clock to power about 1 million homes, reconnected to the grid about 5 p.m. Monday, June 16, after a 65-day outage for refueling and for maintenance work that cannot be done while the reactor is operating.

Every other spring a third of the fuel rods in the reactor are replaced with fresh fuel.

The 2025 outage for the plant 10 miles north of Richland was longer than usual and the 2,000 workers hired were more than usual due to a major project, installing a new adjustable speed drive system.

The system needed to be replaced after there were a few issues that required powering down to fix components.

The speed drive controls the pumps that control the water inside the core, which in turn controls the amount of power the reactor produces, according to Energy Northwest.

The heat produced by a chain reaction boils the water within the core, creating steam that turns turbines attached to an electric generator.

Maine is home to two of the last remaining paper plants in the country that burn tires as fuel.
As other mills move away from so-called “tire-derived fuels,” Maine plants have increased their use in recent years, adding to their output of harmful pollutants.
When biogenic fuel is taken into account, mill greenhouse gas emissions are almost as high as the dirtiest U.S. oil refineries, according to EIP.
Nationwide, EIP found that paper mills’ greenhouse gas emissions were 350% higher than public-facing EPA estimates.","Two of Maine’s largest paper mills are among the dirtiest in the country, according to a new study on U.S. pulp and paper plants, putting their emissions on par with some oil refineries.

The May report from the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit advocacy group, calls attention to the industry’s overreliance on dirty fuels and the old, inefficient technologies they use to burn them.

“In Maine, there are several plants that are still burning coal and… tires,” said Courtney Bernhardt, EIP’s director of research who co-authored the report. “We wanted to raise awareness about that.”

The group analyzed greenhouse gas emissions from 185 paper plants across the country, which Bernhardt says are undercounted by federal estimates because of a loophole in the reporting process: the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency doesn’t include greenhouse gas emissions from “biogenic” fuel sources like biomass or black liquor, a wood byproduct of the chemical papermaking process, both of which mills burn to power their operations and can be dirtier than coal.

The agency’s rationale for excluding those sources from total emissions estimates in its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, according to EIP, is “because trees can grow back in the future” and offset the carbon emissions from biomass fuels.

Until the EPA accurately reports and regulates all facility emissions, mill owners will have less of a reason to pursue energy efficiency upgrades that can both cut back reliance on dirty fuels and maintain profits, the report claims.

The study’s recommendations for tightening limits on the paper industry’s emissions come as the Trump administration eyes drastic rollbacks of federal rules curtailing greenhouse gases and hazardous air pollutants released by American power plants, according to reporting from The New York Times.

Maine is home to two of the last remaining paper plants in the country that burn tires as fuel. As other mills move away from so-called “tire-derived fuels,” Maine plants have increased their use in recent years, adding to their output of harmful pollutants.

The combination of coal, tires and other fuels burned by ND Paper’s plant in Rumford made it the second-largest emitter of mercury out of the 185 facilities included in EIP’s analysis of 2023 EPA data. The Sappi Somerset mill in Skowhegan, which also burns tires, was a top-20 emitter of hazardous air pollutants in 2020.

Both plants’ emissions have local and global effects. Common mill byproducts like nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and fine particulate matter all harm the respiratory system and can linger in the atmosphere, where nitrogen oxide creates acid rain.

When biogenic fuel is taken into account, mill greenhouse gas emissions are almost as high as the dirtiest U.S. oil refineries, according to EIP. Sappi Somerset mill’s total greenhouse gas emissions balloon from 316,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide to nearly 1.6 million when including biogenic fuel sources — a 400% increase.

Nationwide, EIP found that paper mills’ greenhouse gas emissions were 350% higher than public-facing EPA estimates.

At the state level, these emissions are counted. Maine ditched the EPA’s model and began including biogenic sources of carbon dioxide in a 2022 update on its climate change goals.

Maine lawmakers recently codified a new 2040 deadline to reach net zero carbon emissions, and one effective way to do so nationwide, according to Bernhardt, is upgrading the inefficient boilers that many mills have relied on for decades to power operations.

The EIP report estimates that 40% of all analyzed pulp and paper mills have a boiler that is at least a half century old, including the power boiler that Woodland Pulp’s Washington County mill still uses 54 years after it was installed.

A representative for Woodland Pulp said that the company’s Baileyville mill has reduced its emissions over the past two decades by switching from fuel oil to natural gas. Mill energy needs are also supported by on-site hydropower.

Although many boilers are upgraded and retrofitted to add pollution controls — including the one used by Woodland Pulp — EIP recommends replacing them with zero-emission industrial heat technologies where possible, reducing overall emissions and the amount of heat lost by inefficient boilers during the papermaking process.

Sappi has pursued similar efficiency updates at its Somerset mill in recent years, according to Sappi communications manager April Jones. The company no longer burns coal and has reduced reliance on other dirty fuels, setting a 2030 deadline to reduce the mill’s 2019 greenhouse gas emissions by 41.5% per ton of product.

Sappi and Woodland Pulp also disputed EIP’s claims that their total mill greenhouse gas emissions are underreported. Despite EPA’s reporting framework, both companies stated that they still publish their mills’ biogenic emissions. (ND Paper did not respond to requests for comment).

The paper industry hasn’t yet been targeted by rollbacks on hazardous air pollution limits the same way power plants have, according to Bernhardt, but broad changes in emissions regulations could impact industries across the board. Further greenhouse gas reductions may instead have to come from paper companies deciding to invest in clean technologies and reduce pollution.

“There’s a real role for paper to play in a more sustainable economy,” Bernhardt said. “It really comes down to dollars. Can companies afford it?”

For instance, the first CIS auction sought to secure 6GW of renewable energy generation in the National Electricity Market (NEM).
Specifically, 23GW of this figure will be renewable energy generation, while 9GW will come from dispatchable capacity, such as battery energy storage systems (BESS).

It will be connected to the NEM and within the T3 Tasmania Midlands proposed Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).","This change is estimated to reduce the time to finalise the tender outcomes from nine to six months.

Bowen said in his speech that the government would continue to optimise the scheme, admitting that it must overcome several hurdles.

“The beauty of the CIS is that it provides the industry investment certainty, but also that we can learn and improve it as we go, as we will continue to do,” Bowen said.

“The sector still faces social license challenges, workforce constraints, and approval times. Together with the states and the industry, we are working to alleviate these constraints. Ensuring community benefit is built into CIS contracts has been fundamental – and we’ll keep improving that.”

Since its introduction, the CIS has spearheaded the growth of Australia’s renewable energy generation and energy storage fleet. Several of these tenders, both at a national and state level, have been oversubscribed.

For instance, the first CIS auction sought to secure 6GW of renewable energy generation in the National Electricity Market (NEM).

The round saw 40GW of bids registered, with 27GW of “very high quality” bids going through to the next stage. Because of the oversubscribed round, the federal government has increased the amount of capacity it is seeking to 10GW in the NEM, with 4GW of dispatchable power and 6GW of renewable energy generation.

Bowen said that the latest tender round was oversubscribed nearly three times, with 16.5GW of projects having registered their interest, with the government having sought 6GW.

For reference, the CIS aims to unlock the “record levels of investment” required for Australia to attain its 82% renewables by 2030 target, aiming to deliver 32GW of renewable energy and energy storage capacity.

Specifically, 23GW of this figure will be renewable energy generation, while 9GW will come from dispatchable capacity, such as battery energy storage systems (BESS).

576MWh solar-plus-storage project approved in just 20 days

In other Australia news, a 576MWh solar-plus-storage site in Tasmania has been approved by the national government in just 20 days.

The 250MW Weasel Solar Farm project was submitted to the federal government’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act in April 2025. It includes plans for a co-located BESS that will be 144MW/576MWh in size and occupy a 3-hectare area.

The federal government confirmed that the approval process for this project took just 20 days.

It will be located 9km north of Bothwell in the centre of the state and near the River Clyde. It will be connected to the NEM and within the T3 Tasmania Midlands proposed Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).

The Downie family from Dungrove and the Bowden family from Weasel Plains are proposing the project in collaboration with Alternate Path, an energy consultancy based in Victoria.

The solar PV power plant will feature up to 4,000 single-axis tracking PV modules installed over 270 hectares of land. The plant’s layout will enable the continuation of agricultural practices, principally sheep grazing, in a site use combination often called ‘agrivoltaics’.

Alongside agrivoltaics, the project developers have stated their desire to ensure forestry practices can continue in the vicinity to “generate significant social and economic benefits for the local community, surrounding landowners, and the state of Tasmania.”

The project’s anticipated operational lifespan is 30 to 40 years. At the end of its tenure, the plant will be decommissioned.

The study analyzed over 2.2 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in May 2023 and 2024 and found that the average used EV price is down 29.5 percent year-over-year versus 6.1 percent for the average used gas car price. In May 2024, the average used electric vehicle was priced at $28,767, or 8.3 percent below the average gas car at $31,424. These prices show a major turnaround from a year ago, when the average used EV cost $40,783 and the average used gas car cost $33,469.

Used Electric Vehicle Market Crashing

“There’s no denying the crash in used electric vehicle values over the past year,” said Karl Brauer, Executive Analyst at iSeeCars. “We’ve watched EVs prices fall between 30 and 40 percent since June of last year, while the average gas car’s price has dropped by just 3 to 7 percent in that same timeframe.”

While electric vehicle values appeared to stabilize at the end of 2023, they experienced a substantial drop in February this year and have continued to decline over the past four months. At the same time, the average used gas car price has shifted by approximately $400 during those same four months.

“It’s clear used car shoppers will no longer pay a premium for electric vehicles and, in fact, consider electric powertrains a detractor, making them less desirable – and valuable – than traditional models,” said Brauer.

Used Gas Car Prices Showing Stability

Demand for used gas cars grew during the new car production shortages brought on by the pandemic. This demand pressure is slowly easing, but with used prices hovering around $31,000 they remain well above pre-pandemic levels.

“Over the past year the average used price for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles has never shifted by more than 7 percent, with most months changing between 3 and 6 percent,” said Karl Brauer. “This is in stark contrast to the 30 to 40 percent drops in used EV pricing.”

Used EV Prices Continue To Crash

The ongoing crash in used electric vehicle prices pulled their values below the average used gas cars in February and shows no sign of stopping.

“While the drop in used EV prices is dramatic, what’s more disconcerting is no indication of used EV values stabilizing,” said Brauer. “At some point used EV prices will have to bottom out, but we don’t appear to be at that point yet.”

EV Models Lead the Drop in Used Car Values

When ranking used cars by the biggest price drops over the past year, electric vehicles take up the first seven slots and make up eight of the top 10 models with the largest drops in pricing.

Methodology

iSeeCars analyzed over 2.2 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in May 2023 and 2024. The average listing prices of each car model were compared between the two time periods, and the differences were expressed as both a percentage difference from the 2023 price as well as a dollar difference. Heavy-duty vehicles, low-volume vehicles, vehicles discontinued as of the 2023 model year, and vehicles in production for fewer than four of the last five model years for each period were excluded from further analysis.

In a 7-2 decision issued late last week, the justices revived the industry’s lawsuit and ruled that fuel makers had standing to sue over California’s strict emissions standards.

The suit argued that California and the Environmental Protection Agency under President Biden were abusing their power by relying on the 1970s-era rule for fighting smog as a means of combating climate change in the 21st century.

California’s new emissions standards “did not target a local California air-quality problem — as they say is required by the Clean Air Act — but instead were designed to address global climate change,” Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote, using italics to described the industry’s position.

The court did not rule on the suit itself but he said the fuel makers had standing to sue because they would be injured by the state’s rule.

“The fuel producers make money by selling fuel. Therefore, the decrease in purchases of gasoline and other liquid fuels resulting from the California regulations hurts their bottom line,” Kavanaugh said.

Only Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson disagreed.

Jackson questioned why the court would “revive a fuel-industry lawsuit that all agree will soon be moot (and is largely moot already). … This case gives fodder to the unfortunate perception that moneyed interests enjoy an easier road to relief in this Court than ordinary citizens.”

But the outcome was overshadowed by the recent actions of Trump and congressional Republicans.

With Trump’s backing, the House and Senate adopted measures disapproving regulations adopted by the Biden administration that would have allowed California to enforce broad new regulations to require “zero emissions” cars and trucks.

Trump said the new rules were designed to displace California as the nation’s leader in fighting air pollution and greenhouse gases.

In a bill-signing ceremony at the White House, he said the disapproval measures “will prevent California’s attempt to impose a nationwide electric vehicle mandate and to regulate national fuel economy by regulating carbon emissions.”

“Our Constitution does not allow one state special status to create standards that limit consumer choice and impose an electric vehicle mandate upon the entire nation,” he said.

In response, California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said “the fight for clean air is far from over. While we are disappointed by the Supreme Court’s decision to allow this case to go forward in the lower court, we will continue to vigorously defend California’s authority under the Clean Air Act.”

Some environmentalists said the decision greenlights future lawsuits from industry and polluters.

“This is a dangerous precedent from a court hellbent on protecting corporate interests,” said David Pettit, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute. “This decision opens the door to more oil industry lawsuits attacking states’ ability to protect their residents and wildlife from climate change.”

In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healey’s administration last month said it will not enforce minimum electric vehicle sales requirements for model years 2026 and 2027, a step officials say will give more time for the auto industry to ramp up production.

“We’re giving carmakers more runway to invest in their manufacturing and supply chains,” said Healey at the time, “which will help ensure customers have additional affordable electric vehicles options at dealerships in the future. Massachusetts will continue to invest in charging infrastructure to support the widespread adoption of electric vehicles.”

The removal of coal from UK electricity generation is the most important factor in the UK’s reduction in CO2 emissions in the last 30 years.

No-one in the industry is pretending that the UK oil and gas industry will ever be the scale it was 20 years ago.
Although supposedly self-sufficient in renewable electricity, Scotland still relies on base load capacity from Torness nuclear power station and imports from England.","The UK government recently made a headline grabbing statement on energy- backing the Sizewell C nuclear plant with £14 billion, plus commitments to Small Modular Reactors (SMR) and fusion technology. However, despite these decisive steps, energy policy and the energy market in Scotland and the UK are broken. Although some of this is due to geopolitical issues, there are also significant policy issues. I want to highlight three areas in particular.

First, the promise of ever increasing generation of renewable electricity is being challenged due to increasing costs and public backlash. Secondly, the domestic oil and gas industry is being hammered by the Labour government’s approach to domestic oil and gas. Thirdly, and most importantly, continuing high electricity prices are impacting on UK households and industry leading to populist politicians questioning New Zero. Fundamentally, the promises of renewable energy being introduced through a ‘Just Transition’ that will automatically lead to new jobs and lower energy costs are not coming to fruition.

There are key structural elements in the UK energy market that do not work. Most critically, the electricity price is set by the last therm generated which, about 80% of the time in the UK, is from gas. Therefore, there is an intimate link between the gas price and electricity price which means that the notionally lower price of renewables are not being seen by consumers.

This is the key reason why electricity prices remain high in the UK. To be clear, this is a feature of the system not a bug- it ensures that we should always be producing enough electricity as there will always be gas generators available to generate the final therm at a price that makes economic sense for them. In time, this issue should decrease. As more interconnectors are installed from the north of Scotland to east of England, as currently under construction by National Grid and the Scottish operators, renewables will be able to deliver more of the time. Storage capacity will also come onstream – be that pumped hydro storage, including plans to upgrade Cruachan and newer schemes in the Highlands, or battery storage. California essentially shows the future in this regard – enormous generation of solar during the day fills batteries which are then discharged in the evening and overnight.

A second live issue is ‘zonal pricing’. Under this proposal, the UK would be split in to a number of regions. If there is excess generation in a region which cannot be exported consumers in this area would get cheaper electricity and vice versa. Zonal pricing should reduce curtailment charges and drive investment in new generating capacity to areas with higher prices (eg new nuclear power stations in the south of England) and new consumers to areas with lower prices (eg new data centres in Inverness). Some people in the industry, in particular the CEO of Octopus Energy, are strongly advocating this in support of consumer rights. Many of the incumbent generators and companies with plans for large developments are vehemently against it. Although it has not yet had much publicity, I assume there will be some pressure (?!) against the concept in the south of England which is likely, at least in the short term, to see higher prices. And, in time, if the market works properly, this approach will decimate the renewable industry in Scotland without even greater investment in grid infrastructure or storage. The proposals are therefore highly contentious in the industry.

The growth of renewable electricity generation over the last few years has been remarkable. According to the SNP government, Scotland now generates more than 100% of its total electricity consumption from renewables. A better figure is that in 2024, renewables accounted for 70% of Scotland’s total electricity generation with about 40% of the total electricity generated exported to England and Ireland. It is important to note, however, that Scotland still relies on base load nuclear generation and imports from England because the wind doesn’t blow all the time. Further, as is widely known, huge amounts of money (£500 million year to date in 2025 according to a study by Octopus) are paid to generators in curtailment charges when there is an overcapacity of generation in the system. These issues could become a key factor in the Holyrood elections next year particularly in rural communities facing an onslaught of wind farm proposals with locals realising that most of the new generation will either be exported or shut in as there is insufficient grid capacity.

The removal of coal from UK electricity generation is the most important factor in the UK’s reduction in CO2 emissions in the last 30 years. For many years, this was driven by the replacement of coal by gas but has more recently been due to the huge increase in wind and solar generation. The last few years have seen a huge expansion in offshore wind. The last licencing round, Allocation Round 6 in 2024, had bidders for 9.6GW of capacity- this is against a current total of about 75GW. However, very significant increases in costs are meaning that developers’ economics are being challenged. Within the last few weeks, Oersted announced that they will not be progressing their Hornsea 4 wind development offshore Yorkshire – one of the largest windfarm developments in the world. This development was underpinned by a Contract For Difference (CFD), awarded in September 2024, which provides guaranteed electricity prices to the developer. However, very significant cost increases in the sector have led to decisions such as that on Hornsea 4 and likely on other developments. There will presumably be less impact on onshore developments which are much lower cost, but which are also likely to foment much more local opposition. In principle, renewable electricity should be cheaper than gas or nuclear generation- the cost of the inputs are free- and not subject to variable international commodity prices. However, due to capital costs increases, the requirements for storage, as the wind doesn’t blow all the time, and essential upgrades to the grid, consumers are not yet seeing cheaper electricity.

Another fundamental energy issue is the impact of Energy Profit Levy (EPL) on the North Sea oil industry. The EPL, which is a marginal tax rate of 78%, was introduced as a windfall tax when oil and gas prices were substantially higher. Although certain capital allowances were retained at the last budget, the tax rates are crippling for new capital expenditure. There have been substantial job losses over the last few months at a number of the large operators, not necessarily the household names but the companies which now dominate the North Sea industry. Uncertainty about licencing and field development approvals have also led to a haemorrhaging of capital investment. This framework of general unfriendliness to the industry is in contrast to other countries, including the Netherlands and New Zealand, which have backtracked on their previous de facto bans, and near neighbour Norway which is maximising its production. Last week Centrica signed a deal with Equinor to import £20 billion of gas over the next 10 years. Only a small proportion of this gas could be produced in the UK. However, even a small proportion would be helpful for the UK Treasury, UK jobs and UK shareholders. No-one in the industry is pretending that the UK oil and gas industry will ever be the scale it was 20 years ago. However, they are pointing out that it seems ludicrous to be importing increasing volumes of oil and gas from international markets including Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) from countries like the USA, Qatar and Peru, which have significantly higher CO2 emissions related to transportation than North Sea produced gas. The Scottish government talks about a ‘Just Transition’ – there seems to be nothing ‘just’ about prematurely curtailing UK oil and gas production while replacing this with imported gas and oil. The UK government is considering changes to the regime but there does not seem to be the necessary urgency.

The combination of all these factors, with a dose of blatant political opportunism, are placing the Net Zero commitment of the Scottish and UK governments in the cross hairs of right wing parties and populists questioning the principle of Net Zero in its totality, or at a minimum questioning the timeframes. Even the Tony Blair Foundation seemed to get in on the act with the headlines around their recent publication stating that current net zero policies are ‘doomed to fail’ – although in this case the headlines missed the key points of an incredibly well thought out set of proposals which do not in any way question the need to tackle climate change. And who can blame people? Households are seeing ongoing high energy costs because we still link the electricity price to gas price. UK industry is saddled with the most expensive electricity in Europe. Local communities throughout Scotland are facing proposals for windfarms and electricity pylons to export electricity to England while seeing little benefit. This is compounded by the Scottish government stating that renewables are the new North Sea- with the key differences being the number of jobs created during the supposed ‘Just Transition’, most of the infrastructure for the oil and gas industry being hundreds of miles offshore rather than back gardens in Angus and unspoilt Highland glens, and that we actually still need North Sea oil and gas.

However, what consumers are not yet seeing is reduced electricity prices as a result of supposedly cheaper forms of generation. Why would local people agree to new windfarms or huge electricity pylons when they know the electricity is being exported south and they are not seeing cheaper electricity bills? No Scottish manufacturing of wind turbines – so where are the just transition jobs actually going to come from?

So what can be done? Well, a positive conclusion is that most of the issues and problems I have highlighted can be solved by policy interventions rather than tricky new technology – albeit policy interventions requiring a huge amount of investment.

From a Scottish perspective, the government needs to get real about the ‘Just Transition’. As my colleague Neil Gilmour wrote on this forum recently, the report from the Just Transition Commission has ‘No timeline. No costs. No specific accountabilities. No integrated road map for the overall journey.’ It is therefore doomed to failure. Enlighten have previously highlighted the plethora of targets, strategies and initiatives from the Scottish government which do no link up. The Scottish Government needs a reality check.

Secondly, the Scottish Government, working with Scottish SNP and Labour MPs (and indeed Conservatives MPs and MSPs), must be much more forthright with the Westminster government about the North Sea oil industry. It is difficult to identify another sector which can demonstrate highly paid jobs, UK capital investment, tax revenue, reduced import costs and lower carbon emissions for the next twenty years. The current consultation has to result in a new tax structure and licencing framework which will be implemented very quickly to protect the industry.

The Scottish government needs to think realistically about base load electricity generation. Although supposedly self-sufficient in renewable electricity, Scotland still relies on base load capacity from Torness nuclear power station and imports from England. The UK government has committed to nuclear plants at Sizewell and investment in Small Modular Reactors and fusion to underpin the base load capacity and Ed Milliband, UK Energy Secretary’ has stated that he sees no reason why there shouldn’t be nuclear in Scotland. Although principally involved in planning decisions, the Scottish government should support the UK position. The construction of new nuclear capacity at existing sites at either Torness or Hunterston, close to Scottish population centres with grid connections would be transformational for the Scottish energy system. The Scottish university sector, with its own severe financial challenges, would benefit from a resurgence in nuclear engineering requirements. Scotland currently generates more electricity than it uses. However, much of this is in wrong place – requiring huge impact on remote parts of the country and transmission lines to the population centres. Better to place the generation close to the central belt.

The UK government needs to redesign the electricity market to a system which will lower prices in the short to medium term. Disconnecting the electricity price from the gas price, as is the case in other countries, would be a first step. Zonal pricing may be a short term fix to placate some objectors who see local windfarm developments but do not see the benefit of local pricing and may also encourage local businesses. However, it would also have a devastating effect on the renewable sector in Scotland. At a minimum, the UK Government should publish its Review of the Energy Markets as soon as possible to remove ongoing uncertainties from the sector.

The single most important way to achieve Net Zero in the UK is electrification of everything that can be electrified- home heating, transport, industry. This requires investment in generation, storage and transmission. However, as Enlighten have written previously, even more important is the hearts and mind campaign to demonstrate to individuals that this energy can be delivered reliably but cheaper than currently, into a daily experience similar to how people live now. It still strikes me as amazing that the need for change- to electric cars and heat pumps, district heating projects, demand side management, domestic generation and storage of electricity, improved domestic insulation- are still geeky, niche topics much like homemade yoghurt in the 1970s. Until these interventions and solutions become mainstream, alongside the policy changes outlined above, we are not going to have a chance of delivering Net Zero.",https://www.enlighten.scot/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AdobeStock_1064917606-1920x1127.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 00:00:37.093034

Energy security affected by disrupted LNG supplies South Korea’s U.S. LNG import has faced challenges.
In 2022, South Korea's U.S. LNG imports plummeted by 31.84% year-on-year due to outages at the Freeport facility, which accounts for 17% of total U.S. LNG export capacity.
Uncertain economics of the Alaska LNG project The Alaska LNG project is one of several proposed export projects in the U.S.
South Korea’s LNG imports have been on a downtrend since 2022, when they peaked at a historic high of 46.4MTPA.","Since South Korea began tariff discussions in Washington in late April 2025, there has been growing speculation over whether the country will participate in the proposed United States (U.S.) Alaska liquefied natural gas (LNG) export development project. The USD44 billion undertaking aims to boost U.S. energy exports to key allies like South Korea and Japan.

In March 2025, U.S. President Trump mentioned cooperation between the U.S. and South Korea in the shipbuilding sector and the Alaska LNG project during a call with Acting President and Prime Minister Han Duck-Soo.

A delegation from South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) and the state-run gas utility Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS) visited Alaska in early June 2025 to gather information on the LNG project.

On 3 June 2025, Alaska LNG developer Glenfarne announced that 50 companies had expressed interest in purchasing gas from the project at an estimated total contract value of USD115 billion. Given South Korea’s commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and the early stage of the Alaska project’s development, questions arise about the suitability of the LNG project for the country.

U.S. LNG imports driven by geopolitical considerations

South Korea began importing LNG from the U.S. in 2017, primarily driven by the U.S. shale gas boom and geopolitical considerations. The country’s LNG imports from the U.S. spiked 70 times year-on-year after the first U.S. export project, Sabine Pass, began operating in 2016. KOGAS signed a long-term contract with Cheniere, the LNG project developer. The South Korean utility imports 3.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG from the project through a 20-year purchase agreement.

Additional reasons for South Korea’s LNG imports from the U.S. included efforts to address the trade deficit, which prompted renegotiations of the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (FTA). The media and parliament frequently mentioned LNG as a potential remedy to alleviate the trade disparity and FTA cancellation risks by the U.S.

At the G20 Summit in 2017, South Korea’s administration announced its 'Coal and Nuclear-free Economy' policy, recognizing LNG as a form of ‘green energy’ and a key component of its energy transition strategy. In December of that year, MOTIE increased the targeted share of LNG in the power mix from 16.9% to 18.8% by 2030.

By the end of the year, South Korean imports of U.S. LNG more than doubled year-on-year, coinciding with the start of the Korea-U.S. FTA renegotiation.

In December 2020, the targeted share of LNG in the country’s power mix increased to 23.3% by 2030, and U.S. LNG imports hit a historic high in 2021.

Financial consequences of additional LNG imports

South Korea needs to carefully consider its energy sourcing strategy, given the potential impact LNG purchases could have on the economy. Currently, U.S. LNG purchases are being considered as an option for tariff negotiation to address the trade imbalance between South Korea and the U.S. In 2024, that deficit was USD66 billion.

As of 01 May 2025, the LNG spot market price was around USD10.50per million British thermal units (MMBtu). South Korea would need to purchase an estimated 121 million tonnes (Mt) of LNG annually to close the trade deficit. In 2024, the country imported46.3Mt of LNG, with only 5.6Mt coming from the U.S. The U.S. exported only 88Mt of LNG in 2024 to over a dozen countries. It does not produce enough LNG to close South Korea’s trade deficit or meet the requirements of multiple trading partners simultaneously.

Most South Korean LNG imports are secured through existing long-term contracts. In 2024, around 18% of the country’s imports came from the short-term or spot market, suggesting some potential for converting spot purchases into longer-term contracted purchases. This could allow for an additional small percentage of long-term imports from U.S. sellers.

However, South Korea should maintain flexibility in its purchasing portfolio to account for LNG consumption changes, as demand depends on economic fluctuations and weather patterns. The country’s demand for LNG is declining. It fell 5% in 2023 and is projected to decrease 20% through 2030. LNG is the most expensive imported fuel, as demonstrated during the Russia-Ukraine war, providing a natural price signal that has triggered reductions in demand. The South Korean economy and its electric power sector may struggle to bear the additional LNG costs.

Energy security affected by disrupted LNG supplies

South Korea’s U.S. LNG import has faced challenges. The U.S. Freeport export facility, one of South Korea’s primary suppliers, experienced frequent outages starting in 2022, lasting more than a year. This undermined energy security during the Russia-Ukraine war when stable LNG supplies were crucial amid global disruptions.

In 2022, South Korea's U.S. LNG imports plummeted by 31.84% year-on-year due to outages at the Freeport facility, which accounts for 17% of total U.S. LNG export capacity.

The disrupted U.S. supply reduced the power output from one of South Korea’s fleet of LNG-fired power plants. For example, SK E&S, an off-taker from the Freeport facility, lowered the operating rates of its LNG-fired power plants from 79% in 2021 to 71% in 2022 due to the supply shortage.

This prompted the company and KOGAS to purchase more expensive spot LNG to compensate for the losses. The U.S. LNG cargoes bought by South Korea were also costly, as prices were 16% higher than cargoes sold to Japan in 2022. These illustrate the potential risks of increasing LNG imports from the U.S.

Uncertain economics of the Alaska LNG project

The Alaska LNG project is one of several proposed export projects in the U.S. However, final investment decisions and commercial partnerships with buyers and financiers are still pending, and the project has experienced delays due to costs, market conditions, and geopolitical shifts.

Despite being proposed nearly two decades ago, the Alaska LNG project is still in its early stages of development. So far, no buyers have signed long-term purchase agreements. For LNG export projects to progress, at least 80% of output should be committed under such contracts to obtain financing.

In 2017, KOGAS signed a memorandum of understanding with the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation (AGDC) to develop the project. However, the state-run gas company stalled its rollout due to economic feasibility and strategic considerations.

LNG’s declining demand and limited role in the energy transition

South Korea’s declining LNG demand and the fuel’s diminishing role in the energy transition are key reasons why U.S. LNG imports should be approached cautiously. South Korea’s LNG imports have been on a downtrend since 2022, when they peaked at a historic high of 46.4MTPA. Despite imports rebounding in 2024 due to stronger industry demand amid lower prices, the downtrend will likely continue amid strengthening decarbonization efforts worldwide.

South Korea’s recently finalized 11th Basic Plan for Long-Term Electricity Supply and Demand (BPLE) also aims to reduce the share of gas from 28% to 10.55% by 2038 to reach its decarbonization goals by reducing fossil fuel dependency and increasing renewable energy generation in its power mix.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2025-06/shutterstock_1967657407.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 00:01:00.675048

Teslas were spotted early Sunday in a neighborhood called South Congress, with no one in the driver's seat but one person in the passenger seat.

The electric car maker planned a small trial with about 10 vehicles and front-seat riders acting as ""safety monitors,"" though it remained unclear how much control they had over the vehicles.

In recent days, the automaker sent invites to a select group of influencers for a carefully monitored robotaxi trial in a limited zone. The rides are being offered for a flat fee of $4.20, Musk said on X.

Tesla investor and social-media personality Sawyer Merritt posted videos on X Sunday afternoon showing him ordering, getting picked up, and taking a ride to a nearby bar and restaurant, Frazier's Long & Low, using a Tesla robotaxi app.

If Tesla succeeds with the small deployment, it still faces major challenges in delivering on Musk's promise to scale up quickly in Austin and other cities, industry experts say.

It could take years or decades for Tesla and self-driving rivals, such as Alphabet's Waymo, to fully develop a robotaxi industry, said Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University computer-engineering professor with expertise in autonomous-vehicle technology. A successful Austin trial for Tesla, he said, would be ""the end of the beginning — not the beginning of the end.""

Most of Tesla's sky-high stock value now rests on its ability to deliver robotaxis and humanoid robots, according to many industry analysts. Tesla is by far the world's most valuable automaker.

As Tesla's robotaxi-rollout date approached, Texas lawmakers moved to enact autonomous-vehicle rules. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, on Friday signed legislation requiring a state permit to operate self-driving vehicles.

The law, which takes effect Sept. 1, signals that state officials from both parties want the driverless-vehicle industry to proceed cautiously.

Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. The governor's office declined to comment. The law softens the state's previous anti-regulation stance on autonomous vehicles. A 2017 Texas law specifically prohibited cities from regulating self-driving cars.

The new law requires autonomous-vehicle operators to get approval from the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles before operating on public streets without a human driver. It gives state authorities the power to revoke permits for operators they deem a public danger.

The law also requires firms to provide information on how first responders can deal with their driverless vehicles in emergency situations.

The law's permit requirements for an ""automated motor vehicle"" are not onerous but require firms to attest their vehicles can operate legally and safely. It defines an automated vehicle as having at least Level 4 autonomous-driving capability under a recognized standard, meaning it can operate with no human driver under specified conditions. Level 5 autonomy is the top level and means a car can drive itself anywhere, under any conditions.

Compliance remains far easier than in some states, notably California, which requires submission of vehicle-testing data under state oversight. Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina law professor who focuses on autonomous driving, said it appears any company that meets minimum application requirements will get a Texas permit — but could also lose it if problems arise.

""California permits are hard to get, easy to lose,"" he said. ""In Texas, the permit is easy to get and easy to lose.""

About East Coast Hydrogen East Coast Hydrogen is a nationally significant infrastructure programme that aims to build a reliable hydrogen pipeline network across the Northeast, the Humber, Yorkshire and the East Midlands.
Original announcement link Source: East Coast Hydrogen","One of the UK’s most ambitious hydrogen infrastructure programmes has taken a significant step forward with £96 million Ofgem funding confirmed to support its next phase.

East Coast Hydrogen will repurpose and build new gas pipelines to deliver clean hydrogen at scale across the North East, the Humber region, Yorkshire and the East Midlands – a critical step on the UK’s journey to clean, secure energy.

East Coast Hydrogen will play a key role in helping power generation and heavy industry across the East Coast transition from natural gas – replacing it with low-carbon hydrogen to protect jobs, keep the lights on and deliver the infrastructure needed to support the UK’s future hydrogen economy.

Ofgem has now confirmed its support for East Coast Hydrogen – a partnership led by National Gas, Cadent and Northern Gas Networks – by awarding around £96 million in funding to carry out engineering, planning and public consultation on proposals. This follows the £500 million announced by Government last week for regional hydrogen transport and storage networks as part of the Spending Review.

It will pave the way for delivery of a hydrogen-ready pipeline network which is expected to be delivered over the next decade and make a major contribution to the UK’s decarbonisation efforts.

This latest funding ensures work can continue at pace on the infrastructure needed to deliver that transformation.

Jon Butterworth, Chief Executive Officer at National Gas, said:

'This funding marks a crucial step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock the UK’s hydrogen economy at scale.

'At National Gas, we’re committed to enabling the UK’s transition to a low-carbon energy system that is secure, cost-effective, and future-ready. Project Union, our plan to create a 1,500-mile core hydrogen network across Great Britain, will start in the East Coast and this funding will support that ambition.

'By repurposing existing infrastructure, we will connect hydrogen production, storage, and demand, helping to deliver flexible electricity, decarbonise industry, and protect jobs in some of the UK’s most energy-intensive regions.'

Steve Fraser, Chief Executive Officer at Cadent, said:

'This funding marks a major milestone and is very welcome news: not just in terms of this specific project, but for the UK’s entire energy transition. Ofgem’s support will allow our partnership to forge ahead with the vital planning and engagement work that is needed to fully realise this important project.

'East Coast Hydrogen is exactly the type of pioneering partnership that’s needed on the path towards achieving net zero. It not only lays the foundations for the creation of a new low-carbon network, but it will also protect jobs, support industry, and help deliver on national ambitions for growth via the creation of new green skills and jobs, with the benefits being felt right across the country.'

Mark Horsley, Chief Executive at Northern Gas Networks, said:

'Our East Coast Hydrogen partnership represents a clear route to driving growth for regional economies, job creation and decarbonisation support for industries that otherwise would find it difficult to meet net zero targets.

'This funding is essential to determining the technical work needed to build hydrogen infrastructure, in order to understand how a hydrogen network can be operational in time to meet government net zero plans.'

Ofgem’s decision signals confidence in the region’s ability to help lead the UK’s hydrogen transition and opens the door to thousands of jobs and future investment in key industrial heartlands.

East Coast Hydrogen is expected to move into the delivery phase later this decade, with the aim of starting hydrogen flows from the early 2030s.

It brings together over 120 organisations across key sectors including hydrogen producers, power generators, industry, energy networks, airports and hospitals.

From decarbonising industry to reducing the carbon footprint of everyday products and services, the shared ambition is to build a hydrogen economy that reduces emissions and generates secure energy, economic growth and new domestic jobs.

Darren Hall, Raw Materials Buyer at Verallia UK, said:

'As a significant energy user with ambitious decarbonisation plans, we’re delighted to hear East Coast Hydrogen has secured its next phase.

‘Verallia UK Ltd is a critical cog in the food supply chain, supplying glass packaging in to the food and beverage industry in the UK and abroad. We see the East Coast Hydrogen network playing a critical role in supporting those plans and ensuring glass is a sustainable packaging choice for the future.'

The study analyzed over 2.2 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in May 2023 and 2024 and found that the average used EV price is down 29.5 percent year-over-year versus 6.1 percent for the average used gas car price. In May 2024, the average used electric vehicle was priced at $28,767, or 8.3 percent below the average gas car at $31,424. These prices show a major turnaround from a year ago, when the average used EV cost $40,783 and the average used gas car cost $33,469.

Used Electric Vehicle Market Crashing

“There’s no denying the crash in used electric vehicle values over the past year,” said Karl Brauer, Executive Analyst at iSeeCars. “We’ve watched EVs prices fall between 30 and 40 percent since June of last year, while the average gas car’s price has dropped by just 3 to 7 percent in that same timeframe.”

While electric vehicle values appeared to stabilize at the end of 2023, they experienced a substantial drop in February this year and have continued to decline over the past four months. At the same time, the average used gas car price has shifted by approximately $400 during those same four months.

“It’s clear used car shoppers will no longer pay a premium for electric vehicles and, in fact, consider electric powertrains a detractor, making them less desirable – and valuable – than traditional models,” said Brauer.

Used Gas Car Prices Showing Stability

Demand for used gas cars grew during the new car production shortages brought on by the pandemic. This demand pressure is slowly easing, but with used prices hovering around $31,000 they remain well above pre-pandemic levels.

“Over the past year the average used price for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles has never shifted by more than 7 percent, with most months changing between 3 and 6 percent,” said Karl Brauer. “This is in stark contrast to the 30 to 40 percent drops in used EV pricing.”

Used EV Prices Continue To Crash

The ongoing crash in used electric vehicle prices pulled their values below the average used gas cars in February and shows no sign of stopping.

“While the drop in used EV prices is dramatic, what’s more disconcerting is no indication of used EV values stabilizing,” said Brauer. “At some point used EV prices will have to bottom out, but we don’t appear to be at that point yet.”

EV Models Lead the Drop in Used Car Values

When ranking used cars by the biggest price drops over the past year, electric vehicles take up the first seven slots and make up eight of the top 10 models with the largest drops in pricing.

Methodology

iSeeCars analyzed over 2.2 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in May 2023 and 2024. The average listing prices of each car model were compared between the two time periods, and the differences were expressed as both a percentage difference from the 2023 price as well as a dollar difference. Heavy-duty vehicles, low-volume vehicles, vehicles discontinued as of the 2023 model year, and vehicles in production for fewer than four of the last five model years for each period were excluded from further analysis.

—

Earlier this month, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) put forward a proposal to repeal all greenhouse gas emissions standards for the power sector, dealing another blow to climate action.

The new rules target pollution control standards for coal and gas power plants established by the EPA under the Clean Air Act in 2015 as well as Biden-era regulations to phase out emissions from electricity-producing fossil fuel plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin earlier this month said that greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution,” when in reality, they are a major contributor and a huge threat to human health. Carbon dioxide (CO2), a by-product of burning fossil fuels, is the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.

“This is the scientific equivalent to saying that smoking doesn’t cause lung cancer,” climate scientist Zeke Hausfather said in response to Zeldin’s claim.

The health benefits associated with reducing long-term exposure to air pollution are significant, as exposure to toxic pollutants has been found to cause certain types of cancer, such as lymphoma, leukemia, breast cancer and liver cancer and even lead to premature death. Approximately 7 million people die each year from air pollution globally.

Zeldin and Energy Secretary Chris Wright anticipated the administration’s move when they publicly attacked the EPA’s Endangerment Finding earlier this year, threatening to end it.

“The 2009 Endangerment finding has had an enormously negative impact on the lives of the American people for more than 15 years. It’s past time the United States ensures the basis for issuing environmental regulations follows the science and betters human lives,” said Wright.

Issued in 2009, the finding revealed that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can endanger both public health and the environment for current and future generations. The proposed rules effectively dismiss these findings, enabling weaker power plant regulations by overturning the original restriction.

Mercury

The new proposal also targets the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), which former president Joe Biden toughened last year. The new rule would cut emissions limits for toxic substances like nickel, arsenic, and lead by two-thirds and reduce regulation on mercury emissions by 70%.

44% of all manmade mercury emissions come from burning coal for electricity. Power plants that burn coal to create electricity are the largest source of mercury emissions in the US, though activities involving the burning of electronic waste such as phones and batteries, as well as steel production, also generate mercury emissions.

Overexposure to mercury is linked to health issues such as speech impairment, hearing, walking or muscle weakness, insomnia, and changes in nerve responses, possibly even leading to memory loss. Exposure to methylmercury, a highly toxic form of mercury that is formed by bacteria in water and soil, can adversely affect unborn infants’ growing brains and nervous systems, children exposed to methylmercury while they are in the womb can have impacts on their cognitive thinking, memory, attention, language, fine motor skills, and visual spatial skills.

‘Legally Baseless’

The Trump administration described the new rules as necessary to restore American energy dominance by removing undue burdens on coal-fired plants, and as a way to accomplish the EPA’s “core mission” of protecting human health and the environment. But critics warn that these rollbacks will have serious repercussions on the health of millions of Americans.

“It would lead to the biggest pollution increases in decades and is a blatant give-away to polluters,” more than 200 health experts wrote in the letter published after the EPA’s announcement. They added that any attempt to reverse the endangerment finding would be “legally baseless”, and would harm communities already suffering from the impacts of climate changes, like extreme heat.

According to the Sierra Club, a grassroots environmental organization, rolling back the EPA’s standards limiting emissions from gas- and coal-fired power plants would release seven times as much CO2 as they currently put into the atmosphere. “This repeal means more climate disasters, more heart attacks, more asthma attacks, more birth defects, more premature deaths,” said Patrick Drupp, the Sierra Club Climate Policy Director.

Howard Frumkin, Director of the CDC’s National Center for Environmental Health, warned that the rollbacks will have “major, direct consequences” for the health and well-being of Americans, adding that “Americans will die needlessly.”

“They would lead to more illnesses, which in turn would mean more days missing school and work, more visits to doctors and hospitalizations, and increased medical costs,” said Vickie Patton, General Counsel of Environmental Defense Fund.",https://earth.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/marcin-jozwiak-uKvPDQop-JA-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 21:01:36.563321

Many of the places most brutally exposed to out-of-kilter weather patterns and natural disasters are in the global south, and rightly demand solidarity from the wealthier countries responsible for most historical emissions. But the costs of the emergency are being felt everywhere.

Three nuggets from the last week alone: first, chocolate prices in the UK increased at a record annual rate of 18% rate last month, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), driven by repeated weather-related failures of the cocoa crop in west Africa.

Second, research by Bloomberg Intelligence calculated that an extraordinary $1tn was spent in the US last year on rebuilding and recovery after climate disasters such as wildfires and floods.

The analysis highlighted the benefits for companies specialising in repair and resilience (the DIY chain Home Depot gets a mention, for example, as does the cement-maker Heidelberg), but rightly pointed out that these are resources that have to be diverted from other purposes.

“Climate-related disasters are redistributing trillions of dollars in global spending away from the broader economy to pay for the costs of repairing the damage from the last fire, flood and storm and preparing for the next one,” as the authors put it.

And third, a deeply depressing paper by US academics, for the IZA Institute of Labor Economics, was highlighted by Ruth Curtice of the Resolution Foundation. It showed that wildfires, which are becoming increasingly prevalent, have a direct impact on jobs and earnings because the smoke affects the health of people many miles away from the centre of the blaze.

Researchers found that the impact over a typically smoky year knocks as much as 2%, or $125bn, off the total earnings of US workers – with older employees feeling the worst effects. That’s a health crisis and an economic challenge, too.

Even in wealthy countries, in other words, the climate emergency is absorbing an ever-expanding share of resources and causing repeated cost shocks.

For policymakers contemplating this “age of shifts and breaks”, as the ECB chief Christine Lagarde has called it, another fascinating piece of research published last week – not specifically about climate, but about cost shocks more generally – provided some worrying context.

Isabella Weber and her colleagues analysed transcripts of more than 100,000 “earnings calls” – the crucial meetings at which companies update their investors – from almost 5,000 US companies between 2007 and 2022, and cross-checked them against data on costs across the economy.

They found that during cost shocks – when everyone knows costs are going up – companies feel emboldened to push up prices and build their profit margins.

Scrutinising the language used on the calls, Weber et al suggest executives tend to calculate that they won’t lose market share, because rival companies will also raise prices, and assume the public will be more understanding than during normal times.

It’s not that CEOs put their heads together and cook up a top-secret plan to make bumper profits in the teeth of a crisis – instead, an economy-wide cost shock acts as what the authors call an “implicit coordination mechanism”.

This is what Weber and co call “sellers’ inflation” – driven not by the demands of workers for higher wages, which companies then pass on to consumers, but by opportunistic behaviour from bosses.

They don’t argue that this is necessarily the main driver of inflation during crises such as the Covid pandemic, but that this “markup increase” channel is significant – and makes managing inflation more complex.

“If, in the face of major supply shocks, firms do not absorb cost increases but instead perceive them as good news – as they facilitate price hikes and hence higher profits – this has important implications for price stability in a world of overlapping emergencies,” they warn.

Climate change is one such emergency – alongside burgeoning global conflicts, and the dismantling of long-established trading relationships. And as it hits food production in particular, it appears likely to continue presenting policymakers with cost shocks.

The main weapon of central banks – raising interest rates – is a very blunt one against this particular species of inflation.

Weber argues instead for a “toolbox approach” that includes building up “buffer stocks” of essential commodities (chocolate, sadly, seems unlikely to qualify), cracking down on companies taking unfair advantage of economic shocks, and in extremis, price controls.

Another recent plea for policymakers to think differently about climate-driven inflation came from a pair of researchers at the LSE’s Grantham Research Institute.

David Barmes and Luiz Awazu Pereira da Silva advocate “adaptive inflation targeting,” in what they call a “hot and volatile world”.

They argue that given the likelihood of increasingly frequent climate cost shocks, policymakers would be wise to tolerate, or “look through,” these short-term blips more willingly than they do at present.

They suggest politicians might also want to allow central banks to temporarily target a higher inflation rate at times of repeated shocks, and perhaps allow more leeway around the target, too.

Keeping rates high to squash climate-driven inflation has no impact on the underlying problem, Barmes and Pereira da Silva argue, and raises government borrowing costs, just as public investment in the green transition is urgently needed.

If you’re hesitant about electric vehicles (EV), it’s likely that your top concerns include how far you can drive in a single charge, how long it takes to charge the battery, and how much this advanced tech will cost you. And you’re not alone.

According to Deloitte’s 2025 Global Automotive Consumer Study, nearly half of U.S. consumers (49%) still say that available battery driving range is their biggest worry about EVs. That’s followed closely by the time required to charge (46%) and the lingering cost premium (44%) associated with battery electric vehicles.

But that narrative may finally be flipping. Just this past week, two developments showcase how much EV technology has evolved over the past decade: China’s BYD is breaking new grounds on just how far you can drive an EV on a single 12-minute charge. Meanwhile, the Nissan Leaf, seen as the first mass-market EV in 2010, is getting an impressive upgrade even as it remains one of the most affordable options on the market.

BYD’s bold battery bet

Chinese auto giant BYD, already the world’s top-selling EV manufacturer, may have just redrawn the limits of battery performance. According to Chinese media, and other reports, the company is testing a new solid-state battery that can add 900 miles of range in just 12 minutes of charging.

Let that sink in. That’s nearly four times the range of many current EVs—enough to drive from New York to Chicago —and charging that’s as fast as a coffee stop.

The battery in question is being trialed in a prototype vehicle reportedly based on BYD’s Seal sedan, and one model even achieved over 1,000 miles of total range in early tests. It uses solid-state battery chemistry, which replaces the liquid electrolyte found in traditional lithium-ion cells with a solid electrolyte, improving safety, energy density, and—clearly—charging speed.

Unlike conventional lithium-ion batteries, solid-state variants are less prone to overheating, can be charged at higher rates, and take up less space, allowing more energy to be packed into a smaller space. Toyota, QuantumScape, and others have been developing this tech for years, but BYD’s real-world trials might give it a huge first-mover advantage.

This leap in performance doesn’t just make EVs more appealing—it threatens to make current battery standards obsolete.

Nissan’s Redemption Arc

If BYD represents the future, Nissan is hoping to reboot its own place in the EV conversation by reinventing the car that started it all: the Nissan Leaf.

When the Leaf debuted in 2010, it was a revolutionary moment—the first mass-market electric vehicle. With a 24 kWh battery and a real-world range of about 75 miles, it wasn’t meant to cross continents but to commute quietly and cleanly. And at around $32,000, it was seen as an affordable gateway into a gas-free lifestyle.

Still, it didn’t take long for Tesla to steal the spotlight. By 2012, the Model S had arrived with 265 miles of range, but it came with a far steeper price tag—between $57,000 and $87,000—and didn’t exactly cater to the average buyer. The Leaf had affordability; Tesla had performance. But over the next decade, Nissan stopped investing in EV tech and the Leaf barely improved, while competitors caught up.

Now, Nissan’s finally stepping back into the ring.

The 2026 Nissan Leaf has shed its econobox styling in favor of a sleek new hatchback body, powered by a liquid-cooled battery and equipped with Tesla’s NACS charging port—meaning it can now plug directly into Tesla’s Supercharger network. Range? Up to 300 miles. That’s a fourfold improvement from the original.

The new Leaf also comes with a revamped infotainment system featuring native Google Maps with EV route planning, a wireless charging pad, and a suite of driver-assistance tech under the umbrella of Nissan ProPILOT. Using sensors and cameras, it enables semi-autonomous driving, helping the Leaf catch up to the competition.

Here’s the kicker: despite the upgrades, Nissan aims to keep the price roughly in line with the original—which means we’re likely looking at something around $32,000–$35,000 before tax credits.

For a tech-packed EV with 300 miles of range and Supercharger compatibility, that’s an aggressive play. It repositions the Leaf not just as a nostalgic nameplate, but as a genuine competitor for entry-level EV shoppers.

The Road Ahead

The EV world has changed dramatically since 2010. What started as a slow, expensive, and often uncertain journey into electrification has accelerated into a global arms race for innovation.

On one end, you’ve got BYD pushing technological boundaries that could make 1,000-mile EVs as common as V6 engines once were. On the other, Nissan is trying to rewrite the Leaf’s history, proving that affordability and advancement don’t have to be mutually exclusive.

Reporting from Guangzhou

""I drive an electric vehicle because I am poor,"" says Lu Yunfeng, a private hire driver, who is at a charging station on the outskirts of Guangzhou in the south of China.

Standing nearby, Sun Jingguo agrees. ""The cost of driving a petrol car is too expensive. I save money driving an electric vehicle,"" he says.

""Also, it protects the environment,"" he adds, leaning against his white Beijing U7 model.

It's the kind of conversation climate campaigners dream of hearing. In many countries, electric vehicles (EVs) are considered luxury purchases.

But here in China - where almost half of all cars sold last year were electric - it's a banal reality.

'King of the hill'

At the beginning of the century, China's leadership laid out plans to dominate the technologies of the future. Once a nation of bicycles China is now the world's leader in EVs.

For Guangzhou's more than 18 million people, the roar of the rush hour has become a hum.

""When it comes to EVs, China is 10 years ahead and 10 times better than any other country,"" says auto sector analyst Michael Dunne.

China's BYD now leads the global EV market, after overtaking US rival Tesla earlier this year.

BYD's sales have been helped by a vast domestic market of more than 1.4 billion people and it is now looking to sell more cars overseas. So too are a raft of other Chinese start-ups that make affordable EVs for the mass market.

So how did China build this lead, and can it be caught?

The master plan

In tracing the origins of China's EV dominance, analysts often credit Wan Gang - a German-trained engineer who became China's minister of trade and science in 2007.

""He looked around and said, 'Good news: we are now the largest car market in the world. Bad news: on the streets of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou all I see is foreign brands',"" says Mr Dunne.

At the time, Chinese brands simply couldn't compete with the European, American and Japanese car makers for quality and prestige. These companies had an unassailable head start when it came to producing petrol or diesel-powered cars.

But China did have ample resources, a skilled labour force and an ecosystem of suppliers in the motor industry. So Mr Wan decided to ""change the game and flip the script by moving to electrics"", according to Mr Dunne.

This was the master plan.

Even though the Chinese government had included EVs in its five-year economic blueprint as early as 2001, it wasn't until the 2010s that it started to provide vast amounts of subsidies to grow the industry.

China, unlike Western democracies, has the capacity to mobilise huge swathes of its economy over many years towards its aims.

The country's mammoth infrastructure projects and dominance in manufacturing are a testament to this.

A US think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), estimates that from 2009 to the end of 2023, Beijing spent around $231bn (£172bn) developing the EV industry.

From consumers and carmakers to electricity providers and battery suppliers, everyone in China is entitled to money and assistance when it comes to EVs.

It encouraged BYD, for example, to switch from making smartphone batteries to focusing on producing EVs.

Ningde-based CATL - which supplies firms such as Tesla, Volkswagen and Ford - was founded in 2011 and now produces a third of all the batteries used for EVs worldwide.

This combination of long-term planning and government funding also allowed China to dominate critical supply chains in battery production.

It has helped build the world's largest public charging network with stations concentrated in big cities, which put drivers just minutes away from the nearest charger.

""If you want to manufacture a battery to put into an electric car today, all roads go through China,"" says Mr Dunne.

Some refer to this as ""state capitalism"". Western countries call it unfair business practice.

Chinese EV executives insist all companies, domestic or foreign, have access to the same resources.

As a result, they argue, China now has a thriving EV start-up sector, driven by fierce competition and a culture of innovation.

""The Chinese government is doing the same thing you see in Europe and in the US - providing policy support, consumer encouragement and infrastructure,"" Brian Gu, president of EV maker XPeng, tells the BBC.

""But I think China has done it consistently and in a way that really fosters the most competitive landscape that there is. There's no favouritism to anybody,"" he adds.

XPeng is one of the ""Chinese champions"", as Mr Gu puts it, driving the industry forward. Barely a decade old and yet to turn a profit, the start-up is already in the world's top 10 EV producers.

The company has attracted some of China's top young graduates to its headquarters in Guangzhou, where casually dressed staff sip flat whites and internet streamers sell cars live in the showroom.

A brightly coloured slide taking employees from the top to the ground floor would seem more at home in Silicon Valley than China's industrial heartland.

Despite the relaxed atmosphere, Mr Gu says the pressure to offer consumers better cars at lower prices is ""immense"".

The BBC was invited on a test drive of XPeng's Mona Max, which has just gone on sale in China for around $20,000.

For this price you get self-driving capability, voice activation, lie-flat beds, film and music streaming. Young Chinese graduates, we're told, see all these as standard features for a first car purchase.

""The new generation of EV makers... look at cars as a different animal,"" says David Li, the co-founder and chief executive of Hesai, which makes the Lidar sensing technology used in many self-driving cars.

'An EV makes sense for me'

Young Chinese consumers are certainly attracted to top-of-the-range technology, but a huge amount of government spending goes towards making EVs financially attractive, according to the CSIS study.

Members of the public receive subsidies for trading in their non-electric car for an EV as well as tax exemptions and subsidised rates at public charging stations.

These perks drove Mr Lu to go electric two years ago. He used to pay 200 yuan ($27.84; £20.72) to fill up his car for 400km (248 miles) of driving. It now costs him a quarter of that.

People in China also normally pay thousands for their vehicle registration plate - sometimes more than the cost of the car itself - as part of government efforts to limit congestion and pollution. Mr Lu now gets his green one for free.

""The rich drive petrol cars because they have unlimited resources,"" Mr Lu says. ""An EV just makes sense for me.""

Another proud EV owner in Shanghai, who wanted to use her English name Daisy, says that rather than charge her vehicle at a station, she changes her car's battery at one of the city's many automated swapping stations provided by EV maker Nio.

In under three minutes, machines replace her flat battery with a fully charged one. It's state of the art technology for less than the price of a tank of fuel.

The road ahead

The government subsidies at the heart of China's EV growth are seen as unfair by countries looking to protect their car industries.

The US, Canada and the European Union have all imposed substantial import taxes on Chinese EVs.

However, the UK says it's not planning to follow suit - making it an attractive market for firms like XPeng, which started delivering its G6 model to British consumers in March, and BYD, which launched its Dolphin Surf model this month in the UK, and is available for as little as $26,100.

This should be music to the ears of Western governments that enthusiastically back the transition to EVs, which the United Nations calls ""pivotal"" to avert climate disaster.

Several Western countries, including the UK, say they will ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030. No country is better placed to help make this a reality than China.

""The Chinese are thinking about a future where they manufacture just about every single car for the world. They're looking around saying, 'Can anybody do it better than us?'"" says Mr Dunne.

""Leaders in Detroit, Nagoya, Germany, UK, everywhere around the world, are shaking their heads. It's a new era, and the Chinese are feeling very confident about their prospects right now.""

Despite the environmental benefits, there is still suspicion about what relying on Chinese technology could bring.

Britain's former head of MI6, Sir Richard Dearlove, recently called Chinese EVs ""computers on wheels"" that can be ""controlled from Beijing"".

His claim that Chinese EVs could one day immobilise British cities was dismissed by BYD's executive vice-president Stella Li in a recent BBC interview.

""Anyone can claim anything if they lose the game. But so what?"" she said.

""BYD pays for a very high standard of data security. We use local carriers for all our data. In fact we do it 10 times better than our competition.""

Nevertheless Sir Richard's concerns echo previous national security debates surrounding Chinese technology.

This includes telecoms infrastructure maker Huawei, whose equipment was banned in several Western countries, as well as the social media app TikTok, which is prohibited on UK government devices.

But for Sun Jingguo in Guangzhou, the message is simple.

""I think the world should thank China for bringing this technology to the world,"" he laughs. ""I do.""

Separately, heavy industries like steel, chemicals and glass will have their network charges, paid to maintain the grid, discounted by 90% from next year – up from 60% currently. This will help around 500 firms, according to a statement.

Article content

UK manufacturers have long complained about the crippling cost of energy in the UK, which is among the highest in the developed world. Some of that is down to climate levies like feed-in tariffs and the renewables obligation.

Article content

The energy exemptions are the highlight of the government’s Industrial Strategy, a 10-year plan to lift investment and make it easier to do business in the UK. The full plan is released on Monday.

Article content

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the strategy “marks a turning point for Britain’s economy and a clear break from the short-termism and sticking plasters of the past.”

Article content

The government has been struggling to drive economic growth since hitting businesses with a £26 billion ($35 billion) tax on jobs and higher minimum wage, both of which came into effect in April. GDP that month shrank 0.3% and the Bank of England has warned of underlying weakness in the economy.

Article content

Article content

Labour insisted the exemptions would complement its “long-term mission for clean power” and would not be paid for by raising household bills or taxes. Instead, they will be “funded through reforms to the energy system,” specifically higher UK carbon pricing. As part of the recent trade deal with the European Union, the government agreed to rejoin the EU carbon market.

A recent study by the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis found that the government would have raised an extra £2.9 billion over 2024-25 and 2025-26 had it matched the EU’s emissions trading scheme.

They promise a new way to provide heat and electricity that is cheaper than current nuclear power plants, being faster to build, easily scalable, and inherently safer.
However, it is in line with American legislation and executive orders going back to 2019, as well as the current administration's commitment to increasing US energy production and promoting nuclear energy in general, so it is a significant advancement.
The reactor would provide heat as well as light, which is important in Alaska, where it can reach minus 50 °F (-45 °C).
""This microreactor pilot could position Alaska and the nation at the forefront of energy innovation – leading us to a new era of safe, secure, and reliable energy,"" said Secretary of the Air Force Troy Meink.","In a major milestone for modular nuclear power on the way to the mainstream, the US Department of the Air Force has issued a Notice of Intent to Award (NOITA) to Oklo that may lead to the construction and operation of a military reactor in Fairbanks, Alaska.

Small nuclear reactors yielding less than 50 MW that can be mass produced in factories and shipped to where needed have very much been in the news in recent years. They promise a new way to provide heat and electricity that is cheaper than current nuclear power plants, being faster to build, easily scalable, and inherently safer.

Such reactors are also a power source that's much easier to set up in remote locations, which is why the US military is so interested in them. Presently, the Air Force wants to test that concept at Eielson Air Force Base (AFB), located 26 miles (42 km) southeast of Fairbanks, Alaska, as a way of replacing the tonnes of coal that regularly have to be shipped in to power the facility.

The latest agreement was made in coordination with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Energy Office and is not a firm contract, so many technical details about what the Alaskan reactors would look like are unknown. However, it is in line with American legislation and executive orders going back to 2019, as well as the current administration's commitment to increasing US energy production and promoting nuclear energy in general, so it is a significant advancement.

If a contract is awarded, it will be for a 30-year power fixed-price purchase agreement after securing an NRC license that will include construction, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning of the reactor.

Based on previous designs, the new demonstration reactor will have an output of about 5 MW and provide part of the base's 35-MW requirements, though the modular design allows for easy scalability by adding more modules if need be. The reactor would provide heat as well as light, which is important in Alaska, where it can reach minus 50 °F (-45 °C).

The type of reactor built will depend on the kind of nuclear fuel selected. The main candidates are some form of high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU), with uranium-235 concentrations higher than that found in conventional commercial power reactors, or TRISO (Tristructural-isotropic) pebbles, where each spherical uranium particle is encapsulated by multiple protective layers of carbon and ceramics. Both of these share the ability to operate for up to 15 years without refueling.

""This microreactor pilot could position Alaska and the nation at the forefront of energy innovation – leading us to a new era of safe, secure, and reliable energy,"" said Secretary of the Air Force Troy Meink.

A year later, he promised to deliver them the next year, but that didn’t happen either.

Despite the empty pledges the promises kept coming. Last year in January, Musk said, “Next year for sure, we’ll have over a million robotaxis.”

Would you settle for 10 or 12?

Musk appears to be on the verge of making his robotaxi vision a reality with a test run of a small squad of self-driving cabs in Austin, Texas, that began Sunday. Reaching a million may take a year or more, however, although the billionaire should be able to expand the service this year if the Austin demo is a success.

The stakes couldn't be higher, nor the challenges.

While Musk was making those “next year” promises, rival Waymo was busy deploying driverless taxis in Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and other cities by using a different technology that allowed it to get to market faster. It just completed its 10 millionth paid ride.

Boycotts related to Musk's politics have tanked Tesla's sales. Rival electric vehicle makers with newly competitive models have stolen market share. And investors are on edge after a $150 billion stock wipeout when Musk picked a social media fight with a U.S. president overseeing federal car regulators who could make the robotaxi rollout much more difficult. The stock has recovered somewhat after Musk said he regretted some of his remarks.

Tesla shareholders have stood by Musk over the years because he’s defied the odds by building a successful standalone electric vehicle company — self-driving car promises aside — and making them a lot of money in the process. A decade ago, Tesla shares traded for around $18. The shares closed Friday at $322.

Musk seemed jubilant Sunday morning, posting on X, “The @Tesla_AI robotaxi launch begins in Austin this afternoon with customers paying a $4.20 flat fee!”

The test is beginning modestly enough. Tesla is remotely monitoring the vehicles and putting a person in the passenger seat in case of trouble. The number of Teslas deployed will also be small — just 10 or 12 vehicles — and will only pick up passengers in a limited, geofenced area.

Musk has vowed that the service will quickly spread to other cities, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands if not a million vehicles next year.

Some Musk watchers on Wall Street are skeptical.

“How quickly can he expand the fleet?” asks Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA. “We're talking maybe a dozen vehicles initially. It's very small.""

Morningstar's Seth Goldstein says Musk is being classic Musk: Promising too much, too quickly.

“When anyone in Austin can download the app and use a robotaxi, that will be a success, but I don't think that will happen until 2028,"" he says. “Testing is going to take a while.”

Musk's tendency to push up the stock high with a bit of hyperbole is well known among investors.

In 2018, he told Tesla stockholders he had “funding secured” to buy all their shares at a massive premium and take the company private. But he not only lacked a written commitment from financiers, according to federal stock regulators who fined him, he hadn't discussed the loan amount or other details with them.

More recently, Musk told CNBC in May that Tesla was experiencing a “major rebound” in demand. A week later an auto trade group in Europe announced sales had plunged by half.

Musk has come under fire for allegedly exaggerating the ability of the system used for its cars to drive themselves, starting with the name. Full Self-Driving is a misnomer. The system still requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road because they may need to intervene and take control at any moment.

Federal highway safety regulators opened an investigation into FSD last year after several accidents, and the Department of Justice has conducted its own probe, though the status of that is not known. Tesla has also faced lawsuits over the feature, some resulting in settlements, other dismissed. In one case, a judge ruled against the plaintiffs but only because they hadn't proved Musk “knowingly” made false statements.

Musk says the robotaxis will be running on an improved version of Full Self-Driving and the cabs will be safe.

He also says the service will be able to expand rapidly around the country. His secret weapon: Millions of Tesla owners now on the roads. He says an over-the-air software update will soon allow them to turn their cars into driverless cabs and start a side business while stuck at the office for eight hours or on vacation for a week.

“Instead of having your car sit in the parking lot, your car could be earning money,” Musk said earlier this year, calling it an Airbnb model for cars. “You will be able to add or subtract your car to the fleet.”

Musk says Tesla also can move fast to deploy taxis now because of his decision to rely only on cameras for the cars to navigate, unlike Waymo, which has gone a more expensive route by supplementing its cameras with lasers and radar.

“Tesla will have, I don’t know,” Musk mused in an conference call with investors, ”99% market share or something ridiculous.” Given Waymo's head start and potential competition from Amazon and others, dominating the driverless market to that extent could be a reach.

But Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst and big Musk fan, says this time Musk may actually pull it off because of Tesla's ability to scale up quickly. And even skeptics like Morningstar's Goldstein acknowledge that Musk occasionally does gets things right, and spectacularly so.

He upended the car industry by getting people to buy expensive electric vehicles, brought his Starlink satellite internet service to rural areas and, more recently, performed a gee-whiz trick of landing an unmanned SpaceX rocket on a platform back on earth.

This project will be a ‘game-changer’.”

— Rayne van den Berg, Values Australia

LONDON, ENGLAND , UNITED KINGDOM, June 21, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Today London Climate Action Week commences which will be attended by some 45,000 people. One of the key themes is mobilizing public and private finance to support global climate goals and transitions, particularly in the lead-up to COP30.

To advance this mission, ten leading forestry companies are today announcing they will quantify and value a set of ecosystem services with the aim of building the foundation for an investible market. These entities own or manage millions of hectares of forests in 21 countries.

The 18-month project, an initiative of the International Sustainable Forestry Coalition (ISFC), will be supported by Value Australia (part of the Capitals Coalition) and the Taskforce on Nature Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).

Independent Chair of the ISFC, Dr David Brand said, “The world must begin to increase investments with positive impacts on both climate and nature. However, if we are to attract the scale of funding required these investments must also make economic sense. The global forestry sector can deliver sustainable, renewable materials as well as positive outcomes for climate and nature. Central to this is standardizing the accounting for the extensive natural capital assets managed by these companies. ISFC members wish to be at the forefront of this work and have therefore decided to come together to build out mutually supporting Natural Capital reports.”

Mark Gough, Chief Executive Officer of Capitals Coalition said, “The contribution that the forestry sector can make has often been undervalued. The ISFC is stepping up to address this by working with the Capitals Coalition and TNFD to produce consistent accounts and disclosures that can reflect the true value of forestry.”

Rayne van den Berg, Chief Value Officer at Value Australia (a regional Capitals Coalition hub), said, “Many individual companies and thought leaders have worked for years to develop frameworks and methodologies to quantify and value Natural Capital with the aim of providing better information for more informed decision-making. This project will be a ‘game-changer’ as, for the first time, a collective of leading forestry companies will develop consistent reports for their most material ecosystem services and the approach taken to quantifying impacts and dependencies.”

Tony Goldner, Chief Executive Officer of the Taskforce for Nature Related Financial Disclosures said, “TNFD is pleased to support this collective effort as ISFC has been able to bring together an impressive range of forestry sector players prepared to work together for the good of nature and climate outcomes, balanced with delivering returns. The TNFD framework, and the LEAP process, being adopted by enterprises all over the world, provides the frame of reference for this project. The missing piece of that puzzle has been the valuation of ecosystem services, which must occur if we are to pivot globally away from nature destructive investments to nature enhancing capital flows. TNFD will utilize the learnings from this project to help inform its guidance and to demonstrate the link between TNFD Nature-related assessments and Natural Capital Accounting for Valuation and presentation.”

About the ISFC:

The ISFC currently represents 17 major forestry companies across the world which steward some 18 million hectares in 37 different countries on all six forest growing continents.

The plan, which may slash energy bills by up to 25% for more than 7,000 UK businesses, is set to be unveiled on Monday alongside other measures hoped to boost growth.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called the industrial strategy ""a turning point for Britain's economy"" by supporting key industries where there is potential for growth.

Conservative acting shadow energy secretary Andrew Bowie criticised the plans, saying the UK needed ""a serious approach to energy policy"" that ""tackles the root cause of our high energy prices"".

He said it was ""astonishing"" Labour was ""finally admitting that the costs of net zero are so high that they're having to spend billions of pounds of taxpayers' money subsidising businesses' energy bills to stop them going bust"".

Manufacturers in the UK currently pay some of the highest electricity prices in the developed world.

A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to £40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for more than 7,000 manufacturing firms by exempting them from levies on bills including the renewables obligation, feed-in tariffs and the capacity market.

About 500 of the most energy-intensive firms, including the steel industry, chemicals and glassmaking, will also have their network charges cut.

Those firms currently get a 60% discount through the British Industry Supercharger scheme, which will increase to 90% from 2026.

Monday's announcement will also contain measures to speed up the time it can take to connect new factories and projects to the energy grid.

The prime minister said the industrial strategy gave businesses ""the long-term certainty and direction"" they need to ""invest, innovate and create good jobs that put more money in people's pockets"".

It also aims to support the creation of more than one million new ""well-paid jobs"" over the next decade.

Other plans within the industrial strategy include:

upskilling Britons and reducing reliance on foreign workers by spending an extra £1.2bn each year for skills by 2028-29

attracting ""elite global talent"" to come and work in the UK with visa and migration reforms

hiring more planners and streamlining application processes to reduce planning timelines and cut costs for developers

boosting research and development spending to £22.6bn per year by 2029-30 to drive innovation - including £2bn for AI

The government said it will be focusing on eight specific sectors where the UK is already strong and therefore should have the potential for faster growth.

These sectors are advanced manufacturing, clean energy industries, creative industries, defence, digital and technologies, financial services, life sciences, and professional and business services.

A bespoke 10-year plan for five of the sectors will be published on Monday, but the defence, financial services and life sciences strategies will come later.

The announcement will come after latest figures showed the UK economy shrank by 0.3% in April - its worst contraction for a year-and-a-half.

Meanwhile, in April business groups raised concerns that the government's Employment Rights Bill could hit growth at an uncertain time for the UK economy.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the industrial strategy will ""see billions of pounds for investment and cutting-edge tech, ease energy costs, and upskill the nation"".

New Industrial Strategy to unlock billions in investment and support 1.1 million new well-paid jobs over the next decade.

Strategy developed in partnership with business, marking a new era of collaboration between government and high growth industries.

Strategy will make the UK the best country to invest in and grow a business, delivering on the Plan for Change.

More than 7,000 British businesses are set to see their electricity bills slashed by up to 25% from 2027, as the Government unveils its bold new Industrial Strategy today [Monday 23 June].

The modern Industrial Strategy sets out a ten-year plan to boost investment, create good skilled jobs and make Britain the best place to do business by tackling two of the biggest barriers facing UK industry - high electricity prices and long waits for grid connections.

British manufacturers currently pay some of the highest electricity prices in the developed world while businesses looking to expand or modernise have faced delays when it comes to connecting to the grid.

For too long these challenges have held back growth and made it harder for British firms to compete. Today’s announcement marks a decisive shift — with government stepping in to support industry and unlock the UK’s economic potential.

From 2027, the new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will reduce electricity costs by up to £40 per megawatt hour for over 7,000 electricity-intensive businesses in manufacturing sectors like automotive, aerospace and chemicals.

These firms, which support over 300,000 skilled jobs, will be exempt from paying levies such as the Renewables Obligation, Feed-in Tariffs and the Capacity Market — helping level the playing field and make them more internationally competitive. Eligibility and further details on the exemptions will be determined following consultation, which will be launched shortly.

The government is also increasing support for the most energy-intensive firms — like steel, chemicals, and glass — by covering more of the electricity network charges they normally have to pay through the British Industry Supercharger. These businesses currently get a 60% discount on those charges, but from 2026, that will increase to 90%. This means their electricity bills will go down, helping them stay competitive, protect jobs, and invest in the future.

This will help around 500 eligible businesses in sectors such as steel, ceramics and glass reduce their costs and protect jobs in industries that are the backbone of our economy and will be delivered at no additional cost to the taxpayer.

These reforms complement the government’s long-term mission for clean power, which is the only way to bring down bills for good by ending the UK’s dependency on volatile fossil fuel markets.

To ensure businesses can grow and hire without delay, the government will also deliver a new Connections Accelerator Service to streamline grid access for major investment projects — including prioritising those that create high-quality jobs and deliver significant economic benefits.

We will work closely with the energy sector, local authorities, Welsh and Scottish Governments, trade unions, and industry to design this service, which we expect to begin operating at the end of 2025. New powers in the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, currently before parliament, could also allow the Government to reserve grid capacity for strategically important projects, cutting waiting times and unlocking growth in key sectors.

The Industrial Strategy is a 10-year plan to promote business investment and growth and make it quicker, easier and cheaper to do business in the UK, giving businesses the confidence to invest and create 1.1 million good, well-paid jobs in thriving industries – delivering on this government’s Plan for Change.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said:

This Industrial Strategy marks a turning point for Britain’s economy and a clear break from the short-termism and sticking plasters of the past.

In an era of global economic instability, it delivers the long term certainty and direction British businesses need to invest, innovate and create good jobs that put more money in people’s pockets as part of the plan for change.

This is how we power Britain’s future - by backing the sectors where we lead, removing the barriers that hold us back, and setting out a clear path to build a stronger economy that works for working people. Our message is clear - Britain is back and open for business.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said:

The UK has some of the most innovative businesses in the world and our Plan for Change has provided them with the stability they need to grow and for more to be created.

Today’s Industrial Strategy builds on that progress with a ten-year plan to slash barriers to investment. It’ll see billions of pounds for investment and cutting-edge tech, ease energy costs, and upskill the nation. It will ensure the industries that make Britain great can thrive. It will boost our economy and create jobs that put more money in people’s pockets.

Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said:

We’ve said from day one Britain is back in business under this government, and the £100 billion of investment we’ve secured in the past year shows our Plan for Change is already delivering for working people.

Our Modern Industrial Strategy will ensure the UK is the best country to invest and do business, delivering economic growth that puts more money in people’s pockets and pays for our NHS, schools and military.

Not only does this Strategy prioritise investment to attract billions for new business sites, cutting-edge research, and better transport links, it will also make our industrial electricity prices more competitive.

Tackling energy costs and fixing skills has been the single biggest ask of us from businesses and the greatest challenge they’ve faced – this government has listened, and now we’re taking the bold action needed. Government and business working hand in hand to make working people better of is what this Government promised and what we will deliver.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

For too long high electricity costs have held back British businesses, as a result of our reliance on gas sold on volatile international markets.

As part of our modern industrial strategy we’re unlocking the potential of British industry by slashing industrial electricity prices in key sectors.

We’re also doubling down on our clean power strengths with increased investment in growth industries from offshore wind to nuclear. This will deliver on our clean power mission and Plan for Change to bring down bills for households and businesses for good.

The Supercharger and British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will be funded through reforms to the energy system. The government is reducing costs within the system to free up funding without raising household bills or taxes and intends to also use additional funds from the strengthening of UK carbon pricing, including as a result of linking with the EU carbon market.

We have set out an intention to link emissions trading systems, as part of our new agreement with the European Union to support British businesses. Without an agreement to do this, British industry would have to pay the EU’s carbon tax.

We intend to link our carbon pricing system with the EU’s, we will ensure that money stays in the UK—which allows us to support British companies and British jobs through these schemes.

Building on the Spending Review and the recently announced 10-Year Infrastructure Strategy, the Industrial Strategy is the latest step forward in our plans to deliver national renewal. It will include targeted support for the areas of the country and economy that have the greatest potential to grow, while introducing reforms that will make it easier for all businesses to get ahead.

The Strategy’s bold plan of action includes:

Slash electricity costs by up to 25% from 2027 for electricity-intensive manufacturers in our growth sectors and foundational industries in their supply chain, bringing costs more closely in line with other major economies in Europe.

Unlocking billions in finance for innovative business, especially for SMEs by increasing British Business Bank financial capacity to £25.6 billion, crowding in tens of billions of pounds more in private capital. The includes an additional £4bn for Industrial Strategy Sectors, crowding in billions more in private capital. By investing largely through venture funds, the BBB will back the UK’s most high-growth potential companies.

Upskilling the nation with an extra £1.2 billion each year for skills by 2028-29, and delivering more opportunities to learn and earn in our high-growth sectors including new short courses in relevant skills funded by the Growth and Skills Levy and skills packages targeted at defence digital and engineering.

Reducing regulatory burdens by cutting the administrative costs of regulation for business by 25% and reduce the number of regulators.

Supporting 5,500 more SMEs to adopt new technology through the Made Smarter programme while centralising government support in one place through the Business Growth Service.

Boosting R&D spending to £22.6bn per year by 2029-30 to drive innovation across the IS-8, with more than £2bn for AI over the Spending Review, and £2.8bn for advanced manufacturing over the next ten years. This will leverage in billions more from private investors. Regulatory changes will further clear the path for fast-growing industries and innovative products such as biotechnology, AI, and autonomous vehicles.

Attracting elite global talent to our key sectors, via visa and migration reforms and the new Global Talent Taskforce.

Deepening economic and industrial collaboration with our partners, building on our Industrial Strategy Partnership with Japan and recent deals with the US, India, and the EU.

Reducing planning timelines and cutting costs for developers, by hiring more planners, streamlining pre-application requirements and combining environmental obligations, removing burdens on businesses as well as accelerating house building.

Revolutionising public procurement and reducing barriers for new entrants and SMEs to bolster domestic competitiveness.

Supporting the UK’s city regions and clusters by increasing the supply of investible sites through a new £600m Strategic Sites Accelerator, enhanced regional support from the Office for Investment, National Wealth Fund, and British Business Bank, and more.

The plan focuses on 8 sectors where the UK is already strong and there’s potential for faster growth: Advanced Manufacturing, Clean Energy Industries, Creative Industries, Defence, Digital and Technologies, Financial Services, Life Sciences, and Professional and Business Services. Each growth sector has a bespoke 10-year plan that will attract investment, enable growth and create high-quality, well-paid jobs.

Dame Clare Barclay DBE, Chair of the Industrial Strategy Advisory Council and President of Enterprise & Industry EMEA at Microsoft said:

I welcome today’s Industrial Strategy, which sets out a clear plan to back the UK’s growth driving sectors. It is particularly positive to see the strong focus on skills in areas such as engineering, technology and defence. Commitments such as £187 million for the TechFirst programme will ensure the UK has the skills it needs to support our growth industries and seize transformative opportunities like AI.

Rain Newton-Smith, Chief Executive, CBI said:

Today’s Industrial Strategy announcement is a significant leap forward in the partnership between government and business that sets us on the path to our shared goal of raising living standards across the country.

It sends an unambiguous, positive signal about the nation’s global calling card as well as the direction of travel for the wider economy for the next decade and beyond.

The CBI has long been advocating for a comprehensive industrial strategy, based on the UK’s USP - the sectors and markets where we can compete to win on the global stage.

More competitive energy prices, fast-tracked planning decisions and backing innovation will provide a bedrock for growth. But the global race to attract investment will require a laser-like and unwavering focus on the UK’s overall competitiveness.

Today marks the beginning of delivering this strategy in close partnership, at pace, and with a shared purpose.

Stephen Phipson CBE, CEO at Make UK said:

British industry has been in desperate need for a government who understands our sector and had the strategic vision for a plan for growth. Today’s Industrial Strategy is a giant and much needed step forward taken by the Secretary of State who has seen the potential and provided the keys to help unlock it.

Make UK has led the campaign for a new industrial strategy for many years, highlighting the three major challenges that were diminishing our competitiveness, hampering growth and frustrating productivity gains: a skills crisis, crippling energy costs and, an inability to access capital for new British innovators.

The strategy announced today sets out plans to address all three of these structural failings. Clearly there is much to do as we move towards implementation but, this will send a message across the Country and around the world that Britain is back in business.

Tufan Erginbilgic, Rolls-Royce CEO, said:

The UK Government’s Industrial Strategy commitment to support our world-leading aerospace and nuclear industries shows long-term strategic foresight. Rolls-Royce’s highly differentiated technologies in gas turbines and nuclear capabilities- including SMRs and AMRs- are uniquely placed to deliver economic growth, skilled jobs and attract investment into the UK.

Mike Hawes OBE, SMMT Chief Executive said:

The publication of an Industrial Strategy – one with automotive at its heart – is the policy framework the sector has long-sought and Government has now addressed. Such a strategy – long-term, aligned to a trade strategy and supported by all of Government – is the basis on which the UK automotive sector can regain its global competitiveness. Making the UK the best place to invest now depends on implementation, and implementation at pace, because investment decisions are being made now against a backdrop of fierce competition and geopolitical uncertainty. The number one priority must be addressing the UK’s high cost of energy, enabling the sector to invest in the technologies, the products and the people that will give the UK its competitive edge.

Five sector plans have been published today:

Advanced Manufacturing - Backing our Advanced Manufacturing sector with up to £4.3 billion in funding, including up to £2.8 billion in R&D over the next five years, with the aim of anchoring supply chains in the UK - from increasing vehicle production to 1.35 million, to leading the next generation of technologies for zero emission flight.

Clean Energy Industries - Doubling investment in Clean Energy Industries by 2035, with Great British Energy helping to build the clean power revolution in Britain with a further £700 million in clean energy supply chains, taking the total funding for the Great British Energy Supply Chain fund to £1 billion.

Creative Industries - Maximizing the value of our Creative Industries through a £380 million boost for film and TV, video games, advertising and marketing, music and visual and performing arts will improve access to finance for scale-ups and increase R&D, skills and exports.

Digital and Technologies - Making the UK the European leader for creating and scaling Digital and Technology businesses, with more than £2 billion to drive the AI Action Plan, including a new Sovereign AI Programme, £187 million for training one million young people in tech skills and targeting R&D investment at frontier technologies such as cyber security in Northern Ireland, semiconductors in Wales and quantum technologies in Scotland.

Professional and Business Services - Ensuring our Professional and Business Services becomes the world’s most trusted adviser to global industry, revolutionising the sector across the world through adoption of UK-grown AI and working to secure mutual recognition of professional qualifications agreements overseas.

Electricity costs for thousands of businesses will be cut by scrapping green levies to help them compete with foreign rivals.

The plan, which could cut bills by up to 25%, forms a key part of Sir Keir Starmer’s 10-year industrial strategy which he hopes will address stuttering economic growth and transform the business landscape.

The Prime Minister said the plan marks a “turning point for Britain’s economy” by supporting key industries where there is potential for growth.

Manufacturers have warned “crippling” power costs are far higher for UK businesses than competitors overseas.

From 2027, a new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to £40 per megawatt hour for over 7,000 manufacturing firms by exempting them from levies on bills including the renewables obligation, feed-in tariffs and the capacity market.

Around 500 of the most energy-intensive firms, including the steel industry, chemicals and glassmaking, will also see their network charges cut – they currently get a 60% discount through the British Industry Supercharger scheme, which will increase to 90% from 2026.

The plan also promises measures to speed up the time it can take to connect new factories and projects to the energy grid.

Sir Keir said: “This industrial strategy marks a turning point for Britain’s economy and a clear break from the short-termism and sticking plasters of the past.”

He said the decade-long plan would deliver “the long-term certainty and direction British businesses need to invest” during an “era of global uncertainty”.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband blamed “our reliance on gas sold on volatile international markets” for the high electricity costs for businesses.

He said “doubling down” on wind and nuclear power would “bring down bills for households and businesses for good”.

The industrial strategy focuses on eight areas where the UK is already strong and there is potential for further growth: advanced manufacturing, clean energy, creative industries, defence, digital, financial services, life sciences and professional and business services.

Plans for five of the sectors will be published on Monday, but the defence, financial services and life sciences strategies will come later.

Other measures include:

– Increasing the British Business Bank’s financial capacity to £25.6 billion, including £4 billion for sectors in the industrial strategy.

– Raising research and development spending to £22.6 billion a year by 2029/30.

– An extra £1.2 billion a year for skills by 2028-29 to train Britons to do jobs in growth industries and reduce reliance on foreign workers.

– Attracting “elite” overseas talent through visa and migration reforms.

– Cutting the administrative cost of red tape by 25% and reducing the number of regulators.

– Reducing the time it takes to get planning permission by hiring more planners, streamlining pre-application requirements and combining environmental obligations.

– Increasing the supply of locations for investment around the country with a £600 million strategic sites accelerator.

The strategy comes after the latest figures indicated the economy shrank by 0.3% in April, the biggest monthly contraction in gross domestic product for a year-and-a-half, as businesses felt the impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs and domestic pressure as a result of hikes to firms’ national insurance contributions.

There are also concerns in industry about the impact of the Government’s Employment Rights Bill, which could add to business costs.

Confederation of British Industry chief executive Rain Newton-Smith said: “More competitive energy prices, fast-tracked planning decisions and backing innovation will provide a bedrock for growth.

“But the global race to attract investment will require a laser-like and unwavering focus on the UK’s overall competitiveness.”

Manufacturers’ organisation Make UK’s chief Stephen Phipson said the three major challenges facing industry were “a skills crisis, crippling energy costs and an inability to access capital for new British innovators”, and the strategy “sets out plans to address all three”.

Acting shadow energy secretary Andrew Bowie said: “It is astonishing that Labour are finally admitting that the costs of net zero are so high that they’re having to spend billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money subsidising businesses’ energy bills to stop them going bust.”

Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith has written an open letter to firms warning they are being “sleepwalked into disaster” by the Employment Rights Bill.

The measure is a key plank of the long-awaited industrial strategy, a 10-year plan to boost sectors ranging from the creative industries to manufacturing.

More than 7,000 businesses could have their energy bills reduced as the government removes levies such as the renewables obligation, which funds continuing commitments to earlier renewable electricity generation projects.

It will come alongside a parallel policy, reported in the Guardian last week, aimed at helping particularly electricity-intensive industries such as the beleaguered steel sector.

This will involve increasing the discount on the fees that energy-intensive firms pay to connect to the grid to 90%, up from 60%.

Industry sources told the Guardian last week that, while the policy was welcome, the overall saving for steel is expected only to be worth about £15m a year.

However, the discount is also anticipated to help about 500 businesses in other industries, including aluminium, ceramics and glass.

British manufacturers have long complained of having to grapple with some of the highest electricity prices in the developed world, as well as delays in connecting to the grid, a particular concern in the tech sector.

There will be new systems put in place for major investment projects that create significant numbers of jobs to have faster grid access, expected to be in place before the end of the year.

Announcing the plan, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, said he hoped it would be “a turning point for Britain’s economy and a clear break from the short-termism and sticking plasters of the past.

“In an era of global economic instability, it delivers the long-term certainty and direction British businesses need to invest, innovate and create good jobs that put more money in people’s pockets as part of the plan for change.”

The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the strategy would complement the spending review, which prioritised investment in infrastructure and industry. “It’ll see billions of pounds for investment and cutting-edge tech, ease energy costs and upskill the nation. It will ensure the industries that make Britain great can thrive,” she said. “It will boost our economy and create jobs that put more money in people’s pockets.”

The government said the reforms would not directly cost the taxpayer anything or lead to an increase in household bills, but would be funded through reforms to the energy system.

Energy costs are likely to remain significantly higher than in Germany and France, chiefly because UK electricity prices are linked to the cost of wholesale gas, which is a larger part of the British energy mix than on the continent.

Key to the plan is the proposed linking of the UK’s emissions trading scheme with that of the EU, announced in May at a joint summit in London, though negotiations about the UK’s entry into that carbon market are still not concluded.

The strategy on Monday is expected to focus on eight sectors where the UK has potential for fast growth: advanced manufacturing, clean energy, creative industries, defence, digital, financial services, life sciences and professional services.

The Confederation of British Industry’s chief executive, Rain Newton-Smith, praised the strategy, saying “competitive energy prices, fast-tracked planning decisions and backing innovation will provide a bedrock for growth. But the global race to attract investment will require a laser-like and unwavering focus on the UK’s overall competitiveness.”

Stephen Phipson, the chief executive of the manufacturers’ organisation Make UK, said the strategy was a “giant and much-needed step forward”, saying there had long been frustration in the sector at the skills crisis, crippling energy costs and difficulty in accessing capital.

“The strategy announced today sets out plans to address all three of these structural failings,” he said. “Clearly there is much to do as we move towards implementation, but this will send a message across the country and around the world that Britain is back in business.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/943c35793c0ec235bb796ae1e9eb2bd6b054e735/630_75_4561_3649/master/4561.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3d7e896e1e1306935bb10b7fece46127,N,,2025-06-22 18:03:01.911730

That justification must supply a “core justification” for the EPA’s action, Thomas said, as it did in the case of the six refineries, whose requests for biofuel mandate exemptions were denied based on an interpretation of the Clean Air Act that the agency applied to all refineries regardless of their geographic location.

“Allowing 12 different circuit courts to adjudicate SREs (small refinery exemptions) would result in a fractured and inconsistent body of law, causing chaos and confusion in the marketplace,” biofuel groups Growth Energy and the Renewable Fuels Association wrote in a joint statement.

Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, in a dissenting opinion joined by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, said the test that the majority laid out was “both mistaken and likely to render simple venue questions unnecessarily difficult and expensive to resolve.”

They nonetheless concurred with the court’s decision to reverse the conclusion by the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the case by Oklahoma and Utah should be transferred to the D.C. Circuit.

That case concerned a rule the EPA issued in March 2023 intended to target gases that form ozone, a key component of smog, from power plants and other industrial sources in 23 upwind states whose own plans did not satisfy the the Clean Air Act’s “Good Neighbor” provision.

Oklahoma and Utah were among 21 states whose air quality plans were rejected by the EPA under that policy. Numerous lawsuits followed, including by Oklahoma and Utah, who sought to challenge the decision in the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Right now, the 30% federal tax credit is still fully in place, and that’s excellent news for anyone going solar in 2025.
While national politics can feel distant, the proposed federal changes could have real impacts here at home.","Dear Eartha, I heard the federal tax credit for solar might change. If I install solar this year, am I still eligible?

Great question — and one we’ve been hearing a lot lately from Summit County homeowners considering solar. With the proposed One Big Beautiful Bill Act being debated in Congress, there’s a lot of uncertainty around how it might affect clean energy incentives. The 30% federal tax credit has been a huge driver of solar adoption both nationally and right here in Summit County through programs like Solarize Summit. So, let’s break down what’s going on and how it could impact your savings.

What is the One Big Beautiful Bill Act?

This proposed legislation is being described by supporters as the “largest tax cut in history.” But for those interested in clean energy, it could bring major changes. Among many revisions to the tax code, the bill proposes terminating the residential solar tax credit 180 days after it’s signed into law. That’s a dramatic shift from the current timeline, which guarantees the full 30% credit through 2032 under the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022. But if the One Big Beautiful Bill becomes law, that timeline could be cut short by more than six years.

Where does the bill stand now?

As of now, the bill has already cleared one major hurdle: it passed the U.S. House of Representatives on May 22, 2025 , by a very narrow margin. The bill is now under consideration in the U.S. Senate, where lawmakers have already proposed changes to the House version.

Next, the Senate will finalize and vote on its own version of the bill, which is expected to happen by early July. If the Senate passes a version with amendments — which is very likely — a conference committee made up of House and Senate members will be formed to resolve the differences between the two versions . This negotiated bill, called a conference report, must then be voted on again by both the House and the Senate before it can be sent to the President’s desk for signature.

If signed into law in its current form sometime this summer, the 180-day clock would begin — giving homeowners just six months to install solar and qualify for the full federal tax credit. This means the credit could expire as early as 2026.

What does this mean for Summit County homeowners?

Right now, the 30% federal tax credit is still fully in place, and that’s excellent news for anyone going solar in 2025. But if the bill becomes law, homeowners could have only six months to complete their installation in order to take advantage of the tax credit.

Fortunately, Solarize Summit is designed to help homeowners move quickly and confidently. In addition to the federal tax credit, participants who sign a contract before July 31 can access up to $2,400 in combined incentives from High Country Conservation Center and the program’s installer, Active Energies Solar . But don’t delay, these incentives are limited and on a first-come, first-served basis.

The takeaway

The combination of the federal tax credit, local rebates and the streamlined Solarize Summit process makes 2025 one of the most affordable and impactful years to go solar.

While national politics can feel distant, the proposed federal changes could have real impacts here at home. By acting now, you can secure your solar savings, reduce your reliance on fossil fuels and be part of the transition to a cleaner, more resilient energy future.

The technology corporation Rheinmetall has secured a double-digit million euro order from a renowned North American truck manufacturer. The order involves a mid-six-figure quantity of CWA 2000 high-voltage coolant pumps being used in the manufacturer’s battery-powered medium and heavy duty trucks. Rheinmetall will supply the customer directly from 2028 to 2035.

The deciding factor behind the order were the technical characteristics of the product. The CWA 2000 is a versatile solution for a wide range of cooling specifications. In principle it is just as suitable for battery-powered electric vehicles as it is for fuel-cell drives. The CWA 2000 has a long life-cycle and is designed for the HV3b voltage level, which allows an operating voltage of up to 850V. It is available with either an active or passive high-voltage interlock loop, which keeps the battery system ready for operation as long as the loop is closed. If the loop is interrupted, this system protects all persons who could come into contact with high-voltage components during the life-cycle of an electric vehicle by switching off the power.

This order is a confirmation of the customer´s trust to Rheinmetall´s technology for the North American market. The order is also of strategic importance, as it enables Rheinmetall to increase its footprint with components for the thermal management of electric trucks. This is a further important step with a view to the transformation of drive technology.

The Power Systems division is a system provider of high-quality and innovative (mobility) solutions, control technologies and digital applications, also for automotive and energy industries.

In a shift in policy, the latest draft of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” omits residential solar lease providers from the Investment Tax Credit. Already, solar stocks are falling and bankruptcies are ticking up as tension and worries rise.

Until now, home solar and batteries have benefitted from a 30 percent tax credit. That would drop to zero percent 180 days after Trump signs, if this latest version of the bill goes through. However, the bill is expected to undergo further changes as it moves through the Senate. But no matter the fine print, the writing is on the wall for solar companies in the United States, and the markets are already strongly responding to this new antagonistic policy space for solar.

PV Magazine reports that the domestic residential solar industry is “on the brink of collapse,” adding that the newest draft of the bill is sweepingly discouraging for clean energy as a whole, but particularly punishing for residential solar. While cuts were anticipated, this new proposed slashing of federal credits is coming far sooner than expected. What is more, this blow is hitting an already bruised and battered industry which was already reeling from tariffs that hit solar supply chains hard.

“The residential solar industry is no stranger to highs and lows, often referred to as the ‘solar coaster’ by those who have weathered the storm of hot-and-cold policies that create markets and then take them away at a breakneck pace,” PV Magazine reports. “But the latest draft of the federal reconciliation bill may represent a crash.”

Already, solar company bankruptcies are piling up. Just this month, two major industry players – residential solar provider Sunnova and financing firm Mosaic – filed for bankruptcies. Sunnova pointed to “uncertainty over the nation’s commitment” to solar power as a major motivation of the filing. “The two companies are among the largest casualties in the sector since Donald Trump took office,” reports the Financial Times.

The news has also hit the stock market hard, with a wide array of solar companies taking major hits. Solar inverter company Enphase Energy and solar panel manufacturer First Solar dropped by 27.2 percent and 19.3 percent, respectively, placing them amongst the largest decliners on the S&P 500. “Solar stocks have had a terrible run lately, amid anticipation that this would happen,” reports Barron’s. Looking at the last year, Enphase, SolarEdge, and Sunrun are all down between 52 percent and 70 percent.

“We are in a fight for our lives,” Abigail Ross Hopper, CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said at a rally in Washington earlier this week. “The bill does not achieve American energy dominance . . . In the residential solar industry alone, 1,500 small businesses and over 250,000 jobs are at risk.”

While the prognosis is grim for residential solar, utility-scale solar may be shielded from some of the worst effects of the bill and be able to bounce back better. The latest draft of the bill is “less punitive for utility-scale developers,” which will not be bound by the same leasing restrictions as residential companies. Furthermore, energy demand growth will help to stabilize large-scale energy generation overall. “Even absent tax credits we believe solar remains highly cost competitive with other fossil fuel generation technologies,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Christopher Dendrinos told Barron’s.

Hydropower, nuclear energy, and geothermal energy will also be spared. The current iteration of the bill extends their tax credits through 2036.

Is it possible the predictions of the death of offshore wind power — one of our single best tools in the fight against climate change — were wrong?

While fossil fuel lobbyists and wealthy waterfront landowners in beachfront communities were cheering on the impending death of clean energy, a funny thing happened: Turbines continued going up, large-scale projects got built and began turning wind into electricity, and the wind projects continued their progress toward construction.

Dominion Energy continues — quietly — to work toward completing the nation’s largest offshore wind project after battling years of fossil-fuel funded opposition and weathering the Trump administration’s repeated — albeit inconsistent — moves to shut down wind. Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is more than halfway complete. In many ways, between the jobs, the power and the investment, it may simply be too big to fail.

With 176 turbines, the $6 billion project will power 660,000 homes with clean energy when finished in 2026. It has already created 2,000 jobs and stands as proof that offshore wind is alive and well.

So while the naysayers were busy writing obituaries, offshore wind continued to do what it was always meant to do: generate power, create jobs, and help secure a livable future.

Meanwhile the most audacious attack on offshore wind, a stop work order from the Trump administration against New York’s Empire Wind, was rescinded earlier this month. That project is now back under construction. Empire has created 1,500 jobs and will power half-a-million New York homes when completed in 2028. To the extent reports that New York Gov. Kathy Hochul agreed to fresh consideration of one or more fracked gas pipelines in exchange for allowing Empire to proceed are accurate, such ill-advised and outdated proposals face major obstacles, including stiff public opposition. Meanwhile, construction of the critical clean energy that New York actually needs proceeds in the form of Empire Wind.

Revolution Wind, 15 miles off the coast of Rhode Island, began work two years ago and is on target to be finished and powering 350,000 homes in Connecticut and Rhode Island by next year. Revolution has faced an onslaught of legal attacks from wealthy waterfront owners concerned about their ocean views. But at least for now, the project has been safe from Trump’s anti-wind attacks. And again, size and economic clout may have helped keep the project viable. Revolution has spent more than $100 million shoreside redeveloping waterfront in both Connecticut and Rhode Island and, by creating 1,500 jobs, has strong political and union support.

Finally, there is Vineyard Wind.

After a devastating turbine break stopped construction in July, Vineyard Wind has quietly — very quietly — managed to get back to work. Their project will power 400,000 homes in Massachusetts, revitalize the port of New Bedford, and generate 2,000 jobs. The project is also generating electricity — though how much is impossible to establish since the developer, possibly in response to the high-profile attacks on wind by the Trump administration, has opted to answer few questions about the work, the progress, the number of turbines in operation, or the resulting power.

Each of these projects has — so far — survived in the face of relentless attacks from the Trump administration, fossil fuel proponents, and greenwashed fronts. Baseless charges that wind power kills whales; lawsuits targeting transmission cables, substations and transmission cables; phony ‘grassroots’ organizations bankrolled by waterfront homeowners and/or oil and gas companies; attacks by the Trump bureaucracy — all so far have failed.

Silence about success and ongoing work seems to be a part of the strategy for offshore wind developers — and maybe you can’t blame them.

One of the directors of the Dominion project said simply this week that continued construction came from “keeping our head down” and keeping the project away from any fanfare. Dominion has also managed to keep working by touting offshore wind not as clean, green or planet saving — which, of course, it is — but simply as homegrown American power. Like federal biologists and health experts, offshore wind developers have learned not to bring the benefits of clean air and cuts to pollution into their conversations.

They can’t say it. But we can: When these four projects go on-line in the next three years, they will power two million homes while taking millions of tons of carbon pollution out of the air we breathe — the equivalent of taking 2,300,000 cars off the road. That means less asthma, better heart health, and a planet moving further from a future marked by increasing heat and drought, flooding and erosion, real damage to marine life, and more houses being swallowed by a rising ocean.

Jobs, measurable economic impact, and the promise of reliable domestic power — these may be keeping offshore wind on track to survive the current headwinds and thrive when the coast is clear. But for now, just don’t say out loud that it could also help protect our health and save the planet.",https://newbedfordlight.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/your-voice-bendy2.png,N,,2025-06-22 17:05:56.790813

Under the Program, eligible WA battery manufacturers1 will be able to access a $30 million grants program to grow manufacturing capacity and provide competitive residential battery products — not just to local, but also international markets.
The Local Battery Manufacturing Program is only part of the Cook Government’s Made in WA plan.
“Building batteries here in Western Australia was a key part of the Made in WA plan my government took to the election,” said Premier Cook.
The scheme is still missing some important detail though, including a list of eligible batteries and suppliers/installers — and with just over a week to go until kick-off.","Amid some backlash over its re-jiggered rebate, Western Australia’s Cook Government’s Budget 2025/26 has earmarked tens of millions of dollars to support a local home battery manufacturing industry.

With launch of the state’s rebate scheme imminent, Premier Cook wants to see some of the home batteries installed under the program ‘Made In WA’, and is backing industry with a $50 million Local Battery Manufacturing Program providing direct grants and low-interest loans.

Under the Program, eligible WA battery manufacturers1 will be able to access a $30 million grants program to grow manufacturing capacity and provide competitive residential battery products — not just to local, but also international markets. The grants will need to be matched dollar for dollar by the manufacturer/proponent.

The package also involves $20 million for low-interest loans, or the State Government providing land to encourage the industry to make major new technology and facility investments.

“Most local manufacturers are focused on commercial and regional or remote battery technologies, and have expressed strong interest in scaling up residential battery manufacturing when the market becomes stronger,” says the WA Government.

Much of the important detail is yet to be announced; such as what will constitute being “Made In WA” — it could be as simple as partial local assembly — and when this initiative will officially roll out.

The Local Battery Manufacturing Program is only part of the Cook Government’s Made in WA plan. Overall, $2.7 billion is being injected into the initiative under Budget 2025/26.

“Building batteries here in Western Australia was a key part of the Made in WA plan my government took to the election,” said Premier Cook. “It will support our nation-leading battery rebates, which in turn will secure our clean energy future and provide long-term, sustainable cost-of-living relief to tens of thousands of households throughout WA.”

WA Home Battery Rebate Rebellion

Some would argue that more generous battery rebate rates were also something else the Cook Government took into the election and then back-flipped on.

While the upcoming scheme was recently expanded to support up to five times the number of rebates previously (~20,000 -> ~100,000), maximum rebate value was slashed from up to $5,000 for Synergy customers to up to $1,300; and from up to $7,500 for Horizon Power customers to up to $3,800.

Another major change was in relation to a previous requirement that eligible solar batteries would just need to be Virtual Power Plant (VPP) capable. This has been tightened up to requiring those receiving states rebates to join a VPP.

However, the “stackability” of WA’s initiative with the national Cheaper Home Batteries program has been confirmed, as have interest-free loans up to $10,000 for households with combined annual incomes of under $210,000.

Premier Cook mightn’t be the most popular person among some Western Australian solar power system owners at the moment judging by comments on our blog post regarding changes to WA’s battery rebate. It saw a few comments from purchasers and potential buyers feeling misled.

Among those balancing criticism of the Cook Government’s move, SolarQuotes’ Anthony Bennett commented:

“For the same state government spend there’s now going to be about 5 times more people eligible, 5 times more leverage of private investment and that equates to perhaps 10 times the impact in terms of grid resilience, because it’s the first 5kWh that makes the most difference to peak demand and thus grid costs.” Anthony said. “80,000 more batteries will make a MASSIVE dent in demand and equally be able to soak up otherwise wasted renewable capacity.”

While Anthony mentions 5 kWh, the maximum state rebate levels are for 10 kWh systems, with 5 kWh being the minimum capacity. The scheme is still missing some important detail though, including a list of eligible batteries and suppliers/installers — and with just over a week to go until kick-off.",https://www.solarquotes.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/wa-battery-manufacturing.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 18:02:54.493074

“Excelsior Springs does not train for solar facility fires.
In response, McHugh said Gateway Trail Solar is working with the Excelsior Springs Fire Department to implement emergency access protocols and that the project will carry comprehensive insurance coverage.
Mallory Brown from the City of Excelsior Springs also raised concerns about the project’s impact on city expansion.
Gateway Trail Solar plans to present a revised Conditional Use Permit application at the Clay County Planning and Zoning Commission meeting on July 1, 2025, at 6 p.m.","Clay County, Mo. – A formative plan to convert a portion of a generational farm into a solar energy project led by Gateway Trail Solar sparked debate at the April 2025 Clay County Planning and Zoning Commission meeting, setting the stage for a revised proposal to be brought forward in July.

While the project wasn’t officially denied, developers are returning to the drawing board to address concerns raised by both officials and members of the public. The proposed site, located at 12222 N Highway just outside the city limits of Excelsior Springs, is a 207.2-acre parcel owned by Roy Sams, with approximately 111.3 acres designated for solar infrastructure under the preliminary plan.

Michael McHugh, project manager for Gateway Trail Solar, said the site was selected due to a mix of favorable conditions, including existing power infrastructure, land compatibility, and proximity to distribution lines. He emphasized the project’s low-impact design and long-term benefits, describing it as a practical way to generate clean energy while preserving the character of the land.

The project is expected to generate 20 megawatts of power, enough to supply electricity to roughly 2,300 homes. The solar panels would be installed on single-axis trackers, engineered to follow the sun throughout the day and last up to 35 years. Solis Renewables will manage day-to-day operations, with the landowner bearing no operational risk or maintenance responsibility.

McHugh explained that the project would create 55 new jobs in Clay County during construction and 155 statewide, resulting in over $6.3 million in local earnings and more than $15.4 million across Missouri. Long-term, the site is projected to support 1.6 local jobs and six statewide, with annual earnings exceeding $100,000 locally.

While the project will benefit from federal tax credits such as the Investment and Production Tax Credits, McHugh clarified that it is privately financed and will generate local property tax revenue through a Chapter 100 tax agreement, pending county approval.

The current landowner, Roy Sams, spoke in support of the project, emphasizing its role in preserving both the land and his family’s legacy. “My grandparents bought this farm in 1942, and it has been passed down through generations,” Sams said. “Farming is tough. This lease would allow me to maintain ownership while securing income for my family’s future without permanently altering the land.”

Several attendees echoed Mr. Sams’ position. Environmental advocate Linda Hetzel noted that solar development may actually support wildlife habitat. “If this land were developed for housing instead, it would likely remove timber and food sources. Solar farms allow ecosystems to thrive,” she said.

Rick Yoder, a supporter from Missouri Energy Professionals, urged the commission to think long-term. “What we have now isn’t going to sustain the number of people and cooling demands we’re facing,” he said, calling the shift to renewable energy both necessary and forward-thinking.

Still, opposition to the project was vocal and wide-ranging. Susan Meehan, a nearby resident, raised concerns about emergency response limitations and fire safety. “Excelsior Springs does not train for solar facility fires. There are no hydrants in this location,” she said, also questioning whether insurance would cover potential damage.

In response, McHugh said Gateway Trail Solar is working with the Excelsior Springs Fire Department to implement emergency access protocols and that the project will carry comprehensive insurance coverage. He also noted that the company will post a fully funded decommissioning bond, ensuring the site can be restored once operations end.

Joe Meehan expressed concern about how the fencing would impact wildlife access. In a written statement, developers clarified that no barbed wire would be used and that the fencing would meet safety and aesthetic standards. Other concerns centered on long-term accountability and the company’s relative newness.

Excelsior Springs City Councilman Stephen Spear, who lives near the Sams property, questioned whether the community could count on the company to remain solvent for the full 30-year life of the project. “Unless the bond is fully funded upfront, there’s no guarantee there will be money to remove the panels when the project ends,” he said.

Mallory Brown from the City of Excelsior Springs also raised concerns about the project’s impact on city expansion. She noted that the site lies in an area targeted for future growth due to the region’s ongoing housing shortage. “If developed, the solar farm prevents annexation and limits our ability to provide necessary utilities,” she said.

The case before the court involved a number of refineries that challenged the EPA’s denial of petitions for exemptions from the CAA’s renewable fuel program under which most domestic refineries are required to blend a certain percentage of ethanol and other renewable fuels into the fuels they produce.

Small refineries across the country initiated challenges in a number of circuits. With the exception of the 5th Circuit, circuit courts either dismissed the petitions for improper venue or transferred them to the D. C. Circuit.

The 5th Circuit rejected the EPA’s efforts to have cases filed by six refineries transferred to the D.C. Circuit, ruling in favor of the refineries on the merits.

Click here to read the full text of the June 18 decision in EPA v. Calumet Shreveport Refining.

BULLET POINTS: “[W]e conclude that EPA’s denials of the small refineries’ exemption petitions were based on determinations of nationwide scope or effect. We agree with EPA’s finding … that its interpretation of the phrase ‘disproportionate economic hardship’ under §7545(o)(9)(B)(i) and its [economic theory that Renewable Identification Number (RIN) costs are fully passed through to consumers, creating a presumption against granting exemptions,] were determinations of nationwide scope or effect that formed the core basis for EPA’s denials. Both conclusions are clear determinations of nationwide scope or effect: EPA invoked both its statutory interpretation and its passthrough theory in justifying its denials, and both points apply generically to all refineries, regardless of their geographic location. …

“These conclusions also can be deemed the ‘basis’ for EPA’s denials here. EPA decided, in light of the foregoing determinations, that it would presumptively deny all the exemption petitions before it. It then considered other, refinery-specific considerations only to confirm that it had no reason to depart from its presumptive disposition. In this posture, EPA’s statutory interpretation and passthrough theory plainly are the most important parts of its reasoning. Or, put another way, where EPA relies on determinations of nationwide scope or effect to reach a presumptive resolution, those determinations qualify as the primary driver of its decision. EPA’s confirmatory review of refinery-specific facts is ‘[m]erely peripheral’ by comparison.

“Accordingly, we agree with EPA that the ‘nationwide scope or effect’ exception applies here. The Fifth Circuit should have transferred this case.”

—Justice Clarence Thomas, opinion of the court

“The question we face does not concern the merits of what EPA did, only where the small refineries’ lawsuit challenging the agency’s actions should be heard. The Act instructs that litigation over ‘nationally applicable’ EPA ‘actions’ belongs in the D. C. Circuit, while disputes over ‘locally or regionally applicable’ agency ‘actions’ generally belong in a regional circuit. In Parts I and II of its opinion, the Court concludes that these rules presumptively route the dispute before us to a regional circuit because EPA’s decision to deny an individual refinery’s petition for a hardship exemption is a ‘locally or regionally applicable’ action. With all that, I agree.

“But then, in Part III of its opinion, the Court pivots. Even when a case challenges only a ‘locally or regionally applicable’ action, the Court observes, the Act routes it to the D. C. Circuit if EPA’s action ‘is based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect.’ Applying a new multistep test it announces, the Court concludes that EPA’s actions at issue here were based on such a determination. As a result, the Court holds, the right venue for this case turns out to be the D.C.

PHOTO: BILL CLARK/ZUMA PRESS

Democrats and clean energy advocates are ratcheting up pressure on a handful of Republican senators to salvage billions of dollars in projects, ahead of an expected vote next week on President Trump’s megabill that targets critical subsidies for elimination.

How fast to wind down clean-energy credits is one of several contentious pieces of the tax-and-spending legislation, along with reductions in Medicaid spending, that Republican party leaders need to iron out quickly to hit a July 4 deadline for delivering the bill to Trump’s desk. While some Republicans are trying to protect funding for projects in their states, other GOP lawmakers see the subsidies as a ripe target for savings, as the party moves to extend and expand Trump’s tax cuts.

Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, who backs the subsidies and is up for re-election next year in closely divided North Carolina, said the Senate language released Monday “moved substantially” in the right direction from an earlier House version, and that he is still in negotiations with colleagues.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R., S.D.) said Wednesday that the energy credits language in the bill is “not totally settled yet.” Any changes that pass the Senate would then have to be approved by the House, where Republicans have taken a dimmer view of the subsidies.

The tug of war over renewable energy projects and manufacturing has centered in recent weeks on senators like Tillis, who hails from a state with billions of dollars of investment at stake in the fate of the tax credits.

In one TV ad, funded by Protect Our Jobs, a clean-energy advocacy group, the owner of a solar installation company says he employs hundreds of North Carolinians and complains about “this dumb idea in Congress to cut investments in clean energy.” The ad urges viewers to call Tillis. On Thursday, the group planned to launch two new 15-second ads in North Carolina targeting Tillis.

A Protect Our Jobs spokesman said the group is organized as a 501(c) 4, a type of nonprofit that can engage in some politics and doesn’t have to disclose its donors. The group has spent more than $7 million on its ad campaign since April, according to data from advertising tracking firm AdImpact, targeting a range of House and Senate Republicans, including Sen. Susan Collins of Maine who faces re-election next year.

Other senators targeted by the ads include Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Jerry Moran of Kansas. They joined Tillis in signing a letter to party leaders earlier this year warning against “full-scale repeal” of current credits for clean energy projects.

Solar and wind production and investment tax credits would wind down through 2026 and 2027 in the Senate proposal, instead of around 2032 in the current law. Battery storage avoided an early sunset. The House version included difficult-to-meet provisions that would have meant an immediate rollback of credits. The Senate extended the time that nuclear, hydropower and geothermal projects would be eligible for credits.

North Carolina’s clean-energy boom

The bulk of the renewable energy construction and manufacturing launched as a result of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act happened largely in Republican states, where it is often easier and faster to build something like a new factory or solar farm.

North Carolina has been one of the biggest beneficiaries. More than $21 billion in manufacturing and generation projects have been announced in North Carolina since the IRA was signed in August 2022, according to data from the nonprofit environmental business group E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker.

When the tax credits were enacted, congressional scorekeepers expected them to cost $271 billion over a decade. But without the GOP bill to end them, the total would likely be several hundred billion dollars above that.

Should the credits be sharply curtailed—as now looks likely—Democrats and aligned groups plan to pummel vulnerable Republicans on the issue as they try to chip away at the GOP’ 53-47 majority in the midterm elections next year.

The bill could help Democrats oust Tillis, said Lauren French, a spokeswoman for Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC run by allies of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.). “That’s what happens when you put kowtowing to Donald Trump before serving your state,” French said.

Tillis spokesman Daniel Keylin shot back that Democrats should be thanking the Republicans who have been working on a gentler phaseout.

“If Democrats had just worked with Republicans to make these credits fiscally sustainable a few years ago, they wouldn’t all be on the chopping block right now,” he said.

Energy executives try to buy time

As the Senate nears a vote, several renewable energy executives said they have been meeting at length with senators and staffers, pressing for a wind-down that would give them and financiers enough time to adjust business models to life without tax credits.

The Senate changes to the Republican megabill are viewed as better but not meaningfully so by many in the power and manufacturing industry, and are the latest in a long fight over the fate of the Inflation Reduction Act, a signature law of the Biden era meant to spark clean energy construction and new factories for products like solar panels and batteries.

Ben Catt, chief executive officer of Pine Gate Renewables, a North Carolina-based developer of solar and storage projects across the U.S., said that he has tried to convey to lawmakers the number of good working-class jobs at stake.

“The vast majority of those are construction and installation jobs,” Catt said. “Those are the ones that are really going away.”

Alex Epstein, an author who promotes the benefits of fossil fuels, attended a closed-door lunch with Republican senators on Wednesday to push for a compromise: an end to tax credits for all technologies after 2028, ensuring their sunset during this administration.

“That would actually extend the subsidies for residential solar purchases and leases,” Epstein said, calling the idea a “very generous compromise.”

The Senate proposal, like the House version, appears dire for companies in the business of selling and installing solar panels for homes and businesses. Tax credits for home solar and storage, energy efficiency investments and the $7,500 tax credit for many electric vehicle purchases, would end six months to a year after enactment.

Utility industry group Edison Electric Institute’s interim CEO Pat Vincent-Collawn said that companies appreciated that senators included “more reasonable timelines for phasing out energy tax credits” and would preserve transferability of credits, which lets companies that don’t owe taxes transfer credits to companies that do.

Analysts say that the Senate proposal might be the best the industry can hope for.

Here's a look at 10 energy stocks across traditional and lower-carbon areas with tremendous growth potential in the decades ahead.

Antero Resources

Antero Resources (NYSE: AR) is a leading U.S. natural gas producer focused on the Appalachian region (Ohio Utica Shale and West Virginia Marcellus Shale). It has the largest and lowest-cost inventory among producers in the region.

That puts it in a strong position to capitalize on the expected surge in natural gas demand in the coming decades. Catalysts such as liquid natural gas (LNG) exports, artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), and crypto could fuel a 116% surge in natural gas demand by the end of the decade compared to their current demand level.

Bloom Energy

Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE) makes the Bloom Energy Server. The distributed generation platform provides customers with resilient power by converting natural gas, biogas, or hydrogen into electricity through its proprietary solid oxide technology.

The scalable technology can serve as either a backup power system or the main electricity source. ""Looking ahead,"" stated founder and CEO KR Sridhar in the first-quarter earnings press release, ""the world needs power, and we expect demand to grow, driven by AI, data center needs and industrial electrification, and Bloom is well-positioned to serve these markets.""

Clearway Energy

Clearway Energy (NYSE: CWEN)(NYSE: CWEN.A) operates a growing portfolio of clean power assets (wind, solar, and natural gas generation) across the U.S. It sells this power to utilities and large corporate customers under long-term, fixed-rate power purchase agreements (PPAs).

Those PPAs produce predictable cash flow, the bulk of which Clearway pays to investors in dividends (a 5.5% current yield). It uses the cash it retains to invest in additional clean power assets. With demand for clean power expected to surge, Clearway Energy can grow its earnings and high-yielding dividend at healthy rates for decades to come.

Diamondback Energy

Diamondback (NASDAQ: FANG) is a leading oil and gas producer in the Permian Basin, which runs through Western Texas and parts of New Mexico. Diamondback has quietly built one of the largest resource bases in that prolific region through a series of highly accretive acquisitions.

The company has nearly 900,000 net acres in the region, with best-in-class inventory depth and quality at 8,400 remaining drilling locations that are economic at $50 per barrel of oil. That massive resource base gives Diamondback Energy a long growth runway to continue supplying the country with more low-cost energy.

Enphase Energy

Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) is the world's leading supplier of microinverter-based solar-plus storage systems. The company's microinverters are crucial for converting the direct current (DC) produced by solar panels into the alternating current (AC) used to power our modern society.

While microinverters are more expensive compared to string inverters, they last longer and are more efficient. Enphase has been expanding beyond microinverters to capture a larger total share of a solar panel installation by adding battery storage and software to its packaged offering. It sees a massive $25.4 billion (and growing) market opportunity for its products.

Kinetik Holdings

Kinetik Holdings (NYSE: KNTK) is an energy midstream company focused on the Permian Basin. It owns an extensive natural gas gathering system in the region and holds equity interests in several long-haul pipelines that move Permian production to market centers along the Texas Gulf Coast.

Rising regional production to support growing gas demand is expected to continue fueling robust growth for Kinetik. The company can continue investing capital to expand its existing systems and make bolt-on acquisitions. That growth should give Kinetik Holdings the fuel to continue increasing its high-yielding dividend (over 7%).

NextDecade

NextDecade (NASDAQ: NEXT) is building the Rio Grande LNG export facility in Brownsville, Texas. Phase 1 (LNG liquefaction trains 1-3) is already under construction and should start entering service in 2027. It has enough space to build up to 10 liquefaction trains at this site in the future, enabling the export of gas produced from the Permian and Eagle Ford. NextDecade is also in the early stages of developing a potential carbon-capture and sequestration project at its Rio Grande facility, opening the door to another potentially large market opportunity.

NuScale Power

NuScale Power (NYSE: SMR) is working to bring small modular reactor (SMR) technology to the global energy market. SMRs are smaller nuclear energy reactors built in a factory, which should save construction costs and time. The company currently has a dozen fully factory-fabricated modules in production and is working with a partner to help commercialize the technology. NuScale sees a massive market opportunity for SMRs, especially in helping to meet the enormous and growing power needs of data centers.

Oklo

Oklo (NYSE: OKLO) is developing fast-fission power plants that can use uranium more efficiently than traditional nuclear power plants. The company is building its first Aurora powerhouse, which it expects will be operational in late 2027 or early 2028. Oklo, backed by OpenAI's Sam Altman, has signed commercial deals to sell power produced by its Aurora powerhouses to data center operator Switch, oil and gas producer Diamondback Energy, and others.

QuantumScape

QuantumScape (NYSE: QS) is working to revolutionize energy storage by creating a better battery. Its solid-state lithium metal battery technology will provide faster charging and enhanced safety compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. The company started shipping its first battery samples to its prospective launch customer earlier this year. QuantumScape estimates that demand for solid-state batteries will exceed 1 terawatt-hour per year by 2040, which it calls a ""truly enormous opportunity"" and ""a challenge worth pursuing.""

High-powered energy stocks

These 10 energy companies have enormous growth potential as the sector continues to grow and evolve. Because of that, they could produce high-octane total returns for their investors in the future.

The study analyzed over 2.2 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in May 2023 and 2024 and found that the average used EV price is down 29.5 percent year-over-year versus 6.1 percent for the average used gas car price. In May 2024, the average used electric vehicle was priced at $28,767, or 8.3 percent below the average gas car at $31,424. These prices show a major turnaround from a year ago, when the average used EV cost $40,783 and the average used gas car cost $33,469.

Used Electric Vehicle Market Crashing

“There’s no denying the crash in used electric vehicle values over the past year,” said Karl Brauer, Executive Analyst at iSeeCars. “We’ve watched EVs prices fall between 30 and 40 percent since June of last year, while the average gas car’s price has dropped by just 3 to 7 percent in that same timeframe.”

While electric vehicle values appeared to stabilize at the end of 2023, they experienced a substantial drop in February this year and have continued to decline over the past four months. At the same time, the average used gas car price has shifted by approximately $400 during those same four months.

“It’s clear used car shoppers will no longer pay a premium for electric vehicles and, in fact, consider electric powertrains a detractor, making them less desirable – and valuable – than traditional models,” said Brauer.

Used Gas Car Prices Showing Stability

Demand for used gas cars grew during the new car production shortages brought on by the pandemic. This demand pressure is slowly easing, but with used prices hovering around $31,000 they remain well above pre-pandemic levels.

“Over the past year the average used price for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles has never shifted by more than 7 percent, with most months changing between 3 and 6 percent,” said Karl Brauer. “This is in stark contrast to the 30 to 40 percent drops in used EV pricing.”

Used EV Prices Continue To Crash

The ongoing crash in used electric vehicle prices pulled their values below the average used gas cars in February and shows no sign of stopping.

“While the drop in used EV prices is dramatic, what’s more disconcerting is no indication of used EV values stabilizing,” said Brauer. “At some point used EV prices will have to bottom out, but we don’t appear to be at that point yet.”

EV Models Lead the Drop in Used Car Values

When ranking used cars by the biggest price drops over the past year, electric vehicles take up the first seven slots and make up eight of the top 10 models with the largest drops in pricing.

Methodology

iSeeCars analyzed over 2.2 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in May 2023 and 2024. The average listing prices of each car model were compared between the two time periods, and the differences were expressed as both a percentage difference from the 2023 price as well as a dollar difference. Heavy-duty vehicles, low-volume vehicles, vehicles discontinued as of the 2023 model year, and vehicles in production for fewer than four of the last five model years for each period were excluded from further analysis.

The rapid charging fund (RCF) was first announced in 2020 by Rishi Sunak, then Conservative chancellor, with the aim of supporting upgrades to the grid so that more electric vehicles could be rapidly charged at the same time.
John Lewis, the chief executive of char.gy, which operates on-street chargers, welcomed the £400m pledge.
However, the focus has shifted from rapid chargers, which can allay “range anxiety” on longer journeys, to the slower on-street chargers needed for car owners who do not have private parking spaces.
A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “The rapid charging fund was designed to support the rollout of charging infrastructure on motorways and major A roads – but the previous government did not set out detailed plans to deliver this.","Labour ministers have scrapped a promise by the previous government for a £950m fund for installing electric car chargers near motorways, instead setting aside a smaller sum mainly for on-street charging points.

The rapid charging fund (RCF) was first announced in 2020 by Rishi Sunak, then Conservative chancellor, with the aim of supporting upgrades to the grid so that more electric vehicles could be rapidly charged at the same time.

However, it was mired in delays amid concerns it could unfairly benefit some motorway service companies.

The Department for Transport said the RCF had never formally been included in budget plans, so the promise was unfunded.

The Guardian revealed in March that ministers were considering directing proposed funding away from motorway services amid criticism of the fund’s design from industry.

The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, committed £400m over the next five years “to support the rollout of charging infrastructure” in this month’s spending review, after announcing £200m for charging in the autumn budget. It is understood much of the spending will support on-street charge points in poorer areas, where private-sector investment has lagged behind.

However, some people in the charging industry said the government should have honoured the £950m pledge in full, even if the money was redirected towards other incentives for people to switch to EVs.

John Lewis, the chief executive of char.gy, which operates on-street chargers, welcomed the £400m pledge. However, he said: “The key question now is: couldn’t the full amount have been directed towards the EV effort – whether through the continued rollout of on-street charging or other consumer incentives – to give people greater confidence to make the switch to electric?”

The number of electric car chargers in the UK is rising rapidly, passing 80,000 in May, according to the data company Zap Map. That represented a 29% increase compared with a year earlier, while the number of rapid chargers with power above 50kW rose by a third.

Increasing the number of public chargers is seen as crucial to persuading people to switch to electric cars. However, the focus has shifted from rapid chargers, which can allay “range anxiety” on longer journeys, to the slower on-street chargers needed for car owners who do not have private parking spaces.

Ian Johnston, the chief executive of Osprey Charging, said: “New funding should be more effectively deployed on projects in prime locations where the grid connection costs render the site unviable – whether A roads, underserved regions or the small number of motorway locations with unviable grid – rather than gifted to all motorway sites regardless of the costs, as was envisaged under the RCF.”

Johnston also called for changes to road signage permissions to allow charge points to be easily advertised to drivers.

Quentin Willson, the founder of FairCharge, a group campaigning for cheaper charging, said the full £950m should have been spent on accelerating the switch to electric cars.

“Withholding unused RCF funds and not diverting them towards other EV charging initiatives isn’t a great look for government,” he said. “It opens them to the obvious questions about their commitment to the EV transition.”

Willson, a former presenter of Top Gear, said the government should also cut VAT on public charging to match the lower rates available on home electricity.

A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “The rapid charging fund was designed to support the rollout of charging infrastructure on motorways and major A roads – but the previous government did not set out detailed plans to deliver this.

“Since the fund was announced in 2020, the market has changed significantly, with the number of open-access rapid and ultra-rapid charge points within one mile of the strategic road network almost quadrupling in the last three years alone.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5fb3040d17a8fb58e70942562025b76af0fb878/623_0_4167_3335/master/4167.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6a9c62e7a5d03c6ee2c59080b646e1bd,N,,2025-06-22 16:02:48.016492

So far, the village's federal grants for the solar array haven't been affected, but local leaders know the risk remains.
In rural areas of Alaska, the costs for many goods can be high, as they must be brought in.
Last year, the 19-year old graduated from the academy, where he learned about solar energy.
And soon, solar energy,"" he said.","GALENA, Alaska -- Eric Huntington built his dream cabin nestled in the wilderness of central Alaska, eventually raising two daughters there. But over the years, he learned that living in this quiet, remote village came with a hefty cost.

Every year, the Huntington family spent about $7,000 on diesel to heat the cabin during bone-chilling winters, and a few years back, a power outage at the town's diesel plant left residents freezing in minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit. When power finally returned hours later, water pipes had frozen, leaving about two dozen homes without running water for days.

""We just didn't open our door all morning until the lights came back on,"" said Huntington, a member of the local Louden Tribe.

In Galena, a sprawling village of 400 people on the banks of the Yukon River, a community built around a former military base is shifting to clean energy in an effort to reduce its reliance on expensive, imported diesel. Local leaders say their nearly completed solar farm, along with an existing biomass plant, will boost the town's savings and protect residents from blackouts during extreme weather. The technology has the potential to provide clean backup power in emergencies and improve the power grid's resiliency, all while diversifying the village's energy sources and providing job opportunities for locals.

The projects come at a precarious time for renewable energy transition in the United States. The Trump administration has canceled billions of dollars of clean energy grants in an effort to bolster fossil fuel production, and billions more in investments have been scrapped or delayed this year. So far, the village's federal grants for the solar array haven't been affected, but local leaders know the risk remains. Whatever the future of public funding, the village is an example of how renewable energies can save costs, boost reliability during extreme weather and create jobs.

Once online, the solar array will ensure that the village's power grid has a backup system, said Tim Kalke, general manager of Sustainable Energy for Galena Alaska, a nonprofit that will operate it. So when the power goes out, it doesn't result in tens of thousands of dollars in repairs, he added, and heat is guaranteed in times of extreme cold.

""You're dealing with life, health and safety,"" he said.

In May, dozens of high school students in navy blue caps and gowns stood with nervous excitement in a locker-brimmed hallway, each waiting their turn to walk through yellow tinsel into a packed auditorium. It was graduation day for Galena Interior Learning Academy.

The school's vocational training courses and cultural offerings attract some 200 students annually from across Alaska, boosting the village's population and energy needs.

Students here can take classes on sustainable energy, aviation, carpentry and much more. But in order to keep it running -- especially during long, cold winters -- it needs heat.

That's where the biomass project comes in. Every winter since 2016, trees, mostly paper birch, are locally harvested and shredded into wood chips that fuel a large boiler plant on campus, offsetting about 100,000 gallons of diesel annually for the school district and the city, said Brad Scotton, a Galena City Council member who also serves on SEGA's board. It's notable as one of the state's first large-scale biomass plants and is the most rural, he added.

Cost savings from using biomass has allowed the Galena City School District to hire certified professionals in trade jobs and do upkeep on campus facilities, said district superintendent Jason R. Johnson in an email.

It's also created a local workforce and a job base the village never used to have. ""It's keeping the money that used to go outside within the community and providing pretty meaningful jobs for people,"" Scotton said.

In rural areas of Alaska, the costs for many goods can be high, as they must be brought in. Galena burns just under 400,000 gallons of diesel annually to produce electricity, and an energy price hike around 2008 helped the village realize something needed to change. Scotton remembered when a gallon of diesel was $1.64 and then skyrocketed to $4.58 another year. At that wholesale price, the city was paying more than $1.8 million to keep the lights on.

""It was really quite a shock to everybody's system in terms of trying to operate with those elevated costs,"" said Scotton. ""So that really got the community assessing whether or not we could continue business as usual with that reliance."" That's when they started looking for grants to build a solar array.

On an overcast May day, on a field flanked by boreal forests, workers in reflective safety vests slotted rectangular panels on a metal grid. They were working on the nearly completed 1.5 megawatt solar farm that will connect to a battery system.

Once it's in use, the community will be able to turn off its diesel engines and run on 100% clean, renewable energy on sunny summer days, and any excess power will be battery stored for nights, emergencies or heating the local indoor pool. The solar array will allow them to shut off the diesel operation between 800 to 1,000 hours a year, totaling about 100,000 gallons.

The solar farm won't necessarily lower people's electricity bills. But like the biomass plant, the hope is that it will stabilize energy costs, allowing those savings to go back into the community, all while providing work opportunities for residents like Aaren Sommer.

Last year, the 19-year old graduated from the academy, where he learned about solar energy. Now he's helping to install the solar array. ""That's going to reduce the diesel usage a whole bunch over at the power plant, which is going to help us out,"" he said.

In addition to the solar farm and biomass project, the Louden Tribe is building new energy-efficient homes that will help members be less reliant on diesel. Some of the siding used in the homes comes from wood harvested in the area.

In November, the Huntington family moved into a new, stilted house with a solar-compatible roof, 13-inch walls and 18 inches of insulation to keep the cold at bay. When they lived in the cabin, the $7,000 a year Huntington spent on diesel was a good chunk of his annual income.

The new home's energy-efficient features are already saving them money. The 300-gallon diesel tank Huntington filled before moving cost him about $2,400. Six months later, he still has unused fuel in the tank.

The Huntingtons are one of eight families the tribe has moved into sustainable homes, and they plan to turn over the keys to three more this year.

Kalke, SEGA's general manager, is often asked what Galena produces. He used to just say education.

""But since 2016 you can say education and wood chips. And soon, solar energy,"" he said.

The executive orders direct government agencies to work more efficiently as customers and supporters of new energy technologies. They focus on modernizing how companies license, fuel, and build advanced nuclear power to meet growing energy demand.

Oklo stands out in the nuclear space because it's developing fast fission power plants that can recycle used nuclear material and convert it into clean, reliable power. The company already has an active site use permit from the Department of Energy, making it the only advanced nuclear developer with this approval.

Nuclear fission energy works by splitting atoms to release massive amounts of energy with zero carbon pollution. This technology could change how we power our communities by providing clean, reliable electricity that doesn't depend on weather conditions like solar or wind power.

Nuclear plants can run 24/7 for decades without interruption, providing stable electricity prices that protect homes from volatile energy markets.

Oklo's use of recycled nuclear fuel from old reactors means the company can turn what was once considered waste into clean energy, solving two problems simultaneously.

The company's power plants can use fresh uranium or recycled nuclear material, offering flexibility in fuel sourcing. This diversification reduces dependence on dirty energy while creating a more secure supply chain.

By expanding nuclear energy options, such projects can help reduce reliance on polluting coal and gas plants. Cleaner air means fewer respiratory problems, heart disease cases, and other health issues linked to dirty energy sources.

The executive orders also emphasize using existing domestic nuclear fuel to jump-start early projects and strengthen national energy resilience, which could help the United States become more energy independent while creating good-paying jobs in the clean energy sector.

""These executive orders are about enabling deployment. They show clear alignment around the need to modernize how we license, fuel, and build advanced nuclear power to meet rising demand,"" Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo, said.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Okloimage-reck5tgAhVQ1jyzoz.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 15:03:49.631709

Beyond its value to the grid, hydropower is a direct economic engine for America’s communities.
Hydropower facilities provide local jobs that are often high-paying technical positions, forging long-term career pathways for residents.
Historically, hydropower hasn’t received the same level of federal support as other energy sources, despite its strong track record.
An investment in hydropower is an investment in the future of America’s communities.","As Congress turns its attention to a budget reconciliation bill that could shape the nation’s energy future, it is essential not to overlook one of our most reliable and time-tested sources of baseload electricity: hydropower.

My company has been fortunate to contribute to this critical industry for more than 40 years. But much of the budget reconciliation process in Washington has ignored hydropower. The House-passed bill is missing big opportunities to support this technology. Without continued investment in our hydroelectric infrastructure, we could face dire consequences.

Our nation is currently focused on increasing domestic energy output, supporting technological innovation and creating jobs. Hydropower offers a compelling and often underappreciated value proposition. It is a foundation for emission-free grid reliability, economic development, job creation and energy independence.

Unlike other renewable sources of electricity, hydropower delivers energy around the clock, making it an essential source of baseload power. Without hydropower’s steady and reliable output, keeping the grid stable would become much harder and more expensive. Those rising costs don’t disappear; they ultimately show up in consumers’ energy bills.

What’s more, hydropower’s flexibility allows it to ramp up quickly when demand spikes or when intermittent renewables like wind and solar dip unexpectedly. It’s one of the few energy sources that can respond to grid needs in seconds. This makes it a vital partner in a grid increasingly dominated by variable demand and resources.

Beyond its value to the grid, hydropower is a direct economic engine for America’s communities. Hydropower facilities provide local jobs that are often high-paying technical positions, forging long-term career pathways for residents.

Many hydropower projects also create and maintain reservoirs and waterways that support flood protection, agriculture, water storage, tourism, fishing, and outdoor recreation, contributing millions of dollars annually to local economies. In our decades of work in this field, we have seen these benefits drive prosperity for generations.

Historically, hydropower hasn’t received the same level of federal support as other energy sources, despite its strong track record. That needs to change. Through the reconciliation process, Congress has a pivotal chance to correct that imbalance and invest in one of our most dependable forms of U.S. energy.

The bill text just released by the Senate is a step in the right direction, but there remains a host of critical priorities to strengthen our hydropower resources, such as extending the investment tax credits to dam safety and environmental upgrades at existing facilities and streamlining licensing and relicensing processes.

America’s hydropower fleet is aging, — most facilities are more than 65 years old. This longevity is a testament to hydropower’s durability and value, but it also signals an urgent need for reinvestment. We see this firsthand as we work to repair aging and deteriorated dam structures.

These facilities have the potential to serve our communities for decades to come as “forever assets,” but only if we modernize them. This requires updated tax incentives, streamlined licensing processes and policies that reflect the crucial role of hydropower in our energy mix.

If we let these critical assets deteriorate, the costs will fall directly onto consumers in the form of higher rates and lost services. We cannot let that happen. It is imperative that we act now.

This is a defining moment. The next four years in Washington will be decisive for hydropower, as about 40 percent of the non-federal fleet is facing license expiration in the next decade. Many facilities could voluntarily shut down if the support they need isn’t there.

If hydropower isn’t fully valued, our communities will pay the price with higher bills, fewer jobs and a less stable grid. I strongly urge lawmakers in Washington, D.C., to back hydropower and value it in the current budget bill and future legislative efforts. An investment in hydropower is an investment in the future of America’s communities.

(CNN) — Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Greener newsletter. Our limited newsletter series guides you on how to minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety.

Whether it’s answering work emails or drafting wedding vows, generative artificial intelligence tools have become a trusty copilot in many people’s lives. But a growing body of research shows that for every problem AI solves, hidden environmental costs are racking up.

Each word in an AI prompt is broken down into clusters of numbers called “token IDs” and sent to massive data centers — some larger than football fields — powered by coal or natural gas plants. There, stacks of large computers generate responses through dozens of rapid calculations.

The whole process can take up to 10 times more energy to complete than a regular Google search, according to a frequently cited estimation by the Electric Power Research Institute.

So, for each prompt you give AI, what’s the damage? To find out, researchers in Germany tested 14 large language model (LLM) AI systems by asking them both free-response and multiple-choice questions. Complex questions produced up to six times more carbon dioxide emissions than questions with concise answers.

In addition, “smarter” LLMs with more reasoning abilities produced up to 50 times more carbon emissions than simpler systems to answer the same question, the study reported.

“This shows us the tradeoff between energy consumption and the accuracy of model performance,” said Maximilian Dauner, a doctoral student at Hochschule München University of Applied Sciences and first author of the Frontiers in Communication study published Wednesday.

Typically, these smarter, more energy intensive LLMs have tens of billions more parameters — the biases used for processing token IDs — than smaller, more concise models.

“You can think of it like a neural network in the brain. The more neuron connections, the more thinking you can do to answer a question,” Dauner said.

What you can do to reduce your carbon footprint

Complex questions require more energy in part because of the lengthy explanations many AI models are trained to provide, Dauner said. If you ask an AI chatbot to solve an algebra question for you, it may take you through the steps it took to find the answer, he said.

“AI expends a lot of energy being polite, especially if the user is polite, saying ‘please’ and ‘thank you,’” Dauner explained. “But this just makes their responses even longer, expending more energy to generate each word.”

For this reason, Dauner suggests users be more straightforward when communicating with AI models. Specify the length of the answer you want and limit it to one or two sentences, or say you don’t need an explanation at all.

Most important, Dauner’s study highlights that not all AI models are created equally, said Sasha Luccioni, the climate lead at AI company Hugging Face, in an email. Users looking to reduce their carbon footprint can be more intentional about which model they chose for which task.

“Task-specific models are often much smaller and more efficient, and just as good at any context-specific task,” Luccioni explained.

If you are a software engineer who solves complex coding problems every day, an AI model suited for coding may be necessary. But for the average high school student who wants help with homework, relying on powerful AI tools is like using a nuclear-powered digital calculator.

Even within the same AI company, different model offerings can vary in their reasoning power, so research what capabilities best suit your needs, Dauner said.

When possible, Luccioni recommends going back to basic sources — online encyclopedias and phone calculators — to accomplish simple tasks.

Why it’s hard to measure AI’s environmental impact

Putting a number on the environmental impact of AI has proved challenging.

The study noted that energy consumption can vary based on the user’s proximity to local energy grids and the hardware used to run AI models.

That’s partly why the researchers chose to represent carbon emissions within a range, Dauner said.

Furthermore, many AI companies don’t share information about their energy consumption — or details like server size or optimization techniques that could help researchers estimate energy consumption, said Shaolei Ren, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Riverside who studies AI’s water consumption.

“You can’t really say AI consumes this much energy or water on average — that’s just not meaningful. We need to look at each individual model and then (examine what it uses) for each task,” Ren said.

One way AI companies could be more transparent is by disclosing the amount of carbon emissions associated with each prompt, Dauner suggested.

“Generally, if people were more informed about the average (environmental) cost of generating a response, people would maybe start thinking, ‘Is it really necessary to turn myself into an action figure just because I’m bored?’ Or ‘do I have to tell ChatGPT jokes because I have nothing to do?’” Dauner said.

Additionally, as more companies push to add generative AI tools to their systems, people may not have much choice how or when they use the technology, Luccioni said.

“We don’t need generative AI in web search. Nobody asked for AI chatbots in (messaging apps) or on social media,” Luccioni said. “This race to stuff them into every single existing technology is truly infuriating, since it comes with real consequences to our planet.”

With less available information about AI’s resource usage, consumers have less choice, Ren said, adding that regulatory pressures for more transparency are unlikely to the United States anytime soon. Instead, the best hope for more energy-efficient AI may lie in the cost efficacy of using less energy.

“Overall, I’m still positive about (the future). There are many software engineers working hard to improve resource efficiency,” Ren said. “Other industries consume a lot of energy too, but it’s not a reason to suggest AI’s environmental impact is not a problem. We should definitely pay attention.”",https://kvia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWM1YmtjMnowMDFiM2o2bndhZDM3OHA2-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtYzViZzM0bzAwdGwyN3FlaDludmhueHk.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 15:04:01.166503

The study analyzed over 2.2 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in May 2023 and 2024 and found that the average used EV price is down 29.5 percent year-over-year versus 6.1 percent for the average used gas car price. In May 2024, the average used electric vehicle was priced at $28,767, or 8.3 percent below the average gas car at $31,424. These prices show a major turnaround from a year ago, when the average used EV cost $40,783 and the average used gas car cost $33,469.

Used Electric Vehicle Market Crashing

“There’s no denying the crash in used electric vehicle values over the past year,” said Karl Brauer, Executive Analyst at iSeeCars. “We’ve watched EVs prices fall between 30 and 40 percent since June of last year, while the average gas car’s price has dropped by just 3 to 7 percent in that same timeframe.”

While electric vehicle values appeared to stabilize at the end of 2023, they experienced a substantial drop in February this year and have continued to decline over the past four months. At the same time, the average used gas car price has shifted by approximately $400 during those same four months.

“It’s clear used car shoppers will no longer pay a premium for electric vehicles and, in fact, consider electric powertrains a detractor, making them less desirable – and valuable – than traditional models,” said Brauer.

Used Gas Car Prices Showing Stability

Demand for used gas cars grew during the new car production shortages brought on by the pandemic. This demand pressure is slowly easing, but with used prices hovering around $31,000 they remain well above pre-pandemic levels.

“Over the past year the average used price for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles has never shifted by more than 7 percent, with most months changing between 3 and 6 percent,” said Karl Brauer. “This is in stark contrast to the 30 to 40 percent drops in used EV pricing.”

Used EV Prices Continue To Crash

The ongoing crash in used electric vehicle prices pulled their values below the average used gas cars in February and shows no sign of stopping.

“While the drop in used EV prices is dramatic, what’s more disconcerting is no indication of used EV values stabilizing,” said Brauer. “At some point used EV prices will have to bottom out, but we don’t appear to be at that point yet.”

The 70% Solution: How 156 Residents Are Redefining Rural Energy Furner’s solar statistics are staggering.","I’m standing at the edge of a tiny South Australian farming community where roof after roof glistens with solar panels. On this crisp winter morning, Furner—population 156—seems unremarkable at first glance. But I’ve just discovered Australia’s unlikely renewable energy champion. With 45 solar systems per 100 dwellings, this microscopic agricultural settlement is silently outperforming Adelaide’s trendy eco-suburbs in green energy adoption.

My rental car thermometer reads 8°C as I navigate the empty streets, exactly 337 kilometers southeast of Adelaide. What brought me to this dot on the map? A tip from a regional energy consultant who called Furner “Australia’s most surprising solar success story.” He wasn’t exaggerating.

The 70% Solution: How 156 Residents Are Redefining Rural Energy

Furner’s solar statistics are staggering. That 45 systems per 100 dwellings translates to roughly 70% of all homes generating their own power—far exceeding Australia’s national average of about 30%. For context, this achievement would be remarkable in a major city with sustainability initiatives, let alone a farming community established in 1896.

“We’re practical people,” explains a sunburned farmer as we chat outside the Furner Community Hall. “Solar just makes sense when you’re this far from everything.” His pragmatism echoes throughout the community.

Unlike Queensland’s rapidly growing regions that attract headlines for population booms, Furner’s revolution is quieter. The town sits at approximately 65 meters elevation in the Limestone Coast region, where agricultural production—beef, wool, lamb, blue gums, and native flowers—has been the economic backbone since 1847.

What’s most striking is how this transition happened without fanfare. No government showcases. No sustainability awards. Just a community quietly adapting to changing energy landscapes while maintaining deep agricultural roots.

South Australia’s Rural Innovation Versus Urban Adoption

When comparing Furner to Adelaide’s eco-conscious neighborhoods, the contrast is striking. While urban sustainability often comes with architectural showcases and technology demonstrations, Furner’s approach is understated yet more comprehensive.

“We visited expecting rural Australia. We found tomorrow’s energy community instead. It’s like they’ve solved problems the cities are still debating.”

Unlike Tasmania’s unique coastal experiences that blend tourism with conservation, Furner offers no packaged experiences. What you see is authentic rural ingenuity—solar panels on weathered farmhouses, water management systems supporting intensive agriculture, and a community hall that doubles as an emergency shelter powered entirely by renewable energy.

This winter morning reveals another advantage: even with June’s limited sunlight, the systems produce enough energy for basic needs. Similar to America’s emerging rural stargazing destinations, Furner benefits from minimal light pollution, creating potential for astronomy-focused sustainable tourism.

What Guidebooks Won’t Tell You About Furner

Access Furner via Princes Highway, turning onto Furner Road. Park anywhere—space isn’t an issue in a town of 156. Visit during late morning when solar production peaks and locals are most receptive to conversations about their energy systems.

The Ken Stuckey Arboretum offers a peaceful walking trail through native vegetation. Geocaching enthusiasts will find hidden caches throughout the reserve—an unexpected treasure-hunting opportunity.

For accommodation, unlike massive innovative community developments, Furner offers no hotels. Stay in Millicent (25km west) or arrange farmstays through regional tourism offices.

By 2026, as 2025 sustainable tourism trends evolve, Furner could become a case study in rural energy transformation. Visit now before educational eco-tourism puts this hidden gem on the map.

As I prepare to leave, watching morning sun intensify on solar panels across town, I’m reminded that Australia’s energy future may not be designed in corporate boardrooms but in places like Furner—where necessity, practicality and community spirit have created what policy alone could not. Sarah would call it “accidental brilliance”—the kind of unplanned perfection that makes travel journalism endlessly rewarding.",https://www.journee-mondiale.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-06-22-21-27-20_.webp,N,,2025-06-22 16:03:05.297716

Is it China’s fault that Europe and especially the US have weaker, less persistent policies telling the auto industry that it’s time to move to EVs?
The Germany government has heavily supported the German auto industry, the French government the French auto industry, the Italian government the Italian auto industry….
If big Chinese automakers do get into financial trouble, will the Chinese government bail them out?
The vision is there, the vision is good, and the vision is being implemented.","Last Updated on:

There are a couple of claims about China and its car industry that are quite common and aim to discredit what Chinese automakers have been achieving in the EV world. Overall, the idea is that EV producers get too much government support. However, there are a couple of things to note about this that a commenter recently pointed out in an insightful comment on CleanTechnica.

First of all, a key is really the consistency of China’s long-term vision to transition to EVs. China has had quite a consistent and predictable drive in its long-term goal of phasing out polluting gas cars. It has used various carrots and sticks in that regard. That’s a positive thing. Europe has been similar, but has had a little more auto industry influence trying to slow down or effectively slowing down pro-EV policies. The US has been like a slow, old, half-broken train trying to get somewhere with its EV policies. When Democrats have had power, they’ve gotten almost half-decent policies through. When Republicans have been in power, they’ve pulled those back a bit. Is it China’s fault that Europe and especially the US have weaker, less persistent policies telling the auto industry that it’s time to move to EVs? Is it a problem that China is consistent and doesn’t give in to legacy automakers and back down on its vision?

Before I get to the second point, I’ll include that reader comment, from “fsc,” here in full:

“The evil Chinese government is helping the companies out-competing the very corporations that the Holy US Government ILLEGALLY bailed out from bankruptcy! Let’s punish China for interfering in the market!

“My hypocrisy meter goes red on this whole theme about how it is China’s fault that they have an industrial policy and the US does not. IMHO: it is the opposite. We failed to adapt to changing technology and consumer desires and are getting our lunch eaten for our corporate short-sightedness.

“This is 1980’s Japanese car crisis 2.0

“When the oil crisis hit, Americans wanted small cars and Detroit refused to make them. ‘Big cars, big profits. Small cars, small profits’ Henry Ford III once said. They dragged their feet as the market evolved and got hit by their arrogance. I am old enough to remember the bumper stickers: ‘No job? Eat your Toyota.’ People were really pissed-off at Japan while they were making a killing in showrooms despite the hatred.

“Now that the world demands EVs, we are seeing a news rerun of the 1980s. Just substitute BYD for Toyota, and the US market for the world.

“‘Those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it.’ George Santayana”

The second point here is about the bailouts. The US has interfered in the market significantly by bailing out its legacy automakers when the were in crisis. The Germany government has heavily supported the German auto industry, the French government the French auto industry, the Italian government the Italian auto industry….

I’ve actually been surprised at times at how willing China has been to let giant companies collapse and go bankrupt. In particular, I was surprised to see this in the solar industry, but it has been the case in other industries as well. If big Chinese automakers do get into financial trouble, will the Chinese government bail them out? I wouldn’t bet on it, actually. There are plenty of highly competitive automakers, and I assume the government would let the market play out and let the best companies win. The Chinese government seems very keen on having intense competition and then letting the market pick winners and losers. It seems that the government is much less under the thumb of mega-corporations than governments in the West.

Of course, some may see that as a problem — the government having too much power. But in this case, in the auto industry, having a strong government that is not pushed around by slow-moving legacy automakers appears to be a definite plus that leads to more competitive companies, a more competitive industry, and faster innovation and growth. The Chinese government is not letting itself be dragged back or slowed down by excessive corporate influence. The vision is there, the vision is good, and the vision is being implemented.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/BYD-dealership-Philippines.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 13:08:40.816743

Thus, we have be­fore us two EPA actions — EPA’s disapprovals of the Okla­homa and Utah SIPs.
“These two disapprovals are undisputedly locally or re­gionally applicable actions.
A SIP is a state-specific plan, so an EPA disapproval on its face applies only to the State that proposed the SIP.
As I explain in today’s companion case [EPA v. Calumet Shreveport Refining], however, the Court and I arrive at that conclusion by different paths.”","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s denial of air quality implementation plans submitted by Oklahoma and Utah in response to the Clean Air Act‘s “good neighbor” provision are subject to review in the regional circuit court of appeals rather than the D.C. Circuit, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in reversing a decision from the 10th Circuit.

The Clean Air Act provides that challenges to EPA actions are heard within the regional circuit when the case is “locally or regionally applicable” and in the D. C. Circuit if the disputed actions are “nationally applicable.” The CAA also contains an exception under 42 U. S. C. §7607(b)(1) for certain “locally or regionally applicable” actions “based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect,” which also must be brought in the D. C. Circuit.

In 2015, EPA revised the national ambient air quality standards for ozone, prompting states to file implementation plans detailing how they would comply with the new standards in accordance with the CAA’s “Good Neighbor” provision. In this regard, the CAA requires “state implementation plans” include “adequate” provisions” to prevent in-state emissions activity that would interfere the air quality compliance efforts of other states.

In the case before the court, Oklahoma and Utah were among the 21 states that had their SIPs denied by the EPA.

The 10th Circuit transferred to the D.C. Circuit challenges to SIP denials brought by Oklahoma and Utah.

In deciding the case, the majority applied the interpretation of §7607(b)(1) outlined in another environmental case decided the same day, EPA v. Calumet Shreveport Refining.

Click here to read the full text of the June 18 decision in Oklahoma v. EPA.

BULLET POINTS: “EPA undertakes SIP disapprovals pursuant to the same CAA authority underlying its SIP approvals. Namely, §7410 directs ‘[e]ach State’ to ‘adopt and submit [to EPA] … a plan’ for [national ambient air quality standards] implementation, and in turn directs EPA to either ‘approve such submittal’ or ‘disapprove’ it. Thus, EPA’s approvals and disapprovals are opposite sides of the same coin. As §7410’s SIP-specific focus makes clear, and §7607(b)(1)’s enumeration confirms, the CAA treats both individual SIP approvals and individ­ual SIP disapprovals as discrete actions. Thus, we have be­fore us two EPA actions — EPA’s disapprovals of the Okla­homa and Utah SIPs.

“These two disapprovals are undisputedly locally or re­gionally applicable actions. A SIP is a state-specific plan, so an EPA disapproval on its face applies only to the State that proposed the SIP. And, the CAA recognizes this lim­ited scope in enumerating a SIP approval as a locally or re­gionally applicable action. §7607(b)(1). If anything, EPA’s decision on an individual SIP ‘is the prototypical “locally or regionally applicable” action,’ as courts have recognized and even EPA acknowledges.”

Circuit, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in reversing a decision from the 10th Circuit.

The Clean Air Act provides that challenges to EPA actions are heard within the regional circuit when the case is “locally or regionally applicable” and in the D. C. Circuit if the disputed actions are “nationally applicable.” The CAA also contains an exception under 42 U. S. C. §7607(b)(1) for certain “locally or regionally applicable” actions “based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect,” which also must be brought in the D. C. Circuit.

In 2015, EPA revised the national ambient air quality standards for ozone, prompting states to file implementation plans detailing how they would comply with the new standards in accordance with the CAA’s “Good Neighbor” provision. In this regard, the CAA requires “state implementation plans” include “adequate” provisions” to prevent in-state emissions activity that would interfere the air quality compliance efforts of other states.

In the case before the court, Oklahoma and Utah were among the 21 states that had their SIPs denied by the EPA.

The 10th Circuit transferred to the D.C. Circuit challenges to SIP denials brought by Oklahoma and Utah.

In deciding the case, the majority applied the interpretation of §7607(b)(1) outlined in another environmental case decided the same day, EPA v. Calumet Shreveport Refining.

Click here to read the full text of the June 18 decision in Oklahoma v. EPA.

BULLET POINTS: “EPA undertakes SIP disapprovals pursuant to the same CAA authority underlying its SIP approvals. Namely, §7410 directs ‘[e]ach State’ to ‘adopt and submit [to EPA] … a plan’ for [national ambient air quality standards] implementation, and in turn directs EPA to either ‘approve such submittal’ or ‘disapprove’ it. Thus, EPA’s approvals and disapprovals are opposite sides of the same coin. As §7410’s SIP-specific focus makes clear, and §7607(b)(1)’s enumeration confirms, the CAA treats both individual SIP approvals and individ­ual SIP disapprovals as discrete actions. Thus, we have be­fore us two EPA actions — EPA’s disapprovals of the Okla­homa and Utah SIPs.

“These two disapprovals are undisputedly locally or re­gionally applicable actions. A SIP is a state-specific plan, so an EPA disapproval on its face applies only to the State that proposed the SIP. And, the CAA recognizes this lim­ited scope in enumerating a SIP approval as a locally or re­gionally applicable action. §7607(b)(1). If anything, EPA’s decision on an individual SIP ‘is the prototypical “locally or regionally applicable” action,’ as courts have recognized and even EPA acknowledges.”

The former environment minister said 60 scientists from reputed institutions from across the world, including two from India, have just published their third annual update of indicators of global climate change.

Ramesh noted it is a comprehensive analysis.

“There is a faint signal of hope in the update in that the rate of increase in carbon dioxide emissions over the last decade has slowed compared to the 2000s. But global mean sea-level rise continues to accelerate,” Ramesh said on X, citing the analysis.

“The earth’s energy imbalance, which represents the difference between the radiative forces acting to warm the climate on the one hand and to oppose the warming on the other, has increased significantly,” he said.

Most worryingly continued emissions of all greenhouse gases at current levels would cause human-induced global warming to reach the critical 1.5 degrees Celsius in about five years, Ramesh said.

The present policies of the US could well advance this tipping point, he said and added that already 2024 was the hottest year on record.

A year later, he promised to deliver them the next year, but that didn’t happen either.

Despite the empty pledges the promises kept coming. Last year in January, Musk said, “Next year for sure, we’ll have over a million robotaxis.”

Would you settle for 10 or 12?

Musk appears to be on the verge of making his robotaxi vision a reality with a test run of a small squad of self-driving cabs in Austin, Texas, starting Sunday. Reaching a million may take a year or more, however, although the billionaire should be able to expand the service this year if the Austin demo is a success.

The stakes couldn’t be higher, nor the challenges.

While Musk was making those “next year” promises, rival Waymo was busy deploying driverless taxis in Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and other cities by using a different technology that allowed it to get to market faster. It just completed its 10 millionth paid ride.

Boycotts related to Musk’s politics have tanked Tesla’s sales. Rival electric vehicle makers with newly competitive models have stolen market share. And investors are on edge after a $150 billion stock wipeout when Musk picked a social media fight with a U.S. president overseeing federal car regulators who could make the robotaxi rollout much more difficult. The stock has recovered somewhat after Musk said he regretted some of his remarks.

Tesla shareholders have stood by Musk over the years because he’s defied the odds by building a successful standalone electric vehicle company — self-driving car promises aside — and making them a lot of money in the process. A decade ago, Tesla shares traded for around $18. The shares closed Friday at $322.

Musk says the Austin test will begin modestly enough, with just 10 or 12 vehicles picking up passengers in a limited area. But then it will quickly ramp up and spread to other cities, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands if not a million vehicles next year.

Some Musk watchers on Wall Street are skeptical.

“How quickly can he expand the fleet?” asks Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA. “We’re talking maybe a dozen vehicles initially. It’s very small.”

Morningstar’s Seth Goldstein says Musk is being classic Musk: Promising too much, too quickly.

“When anyone in Austin can download the app and use a robotaxi, that will be a success, but I don’t think that will happen until 2028,” he says. “Testing is going to take a while.”

Musk’s tendency to push up the stock high with a bit of hyperbole is well known among investors.

In 2018, he told Tesla stockholders he had “funding secured” to buy all their shares at a massive premium and take the company private. But he not only lacked a written commitment from financiers, according to federal stock regulators who fined him, he hadn’t discussed the loan amount or other details with them.

More recently, Musk told CNBC in May that Tesla was experiencing a “major rebound” in demand. A week later an auto trade group in Europe announced sales had plunged by half.

Musk has come under fire for allegedly exaggerating the ability of the system used for its cars to drive themselves, starting with the name. Full Self-Driving is a misnomer. The system still requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road because they may need to intervene and take control at any moment.

Federal highway safety regulators opened an investigation into FSD last year after several accidents, and the Department of Justice has conducted its own probe, though the status of that is not known. Tesla has also faced lawsuits over the feature, some resulting in settlements, other dismissed. In one case, a judge ruled against the plaintiffs but only because they hadn’t proved Musk “knowingly” made false statements.

Musk says the robotaxis will be running on an improved version of Full Self-Driving and the cabs will be safe.

He also says the service will be able to expand rapidly around the country. His secret weapon: Millions of Tesla owners now on the roads. He says an over-the-air software update will soon allow them to turn their cars into driverless cabs and start a side business while stuck at the office for eight hours or on vacation for a week.

“Instead of having your car sit in the parking lot, your car could be earning money,” Musk said earlier this year, calling it an Airbnb model for cars. “You will be able to add or subtract your car to the fleet.”

Musk says Tesla also can move fast to deploy taxis now because of his decision to rely only on cameras for the cars to navigate, unlike Waymo, which has gone a more expensive route by supplementing its cameras with lasers and radar.

“Tesla will have, I don’t know,” Musk mused in an conference call with investors, ”99% market share or something ridiculous.” Given Waymo’s head start and potential competition from Amazon and others, dominating the driverless market to that extent could be a reach.

But Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst and big Musk fan, says this time Musk may actually pull it off because of Tesla’s ability to scale up quickly. And even skeptics like Morningstar’s Goldstein acknowledge that Musk occasionally does gets things right, and spectacularly so.

He upended the car industry by getting people to buy expensive electric vehicles, brought his Starlink satellite internet service to rural areas and, more recently, performed a gee-whiz trick of landing an unmanned SpaceX rocket on a platform back on earth.

Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles employ a method known as reverse electrolysis.
In theory, that would be the easiest way to power a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, but as we mentioned, many of them use reverse electrolysis instead.
Speaking of which, the fuel economy of a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is twice that of standard gasoline engines.
Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles may give you more fuel economy, but no one knows the kind of maintenance they will need or how much it will cost.","Ah, alternative fuels. Aren't they the best? It all started with a hybrid car, which led to plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and now battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) are dominating the scene. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are also possible these days. The how is pretty scientific, but we can break it down easily. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles employ a method known as reverse electrolysis. They're a great alternative to gasoline-powered vehicles, especially since they emit zero carbon dioxide emissions, except for some water coming out of the tailpipe. And we don't recommend you drink it.

Anyone who has taken chemistry in high school knows that the elements that make up water are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. With a little electricity, we can split up the atoms, and voila! In theory, that would be the easiest way to power a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, but as we mentioned, many of them use reverse electrolysis instead. This is the process of introducing hydrogen to water in a fuel-cell stack. When they combine, they produce the electricity that turns the wheels. However, surely, there must be some cons to a vehicle filled with a highly combustible gas, right?

Let's talk about the good first. They're quiet, smooth, and can drive laps around the standard BEV, only needing five minutes to refuel. Speaking of which, the fuel economy of a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is twice that of standard gasoline engines. As we mentioned, the energy comes from hydrogen and oxygen, both of which are clearly abundant, meaning the fuel for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles comes from a renewable energy source we may never run out of.

Let's look at the opposites. It may only take five minutes to refuel, but have you seen a hydrogen fueling station? The infrastructure to build them is pretty limited, and so far, they're only in California. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles may give you more fuel economy, but no one knows the kind of maintenance they will need or how much it will cost. And if your fuel cell blows, it's going to be a costly replacement, so there goes all the money you could potentially save on gasoline.

Plus, there are obvious safety concerns over the flammability of hydrogen, which President Trump keeps claiming. H2O may be a renewable energy source, but the current hydrogen used to power hydrogen fuel cell vehicles is a nonrenewable natural gas that actually creates enormous CO2 emissions. It's a catch 22, over here. Thankfully, Kia is working on green hydrogen to turn that around with carbon neutrality.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/are-hydrogen-fuel-cars-worth-it-the-pros-cons-explained/l-intro-1749735043.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 12:16:16.723980

Banks funding fossil fuels haven’t lost their way—they’ve just stopped pretending.

What global banks are doing right now isn’t a reversal of climate commitments—it’s a long-overdue reality check. In 2024, they dumped nearly $900 billion into fossil fuel financing, according to the latest “Banking on Climate Chaos” report. And while advocacy groups are clutching their pearls, investors are quietly nodding.

Banks funding fossil fuels haven’t lost their way—they’ve just stopped pretending.

JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Barclays topped the charts, each tacking on over $10 billion in new fossil-fuel financing. JPM alone dropped $53.5 billion into oil, gas, and coal. That’s not exactly chump change—and it’s certainly not the behavior of an institution planning to kick the hydrocarbon habit anytime soon.

Critics say this undermines climate targets. The reality? These banks were never designed to hit climate targets. Their mandate is to maximize returns. And with interest rates stabilizing, oil prices firming, and energy demand still rising globally, fossil fuel investments—messy, profitable, scalable—are back in vogue.

Yes, some of these banks made splashy commitments during the ESG boom. They joined net-zero alliances. They funded glossy sustainability reports. But those were branding exercises, not binding strategies. The minute those commitments became a regulatory liability—or a political punchline—they started dissolving. Exhibit A: the exodus from the UN-sponsored Net-Zero Banking Alliance, timed nicely with President Trump’s return to office.

“This reversal exemplifies the limits of voluntary commitments by financial firms whose primary goal is short-term profit,” the report complains. That’s the closest the report comes to admitting the obvious: voluntary green finance was always a shaky foundation for decarbonization.

Related: Texas Oil Family to Benefit From Potential $8-Billion Mitsubishi Deal

In fact, the Banking on Climate Chaos report makes that plain: banks committed $869 billion to fossil fuel companies in 2024 alone—up $162 billion from the year before. Nearly half of that financing came from U.S.-based banks, with JPMorgan Chase leading at $53.5 billion, followed by Bank of America ($46 billion) and Citigroup ($44.7 billion). Barclays was the top fossil fuel financier in Europe at $35.4 billion. Meanwhile, over $347 billion went to the top 100 companies actively expanding their fossil fuel operations.

For a supposedly dying industry, fossil fuels are drawing a staggering amount of capital.

It’s not lost on anyone that some of the same banks being scolded for fossil fuel financing are still pouring money into renewables and climate tech. But here’s the thing: they’re not missionaries—they’re market players. And right now, oil and gas projects are delivering stable returns, while clean tech continues to wrestle with cost overruns, supply chain headaches, and policy volatility.

Banks are not public policy arms. They’re capital allocators. And right now, capital is flowing toward fossil fuels for one simple reason: the energy transition isn’t happening fast enough to make renewables the better bet.

There’s also the regulatory vacuum to consider. As long as no one is forcing banks to price in climate risk with real teeth, voluntary initiatives will keep folding under pressure. A report can scold them all it wants—until there’s a law on the books or a tax on the balance sheet, banks will do what they’ve always done: follow the money.

What’s more, climate advocacy itself has lost coherence. The same groups that demand banks stop lending to fossil fuels often oppose mining permits for the metals and minerals needed for clean tech. That contradiction hasn’t gone unnoticed in boardrooms. Banks, to their credit, have at least picked a lane: they’ll fund what actually gets built.

And for now, what’s getting built—at scale, at speed, and at profit—is still largely oil and gas. As long as energy security, inflation, and political volatility remain unresolved, fossil fuels will continue to look like the safer bet. Not morally. But financially.

So yes, banks are still backing fossil fuels. And yes, they’re still issuing climate reports. But no, they’re not confused. They’re just honest—at least in their balance sheets. The climate movement may not like it, but until the economics change or the regulations bite, this isn’t a scandal. It’s a strategy. And for now, it seems to be working.

The two financial facilities are expected to help subsidise 429,127 cookstoves across the three countries, although the specific stove models were not disclosed.

While Burn already operates in DRC and Mozambique, this marks its entry into the Zambian market, supplying Kenyan-made stoves designed to be more energy-efficient than traditional cookstoves. The company also has a presence in Tanzania, Somalia, Ghana, and Nigeria.

The firm’s business model hinges on selling carbon credits –earned by the reduction of carbon emissions through the use of its energy-saving stoves – and using the proceeds to subsidise product prices and promote uptake, especially among low-income households.

A carbon credit represents a certificate for avoiding the emission of one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent. These credits can be sold to companies looking to offset their own greenhouse gas emissions.

This is the first time Burn is taking a loan to be repaid through future carbon credit revenues, marking a shift in its financing model. But CEO Peter Scott said the company expects to pursue more such arrangements in the near future.

“Burn is confident that this will be the first of many such deals with TDB and similar institutions,” he said following the signing in Cape Town.

TDB, the financial arm of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa), primarily funds trade and infrastructure projects for public and private entities across the region.

This financing is part of a broader partnership with the World Bank to accelerate access to clean energy across Africa through a mix of debt, grants, and equity directed at small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector.

The move also aligns with the Mission300 initiative – launched by the World Bank and the African Development Bank (AfDB) in January – which aims to connect 300 million Africans to modern, affordable, and clean energy by 2030.",https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/resource/image/5041360/landscape_ratio3x2/1200/800/fb06343c65ac676c979483b0d9990cca/to/peter.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 13:07:44.466935

Scientists say crossing that limit would mean worse heat waves and droughts, bigger storms and sea-level rise that could imperil small island nations.

Humans are on track to release so much greenhouse gas in less than three years that a key threshold for limiting global warming will be nearly unavoidable, according to a study to be released Thursday.

The report predicts that society will have emitted enough carbon dioxide by early 2028 that crossing an important long-term temperature boundary will be more likely than not. The scientists calculate that by that point there will be enough of the heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere to create a 50-50 chance or greater that the world will be locked in to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of long-term warming since preindustrial times. That level of gas accumulation, which comes from the burning of fuels like gasoline, oil and coal, is sooner than the same group of 60 international scientists calculated in a study last year.

“Things aren’t just getting worse. They’re getting worse faster,” said study co-author Zeke Hausfather of the tech firm Stripe and the climate monitoring group Berkeley Earth. “We’re actively moving in the wrong direction in a critical period of time that we would need to meet our most ambitious climate goals. Some reports, there’s a silver lining. I don’t think there really is one in this one.”

That 1.5 goal, first set in the 2015 Paris agreement, has been a cornerstone of international efforts to curb worsening climate change. Scientists say crossing that limit would mean worse heat waves and droughts, bigger storms and sea-level rise that could imperil small island nations. Over the last 150 years, scientists have established a direct correlation between the release of certain levels of carbon dioxide, along with other greenhouse gases like methane, and specific increases in global temperatures.

In last Thursday’s Indicators of Global Climate Change report, researchers calculated that society can spew only 143 billion more tons (130 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide before the 1.5 limit becomes technically inevitable. The world is producing 46 billion tons (42 billion metric tons) a year, so that inevitability should hit around February 2028 because the report is measured from the start of this year, the scientists wrote. The world now stands at about 1.24 degrees Celsius (2.23 degrees Fahrenheit) of long-term warming since preindustrial times, the report said.

Earth’s energy imbalance

The report, which was published in the journal Earth System Science Data, shows that the rate of human-caused warming per decade has increased to nearly half a degree (0.27 degrees Celsius) per decade, Hausfather said. And the imbalance between the heat Earth absorbs from the sun and the amount it radiates out to space, a key climate change signal, is accelerating, the report said.

“It’s quite a depressing picture unfortunately, where if you look across the indicators, we find that records are really being broken everywhere,” said lead author Piers Forster, director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures at the University of Leeds in England. “I can’t conceive of a situation where we can really avoid passing 1.5 degrees of very long-term temperature change.”

The increase in emissions from fossil-fuel burning is the main driver. But reduced particle pollution, which includes soot and smog, is another factor because those particles had a cooling effect that masked even more warming from appearing, scientists said. Changes in clouds also factor in. That all shows up in Earth’s energy imbalance, which is now 25 per cent higher than it was just a decade or so ago, Forster said.

Earth’s energy imbalance “is the most important measure of the amount of heat being trapped in the system,” Hausfather said.

Earth keeps absorbing more and more heat than it releases. “It is very clearly accelerating. It’s worrisome,” he said.

Crossing the temperature limit

The planet temporarily passed the key 1.5 limit last year. The world hit 1.52 degrees Celsius (2.74 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since preindustrial times for an entire year in 2024, but the Paris threshold is meant to be measured over a longer period, usually considered 20 years. Still, the globe could reach that long-term threshold in the next few years even if individual years haven’t consistently hit that mark, because of how the Earth’s carbon cycle works.

That 1.5 is “a clear limit, a political limit for which countries have decided that beyond which the impact of climate change would be unacceptable to their societies”, said study co-author Joeri Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial College London.

The mark is so important because once it is crossed, many small island nations could eventually disappear because of sea level rise, and scientific evidence shows that the impacts become particularly extreme beyond that level, especially hurting poor and vulnerable populations, he said. He added that efforts to curb emissions and the impacts of climate change must continue even if the 1.5 degree threshold is exceeded.

Crossing the threshold “means increasingly more frequent and severe climate extremes of the type we are now seeing all too often in the US and around the world – unprecedented heat waves, extreme hot drought, extreme rainfall events, and bigger storms,” said University of Michigan environment school dean Jonathan Overpeck, who wasn’t part of the study.

Andrew Dessler, a Texas A&M University climate scientist who wasn’t part of the study, said the 1.5 goal was aspirational and not realistic, so people shouldn’t focus on that particular threshold.

“Missing it does not mean the end of the world,” Dessler said in an email, though he agreed that “each tenth of a degree of warming will bring increasingly worse impacts”.",https://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2025/06/22/3162843/8324562.jpg?itok=4mVoyLZL,N,,2025-06-22 14:06:24.112239

The African country has produced and exported coal to bolster its economy as well as to provide energy for its population of over 60 million. However, now it has a $2.2 billion coal-exit plan thanks to funding from the World Bank.

Coal contributes around 82 percent of South Africa’s energy mix. In addition, roughly 28 percent of the country’s coal production is exported, primarily through the Richards Bay Coal Terminal, making South Africa the fourth-largest coal exporting country in the world. It was also the world’s 15th-highest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2023.

Although there is a multitude of coal producers in South Africa, just five account for around 85 percent of saleable coal production. Meanwhile, 11 mines contribute 70 percent of the output. The country’s coal deposits are relatively shallow with thick seams, making them easier and, generally, cheaper to mine, than the international average. At the present production rate, there is more than an estimated 50 years of coal supply left.

Its long dependency on coal, both for energy and revenue, has made many doubtful that South Africa will be able to move away from the fossil fuel any time soon. However, in June, the World Bank’s Climate Investment Funds (CIF) announced a new funding plan to support South Africa’s Accelerating Coal Transition investment plan. The CIF plan was put on hold last year after South Africa requested to delay the closure of three coal-fired power plants to ease an energy crisis. The CIF plans to provide South Africa with $500 million in funding, which could open the door to a further $2.1 billion in investment from multilateral lenders. South Africa must now provide projected project costs for approval from the CIF.

The CIF initially announced the plan in 2022, but it has taken several years to get to this point, and progress will rely heavily on South Africa’s ability to shift away from a dependence on coal by developing its renewable energy capacity. There are plans to disperse CIF funds to several different countries around the world to support a global green transition. Of the 15 fund donors, the U.S. was the biggest, having contributed $3.8 billion by the end of 2024, followed by the U.K. at $3.6 billion, then Germany, Japan and Canada, which have contributed over $1 billion each.

Fears have mounted over the future of U.S. contributions to the fund and in support of other international climate action following President Trump’s planned withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and the decision to cut the U.S. contribution to the Green Climate Fund. Earlier in the year, the U.S. withdrew from plans backed by rich nations to help Indonesia, Vietnam, and South Africa reduce their coal dependency.

Environmentalists have long been calling for South Africa to reduce its reliance on coal and develop its renewable energy sources, but this has long fallen on deaf ears. In 2020, the government approved the procurement of a huge quantity of new coal-fired capacity as part of South Africa’s energy mix. While the government has stated its support for the development of renewable energy projects, such as solar and wind energy, it has repeatedly said it will continue to pursue coal, oil, and gas production.

However, in April, a court ruled that the government’s new coal plans were unlawful, invalid, and against the country’s constitution. The decision came three years after three South African environmental and climate justice groups took the South African government to court to fight the authorisation of new coal-fired power.

Despite the strong opposition to new coal development on the grounds of environmental concerns, not everyone is happy leaving coal in the ground. Hundreds of thousands of coal workers are concerned about the prospect of losing their jobs as South Africa transitions away from the fossil fuel. A 2023 government reportestimated that 80,000 coal mining jobs were at risk in the Mpumalanga province alone. Many believe that greater progress needs to be made in developing the country’s renewable energy sector before coal plant closures can take place.

Joanne Yawitch, who leads the government’s Just Energy transition unit, stated, “These coal transitions are difficult right around the world and they take decades to achieve. And, in many parts of particularly the developed world, what it’s taken is throwing a lot of money at them in order for them to work.”

To be successful in moving away from coal, the government must establish a clear roadmap to increase South Africa’s renewable energy network, supported by the development of an adequate transmission network. In addition, to avoid widespread job losses, the government must also plan for a just transition, in which coal workers are provided with training to develop the skills needed to work in other parts of the energy sector.

Judges in Massachusetts, Hawaii and Minnesota, among other places, have denied the oil companies’ SLAPP motions, though appeals of some of those decisions are pending.
She said that under California law, lawsuits filed by the state attorney general “are, by definition, not SLAPP suits,” she said.","Oil companies are employing an unusual tactic in some of their biggest court battles. They’re alleging that their critics are infringing on their free-speech rights, invoking laws designed to protect people who challenge the powerful.

The laws, known as “anti-SLAPP” provisions, were created to stop companies or people from silencing their critics with the threat of costly lawsuits. Oil companies have turned this around, arguing that climate lawsuits against them should be thrown out because they infringe on the companies’ protections under the First Amendment.

“What we’re seeing now is a complete inversion” of the original intent of these laws, said Nicole Ligon, an assistant professor of law at Campbell University in North Carolina and expert on freedom of speech and SLAPP, which is shorthand for strategic lawsuit against public participation. The laws offer judges a way to dismiss cases that they determine lack merit.

This strategy is playing out in courtrooms nationwide, particularly where oil companies are fighting lawsuits filed by state and local governments that claim the industry has misled Americans about global warming and should help pay the cost of adapting to climate change.

The industry considers these climate lawsuits a major threat. Nearly 40 have been filed since 2017. They are seeking potentially billions of dollars in damages.

Recently, the cases have come under increased scrutiny as the Trump administration has sought to stop them, even pre-emptively suing Hawaii and Michigan to try to block them from filing their own climate-change lawsuits. (Hawaii sued anyway, and Michigan has said it will.)

While each case differs, the lawsuits generally allege that various oil companies and trade associations have for decades covered up what they knew about climate change in a quest for profit. The lawsuits cite laws against consumer deception, creating a public nuisance and others. None has yet made it to trial.

The companies, in turn, have accused the plaintiffs of filing copycat lawsuits that are aimed at bankrupting the fossil fuel industry. They also say the lawsuits, filed in state courts, are improperly trying to dictate national energy policy when that should be left to the federal government, not state proceedings. Jury trials could create a patchwork of policies around the country, the companies argue, which wouldn’t be the right way to address climate change. A few cases have been partly or fully dismissed.

Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a veteran First Amendment lawyer who represents Chevron in the climate litigation, said the lawsuits against the oil companies are centered on political speech by the companies that is protected by the Constitution. “The First Amendment applies to everyone,” he said. “It applies to companies.” He pointed to the 2010 Supreme Court decision in Citizens United, in which the justices, citing free speech, ruled that the government could not ban political spending by corporations.

With the climate-change lawsuits, he said, “The government is trying to squelch speech it doesn’t like and punish it and deter it in the future.”

The companies haven’t yet prevailed using these arguments. Judges in Massachusetts, Hawaii and Minnesota, among other places, have denied the oil companies’ SLAPP motions, though appeals of some of those decisions are pending.

The term SLAPP was coined in the 1980s by two professors at the University of Denver, the sociologist Penelope Canan and the law professor George W. Pring, who went on to write the 1996 book “SLAPPs: Getting Sued for Speaking Out.” In the years since, anti-SLAPP laws have been adopted by most states. To deter frivolous lawsuits, these laws typically require a losing plaintiff to pay the defendants’ legal bills.

Professor Canan said the energy companies were essentially interfering with the right of local officials to raise their concerns before a judge and jury. “The logic of what the energy companies are doing is the logic of a SLAPP, not the logic of an anti-SLAPP,” she said.

Observers are particularly watching cases in California, where the attorney general, Rob Bonta, and eight local governments, including San Mateo County and the city of Imperial Beach, have filed suits against Exxon Mobil, Chevron and other companies.

The suits argue that oil companies used deceptive public statements and marketing to deter government action to curb greenhouse gas emissions. They are being handled jointly by the Superior Court for the County of San Francisco.

California has a strong anti-SLAPP law that was enacted in 1992.

This coming August, Mr. Boutrous is expected to argue on behalf of the companies that the judge should strike parts of the lawsuits that concern the companies’ participation in the public debate around climate change. In a joint motion earlier this year, the companies argued that the First Amendment prohibits liability based on advocacy, lobbying or scientific debate.

Judge Ethan P. Schulman dismissed a similar motion in December that had been filed solely by Chevron, saying the state’s anti-SLAPP law carves out an exception for “commercial” speech related to the selling of goods and services.

Mr. Boutrous said that decision was wrong because the speech described in the lawsuit against the oil companies was not part of a commercial transaction. In the climate change cases, where governments are seeking damages based on speech concerning public issues, anti-SLAPP laws are applicable tools, he said.

“The double standard drives me crazy, the notion that the First Amendment and the anti-SLAPP laws are only meant to protect one side of a debate,” Mr. Boutrous said. Restrictions on particular viewpoints, he said, are “an insult to the First Amendment.”

Mr. Edling said the fossil fuel companies “want to have it both ways.” They want First Amendment protections for their own statements, he said, but also to “use First Amendment and anti-SLAPP arguments proactively to silence public entities” from challenging those statements.

Christine Lee, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bonta, noted that two higher courts in California had declined to hear appeals of the decision on Chevron’s motion. She said that under California law, lawsuits filed by the state attorney general “are, by definition, not SLAPP suits,” she said.

(Judge Schulman did not address the question of whether prosecutors like Mr. Bonta are automatically exempt from anti-SLAPP laws.)

Professor Ligon, the Campbell University legal expert, said that anti-SLAPP laws had traditionally been invoked almost exclusively in defamation suits and that fossil fuel companies had started using them as a legal tactic only in recent years. So far the companies have largely been unsuccessful, she said, but courts haven’t closed the door entirely on the idea.

Still, Professor Ligon said, political speech and commercial speech have different protections under the First Amendment, complicating the energy industry’s argument. “These laws were meant to protect vulnerable speakers,” she said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/18/multimedia/00cli-slapp-01-jcpv/00cli-slapp-01-jcpv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 12:17:05.478776

ACCE Action wants to see a portion of that money spent on the neighborhood-scale project.","In Richmond, California, Zenaida Gomez is ready to say goodbye to the gas stove in the apartment she has rented for over a decade. She has a hunch that the pollution it emits is exacerbating her 10-year-old son’s asthma attacks, and she has heard from public health experts and doctors who’ve said it probably is.

“I’ve learned that not only do we have contaminated air when we are outside in Richmond, but there’s contamination and toxins within our homes,” Gomez said in a recent phone call.

She started attending City Council meetings and organizing with her neighbors as a member of the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE) Action, because, she said, “I wanted something different. I wanted something better.”

But ACCE Action’s goal isn’t simply to get rid of gas stoves. In a city where about one in four people—nearly double the national average—suffer from asthma due in large part to pollution from heavy industry, the group wants to shut off or “prune” the lines that send natural gas into homes in some neighborhoods. The phenomenon is called “neighborhood-scale decarbonization,” and it’s just getting off the ground in California.

Pacific Gas & Electric, the utility in the area, is on board with the idea. It has expressed a willingness to spend a portion of the money it would otherwise use to maintain gas lines to help electrify the homes in the neighborhood that will no longer use the gas.

David Sharples, county director at ACCE Action, says the group is looking at different neighborhoods that PG&E has identified as likely candidates. Once the group chooses an area, it plans to run a pilot project with the goal of electrifying all the appliances and adding solar panels and batteries for up to 80 homes.

“We’re looking at the Coronado, Iron Triangle and Santa Fe neighborhoods, which are working class, Black and brown neighborhoods where ACCE has been organizing for years,” Sharples said. “They all have old gas lines that need to be replaced, so it represents an opportunity to electrify.”

To understand the appeal of neighborhood-scale decarbonization, which is also sometimes called “zonal decarbonization,” it helps to be able to envision the vast network of gas pipelines that exist under most cities in the Western U.S. That network holds a potentially explosive gas, and it requires constant, expensive upkeep.

California has pledged to install 6 million heat pumps by 2030 as part of its larger effort to reach net zero by 2045. And while a rule will begin going into effect in the Bay Area in 2027 requiring that broken water heaters and furnaces be replaced by electric appliances, a similar rule was just rejected in Southern California.

Experts say a large-scale effort just makes more sense than a piecemeal approach in many parts of the state. And as dramatic as it might sound to transition a whole block or neighborhood off gas at once, the approach may also cost less overall and make it easier to employ people fairly.

Neighborhood-scale decarbonization has also been popular with lawmakers. Last fall, the California Legislature voted to adopt SB 1221, a bill that will enable up to 30 neighborhood-scale projects of this type over the next five years.

The catch is that most residents in the neighborhoods must agree to the change. While the state’s obligation to serve currently requires 100 percent approval, SB 1221 will lower the threshold to 67 percent as the pilot projects start rolling out. Several groups have begun the work of educating communities about the benefits of the switch.

In Albany, a city of about 20,000 people north of Berkeley, Michelle Plouse, the city’s community development analyst, has spent the last few years working with PG&E to pilot one of the first neighborhood-scale projects in the state. Using the gas line mapping tool developed by the utility, Plouse and other city staff worked with the Albany City Council to identify 12 potential blocks. This spring, they narrowed it down to three.

The goal, Plouse said, is to find blocks that are easier to electrify while also focusing on lower-income parts of the city, where residents are less likely to be able to afford to electrify.

“What will happen if we don’t decommission the gas line is that the cost of maintaining it will continue to increase over time, and the user base will drop as people electrify,” said Plouse. “The folks who don’t have the money to electrify will be stuck on gas that will get more expensive every year.”

The City of Albany received a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy for the project, and they’ve used the funds to support an outreach plan that involves a block party, a focus group and a team that goes door-to-door in hopes of talking to everyone on the three blocks. “It’s going to be a lot of listening and a lot of connecting with different people,” said Plouse.

Rachel Wittman, a senior strategic analyst at PG&E, said the utility provided a letter of commitment in support of Albany’s DOE grant, but it won’t be providing financial support for the project.

Although the California Public Utilities Commission is soliciting interest from communities that want to take part in the SB 1221 pilot program, a spokesperson for the commission said it won’t have a list of potential sites until the second half of 2026, at the soonest.

The Albany project will begin before then, so it won’t likely be considered one of the 30 pilots, and Plouse said they’re hoping to get 100 percent of the residents to sign on. “What’s most likely is that we continue serving as a kind of first test run that can provide information for those pilots,” she said. If that doesn’t work, they may decide to wait until they only need 67 percent resident approval.

“Albany’s learnings from their efforts in community outreach and advocacy during this project will provide valuable insights that can inform zonal electrification outreach strategy,” said Wittman. “This applies not just for SB 1221 and PG&E, but for any utility or community.” She said over three dozen cities, counties and other energy providers have reached out to the utility with interest in zonal decarbonization.

ACCE Action and others in Richmond hope its neighborhood-scale project—dubbed Clean Energy and Healthy Homes—will be included in the list of pilot projects, and it appears to have a good chance at making the list. If they’re able to decommission a gas line there, Sharples estimates that it could cost as much as $15 million to upgrade and electrify homes spanning a few different neighborhoods and provide them with solar power. He hopes PG&E will cover around 10 percent of that cost.

The Richmond City Council approved the effort in early 2024, but the remaining funding is still in question. Chevron, whose local refinery has been a major polluter for more than a century, entered into a settlement with the city for $550 million over the next 10 years to avoid paying a per-barrel tax on the oil it produces. ACCE Action wants to see a portion of that money spent on the neighborhood-scale project. The group has been hosting community events and engaging community members like Gomez.

Tim Frank, a representative of the Building and Construction Trades Council in the county, wants to see the project move forward because it could also create a model for so-called high-road work in the home electrification space. Currently, unionized workers tend to do larger electrification projects, while one-off residential projects are done by smaller companies not affiliated with unions. While some pay their workers well, many hire temporary laborers and keep wages low.

Electrifying all the homes on one block allows for the efficiency and stability associated with larger projects while benefiting individual families. It’s also more cost-efficient because it allows for bulk purchases of supplies.

It’s a worthwhile experiment, Frank said. “We’re engaged, partly because we see the huge promise of this strategy and we want to help prove out the model and scale it up,” he added.

For Gomez, who has been talking to her neighbors about the possibility that all their homes could be upgraded and electrified at once, the biggest barrier is convincing them that it’s not a scam. Richmond’s low-income communities have seen their share of companies that go door-to-door trying to extract money from people who are stretched thin and working multiple jobs. Some clean energy providers have turned out to be imposters.

This is what communities need to do, but those questions must be met with facts, not fear.

Recent headlines about Wendell’s battery energy storage bylaw and the ongoing legal challenge paint the picture of a community fighting to protect itself. I understand that instinct. I spent nearly two decades as the mayor of Somerville, the densest city in the country, where every infrastructure decision impacted the whole community. I know what it feels like when communities believe they aren’t being heard. And I also know how important it is not to let misinformation, emotion, or outdated understanding of technology derail solutions essential to our economic and energy future.

Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are not science fiction or untested theory. They’re a proven tool for reducing energy costs, stabilizing the grid, and protecting our communities from fossil fuel price shocks, which, as this past winter and summer reminded us. We are seeing those shocks play out monthly in our ever-rising energy bills. Storage is the infrastructure that enables us to take full advantage of cheaper, cleaner, local sources like solar and wind, holding that energy and delivering it when it’s needed most. Without it, we’re stuck paying more for dirty, more costly oil and gas.

In addition, Massachusetts families are footing the bill for addressing gas system leaks, which will cost the consumer more than $40 billion to fix. They’re also paying for fossil fuel volatility driven by global markets, and for decades of underinvestment in alternatives. At the same time, they’re told to fear the very infrastructure, like battery storage, that can lower their bills and keep the lights on. That’s a lose-lose scenario.

We can’t let anecdotes from rare, isolated incidents obscure what decades of progress and modern safety protocols have delivered. The Moss Landing fire in California, frequently cited by opponents, involved older equipment and site-specific failures, issues that wouldn’t meet today’s rigorous standards. The latest National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes mandate advanced thermal management, isolation systems, remote monitoring, and local emergency coordination. These are not optional guidelines, they’re enforceable codes that reflect lessons learned.

As a former mayor, I understand you can never dismiss real concerns about siting, water safety, or community engagement. These must be addressed transparently and honestly. Projects should include local consultation, third-party safety reviews, and community benefits. However, a blanket rejection of battery storage based on generalizations or misread legal distinctions, such as zoning versus general bylaw, doesn’t just delay solutions. It risks deepening the very vulnerabilities we’re trying to solve.

Wendell’s case is not an isolated incident; it reflects a broader trend, and that’s no accident. Across the Northeast, we see a well-organized playbook of local opposition that mixes skepticism, exaggerated risk, and appeals to “home rule,” often fueled by groups fighting renewable energy across the board. Though they may appear “organic,” they’re frequently coordinated and funded by dark money, and they don’t always reflect the full voice of a community. But these efforts can effectively slow the clean energy transition, unless the truth is told.

Let’s elevate a different kind of leadership rooted in science, public benefit, and local trust. Clean energy infrastructure, including storage, isn’t just about meeting state climate goals. It’s about protecting public health, increasing energy security, creating good jobs, and insulating families from fossil fuel price shocks.

Battery storage, like all infrastructure, must be safe. But it must also be understood. The communities that lead the way on clean energy will shape their future, economically and environmentally. Those who reject it based on misinformation and fear will find themselves stuck with older, dirtier, and more expensive systems long after the rest of the state has moved forward.

We have a responsibility to facts, to each other, and to future generations to make renewables the safe, easy, and affordable choice for our energy future. Let’s meet this challenge head on.

Around here, we call it for what it is: Biden’s Green New Scam.
A recent report from the Clean Energy Buyers Association shows why.
They found that a full repeal of the technology-neutral investment and production tax credits would lead to an annual average yearly increase of more than $110 for annual electricity prices.
Biden’s Green New Scam has dominated headlines in Washington since its passage in 2022, but in Maine it’s been nothing but a raw deal.","Mainers have always believed in hard work, independence and doing what’s right without waiting for permission from Washington. For generations, we’ve powered this nation the honest way — through fishing, forestry, manufacturing and farming.

But under former President Joe Biden, those values weren’t just ignored — they were under attack. His so-called Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), pushed through Congress without serious conservative input, was sold as a clean energy plan. In reality, it was a reckless green giveaway that benefited China, rewarded wealthy elites, inflated our national debt and punished working Americans.

Around here, we call it for what it is: Biden’s Green New Scam.

The centerpiece of Biden’s law — $7,500 subsidies for electric vehicles — might sound good to the lobbyists and activists who helped write it. But for the rest of us, it’s a joke.

According to Gallup, only 7% of Americans own an electric vehicle (EV). What’s more concerning for the industry, however, is that nearly half say they never plan to own one, up from 41% the prior year. And fewer say they are likely to consider one in the future. Why would they?

Try hauling lobster traps out of Boothbay Harbor with a Tesla. Try driving through a February snowstorm in Jackman without a real truck. EVs aren’t built for the way Mainers live — or for the weather we face every year.

Meanwhile, the companies that have cashed in on these subsidies aren’t American job creators. They’re Chinese conglomerates, some of which are tied to slave labor and human rights abuses. Biden’s plan hasn’t rebuilt America. It’s bankrolled Beijing.

Some bureaucrats claimed the IRA would help Mainers by funding weatherization projects, heat pumps and energy-efficient appliances. But these so-called savings depend upon families spending thousands of dollars up front — money most working Mainers don’t have.

Even worse, the IRA included a slush fund for radical left-wing nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that are at odds with Maine values. These groups support defunding the police in the name of “environmental justice.”

And let’s be honest: In Washington, “help” usually means more red tape, more middlemen and more consultants getting rich off taxpayer dollars. Without real conservative reforms, the benefits haven’t reached the families that need them most. They’ve been swallowed up by special interests as Mainers’ heating bills have only gone up.

We know what actually works — strong borders, tough trade deals, American-made energy and lower taxes. President Trump’s policies brought factories back and put our workers first, and we expect that to happen again during his second term.

We don’t need another bloated government program. We need to fix what’s left of the IRA or roll it back entirely by stripping out waste, reversing the disincentives for pharmaceutical innovation, shutting down the China cash-outs and investing in real American energy that respects how we live in Maine.

As Congress repeals the Green New Scam, some bipartisan provisions that were lumped into the Inflation Reduction Act should be kept.

For example, the 45X advanced manufacturing tax credit, which creates the incentive for companies to manufacture here in America, is a core part of an America-first trade policy. A recent poll from the Rainey Center found that 59% of voters support clean energy incentives, but only when the products are made in America by American companies.

Only 16% want these credits to end. However, voters don’t support tax credits going to foreign companies — these policies need to end.

Another key provision of the IRA that makes sense is technology-neutral tax credits. Rather than creating a system where the government picks winners, technology-neutral tax credits let carbon capture, geothermal and clean fossil fuels compete on the same level as solar and wind.

A recent report from the Clean Energy Buyers Association shows why. They found that a full repeal of the technology-neutral investment and production tax credits would lead to an annual average yearly increase of more than $110 for annual electricity prices. Instead, projections suggest these positive aspects of the IRA will boost Maine’s GDP by $200 million in 2030.

Biden’s Green New Scam has dominated headlines in Washington since its passage in 2022, but in Maine it’s been nothing but a raw deal. In fact, recent revelations of waste, fraud and abuse across the whole of federal government has been quite shocking. We deserve better — and we should demand it.",https://www.sunjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/06/Biden_Cancer_18315_3db427-1750250647.jpg?w=1000,N,,2025-06-22 12:16:52.061161

A VPP is software that can pull power from your household battery and sell it back to the grid.
For example, to connect an 11.5 kilowatt-hour battery to a VPP would earn a bonus of about $850.
Some networks, such as Ausgrid, are now charging to feed in solar power during the day.
Solar Citizens chief executive Heidi Lee Douglas says her organisation, which advocates for solar consumers, was disappointed by the NSW decision.","For decades Australia has led the world in rooftop solar. Government incentives to encourage uptake have been so successful that panels now adorn the roofs of more than 4 million homes around the country.

Then came the push to install household batteries to save more of the solar power generated by day for use in the evening. There are now more than 300,000 households with batteries in Australia, and the number is growing rapidly.

Now some states and territories have new incentives to encourage uptake of virtual power plants, or VPPs.

But what is a VPP, and why might households want to join one?

A VPP is software that can pull power from your household battery and sell it back to the grid. It is a “power plant” in the sense that the software bundles the energy from several households to emulate a single producer.

When demand for electricity is high, the VPP pulls excess power stored in batteries, to increase the stability of the grid and reduce the need for big generators or what some call “baseload power”.

In theory, it will lower power bills for everyone and reduce reliance on ageing coal-fired power stations.

Smart Energy Council acting chief executive Wayne Smith said recently that it was important to integrate individual whole batteries into a bigger collective system.

“There’s a private benefit and a public good,” Smith said.

Households are giving up some control over their system when they consent to be in a VPP, so what’s in it for them?

First, they will be paid for it. There are VPPs available in all Australian states and territories. Consumers are either simply paid for participation in the VPP, or paid for the energy they feed into the grid.

In NSW, there is an additional sweetener: the government will pay a household to join a VPP based on the size of its battery. For example, to connect an 11.5 kilowatt-hour battery to a VPP would earn a bonus of about $850. The state is ending its separate incentive for the purchase of the actual battery, deeming the new Commonwealth Cheaper Home Batteries scheme to be enough.

Solar households would be familiar with the dwindling feed-in tariffs for selling electricity to the grid, which are set to get even worse with new pricing from July 1. This is because there is now so much cheap solar energy in the electricity network during the day – when the sun is shining and the panels are pumping out the power – that it far exceeds demand.

Some networks, such as Ausgrid, are now charging to feed in solar power during the day. This doesn’t come as a direct fee to the solar households because the energy retailer sits in the middle, but the cost is deducted from the feed-in tariffs available to consumers.

Most electricity retailers have drastically reduced feed-in tariffs or even taken them to zero, and in some cases, they’re choking off households from being able to feed in at all.

Electricity retailers would be willing to pay significantly more if the time is right. In the evening – when no solar is being produced and demand is high because most people are home from work – retailers are paying a higher wholesale price and would be keen to pay households for stored power.

Rewiring Australia chief executive Francis Vierboom says consumers need to shop around because the rate you can earn through a VPP varies by electricity retailer.

“If you don’t sign your battery up to a VPP, then it’s a bit like keeping your money under the mattress – it’s the most simple option,” Vierboom says.

“A lot of VPPs will offer you basically a reward, based maybe on a fixed rate that your battery gets paid if they call on it, to export energy to the grid. That’s a bit like putting your money into a savings account that’s got an interest rate.”

Finally, Vierboom says, there are retailers such as Amber Electric that pass the live five-minute changing price of energy through to their customers.

In that case, Vierboom says, “it’s a bit more like putting your money in the stock market ... one of those index funds”.

This is complex and would not suit everyone, but for those who are interested, there is a higher risk and return.

Loading

Consumers will need to ask questions about how frequently their batteries will be accessed and whether they can override VPP instructions when they want. Battery owners will want to retain control so they don’t have their electricity taken at one price and then be forced to buy it back at a higher price.

Fortunately, battery owners should always be able to use their own stored energy in the event of an actual blackout, since it is a physical impossibility to feed energy into an offline grid.

Solar Citizens chief executive Heidi Lee Douglas says her organisation, which advocates for solar consumers, was disappointed by the NSW decision. There should have been more public education about VPPs before pulling the pin on the state battery subsidy, she says.",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1317%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/t_smh_analysis_no_age_social_wm/9ea4cf5891e9c9c1c77800cc704d5d0dd3148c1a,N,,2025-06-22 12:15:29.969583

It is a pro-market, pro-development, proactive approach to high-grading the Texas grid, a welcome change from the reactive, disaster-driven processes of the past.","Concerns that the Texas power grid, managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), could soon begin to groan under the weight of surging demand, led the Texas Legislature to pass Senate Bill 6 (SB 6) in the 2025 session. Signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott on Saturday, this bill is an aggressive attempt to shore up reliability on the Texas grid while making large-load customers bear a fair share of the cost.

Texas has always prided itself on doing things big, including maintaining its status as a national energy powerhouse. From leading the shale oil and gas boom, to supporting state-of-the-art ports moving the lion’s share of U.S. crude and LNG exports, to leading the nation in both wind and solar generating capacity, Texas has fueled America’s growth while taking a different path than other large population states like California, New York, and Florida.

SB 6 is a legislative balancing act designed to ensure Texas continues to play a leading national role in hosting the nation’s rapidly expanding AI industry and its associated datacenters while simultaneously achieving a higher level of grid reliability and energy security. Authored by Senator Charles Schwertner and championed by Lt. Governor Dan Patrick, SB 6 targets one of the elephants in the room: massive electricity consumers, defined as those with loads of 75 megawatts or more.

In addition to high tech datacenters, the bill’s provisions will also impact operations like cryptocurrency mining centers and heavy industrial plants. Such industrial giants have flocked to Texas in recent years to take advantage of comparatively cheap electricity and a business-friendly policy structure.

But the Texas grid has at the same time shown clear signs of struggling to maintain reliability amid a rapid economic and population expansion, and recent projections by ERCOT of massive demand growth over the coming decade motivated the legislature to take proactive action. This is a welcome change from past episodes that saw policymakers taking action only after disaster had struck, as was the case with Winter Storm Uri, which devastated the state in February 2021 following a decade of failure to act to address well-known weaknesses in the grid.

How SB 6 Improves Texas Grid Reliability

The bill signed by Gov. Abbott mandates that large-load customers register with ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission (PUC), provide backup generation (like on-site gas or diesel generators), and shoulder new transmission fees to fund grid upgrades. The new law also greenlights proprietary, behind-the-meter power generation for these facilities, reducing their draw on the grid. Such generation will consist mainly of natural gas plants in the near term, with aspirations for more nuclear generation in the longer term.

SB 6 also gives ERCOT enhanced tools for large load forecasting, enabling both ERCOT and the PUC to review large load projects which involve taking existing generation off the grid. It establishes a process for curtailing large loads before residential and small business customers during emergency situations, a key step that would require backups for large load customers and thus let ERCOT curtail the load during emergencies without centers powering down. The legislature also tossed in a provision which lets water and sewer corporations generate power in hopes of enhancing rural resilience.

“Texas is open for business, but we won’t let unchecked growth crash our grid,” Lt. Gov. Patrick declared when he unveiled his 40 priority bills for the 2025 session in March, with SB 6 near the top. His point is hard to argue with: ERCOT projected in April that Texas power demand will double by 2030, to as high as 208,000 megawatts, driven largely by data centers and industrial loads.

A Pillsbury Law analysis notes that “SB 6 ensures large-load customers contribute to the infrastructure they rely on, protecting residential ratepayers from footing the bill.” The math is compelling: Data centers alone could account for 20% of ERCOT’s peak load by 2030. Without proactive policy intervention like SB 6, the grid would be at higher blackout risk during major weather events.

The Outlook Ahead For The Texas Grid

The legislature’s embrace of behind-the-meter natural gas and nuclear power is a pragmatic nod to both the need to enhance reliability and to the state’s resource abundance. Texas ranks as far and away the largest natural gas producing state in the country. A recent study published by the Environmental Integrity Project reports that the state is in the early stages of a significant gas plant boom, with at least 130 projects either already in the queue or in the planning stage. Altogether, the plants would combine for 58 gigawatts of new 24/7 power generation.

Nuclear appears poised for a national comeback spurred by rising public confidence and favorability and by the rapidly shifting energy policy direction under the Trump administration. Last week, the Department of Energy led by Secretary Chris Wright rolled out a new initiative to reform the system for nuclear reactor testing and spur development of new generation reactors on the site of the DOE National Labs.

Critics will no doubt argue that Texas policymakers should encourage big new industrial power users to focus on wind and solar for their behind-the-meter generation. But, as I’ve detailed here in prior pieces, a consensus has formed among the big datacenter developers that renewables alone can’t handle the 24/7 demands of data centers, and SB 6’s critics consistently ignore that wind and solar lean on gas peaking plants when lack of wind, bad weather and the setting sun render them dormant.

The bill’s supporters argue that SB 6 is less about ideology and more about fairness, centered on the principle that residential customers shouldn’t subsidize grid upgrades for tech giants. As Schwertner put it during Senate debates, “This bill ensures those who strain the system invest in its stability.”

All in all, SB 6 represents a straightforward move by Texas policymakers to ensure that ERCOT and the PUC have the appropriate tools to incorporate large loads onto the grid and ensure minimal risk from a cost and reliability standpoint while maintaining the state’s ability to lead the country in the kinds of large industrial power users. It is a pro-market, pro-development, proactive approach to high-grading the Texas grid, a welcome change from the reactive, disaster-driven processes of the past.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/685808d4fd5600d9df0c178f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-06-22 12:17:01.568571

Ted Cruz deserves credit for saying what too many in Washington are unwilling to admit. American energy security is under coordinated attack, and it is not just coming from progressive environmental activists. It’s being encouraged and in some cases funded by our top geopolitical rival.

On Wednesday, Sen. Cruz’s Judiciary oversight subcommittee will hold a hearing to examine how China and America’s climate litigation movement are working in parallel to undermine U.S. energy dominance. These efforts are being carried out under the banner of environmental protection and the clean energy transition, but the real goal is to weaken America’s energy sector and give the advantage to China in global energy and manufacturing markets.

Climate cases brought by plaintiff firms like Sher Edling are supported by a network of well-funded foundations and nonprofits that are unwittingly advancing the strategic interests of America’s adversaries by weakening domestic energy production and increasing our dependence on foreign-controlled supply chains—particularly those dominated by China.

There is growing recognition that this is a national security problem. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission has warned that the Chinese Communist Party is actively working to “directly and malignly influence state and local leaders to promote China’s global agenda.”

A recent report by national security nonprofit State Armor outlines how China has co-opted elements of the U.S. climate lobby to drive a transition away from fossil fuels. The result is greater U.S. reliance on Chinese-controlled technologies, minerals, and supply chains. China dominates the global markets for lithium, cobalt, solar panels, and battery components. It stands to gain enormously from U.S. policies that force a premature shift away from traditional energy sources.

The report spotlights Energy Foundation China (EFC) which claims to be a nonprofit headquartered in San Francisco. In reality, its staff are mostly based in Beijing, and its operations align closely with the Chinese Communist Party’s interests. EFC has spent millions supporting anti-fossil fuel groups in the United States, including the Rocky Mountain Institute and the Natural Resources Defense Council. NRDC was the subject of a 2018 congressional inquiry over whether it should register as a foreign agent due to its ties to China.

House Energy and Commerce Committee leaders last year warned that “China has already attempted to influence United States policy and opinion through covert influence and by exploiting perceived societal divisions.” Their letter raised concerns about China-affiliated organizations influencing U.S. energy policy.

A number of foundations have played a role in financing climate litigation efforts nationwide. A decade of litigation that most likely would not have happened without their financial backing. Major donors to this network include some of the largest philanthropic institutions in the country, including the Children’s Investment Fund, MacArthur, Rockefeller, and Hewlett foundations. Yet few of these donors have accounted for the risk of foreign manipulation embedded in the organizations they fund.

The influence campaign also extends into U.S. academic institutions. The National Natural Science Foundation of China, a government-run research entity, has published articles in American journals criticizing fossil fuels and accusing U.S. companies of deceptive practices. One of EFC’s top communications directors previously held a position at that same Chinese foundation.

At the same time, the revolving door between activist nonprofits and government agencies is raising serious ethical and legal questions. Ann Carlson, a senior official in the Biden administration, previously sat on the board of the Environmental Law Institute while also consulting for Sher Edling. This institute has hosted multiple educational events with Chinese organizations on “climate litigation capacity building” aimed at influencing judges and shaping the legal landscape in both countries.

Sen. Cruz is right to shine a spotlight on these connections. There is no shortage of outside forces fueling this wave of litigation, and his subcommittee is well positioned to expose them. The American people deserve transparency about who is bankrolling the litigation assault on domestic energy and to what end. This is not simply the work of environmentalists who believe they are saving the planet. It includes adversarial foreign actors with a vested interest in weakening U.S. energy leadership and shifting global influence away from the United States.

President Trump’s energy dominance agenda is helping restore American strength by unleashing domestic production and lowering energy prices. But the progress made is at risk. Foreign interference, opaque litigation funding, and activist-driven policy by lawsuit are undermining U.S. energy security. Prior administrations allowed this framework to take hold by ceding policymaking authority to the courts.

China is more than happy to watch us tie our economy in regulatory knots while it builds new coal-fired power plants, locks in oil and gas contracts with OPEC+ members, and consolidates control over clean energy technologies. If we let this trend continue, we are handing Beijing exactly what it wants.

We need stronger congressional oversight, new transparency requirements for nonprofits that receive foreign-linked funding, and a renewed national focus on producing energy here at home. That starts by recognizing that this is not just a political disagreement. It’s a strategic threat to our country’s future.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6857f55ce140cec67134bb7a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-06-22 12:15:33.494129

I spoke at Lobby Day at the State House on June 3 to help pass medical aid in dying legislation in Massachusetts.

I support the option after watching my brother, Chuck, die last year of an aggressive cancer. Six days after entering hospice care. I saw how the ever-increasing doses of morphine and anti-anxiety medications could not keep up with his suffering. Previously, he cared for his partner as she died an extremely painful death from cancer. This was not the end he wanted.

Those final tortuous days for Chuck deepened my conviction that we need the option of medical aid in dying that would allow mentally capable, terminally ill adults the option to request and self-ingest prescription medication to peacefully end their suffering.

The bill has a wide range of safeguards that ensure the patient and medical provider are protected throughout the process.

I urge Massachusetts legislators to seize this historic opportunity to demonstrate compassion for their dying constituents who desire this option and pass end-of-life options legislation (S.1486/H.2505) this year. I want people in Massachusetts to avoid protracted suffering in their last days and gently die on their own terms instead of from the illness that will end their lives anyway, give them the peace of mind to know what the end will look like, and focus on living their lives to the fullest in the days that remain.

Barbara Webster, Upton

Battery storage for clean energy

Joe Curtatone makes many good points in his column (Battery storage part of path to clean energy, June 15). Battery storage is a proven technology for storing clean energy from wind and solar. It can also be used to store energy generated by any source off-peak to be delivered during peak demand hours. These systems are safe and cost-effective alternatives to additional fossil fuel infrastructure.

Mr. Curtatone also points out that Massachusetts customers are getting walloped by energy bills because fossil fuel prices can swing due to various market effects. Clean, renewable energy is not subject to such events and is therefore less volatile.

Massachusetts residents are already bankrolling a crumbling $40 billion pipeline network through utility bills. Every delay in clean energy transition means more money flowing to maintain costly and environmentally damaging fossil fuel infrastructure.

Electricity demand continues to grow and the utilities are barely able to keep up. This is the right time to add new capacity to the electrical grid via renewable energy sources backed up by battery storage systems.

Proud to stand with devout Jews opposing Israeli policy

During a June 10 rally at Newton Square for City Councilor Etel Haxhiaj, a driver called Etel and me antisemites, ostensibly because of our support for free delivery of humanitarian aid and ceasefire in Gaza.

On Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, in 1985, Jewish friends invited me to join a prayer/protest against the launching of a Trident submarine. Wearing prayer shawls and yarmulkes we knelt in the road to block busloads of dignitaries. After blowing a shofar (ram's horn) lent to me for this protest by the rabbi of Temple Emanuel, we chanted in Hebrew the central prayer of Judaism: ""Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is one!""

Jesus cited this prayer when asked, ""Rabbi, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” and said that the second-greatest commandment is to ""love your neighbor as yourself.""

God's gift of the promised land to the Jewish people flowed out of obedience to these two commands. When the community worshipped other gods and oppressed strangers, God exiled them to Babylon.

Members of groups, like Jewish Voice for Peace, draw on their faith to oppose Israeli policy. They and other faithful Jews do not support blockading humanitarian aid to Gaza, detaining thousands of Palestinians without charges, and certainly not perpetrating genocide. Etel and I are proud to stand with devout Jews like them, as we did at Newton Square.

Preserving role Clark has played in community

We write in response to your June 3 article on Clark University’s plans for restructuring.

The challenges Clark is facing are not unique; many universities in New England and throughout the country face enrollment challenges due to changing demographics and threats to international students. One thing that does make Clark unique, however, is its connection to the city of Worcester.

We have been on the faculty at Clark for nearly two decades. Like many faculty members, we live in Worcester and our children have attended Worcester schools. Many of our students are from Worcester or have chosen to make Worcester their home after graduation. Clark graduates make important contributions to the city as teachers, lawyers, small business owners and members of many other professions.

Many details of Clark’s plan still need to be worked out. While it highlights areas of strategic strength — such as climate, health and human behavior, and media arts — Clark’s strategic plan does not discontinue the range of majors that have also made a Clark education exciting and valuable for our students and for the community. Clark has historically been a university where the faculty (including us) play a major role in university governance. We, like many others on the faculty, are prepared to work with the administration on this plan to make these restructuring decisions carefully and compassionately, and to ensure that the quality and breadth of education that Clark has historically offered to our students and the role Clark has played in the community are preserved.

Muir Mhòr Offshore Wind Farm’s onshore consent application was approved by Aberdeenshire Council today, in a big step forward for the project.

The decision was taken at a meeting of the local authority’s Infrastructure Services Committee, with councillors backing the plans to connect the project to the National Grid.

It means that planning permission has now been granted in principle for the wind farm’s onshore infrastructure, which includes underground cabling and a substation.

A separate offshore consent application covering the wind farm itself was submitted at the end of last year, and is currently being considered by the Scottish Government.

Muir Mhòr is the first fully floating offshore wind farm from the ScotWind leasing process to achieve onshore planning consent, following extensive consultation with local communities and stakeholders.

If its offshore application is approved, the project is set to start generating clean and renewable power in the early 2030s, bringing huge economic benefits to Aberdeenshire in the process.

These include the creation of a significant number of jobs during its construction, operation and maintenance phases, and a supply chain contributing millions of pounds to the region’s economy.

A community benefit fund will also be established, developed in partnership with local communities and focusing on their priorities.

Once operational, the wind farm will be able to generate up to 1GW of clean power, enough to provide electricity for the equivalent of up to 1.2 million homes every year.

This will in turn make the country’s energy supplies more secure, as well as aiding with the UK Government’s clean power mission.

As well as bringing economic benefits, the project is committed to enhancing the skills of the Scottish offshore wind workforce at all levels, beginning in schools.

Muir Mhòr is a 50/50 joint venture between Fred. Olsen Seawind and Vattenfall, both having an established track record in Scotland. Working together, both companies are committed to securing Scotland’s energy future and green economy.

The wind farm – whose name means ‘Great Sea’ in Gaelic – will be located off the east coast of Scotland, approximately 63km from the coast of Peterhead.

David Hinshelwood, project director for Muir Mhòr Offshore Wind Farm, said:

'The granting of onshore planning consent is a very important moment for our project, and we are delighted that Aberdeenshire Council has decided to give the go-ahead.

'Our submission followed a long period of consultation where we listened carefully to those impacted by our development, took on board their feedback, and made adjustments.

'Muir Mhòr is leading the way to a clean energy future, becoming the first fully floating offshore wind farm from the 2022 ScotWind leasing round to be granted onshore consent.

'In doing so, we are supporting?the ambitions of governments in Scotland and the UK to be a world leader in floating offshore wind, and a clean energy superpower.

“Our focus is now on gaining approval for our offshore consent application from the Scottish Government, so our project can move ahead and bolster the UK’s energy security.'

Rachel Baird, onshore consents manager for Muir Mhòr Offshore Wind Farm, said:

'Today’s decision is the culmination of a lot of hard work by our team, and we are very grateful to the councillors in Aberdeenshire for taking the time to consider our application carefully.

'Throughout the process we have sought to be as transparent as possible about our plans, holding multiple consultation events in Peterhead and Longside, speaking to residents and businesses, answering their questions, and gathering their feedback.

'We then used this to adjust our application, because we understand the importance of listening to local communities.

'We’d like to thank everyone who participated in this process and look forward to continuing these conversations as the project moves forward.'

Tesla, the Elon Musk-led EV brand, is all set to inaugurate its first showroom in India by mid-July. Of late, we have been hearing about the world’s biggest electric car company making entry into the Indian market and now sources tell us that Tesla will finally start sales and operations in the coming 2-3 weeks. The dealerships in Mumbai and Delhi will start retailing Model Y as the first Tesla EV available for Indian buyers. The first set of Model Y electric SUVs have been imported in India from the company’s factory in China.

Apart from a few units of the rear-wheel-drive Model Y, Tesla has also shipped a few components of its Supercharger network in India from the US, China and Netherlands. Further, spare parts, accessories and merchandise have also been imported into our country so that it can kick start sales operations in the next one month or so.

Tesla has always been reluctant regarding its entry in India due to disagreements with the government over local manufacturing and import tariffs. Earlier this year in Feb, Tesla CEO Elon Musk had met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the US. Post that, the Union Government in India had laid out a new EV policy with lesser import duties, if the automaker commits to set up a factory in India within three years and start local production.

The documents accessed by Bloomberg revealed that five units of Tesla Model Y have been shipped from the Shanghai factory to Mumbai, India. The cost of these electric cars is claimed as 2.77 million rupees ($31,988). The import tariff attracted by these SUVs is valued at 2.1 million rupees. Just so you know, Model Y is the world’s highest-sold electric car till date.

Tesla Model Y price in India is expected to be around $56,000 (Around Rs 49 lakh). However, the eventual pricing will be decided by the company closer to the launch date, but its likely to be around Rs 50 lakh (ex-showroom), more or less. The Model Y is sold at $44,990 (Around Rs 39 lakh) in the American market. Moreover, after the government subsidies and tax credits, the buyers pay around $37,490 (Around Rs 32 lakh).

Pretty much everything they do seems to fit under that umbrella.

None of that fit's the narrative and payment plan. They prefer to tow the rope to the fossil fuel industry as there is a threat that alternative sources of energy will overtake fossil fuels. Which in most cases has already happened. Once they cut all these programs and start seeing the job losses and economy losses they will shake their heads.

They're not interested in any of those goals. That's just what they say when people ask them what their policies support. What they want is zero taxes on the wealthy and 100% unregulated capitalism.

They're fundamentally unable to. Renewables can't funnel as much in kickbacks as the fossil fuel industry. Also, it's a Democratic plan. They get kkkarma by hating on and dismantling anything resembling Progressive policy.

The process of making beer requires a lot of steam, which is usually made by burning natural gas, exposing brewers to volatile price spikes. Fortunately, New Belgium found a solution with AtmosZero, a company specializing in industrial electric boilers which swap out expensive and dirty fossil fuels for clean electrons with stable prices.

Industry – everything from making steel and cement to chemicals and beer – is the world’s largest energy consumer, and its energy demand has soared 70% since 2000. To help protect against price volatility and cut climate pollution, industries around the world are embracing electric technologies in lieu of burning fossil fuels —also called industrial electrification—to create truly cleaner products.

That’s critical for manufacturers looking to succeed: Industrial producers won’t remain competitive in a global marketplace that increasingly values clean products, so countries and companies that don’t evolve will get left behind by those who do.

Until recently, cutting industrial emissions was considered difficult because of the sector’s reliance on burning fossil fuels for various processes. Fortunately, all-electric technologies—many already commercially available and ready to deploy at scale—can meet industry’s heat needs without compromising performance, while providing secondary benefits including cleaner air, a stable climate, and improved worker health.

Electric technologies are to poised power the next industrial revolution, but overcoming all barriers to industrial electrification requires policy leadership and industry’s embrace of technological innovation.

Electrifying industrial heat is the next step in manufacturing innovation

Industry is integral to our daily lives, economic health, and quality of life. The industrial sector produces nearly everything in our lives—from beverages and food to paper products and plastics, and even electric vehicles and solar panels. Manufacturing uses enormous amounts of fossil fuels to create those products, making industry the largest energy consumer in the world and responsible for a third of greenhouse gas emissions.

These energy demands fall into three primary categories:

Process uses, which is the energy used directly in industrial equipment, such as in boilers that generate steam for heating materials or distilling liquids or in kilns and blast furnaces that make cement and steel

Feedstocks used as chemical inputs that cannot be replaced with electricity directly, such as ammonia in fertilizer

Non-process uses required for industry to operate but not part of manufacturing, such as building heating, cooling, and lighting, or transportation equipment.

Process uses account for 84% of industrial non-feedstock fossil fuel use globally, and each industrial subsector requires different temperatures for their bespoke processes.

Today, industries rely on burning large volumes of fossil fuels to achieve these temperatures.

Fortunately, many untapped opportunities exist to reduce industrial energy demands by improving the overall efficiency of industrial operations. This can be done through energy and material efficiency measures, as well as reducing demand for new products. However, sizable industrial heat needs require scalable technology solutions to mitigate the sector’s outsized impact on climate change and air pollution. Fortunately, viable technologies and policy solutions are primed to tackle this challenge.

Powering industrial heat with electric technologies and a clean grid

Because electricity can be generated from carbon-free resources—like solar, wind, batteries, and geothermal—swapping electric technologies for burning fossil fuels can reduce and ultimately displace emissions. Though no one-size-fits-all solution exists for industrial heat, electrified technologies can meet nearly all industrial heating demands, including industrial heat pumps, electric boilers, thermal batteries, electric arc or induction furnaces, electric resistance heating, dielectric (radio or microwave) heating, and infrared heating.

However, shifting industrial processes from dirty fuels to clean electrons requires overcoming three primary categories of barriers—economics, grid readiness, and technology maturity and awareness—with a suite of policy solutions.

Primary barriers to industrial electrification and policy solutions to overcome them

Electrification can deliver many long-term economic, environmental, and societal benefits, but the higher cost of electricity relative to fossil fuels in many places and the capital expenditures needed to switch to electric technologies can be a deterrent to change. In addition, the costs to connect to the grid can add expenses.

Policymakers can pursue a combination of incentives to increase deployment of renewable and carbon-free electricity and create incentives to encourage clean industry and electrification. Creative financing tools will help fill market gaps, and clean heat emissions standards will help level the playing field for industrial electrification technologies, allowing them to compete with fossil fuel alternatives.

Widespread industrial electrification will also require a robust and reliable electricity grid capable of supporting more demand. New capacity additions must be carbon-free, alongside new transmission and distribution infrastructure. Slow and costly interconnection processes and outmoded grid planning can prevent meaningful progress. In order to overcome grid readiness barriers, policymakers should pursue greater energy efficiency as well as flexible industrial demand. This combined with interconnection and grid planning reforms that can reduce demand on the grid, while also reducing the costs for other ratepayers.

Finally, many electric technologies have been commercially available and in use in specific applications for decades, but not all have been deployed at scale or applied to traditionally fossil-fueled industrial processes. Industries, the workforce, and investors need experience with these technologies to gain confidence in industrial electrification. Government officials should support foundational research development and demonstration policies to ensure continued technology evolution and support for projects that yield cost and performance improvements across different geographies and jurisdictions. Workforce training and education programs are also necessary to attract, train, and support the people charged with their effective deployment and maintenance.

Catalyzing industrial electrification today

No one-size-fits-all policy package exists to electrify the industrial sector, and each sub-industry and jurisdiction faces unique challenges and priorities. Overcoming all barriers to industrial electrification can help government officials revitalize and modernize their region’s industrial base—one that is cleaner, more economically competitive, and aligned with a stable climate future.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6852f4b0b44d9de0b133ce1e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-06-22 11:09:25.824900

While this announcement may seem like a form of sensationalism, China is pursuing safer and far more efficient generation of energy utilizing nuclear technology. With this nuclear technology, China may very well achieve all of its set net-zero goals.

Understanding SMRs and noting the focus on SMRs

So, what may initially seem like a hyperbole may very well be a shift in a new direction in terms of global energy technology. The big revelation came with progress made on a novel small nuclear reactor called the Small Modular Reactor (SMR), which is a compact and highly advanced system. The first-ever commercial above-ground SMR has been created in Hainan province and is known as Linglong-1. China will thus test this SMR technology beyond the borders and will begin testing in Southeast Asia.

SMRs are said to be nuclear reactors able to produce up to 300 megawatts of electricity (MWe), which is one-third of the capacity of traditional nuclear plants. Despite producing less power, the SMRs offer advantages in safety and flexibility. What makes SMRs so attractive is their integrated design that contains the fuel system and the steam generation in a compact, singular module. The beauty part is that most SMRs can shut down and still continue programming even without any electricity.

The uranium fuel that is used by these reactors is rather widely available. With the fuel, the SMR can continuously operate for 24 months before another refueling is needed. While output may fall short in comparison to other energy generators, the output concerning its size must be commended. This output produced has earned the SMRs the endearment, “extreme energy”.

Testing to start in Thailand first

Thailand has stood out as one of the key players to put China’s SMR technology to the test. It was a recent announcement from Thailand’s Electricity Generating Authority (EGAT) that mentioned the country is looking at several SMR options as per its energy transformation strategy. As has been stated by the EGAT governor, Thepparat Theppitak, these SMRs may very well be key in securing a low-carbon future for Thailand and ensuring that sustainable yet affordable energy is produced.

Thailand understands that since natural gas reserves are on the decline, power sources need to be diversified as much as possible. In opting for diversification of energy, SMRs stand central to the equation. While the focus remains on green hydrogen (and not at all on black hydrogen), the core premise of SMRs has been included in all of the green technology discussions thus far.

SMRs demand a mere 1km space for emergency planning and hence serve as an urban and industrial solution where space limitation is not considered a factor.

China’s collaboration with Thailand: A stepping stone towards a cleaner energy future

With the interest in SMRs increasing, it is Thailand that is looking forward to a future that entails relying on SMRs. Thailand’s nuclear program, which got delayed, has paved new avenues towards finding nuclear solutions, and Thailand’s collaboration with China may show advancement being made towards nuclear technology adoption.

China is looking to export its SMR solution, but China is also looking to become the leader of nuclear innovations. While SMRs are in the early stages of development, they prove to be more expensive to build in comparison to gas-powered plants. However, the advantages of SMRs surely do outweigh the cost factor incurred in manufacturing them. SMRs offer a lifetime of operational costs, performance for up to 10 years, and low emissions.",https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot_16-6-2025_52254_www.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 11:09:28.848562

Details about the company’s robotaxi service have been scant since its unveiling in October of last year, and its launch has been delayed.
Just two days before that supposed launch, Musk reposted a video on X, the social media platform he owns, showing a driverless Tesla passing through an intersection in Austin.
Despite a launch that Musk has described as scaled back, Tesla is already facing opposition from Texas lawmakers.
Federal authorities have likewise taken note of the robotaxi launch.","Austin, Texas is set to be the first city worldwide to see Tesla’s self-driving robotaxi service on its roads. Elon Musk, CEO of the electric carmaker, has said he is “tentatively” planning to roll out a small number of these autonomous vehicles on the streets of the Texas state capital on Sunday.

Details about the company’s robotaxi service have been scant since its unveiling in October of last year, and its launch has been delayed. Musk has told reporters that there may be fewer than a dozen cars in Austin on Sunday and that the vehicles will stick to specific neighborhoods. Some analysts believe that the robotaxis will only be available to employees and invitees initially.

For the CEO, Tesla’s rollout is slow. “We could start with 1,000 or 10,000 [robotaxis] on day one, but I don’t think that would be prudent,” he told CNBC in May. “So, we will start with probably 10 for a week, then increase it to 20, 30, 40.”

The billionaire has said the driverless cars will be monitored remotely, but it is unclear if a safety driver will accompany the vehicles – as is standard practice when other robotaxi companies have launched in new cities.

Musk has been touting the Austin rollout since last summer, but the debut date has been a moving target. Over the past few months, the billionaire indicated the launch would be some time in June.

Then, news reports floated that it would happen on 12 June. Just two days before that supposed launch, Musk reposted a video on X, the social media platform he owns, showing a driverless Tesla passing through an intersection in Austin. In response to questions about the video on X, Musk said the date was “tentatively” 22 June but that this launch date would be “not real self-driving”, which would have to wait nearly another week.

“We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,” Musk added. “First Tesla that drives itself from factory end of line all the way to a customer house is 28 June.”

Musk said he plans to have one thousand Tesla robotaxis on Austin roads “within a few months” and then he’ll expand to other cities in Texas and California.

Despite a launch that Musk has described as scaled back, Tesla is already facing opposition from Texas lawmakers. A group of Democratic state senators and members of the house sent Tesla a letter last week asking the company to delay the debut until a new autonomous vehicle law takes effect in September.

“We believe this is in the best interest of both public safety and building public trust in Tesla’s operations,” the lawmakers wrote. It is unlikely their objections will throw up lasting roadblocks, though, as Republicans hold majorities in both chambers of the Texas legislature.

Federal authorities have likewise taken note of the robotaxi launch. In May, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent Tesla a list of questions about its robotaxi launch in Austin, which included how the company would intervene if something went wrong, how it would handle crash reporting and how it would deal with adverse weather conditions.

An NHTSA spokesperson told the Guardian that the agency has received a response from Tesla and it is in the process of reviewing it.

Tesla has been the subject of numerous investigations and lawsuits over the safety of the software that allows owners of its vehicles to drive hands-free, which the company calls Full Self-Driving and which is closely related to the technology used in its robotaxis.

There have been at least 17 deaths and five serious injuries involving the technology, according to the Washington Post. The NHTSA is looking into numerous crashes in which the agency says Full Self-Driving software was impeded by weather conditions like sun glare, fog, dust and darkness, including one crash that resulted in the death of a pedestrian.

Tesla will be joining a crowded robotaxi market in the Texas city, which already has services from Waymo, owned by Google parent Alphabet.

Amazon and Volkswagen are also testing driverless taxis in Austin. These companies have taken a slower approach in developing their autonomous vehicle technology by driving hundreds of thousands of miles to map city streets and working to train their software to avoid pedestrians, cyclists and unexpected happenings on the road.

A year later, he promised to deliver them the next year, but that didn’t happen either.

Despite the empty pledges the promises kept coming. Last year in January, Musk said, “Next year for sure, we’ll have over a million robotaxis.”

Would you settle for 10 or 12?

Musk appears to be on the verge of making his robotaxi vision a reality with a test run of a small squad of self-driving cabs in Austin, Texas, starting Sunday. Reaching a million may take a year or more, however, although the billionaire should be able to expand the service this year if the Austin demo is a success.

The stakes couldn't be higher, nor the challenges.

While Musk was making those “next year” promises, rival Waymo was busy deploying driverless taxis in Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and other cities by using a different technology that allowed it to get to market faster. It just completed its 10 millionth paid ride.

Boycotts related to Musk's politics have tanked Tesla's sales. Rival electric vehicle makers with newly competitive models have stolen market share. And investors are on edge after a $150 billion stock wipeout when Musk picked a social media fight with a U.S. president overseeing federal car regulators who could make the robotaxi rollout much more difficult. The stock has recovered somewhat after Musk said he regretted some of his remarks.

Tesla shareholders have stood by Musk over the years because he’s defied the odds by building a successful standalone electric vehicle company — self-driving car promises aside — and making them a lot of money in the process. A decade ago, Tesla shares traded for around $18. The shares closed Friday at $322.

Musk says the Austin test will begin modestly enough, with just 10 or 12 vehicles picking up passengers in a limited area. But then it will quickly ramp up and spread to other cities, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands if not a million vehicles next year.

Some Musk watchers on Wall Street are skeptical.

“How quickly can he expand the fleet?” asks Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA. “We're talking maybe a dozen vehicles initially. It's very small.""

Morningstar's Seth Goldstein says Musk is being classic Musk: Promising too much, too quickly.

“When anyone in Austin can download the app and use a robotaxi, that will be a success, but I don't think that will happen until 2028,"" he says. “Testing is going to take a while.”

Musk's tendency to push up the stock high with a bit of hyperbole is well known among investors.

In 2018, he told Tesla stockholders he had “funding secured” to buy all their shares at a massive premium and take the company private. But he not only lacked a written commitment from financiers, according to federal stock regulators who fined him, he hadn't discussed the loan amount or other details with them.

More recently, Musk told CNBC in May that Tesla was experiencing a “major rebound” in demand. A week later an auto trade group in Europe announced sales had plunged by half.

Musk has come under fire for allegedly exaggerating the ability of the system used for its cars to drive themselves, starting with the name. Full Self-Driving is a misnomer. The system still requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road because they may need to intervene and take control at any moment.

Federal highway safety regulators opened an investigation into FSD last year after several accidents, and the Department of Justice has conducted its own probe, though the status of that is not known. Tesla has also faced lawsuits over the feature, some resulting in settlements, other dismissed. In one case, a judge ruled against the plaintiffs but only because they hadn't proved Musk “knowingly” made false statements.

Musk says the robotaxis will be running on an improved version of Full Self-Driving and the cabs will be safe.

He also says the service will be able to expand rapidly around the country. His secret weapon: Millions of Tesla owners now on the roads. He says an over-the-air software update will soon allow them to turn their cars into driverless cabs and start a side business while stuck at the office for eight hours or on vacation for a week.

“Instead of having your car sit in the parking lot, your car could be earning money,” Musk said earlier this year, calling it an Airbnb model for cars. “You will be able to add or subtract your car to the fleet.”

Musk says Tesla also can move fast to deploy taxis now because of his decision to rely only on cameras for the cars to navigate, unlike Waymo, which has gone a more expensive route by supplementing its cameras with lasers and radar.

“Tesla will have, I don’t know,” Musk mused in an conference call with investors, ”99% market share or something ridiculous.” Given Waymo's head start and potential competition from Amazon and others, dominating the driverless market to that extent could be a reach.

But Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst and big Musk fan, says this time Musk may actually pull it off because of Tesla's ability to scale up quickly. And even skeptics like Morningstar's Goldstein acknowledge that Musk occasionally does gets things right, and spectacularly so.

He upended the car industry by getting people to buy expensive electric vehicles, brought his Starlink satellite internet service to rural areas and, more recently, performed a gee-whiz trick of landing an unmanned SpaceX rocket on a platform back on earth.

“Maybe his timelines aren’t realistic,"" Goldstein says, “but he can develop futuristic technology products.”",https://images.wral.com/asset/news/technology/2025/06/22/22060027/6857d44050278-media_6fe8677645b245b386a61bf067c2adcb-DMID1-67e2zktiq-640x480.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 08:59:29.297064

The current U.S. climate resiliency policy has no chance to protect us from ever-worsening, billion-dollar-plus severe weather events.
Unfortunately, the public places their trust in elected leaders and feels reassured that appropriate action is being taken regarding climate change.
The climate change threat can be a revenue-generating opportunity because America’s greatest asset is our innovative people.","Robert ""Jaz"" Jastremski, founder of Mystic Innovations Group, Inc., and a former project manager at Electric Boat, believes applying holistic engineering principles could help mitigate our climate crisis. But he says U.S. policies both past and present are not in tune with current realities and are only delaying long-term solutions. He believes focusing on climate resiliency is the key to forging a better future, and his nonprofit Climate Adaptive Solutions is dedicated to shifting public perception away from accepting carbon reduction policies as the key to fighting climate change.

Early in his career, as the team leader at Electric Boat responsible for developing design and performance specifications for the Trident submarine, Jastremski underwent specialized government training in holistic assessment methods. He also served as the senior vice president for strategic planning and business development at Analysis & Technology, formerly headquartered in North Stonington and now dispersed into several companies. His Mystic Innovations company demonstrated the feasibility of all-electric submarines, a potential major cost saver.

As a systems engineer, Jastremski approaches problems from a holistic, big-picture perspective, integrating information from technical, financial and other relevant fields to devise creative solutions verified by rigorous testing. He likens this approach to the Romans' use of holistic engineering to create their enduring marvels, such as the aqueduct system. Jastremski believes that a similar methodology could address current national challenges and empower citizens to demand action or accountability from political leaders. He asserts that the processes established by the Founding Fathers are outdated, contributing to public dissatisfaction demonstrated in the consistently poor performance ratings for Congress and the White House.

Jastremski is also the author of ""Working World Mentor,"" offering specific advice focused on achieving career success and dealing with inter-personal challenges. The Day's Business Editor, Lee Howard, conducted a series of interviews with Jastremski over recent months, covering significant issues facing the United States, including climate change, Congress, the national debt and China's effect on the U.S. manufacturing industry. These interviews will be published in a series over the coming months.

What makes you so sure that climate change is a real problem and not a hoax, as some seem to believe?

The climate change debate, hoax or real, is about whether human activity or natural planetary cycles are the cause of global warming. To me, it is irrelevant because the issue the U.S. needs to immediately address is the growing frequency of severe weather catastrophes. Regardless of the root cause of worsening weather events, it is a national responsibility to implement defensive measures to mitigate the effects of rapidly increasing severe weather impacts, including flooding, wildfires, unbearable heat, water shortages and high windstorm damage. It should be a national imperative to prioritize the development of technology and new methods to adapt to this current undeniable reality. Had all world air pollution and rain forest clear-cutting ended 75 years ago as scientists warned, it might have slowed global warming. But it did not happen, and the predicted consequences came true.

Our atmosphere already retains centuries of pollutants to form the greenhouse gas layer that 97% of scientists believe causes global warming. The analogy would be akin to merely slowing down the amount of water entering an already-flooded basement and expecting it will help the basement dry out, which makes no sense. In 2022, our politicians made a technically naive climate resiliency policy targeting zero U.S. carbon emissions by 2050. It assumes, without supporting technical and financial analysis, that it is practical and affordable to replace all fossil fuel use with alternative energy. This policy misleads the American public and makes it harder to focus on the only strategy that makes sense which is a national goal to develop innovations to adapt and survive worsening SWIs (sever weather impacts).

The current U.S. climate resiliency policy has no chance to protect us from ever-worsening, billion-dollar-plus severe weather events. Unfortunately, the public places their trust in elected leaders and feels reassured that appropriate action is being taken regarding climate change. Politicians have chosen to select a carbon reduction strategy, where validation of expected benefit cannot be measured for lifetimes, even centuries. A risk avoidance approach involves planning for worst-case scenarios based on the assumption that slowing global warming is unrealistic because it depends on unattainable worldwide cooperation. It is crucial to develop innovative adaptations to mitigate severe weather impacts. Evidence supports this strategy over reducing emissions, which has not demonstrated measurable deterrence but rather represents wishful thinking.

Wouldn't your approach be more expensive, more all-encompassing and possibly a greater burden on taxpayers than the green policies that are now often mentioned to try to cut down on carbon emissions?

Absolutely not! Investing in carbon reduction through wind and solar farms, with the expectation of widespread adoption of electric vehicles and replacement of gas and diesel engines across the country, is impractical. Certainly, reducing energy costs with solar panels or windmills makes sense for individual situations, just not on scale for eliminating everything that emits carbon pollution. For example, consider the substantial cost required to convert 175,000 filling stations and their half-million employees to charging stations. Consumers are unlikely to abandon functional fossil fuel vehicles in favor of entirely electric replacements. Oil-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia, which possess over a century's worth of supply and established extraction facilities, can reduce prices to encourage the continued use of gasoline vehicles. Adaptation technology provides a significant return on investment while green policies are insufficient to reverse the severe-weather trend.

An example of effective innovation is New York City's flood protection system developed after Superstorm Sandy caused $34 billion in damage to underground infrastructure. With an investment of $1.5 billion, the city now has available Kevlar tunnel and subway entrance-sized inflatable ""plugs."" This preventive measure may yield a return on investment of $50-200 billion in cost avoidance, depending on the frequency of future flooding events. This idea was proposed by a citizen shortly after the storm and I read about it then in the New York Times.

Relying on green policies to mitigate severe weather impacts dangerously provides false reassurance and misguides younger generations into pursuing green careers instead of focusing on adaptation solutions.

One of your arguments for your approach is that the United States alone cannot stop climate change; wouldn't your ideas to seek engineered solutions still have to assume that other countries buy in as well?

Our focus should be on defending the U.S. from severe weather events without needing global coordination. The Paris Accord demonstrates the difficulty in achieving global cooperation. Some economies still rely on fossil fuels, and green policies will not effectively stop climate change within a few lifetimes. Climate change is unstoppable.

Currently, our political leaders will not work hard to do what every family must do, which is if your income does not support essential expenses, figure out how to earn more. Creating innovations to mitigate or prevent growing cost of severe weather impacts will generate economic growth. The climate change threat can be a revenue-generating opportunity because America’s greatest asset is our innovative people.

Defending against climate change depends on each country's priorities and affordability. Other countries lead in adaptation solutions: the Netherlands manages sea level rise, China built an 800-mile aqueduct, Australia uses drones for early fire detection and immediate fire suppression, and several countries excel in seawater desalination.

Who would be responsible for implementing your policy ideas? How would they be turned into laws? Do you have any estimate of the cost, and over what time period these policies would be in effect? Is there any place in your policy prescriptions for encouraging electric cars, reducing greenhouse gases, or de-emphasizing fossil fuels, among other issues?

I, with others, drafted a national action plan to safeguard against global warming harm. The Constitution requires government by and for the people, but elected officials often prioritize personal agendas over public concerns. Adaptation policy success may require significant public demand for action to mitigate severe weather impacts. The initial objective is to raise public awareness of a national threat and prompt officials to understand the urgency of adaptation innovation.

The plan includes establishing an adaptation innovations industry with tasking, timing, phased cost estimates, ROI measures and public engagement. A suggestion is to allocate a small fraction of the remaining $600 billion or so from the Inflation Reduction Act to start developing climate adaptation solutions. Collaboration with experts from federal and state agencies, first responders, severe weather impact victims and academia will establish innovation requirements. I believe that climate resiliency funding for 20,000 Climate Corps jobs exists, and this initiative would leverage that workforce to the adaptation goal. Any organization with solution ideas will be able to bid on government solicitations.

A White House or Congressional special project, named the “Climate Adaptation Industry Development Initiative,” should evolve independently to find optimal solutions. It must be streamlined and free from bureaucratic delays, as severe weather impact recovery costs increase by $2 billion weekly. Phase One involves planning project tasks, identifying participants, assigning responsibilities and focusing on one severe weather topic for the quickest path to promising innovation investments. Over the long term this project team would dissolve and coordination between companies that innovate protective products and services would be done through a professional association like exists for many industries.

Efforts to inform senators, the White House, and others have been ignored. Attempts to contact President Biden and Senators Murphy and Whitehouse received deflective responses and/or donation requests. Summaries sent to President Trump, Elon Musk and Stephen Miller have gone unanswered.

Homeowners, schools, communities or businesses should adopt alternative energy methods or use EVs where economically or otherwise beneficial for themselves, just do not believe it will help solve global warming.

How do you feel about wind energy, solar power and nuclear solutions? Are there other energy gamechangers on the way?

The challenge of scale is often misunderstood. Wind, solar, hydropower and fuel cells can supplement traditional electric generation for small entities using clean energy sources. However, large projects like the Northern Atlantic 16,000-generator offshore wind farm have doubled electric rates due to high startup costs, making grid-size alternate energy less attractive compared to nuclear power. There are 440 commercial nuclear power plants operating in 30 countries. China and Russia are both committed to producing about 30 nuclear plants each. Nuclear power has been proven to be safe after 50 years of service for naval submarines and aircraft carriers as well as the 54 commercial nuclear power plants across the U.S. Lessons were learned from the Three Mile Island near disaster in 1979, in an NRC-sponsored contract to optimize operator training. My colleague, Mitch Henderson, led the operator task analysis team which resulted in much better operator confidence and that course is used today.

Distant future electricity needs may be met by safer nuclear options like thorium. Bill Gates is investing in this research. ExxonMobil explores hydrogen from water as clean fuel, though scaling remains a challenge. These novel energy innovations are unlikely to deploy within the next 20 years or later and cannot be relied on until proven.

Many recent climate policies have been at the whim of various administrations. How do we get both parties onboard, so this becomes less of a political hot potato?

Uniting political parties on climate policy requires unrelenting public demand for immediate action. Citizens should be informed about national climate policy misdirection and demand adaptation technology development support. Gen Z must lead the charge to pressure members of Congress as they will inherit the results, but I do not know how to reach them via social media.

Financial control is also a concern. Current policies reduce tax revenue, but eliminating debt requires more revenue. Immediate investment in adaptation innovation is crucial to reduce recovery expenses, averaging $2 billion per week and projected to escalate by 2050. Past urgency shows the need for focus on adaptation rather than emissions reduction alone. Emphasizing adaptation with younger generations and that what they inherit is a good reason to influence bipartisan support now. Using funds from the Inflation Reduction Act for adaptation projects could unify climate defense efforts. Public figures could help raise awareness and drive demand for action from Congress and the president.

You have mentioned your deep concern for the future as you recently reached your 80th birthday. Discuss the sense of urgency you feel and why others should share this sentiment.

I want every American to act urgently to address our country's shortcomings. Dysfunction among elected officials has hindered financial control and accountability, leading to a perilous future. Warnings that would have prevented 9/11 were ignored, and now we face harmful, severe weather patterns due to global warming. Despite decades of scientific warnings and literature like ""Disaster Resilience: A National Imperative,"" a 2012 call to national action by findings of a National Academy of Sciences investigative team, there has been no legislative action on meaningful climate resilience adaptation. Our leaders tend to react to disasters rather than prevent them. Severe weather patterns are worsening, and we must shift investment from emission reduction to adaptation defenses.

With my experience in military technology innovation and lobbying Congress, I understand the inner workings of Congress better than most. Our national leaders lack the expertise to tackle complex engineering challenges, risking a catastrophic future without immediate action. Future generations deserve our best efforts to leave America in optimal condition. Urgent public demand is crucial in addressing this clear national threat.

Personal note: In the mid-1990s, my daughter taught MIT's graduate course on the global environment during summers at a retreat facility in Switzerland.

'So until we see more exploration successes (with geologic hydrogen) it's going to be a very small process.","Emerging science shows geologic hydrogen, created under the Earth's crust naturally, may exist in pools that can be extracted for clean energy.

A U.S. Geological Survey study of where geologic hydrogen could potentially be found shows Michigan as a particularly promising site.

Imagine an abundant form of energy that's so clean, when you burn it, it doesn't create carbon or greenhouse gases, it creates water. Imagine that, unlike oil and gas, where when you take it out of the ground it's gone, this underground energy source can be stimulated to keep reproducing itself, creating wells that never run out.

Now imagine that energy source being abundant beneath the surface of the United States — and that Michigan, in particular, is teeming with it.

Emerging science is showing all of the above appears true, but there is a lot more work to do before this potentially revolutionary energy source can be unlocked on a large scale.

It's not some exotic, newly discovered element, but the most ubiquitous one in the universe: hydrogen. It's been used for years in producing metals, in hydrogenating cooking oils for better shelf life, and in the creation of ammonia for nitrogen-based fertilizers used on farm fields across the globe. But that hydrogen comes at a cost, from applying electricity to water — H₂O, two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom — to separate the two elements and retain the hydrogen. Natural gas is often used to provide the energy for that process, but that's expensive and, while better than coal or oil, still pollutes the atmosphere. Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are also being applied to this hydrogen extraction process, but it's difficult and costly to do at scale.

Hydrogen is created naturally underground through a reaction between water and certain iron-rich rocks, a process known as serpentinization, or through radiolysis, where natural radiation deep in the Earth breaks down water molecules to produce hydrogen. But scientists for generations — to the extent they thought about geologic hydrogen at all — considered it so diffusive and reactive they believed most was dissipated or converted to some other compound. Historically, when hydrogen pockets were discovered in drilling or mining, it wasn't identified or quantified. Rather, it was often considered a nuisance to remove so that miners and drillers could get what they really were after: oil, gas, and minerals.

Scientists only recently discovered that geologic hydrogen potentially remains trapped in rock layers in pools that could be tapped, maybe even on a commercial scale.

An old water well drilling in the late 1980s in the African nation of Mali, capped after flammable hydrogen exploded, was tested by an exploration company as a potential energy source many years later — and ended up powering a nearby village for years, carbon-free. That discovery, along with others around the world and in the United States, has enthusiasm on the rise.

In a study published earlier this year, geologists with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed a multifaceted map of the prospectivity of geologic hydrogen in the continental United States. They looked for areas with all the right ingredients: a source of sufficient hydrogen generation — iron-rich rock is an important catalyst; porous underground reservoirs for storage, and a sufficient layer of sealing cap rock to contain the hydrogen pools and prevent leaking.

The study found that a large swath through the middle of the country has great potential to contain collected pools of geologic hydrogen — and Michigan, in particular, was one of the areas that really showed promise.

""The source of the hydrogen, the reservoir and the seal, Michigan, in particular, happens to have all of these ingredients all overlaid with one another, plus a handful of other things that we mapped out,"" said Jane Hearon, a USGS geologist and co-author of the study.

""It was kind of interesting and fun to see Michigan light up that way because you don't think of it as like a Texas, one of these states that has a long-standing tradition of energy production.""

And while one path of research is looking into where geologic hydrogen may be naturally occurring, another is looking into places with the right rock formations and other ingredients where the gas may be stimulated into existence and produced, through injection of water into rock and perhaps with some catalysts such as other elements and microbes, said USGS geologist Sarah Gelman, a co-author on the prospectivity mapping study.

Then-President Joe Biden's Department of Energy, in February 2024, announced $20 million in grants to 16 institutions looking into geologic hydrogen's energy potential, including 10 institutions working on stimulated hydrogen projects.

""It's a bit simpler versus finding the accumulations, because you just go where the right rocks are,"" Gelman said. ""But it's got a lot of engineering challenges, and that's where that body of research (is needed).""

Stimulated hydrogen holds promise for iron-rich regions without natural underground reservoirs for accumulating naturally created hydrogen, such as ""the Upper Peninsula and into Minnesota,"" she said.

""It doesn't mean all hope is lost there,"" Gelman said. ""There is some good, good potential (for stimulated hydrogen production).""

170,000 years' worth of energy, created by the Earth

The Earth has produced enough hydrogen under its crust to meet the entire planet's energy needs for 170,000 years — but most of it is lost or inaccessible, said Christopher Ballentine, a professor of geochemistry at the University of Oxford in England.

""But what it does mean is we only need to find a small amount of it for it to be useful societally,"" he said.

Ballentine pointed to USGS studies showing there's potentially enough geologic hydrogen which ""has the potential to be found and discovered and produced"" to meet society's increasing hydrogen demands for the next 200 years.

That has piqued the interest of the oil, gas and mineral extraction world.

[ Help us improve the Free Press experience! Take our short survey. ]

""The industry is following the money,"" Ballentine said. ""About five years ago, there were zero companies in this space. Two years ago, there were 40. There are probably double that today.""

But prospectivity means places where stored, naturally occurring underground hydrogen may be, where the conditions are ripe for it. But it's not a certainty, and searching for it is a costly process that oil and gas production companies approach carefully.

""There are a lot of smaller startups, a lot of independent new companies that are interested in this,"" Gelman said. ""The oil majors are often interested and sitting back and watching a little bit, but they will be the fast followers.""

""We want to get to the wells — that's the exciting part; they actually call it the rotary lie detector, where you figure out what's down there. But there is a lot of groundwork and geology that we're trying to provide to American industry and American policymakers to try and help ease this initial stage.""

Interest, but not much activity so far in Michigan

Current U.S. exploration and drilling for geologic hydrogen occurs most intensely in Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa, along the Midcontinent Rift, a geologic formation in the middle United States, where the Earth's crust began to pull apart millions of years ago, a formation that also runs through Michigan as well and contributes to its prospectivity.

HyTerra, a Subiaco, Washington-based subsidiary of an Australian exploration company seeking natural hydrogen and helium, is drilling above and near the Midcontinent Rift in eastern Kansas, in areas where hydrogen was observed in historic oil and gas wells. They've found both elements and are now adding more wells to appraise and define the potential resource, said Avon McIntyre, the company's executive director and chief technical officer.

""We are excited by what we are seeing so far,"" he said.

While it's still very early on, there is rapidly growing interest in geologic hydrogen — sometimes called white hydrogen, McIntyre said.

""The possibility of an extremely useful, low-carbon commodity naturally occurring in places we have not properly looked is a compelling one,"" he said.

""Hydrogen is used for so many purposes, from industrial feedstock through to an energy source, that wherever it may be found, it is likely there will be someone nearby to whom it will be useful.""

But even exploratory drilling for geologic hydrogen hasn't occurred in Michigan — yet.

""We’ve been following the increased attention on geologic hydrogen, and the prospectivity map certainly shows Michigan in the darkest blues for prospectivity,"" said Adam Wygant, director of the Geologic Resources Management Division of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.

""Our sense is there is a fair amount of research going on and companies looking at potential in Michigan,"" both for naturally occurring underground pools and for stimulated hydrogen production.

State officials are encouraging any companies doing geologic testing to include hydrogen in their tests, to better learn where it's found and help zero in on those more costly exploration methods, Wygant said.

Michigan is prepared to regulate any hydrogen production activities through its existing laws, and is monitoring other states where geologic hydrogen exploration is farther along to help identify administrative rules and procedures, he said. The actual extraction process would not be remarkably different from an oil or natural gas well.

""But the hydrogen molecule is a little different from a methane molecule — it’s pesky; it doesn’t like to be contained,"" Wygant said.

""There are specialty products that would be used in well construction, in cements, in surface infrastructure, to properly maintain it.""

Finding the recipe for reproducing hydrogen underground

Multiple avenues of geologic hydrogen research are under pursuit at Sandia National Laboratories, a federally owned facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, operated by a subsidiary of Honeywell International that works on advancing science on energy, national security and other issues.

The lab is participating in a research project experimenting with certain rock types and characterizing how much hydrogen they produce under different conditions, the keys to producing stimulated hydrogen.

""They're doing microbes, catalysts, different chemicals, steam, working at different temperatures,"" said Sandia geologist Franek Hasiuk. ""Right now, the race is to find the right recipe, and there have been early positive results with some of these techniques.""

""We can either do those chemical reactions down in a well deep underground, or we can even do it at a mine, and it's actually a way we could use old mine tailings and mine waste to produce new energy and new revenue streams that can help clean up those mine wastes.""

Sandia is also funding an internal research and development project on the molecular and atomic processes involved in geologic production of hydrogen.

""There is a long way to go; there is still a lot to discover,"" said Donald Conley, acting senior manager of the Geosciences Research and Applications Group at Sandia.

""We are guiding the conversation to what's next for geologic hydrogen. Once we find all these discoveries, how do we make it a viable part of the U.S. energy economy?""

An accidental find helps an African village meet its power needs

Workers drilling a water well in the village of Bourakėbougou in the African nation of Mali in 1987 accidentally hit a vein of geologic hydrogen — a discovery confirmed after a worker lit a cigarette and the gas exploded. The well hole was capped with cement for safety reasons and forgotten until 2012, when Hydroma, a company based in Canada, began a pilot project combusting the hydrogen from the well to produce electricity for the village.

""For more than 7 years, the village of Bourakébougou benefited from free electricity without CO₂ emissions,"" the company states on its website. The company has since proven the existence of other nearby pools of geologic hydrogen, has expanded its footprint in other parts of Africa, and has opened a U.S. division.

A reservoir of geologic hydrogen discovered at an abandoned chromium mine in Albania, and reserves discovered in France's Lorraine region, have also sparked development interest.

While geologic hydrogen discoveries and their benefits may be at first localized, that's not a new story, Hasiuk said.

""When the oil and gas industry started, it was also just like that, very localized pockets where you had oil seeping out of the ground,"" he said. ""In one place, they would use it to line the outside of ships to make them waterproof, or they'd use it in making patent medicines and things like that. It was really when we started moving from collecting it from places where it seeped out of the ground to drilling nearby that we were able to unlock these larger volumes.""

Drilling is very expensive, and companies today generally do it only when they have really good information, he said.

'So until we see more exploration successes (with geologic hydrogen) it's going to be a very small process. But just like with the start of the oil industry, once people started being very successful, then the exploration activities spread rapidly across the country and across the world.""

The cautions and tempered expectations are repeatedly cited, but the excitement about geologic hydrogen's possibilities is undeniable.

""If we can prove this concept and reproducibly find natural hydrogen, it will be a game-changer,"" Ballentine said. ""It will potentially provide a transition of green energy from wind, from solar to a hydrogen economy.""

Drilling is very expensive, and companies today generally do it only when they have really good information, he said.

'So until we see more exploration successes (with geologic hydrogen) it's going to be a very small process. But just like with the start of the oil industry, once people started being very successful, then the exploration activities spread rapidly across the country and across the world.""

The cautions and tempered expectations are repeatedly cited, but the excitement about geologic hydrogen's possibilities is undeniable.

""If we can prove this concept and reproducibly find natural hydrogen, it will be a game-changer,"" Ballentine said. ""It will potentially provide a transition of green energy from wind, from solar to a hydrogen economy.""

What's happening?

Federal lawmakers are currently discussing a budget bill proposed by Congressional Republicans that could dismantle, among other things, huge portions of the Inflation Reduction Act — perhaps most notably, the tax breaks and incentives available for solar-energy projects.

EnergySage, a solar energy consulting company and independent source of industry information, has reported on the massive impact this could have on green-energy jobs.

Nowhere might this be more evident than in Nevada. If the bill passes as is, the company warns, Nevada could lose nearly 22,000 clean-energy jobs.

""From solar production to lithium mining, Nevada is at the forefront of the clean energy revolution,"" Senator Catherine Cortez Masto said in a statement to EnergySage. ""Dismantling the IRA tax credits will destroy thousands of good-paying, union jobs, raise energy costs for working families, and shrink the Silver State's [gross domestic product].""

Nevada is a clean-energy leader and has the highest solar generation per capita among all states, according to EnergySage.

Nevada Senator Jacky Rosen, the company also noted, posted on social media in mid-May that the passage of the current proposal could mean that ""NV will lose thousands of good-paying jobs and families will see higher energy bills.""

In mid-June, the Indianapolis Star reported that data from the Solar Energy Industries Association indicates that ""roughly 4,000 solar jobs in Indiana that could be at risk"" if the bill were to be approved in its current form. In their own mid-May statement, the SEAI said the budget, as drafted at the time, could ""result in nearly 300,000 current and future American jobs to be lost, including 86,000 in solar manufacturing.""

Why does this matter?

In April, Nevada had the highest unemployment rate of all U.S. states. Big hits to major employers could be another blow for residents and especially families, who could lose out on income and employment benefits like health insurance.

As the drafted budget bill is also currently poised to roll back the government-funded insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid, the effects could be compounding. Those compounding effects could also show up for consumers who had planned to lower their utility bills by installing clean-energy options like home solar systems, which can bring energy costs down to nearly $0 a month in some cases.

Among the many proposed cuts in the GOP's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" are those aimed at the Investment Tax Credit, also known as the Solar Credit, which currently covers 30% of installed solar-panel system installation costs.

As PV Magazine has reported, the draft from the Senate Finance Committee would cut the ITC to 60% of its current value by the end of 2026, to 20% by the end of 2027, and scrap it altogether for projects beginning in or after 2028.

Solar is the fastest-growing electricity source in the U.S., and with new breakthroughs happening all the time to make solar panels even more efficient, anything that slows its growth could spell bad news for the economy domestically and the environment worldwide.

What can I do about this?

With the future of renewable-energy credits uncertain, anyone interested in getting solar panels may want to act quickly.

Purchasing solar panels before the credits are cut back by Congressional action could mean thousands of dollars saved in your household budget. In fact, EnergySage estimates that, by using its free services, the average person can shave up to $10,000 of installation costs.

EnergySage even has a free mapping tool that shows, for each state, the average cost of a home solar-panel system, as well as available incentives. By using the free map, listed incentives, and installation-comparison tools, consumers can ensure they find the best price from a trusted company.

As the bill has not yet been passed, those wishing to voice their thoughts about the budget proposal and its potential effects still have time to reach out to their elected officials.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/clean-energy-jobsimage-rec5WzCPwhxPXPqWM.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 05:01:30.486801

These strategic investments in advanced energy manufacturing, electric transportation, and electric grid resilience are powering job creation, revitalizing rural areas, and positioning South Carolina as a national leader in American-made energy. These clean energy tax credits are critical for businesses, like mine, here in South Carolina in order to maintain investment and continue growing the manufacturing base within the Palmetto State.

South Carolina’s power grid — like much of the nation’s — is aging and under rising pressure.

Demand from data centers, manufacturing expansions, and electric vehicles is expected to surge over the next decade. In South Carolina, the commercial and industrial electricity rates are 10.97 cents/kWh and 7.01 cents/kWh, respectively, and both are below the national average.

However, electricity rates are up almost 6% from the year prior. Reduced incentivized investment in clean energy infrastructure could lead to even higher prices due to a reliance on more expensive, traditional power sources. Strategic energy investments, supported by stable tax policies, will help us avoid future grid shortfalls, prevent the risk of rolling blackouts, and reduce long-term energy costs for South Carolina families and businesses.

Tax credits are not a new concept — they have been a bipartisan policy tool used for decades to support emerging technologies. From artificial intelligence to biotechnology, to government investments driving technologies like GPS and the internet, these investments have repeatedly demonstrated their value. Clean energy technologies are no exception.

In 2024, over 2,600 megawatts of solar energy capacity came online in South Carolina, equating to enough power to supply 325,640 homes.

Over the next five years, South Carolina is projected to add over 2,500 megawatts of solar capacity.

Retaining the existing energy tax credits will allow businesses in South Carolina to continue to develop and deploy renewable energy technologies which are vital to improve grid resiliency, promote greater efficiency that results in lower energy costs for everyone, and foster economic opportunities in our rural communities.

Energy diversification mirrors a sound investment portfolio. Just as diverse assets protect against market volatility, multiple energy sources safeguard against physical and cyber threats. In addition, if we’re manufacturing these technologies here in South Carolina, we are securing our energy independence by growing our ability to produce what we need at home and having greater control over our supply chain.

Businesses have planned with these tax incentives in mind and rely upon them for capital allocation, planning, and project commitments — all of which would be threatened by the whiplash of major changes to these credits or further restrictions.

We’ve already seen a taste of what this disruption can do.

Recent federal changes and uncertainty have led to an indefinite pause in the construction of the AESC manufacturing facility in Florence, a $1.6 billion investment that promised to create 1,600 jobs in the Pee Dee.

A full repeal of these vital credits would undermine significant progress made in clean energy innovation, economic growth, and national security, and likely cede jobs and progress to China.

Now it’s up to our elected officials on Capitol Hill to decide whether these clean energy tax credits continue as Congress intended in 2022.

These private and public investments will spur domestic production of clean energy technologies which will set the United States up to compete in the global clean energy economy and create thousands more in clean energy jobs that will benefit all South Carolinians.

South Carolina businesses are ready to build — ready to invest in local workers, modern energy systems, and secure supply chains. But we need policy certainty to stay competitive.

Keeping these energy tax credits will empower American enterprise, protect ratepayers, and secure South Carolina’s leadership in 21st-century manufacturing.

Chuck Grassley Defends Wind Energy After Trump Calls It 'Junk',Naomi LaChance,,,,,https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-gop-senator-grassley-defends-wind-energy-1235369588/,"Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) quickly said that wind energy is a key energy source in his state — and cheap.
“Iowans get 60% of their electricity frm wind energy It’s an important tool for America’s energy independence &2 keep Iowans’ utility bills low,” he posted on X. Grassley, who is even older than Trump, has been a champion of wind energy since he pushed legislation incentivizing wind energy in 1993.
When we get energy down, you know … this was caused by their horrible energy — wind.
You tell me that one, OK?” “I hate wind,” Trump reportedly said at Mar-A-Lago last year.
Trending Stories Trump’s attitude toward wind energy has had a palpable effect in the industry, E&E News reported.","President Donald Trump is ranting about wind power again, and a top Republican lawmaker is pushing back.

“Windmills, and the rest of this ‘JUNK,’ are the most expensive and inefficient energy in the world, is destroying the beauty of the environment, and is 10 times more costly than any other energy,” Trump posted on Truth Social. He added that renewables are mostly made in China. “It is time to break away, finally, from this craziness!!!” he wrote.

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) quickly said that wind energy is a key energy source in his state — and cheap. “Iowans get 60% of their electricity frm wind energy It’s an important tool for America’s energy independence &2 keep Iowans’ utility bills low,” he posted on X.

Grassley, who is even older than Trump, has been a champion of wind energy since he pushed legislation incentivizing wind energy in 1993.

As Senate Judiciary Chair, Grassley plays a key role in advancing Trump’s agenda in Congress. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the upper chamber.

Grassley also pushed back on Trump in April when the president called windmills “stupid” at a rally in Michigan. “I like to tell him, when he talks about wind energy killing birds, there are more birds that fly into the glass towers in Washington, D.C., including his, that kill more birds than wind energy does,” Grassley told Iowa station KCCI.

Despite Trump’s claims that windmills and other renewable energy sources are expensive, in real life, wind energy is a cheap source of power. Both wind and solar energy cost less than fossil fuels. Any increased prices are likely due to inflation.

Wind energy seems to occupy a lot of space in Trump’s mind. At a campaign event in Wisconsin last year, Trump appears to have said people aren’t eating bacon because wind energy is expensive.

“You take a look at bacon and some of these products — and some people don’t eat bacon any more,” Trump said. “We are going to get the energy prices down. When we get energy down, you know … this was caused by their horrible energy — wind. They want wind all over the place. But when it doesn’t blow, we have a little problem.”

Editor’s picks

In 2019, Trump claimed at a speech to the National Republican Congressional Committee that the noise from windmills causes cancer. “If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations, your house just went down 75 percent in value. And they say the noise causes cancer. You tell me that one, OK?”

“I hate wind,” Trump reportedly said at Mar-A-Lago last year.

At a rally last year in New Jersey, Trump made the false claim that aquatic wind turbines “cause tremendous problems with the fish and the whales.” He then compared a dead beached whale to former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

In 2023, he claimed windmills are driving whales “crazy” and killing them. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there is “no scientific evidence” that windmills are killing whales.

“The windmills are killing our country by the way,” Trump said earlier this month. He called them “the greatest scam in history. It’s the most expensive energy you can buy. They’re ugly.”

On Trump’s first day in office, he issued an executive order halting wind energy projects. More than a dozen attorneys general then sued the administration over the executive order. The Trump administration moved to dismiss the suit. Then, earlier this week, a judge said he plans to deny that motion, allowing the case to proceed.

State Rep. John Resman, an Olathe Republican, represents a district near the Panasonic plant.","Slumping Tesla sales, uncertainty around auto tariffs and proposed cuts to electric vehicle incentives could have serious implications for the new $4 billion Panasonic factory in De Soto, Kansas.

The sprawling complex is being built to make batteries for electric vehicles — specifically Teslas and other brands. As the factory nears completion, industry observers are watching worrisome changes in the market.

“There is cause for concern,” said John Higham, vice president of communications and media outreach for the Electric Vehicle Association.

Kansas lawmakers approved $829 million in tax incentives to lure the plant to the Kansas City suburbs. When the deal was announced in 2023, Panasonic promised as many as 4,000 jobs with an average salary of $50,000.

But the contract the company ultimately signed with Kansas doesn’t have any job or pay requirements. A local incentive deal with De Soto did include hiring quotas, but they are much lower than the number of jobs originally touted.

Critics warned when the deal was signed that the company was not required to follow through on its initial hiring promises. Now, there’s growing concern Panasonic will tap the brakes on hiring amid economic uncertainty.

“Are (jobs) at risk?” Higham said. “The only possible answer that anyone can give you is, yeah, maybe.”

Projections of a slumping EV market

The Beacon spoke with multiple people who said short-term hiring could be at risk, but most added that the Panasonic plant should be secure for the long haul. The company has already made substantial investments and the plant will ramp up production over a period of years.

Even so, there are several signs the EV market may not meet expectations in the coming years.

Notably, first-quarter revenue at Tesla was down 9% and net income was down 71%.

“Uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers,” the company said in an earnings presentation. “This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term.”

The company’s reference to “changing political sentiment” was widely seen as an acknowledgement of the impact of Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s high-profile relationship with President Donald Trump, and a backlash from prospective customers who might otherwise buy the company’s vehicles.

Tesla sales dropped for the fifth straight month in Italy, Germany and Britain in May. In Britain, Tesla sales dropped 45% in May. Fewer U.S. customers are buying Teslas as well.

Tesla’s poor sales results come amid federal proposals that would discourage people from buying electric vehicles. Notably, Trump wants to eliminate the $7,500 tax credit that makes EVs cheaper.

A Harvard University study projects that future EV sales will fall if the tax credit goes away. Under existing law, EV sales could be 48% of new car sales by 2030. But that would drop to 42% of the market if the tax credit disappears. In the most extreme scenario, Harvard economists said EVs could plunge to 32% of new car sales by 2030.

There’s also federal legislation proposing to charge EV owners an additional $250 annually. Hybrid car owners would be charged an additional $100 annually.

That comes in addition to a pause on spending $3 billion to build new charging stations. Finally, there is ongoing uncertainty around tariffs — which can make batteries with foreign components more expensive to produce.

“It’s a … shame that the current administration has politicized it to the point that they’re ready to decimate this part of auto manufacturing … for political points,” Higham said.

Businesses rely on regulatory certainty to make plans, Higham said. Right now, he said fears of a recession and cuts at the federal level create uncertainty, “and businesses are going to respond to that with fear and trepidation.”

That means fewer capital investments and slower hiring, he said.

Joshua Jefferson, deputy secretary of business development with the Kansas Department of Commerce, said that Panasonic has diversified its battery offerings in response to the evolving market. The plant was initially touted as a Tesla and Toyota manufacturing plant. Now the company makes batteries for Lucid, Hexagon Purus and Harbinger Motors.

What can Kansas do?

The Kansas City Star reported in 2022 that the state’s contract with Panasonic didn’t include job and pay requirements. But Panasonic has things it needs to do to get more than $800 million in state-approved tax incentives:

Spend $4 billion on the factory to get an estimated $500 million in incentives, by far the largest requirement for taxpayer dollars.

Stay in Kansas for at least 15 years.

Have an annual payroll of $234 million. It’ll then get $234 million in rebates over 10 years.

The Star reported in 2022 that Panasonic promised up to 4,000 jobs but refused to answer questions about an exact number of openings and pay. The De Soto City Council offered an estimated $229 million in tax-increment financing incentives if the company hired 2,500 full-time employees and invested $1 billion.

Panasonic has hired 660 people so far, Jefferson said. The company is planning a grand opening event on July 14, and Jefferson said the 660 figure is about right for a factory that hasn’t made a single battery.

Jefferson emphasized that these incentives are only given if Panasonic invests in Kansas and hires locally. He also noted that the incentives aren’t handed out in one big chunk. It’ll take years for every dollar to be awarded.

Jefferson said the investment is already paying off — De Soto was able to lower its taxes because of the additional sales tax brought in during the plant’s construction.

He stands by the contract the state signed.

“If we would have changed one thing in this package,” Jefferson said, “the deal would have gone somewhere else … These types of deals unfold in a very real, intentional way.”

Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, has been sounding the alarm for years about what he sees as a poorly written contract.

LeRoy said if he could, he’d go back in time and tell Kansas to make the agreement all about jobs. He wants Panasonic to only get the taxpayer dollars if they hired enough people with good benefits at full-time hours and local hiring preferences and apprenticeship training programs.

The contract does require an average salary at the plant, but averages are not the perfect measure.

“Performance-based incentives just make more sense,” LeRoy said. “They’re more precise, they’re more calibrated, they’re more politically feasible.”

Reasons for optimism

As for Tesla, Musk said the EV market will turn around.

“I encourage people to look beyond the bumps and potholes of the road immediately ahead of us,” Musk said to Axios. “Lift your gaze to the bright shining citadel on the hill — I don’t know, some Reaganesque imagery — and that’s where we’re headed.”

Panasonic, which is in line to receive billions of dollars in federal tax incentives by 2032, declined interview requests for this story.

A February presentation from the company said it is harder to make money on battery sales because the EV market growth is slow, but battery development remains a top priority.

Top Panasonic officials did answer questions about U.S. tariffs and the De Soto plant during a recent investor call.

Yuki Kusumi, CEO of Panasonic, said he expects difficulties manufacturing batteries using Chinese components in American factories, but there’s no major financial concern.

There’s been no significant slowdown in demand, Kusumi said. Panasonic estimates U.S. tariffs will cost the company’s energy segment $540 million, but that’s just 1% of group sales.

The company’s larger concern is a potential recession that will discourage buying electric vehicles. Panasonic’s investor presentation said sales will pick up because of more affordable vehicles.

The Toyota Corolla Hybrid and Prius are both on the more affordable end. But Teslas are not affordable for working-class Americans, said economist Chris Kuehl.

Kuehl said that a few things are working against Tesla sales and EV sales.

Owning a Tesla signals certain political opinions that can scare off some customers. There are also concerns about the range of EVs and ability to find charging stations.

But the Panasonic plant doesn’t have to tie itself to Tesla forever. Both Kuehl and Higham said the factory could pivot to make batteries for other cars, energy storage devices or something else.

State Rep. John Resman, an Olathe Republican, represents a district near the Panasonic plant. He said the plant will create a strong workforce in the long run. Panasonic is a multinational corporation that can attract other businesses to the area. That’ll help.

And projected EV sales may drop in the short term, but not forever.

“EVs are not going away,” Resman said. “Every day you read about companies that have expanded the amount of miles that batteries can take a car, and they can recharge even quicker now than they have in the past. So the technology is there.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ddf04f4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+23/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthebeaconnews.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F03%2FUntitled-design-2.png,N,,2025-06-22 02:01:25.203168

On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order entitled Unleashing American Energy, which instructed federal agencies to immediately pause disbursement of funds provided by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and to submit a report to the Director of the National Economic Council analyzing its consistency with the order, which included funds set aside for clean energy projects. In the wake of the executive order, there is a widespread sense of uncertainty in the regulatory future of the clean energy industry under the current administration.

Amidst federal backstepping on clean energy, the state of California remains committed to promoting a clean energy transition. California has set ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals with the overarching goal to shift away from reliance on fossil fuels and towards increased reliance on renewable energy resources. Specifically, California has a goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 48% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 85% below 1990 levels by 2045. Progress towards these decarbonization goals on the state level will require the passage of new laws to incentivize renewable energy projects, encourage research into the viability of cleaner sources of energy, and promote a just transition. One source of energy that has become increasingly prominent is hydrogen, particularly green hydrogen, which is the process by which hydrogen is produced by using renewable energy sources to drive the electrolysis process by which water is broken down into its component parts — hydrogen and oxygen.

Senate Bill (SB) 1420 (Caballero) is a relatively new state law, which Governor Newsom signed into law on September 25, 2024, intended to incentivize green hydrogen projects. The bill was introduced by Senator Anna Caballero during the 2024 Legislative Session. Senator Caballero is currently serving her second term representing the 14th State Senate district, which includes the majority of Merced, Madera, and Fresno Counties. Senator Caballero also serves as the Chair of the Appropriations Committee and a member of the Housing, Public Safety, Insurance, Judiciary, Energy, Utilities, and Communications Committee. SB 1420 aims to incentivize clean hydrogen projects and renewable energy projects by making more qualifying projects eligible for permit streamlining benefits, expedited review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and expedited judicial review of CEQA challenges.

The bill adds qualifying hydrogen projects as eligible for centralized permitting by the California Energy Commission (CEC) under its Opt-In Certification Program by expanding the definition of a “facility” to include qualifying hydrogen production or storage and processing facilities.

The bill makes more qualifying hydrogen projects eligible for expedited judicial review of CEQA litigation by expanding the definition of “energy infrastructure project” as defined in the Public Resources Code in two significant ways. First, SB 1420 expands the definition of “energy infrastructure project” by excluding “resources that combust biomass fuels” rather than all “resources that use biomass fuels.” Second, SB 1420 extends the definition of “energy infrastructure project” to include qualifying hydrogen production facilities and associated storage and processing facilities among the projects eligible for expedited review under CEQA. Prior to this bill, all “projects utilizing hydrogen as a fuel” were specifically excluded.

Under SB 1420, to qualify for expedited judicial review or the centralized permitting under the CEC Opt-In Certification Program, the hydrogen production or storage and processing facility must meet the following two criteria: the Facility must “not derive hydrogen from a fossil fuel stock” and the Project must have received funding from a listed funding source. The first requirement reflects the fact that the overall environmental impact of hydrogen as an energy source largely depends on the source of energy that drives its production. Modern technological advancements have led to the development of production processes that utilize renewable resources — instead of fossil fuels — in the hydrogen production process.

The second requirement is that the project must have received funding from one of the following three sources: (1) the state-funded Hydrogen Program under Public Resources Code Section 25664.1; (2) the 2024 climate bond approved by voters in the November 2024 election; or (3) the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (ARCHES) as awarded by the United States Department of Energy (DOE).

The latter of these funding sources has been in the news and is, as of the date of this article, in jeopardy as the current administration reconsiders funding awarded by the prior administration. In 2022, the federal government passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which set aside $7 billion in funding for the creation of the Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs Program (H2Hubs) to be awarded by the DOE. The purpose of the program funding was to encourage the creation of regional clean hydrogen hubs to create a national network that will ultimately lead to the formation of a national hydrogen economy. The California Hydrogen Hub, which proposed various hydrogen projects across the state, was among the projects selected to receive the H2Hubs designation and a $1.2 billion slice of the federal funding. On March 26, 2025, Politico reported that a list circulating within the DOE indicates that the California Hydrogen Hub is among the four H2Hubs that may face funding cuts related to the President’s executive order.

FORWARD LOOKING: PENDING BILLS IN THE 2025 LEGISLATIVE SESSION

AB 35 (Alvarez) would allow for limited CEQA review of an application for a discretionary permit or authorization for a clean hydrogen transportation project, which is defined as “a pipeline project composed of a system that transports hydrogen, and any associated facilities necessary for the system’s operation,” that meets stated criteria in the bill. The limited CEQA review involves completing a clean hydrogen environmental assessment rather than a full environmental impact report or mitigated negative declaration as is typically required by CEQA. The bill would also expedite the review process by requiring that the lead agency make its determination about whether to approve the clean hydrogen environmental assessment and issue the discretionary permit or authorization within 270 days of when the application is deemed complete. AB 35 has becme a two-year bill and will be re-considered by the Legislature in 2026.

SB 88 (Caballero) would require the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission to consider the potential of using biomass to produce low and negative carbon fuels, including hydrogen, in its reports and documents.

SB 714 (Archuletta) would state the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation to establish a Clean Energy Workforce Training Council to analyze the workforce and infrastructure needs as well as the needs of hydrogen and other clean energy technologies and a Zero-Emission Vehicle Workforce Development Pilot Project for use at community colleges. These programs would be under the purview of the Deputy Secretary for Climate within the Labor and Workforce Development Agency. SB 714 has become a two-year bill and will be re-considered by the Legislature in 2026.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-06/California%20folded%20map%20graphic_0.jpg?h=9ccdcaa6&itok=UGN4Eiaq,N,,2025-06-22 00:00:19.324821

But PHEVs are not the same, and as I’ve written, their limited EV range has held them back.","The U.S. market has seen Extended Range Electric Vehicles (EREVs) before. The BMW i3 was technically the first, though many consider the Chevy Volt the pioneer of the general concept. That concept being: You drive in electric mode until the battery dies, then a gas engine-generator charges the battery so you can go farther. But despite these two having existed in the U.S. market, we still have no idea how America is going to react to EREVs, which is wild to think about given that yet another automaker is looking to head that route according to a new report.

I was recently on a call with Bank of America’s senior analyst John Murphy, who was explaining to a group of journalists the contents of the company’s latest annual “Car Wars” market report. At the end of the call, I asked Murphy what his thoughts are on EREVs. Here’s what he replied:

“I think it’s an odd setup for a powertrain. I certainly think in some use cases — pickups and large SUVs, but in general I don’t think it’s going to become that pervasive.”

I’m not saying I think Murphy is wrong, but it seems to me that, at this point, it’s hard to know what’s going to happen. To be completely fair, I wrote “The Future Of The Auto Industry Is Electric, With A Gasoline Backup,” so I, too, am making guesses about how well the technology will do, but I have to admit that I just don’t know for sure.

What I do know is that the technology is awesome to live with day-to-day; I’ve been driving a BMW i3 Range Extender for years now, and it’s simply amazing. The reality is that America’s EV infrastructure isn’t good enough, and that people don’t want low-range EVs. As Murphy said on the all “[EV Range anxiety] is very real.” A Range Extender is a way to solve both problems without jamming a heavy, expensive battery under the floor.

I’m not the only one saying this; lots of automakers are heading down the EREV path. And I mean lots. Ford, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Jeep, Lotus, Scout, Ram and now BMW have indicated interest in bringing EREV technology to the marketplace.

I say “now” BMW, because there’s a new report from Automobilewoche that states that BMW — once the authority when it came to EREVs – has changed its mind on EREVs. From Automotive News:

BMW plans to revive its range extender technology, starting with a variant of the iX5 SUV, which is already in testing and could arrive in 2026, according to a report in Automotive News Europe sibling publication Automobilwoche.

The news signals a shift for BMW. In 2019 a leading executive was quoted as saying that there was “no future” for range extenders.

The comment came as BMW was looking to shift beyond its i3, which was offered as either a full-electric model or with a range extender in the early days of the transition to vehicles powered only by electricity. The aim of offering the system was to ease range anxiety.

The world watches as the Ram Ramcharger is expected to become the first EREV to enter the U.S. market since the BMW i3 bowed out in 2021. But the question is: How will it fare?

The BMW i3 and Chevy Volt were both relatively slow sellers, but we really shouldn’t draw any conclusions from that. Not only were these two vehicles part of a market segment that America just doesn’t care about anymore (small cars), but because they’re small cars they don’t really stand to benefit as much from EREV technology. Let’s be honest: The Volt and i3 would have probably been 40 MPG cars had they been powered solely by gas.

But as Murphy mentioned: Trucks and SUVs are a different ballgame. Getting an 18 MPG pickup truck to drive on electric power while offering significantly improved acceleration, plus plenty of range for towing — that’s a massive improvement for the buyer.

But at what cost?

That’s really the big question here. If I can buy a gasoline SUV for $40 grand, and — especially if EV tax credits go away as it seems they might — I have to spend $60 grand for an equivalent EREV, what’s the value to me as a consumer? Gasoline is fairly cheap, so it could take over a decade to make up $20 grand in fuel costs. Maintenance costs will help fill the gap, but it’ll take time, and I’m not sure any consumers think that far out. They want the car to bring them value now.

EREVs do promise to offer a cost advantage over full BEVs with similar capabilities (particularly in truck/SUV applications), so I can absolutely see them appealing to those who are already on the fence about buying a BEV. But will automakers actually price them below BEVs? I spoke with a Ram representative who said it’s possible they will price their EREV higher because technically it offers more performance than the BEV (basically, an EREV truck offers EV acceleration with gasoline truck-range: The best of all worlds — with maintenance being significantly less than a regular gas truck). I think not leveraging EV’s potential cost-savings over a BEV would be a mistake.

Then there’s the whole marketing element. EV diehards think EREVs are bad simply because they involve some amount of reliance on gasoline, and gasoline diehards basically just see EREVs as EVs (so many folks in the comments of Scout’s EREV social media posts say “This is cool, but too bad it’s electric!”). It will be challenging to solve that. Add to that the fact that “EREV” is just not sexy at all, and you’ve got a product with an uphill marketing battle. I’ve written about this before:

The term “EREV” needs to be out of the equation. It’s a jargon-y term, and it will not resonate with the public. I won’t pretend to know what the answer is exactly, but I’ve come up with a few fun terms. “Long-range plug-in hybrid” is one option. “Gasoline-Assisted EV” is another. The common thread between these two is: I don’t think shying away from the fact that gasoline is involved is the move. I think many people find comfort in gasoline propulsion, and using a name that implies there’s gasoline is a good thing.

We can look at the success of EREVs in China, but I don’t think we really have a great analog right now that helps us understand how EREVs are going to do stateside. Maybe we can look at plug-in hybrids? But PHEVs are not the same, and as I’ve written, their limited EV range has held them back. Toyota is still heading down the PHEV path, but it’s planning to crank up the range, per CNBC:

“We are going to grow our PHEV volume through the lineup over the next few years,” David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, told CNBC during a visit to the company’s North American headquarters. “We love the PHEV powertrain. We’re working to increase, perpetually increase, the amount of miles you can drive on EV-only range.”

Company sources said Toyota plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume last year to roughly 20% by 2030. However, they said that could change based on regulations, customer acceptance of electrified technologies and affordability, among other factors.

Toyota has been right about a lot of things, so I could see higher-range PHEVs catching on, and if so, I could see EREVs doing the same (note that the path to higher-range PHEVs is one that automakers, including Toyota, are traveling carefully). But there are just so many factors in play — fuel prices, EV incentives, marketing, product execution, infrastructure developments, MSRPs and on and on.

With so many factors in play, it just makes it that much more important for automakers to make a great product. Build an excellent vehicle that meets customers’ needs and exceeds their expectations, at a price that they feel is competitive with vehicles that offer similar performance, and I believe it will sell. All this potential confusion about how EREVs work and infrastructure implications and EV incentives and cost savings over gas cars and on and on can largely be thrown out the window if you can get the world to think your vehicle is extremely badass and a good value.

I’m rooting for EREVs solely because I want others to experience the unmatched combination of EV performance and gasoline convenience that I get to enjoy everyday while driving my BMW i3. But in truth, I don’t know how it’s going to shake out; I don’t think anyone really knows at this point.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill.
The Senate bill doesn’t include such a provision.
The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.","WASHINGTON (AP) — House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.

Republicans in the two chambers don’t agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.

The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.

While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.

Here’s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:

Tax break for families

The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.

The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump’s second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.

Trump campaign promises

Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.

The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.

The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that’s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.

The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.

The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.

And on Social Security, the bills don’t directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

More SALT

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That’s a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

Medicaid providers

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

“This needs a lot of work. It’s really concerning and I’m really surprised by it,” he said. “Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.”

Tax breaks for business

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Clean energy tax credits

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden’s climate law. It aimed to boost the nation’s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

Odds and ends

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn’t include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

Why build gas plants that may rarely run when cheaper, cleaner, and domestically produced solar energy is so readily available?
China’s recent experience during periods of high global gas prices when gas plants simply shut down due to fuel costs further underscores this fundamental weakness.","Last Updated on:

In recent remarks, John Ketchum, CEO of NextEra Energy, laid out a curious and somewhat baffling narrative: renewables should serve as a transition solution toward expanding natural gas generation. Yes, you read that correctly. After decades of framing gas as a so-called “bridge fuel” to a renewable future, the argument has seemingly flipped on its head. We are now being asked to consider the most rapidly deployable, clean, cost-effective energy sources — wind, solar, and storage — as nothing more than a stopgap solution until we can build more expensive, slower-to-deploy fossil-fuel infrastructure. This logic would be amusing if it weren’t deeply troubling.

“We need a bridge to get ourselves to 2032 when that gas shows up,” Ketchum said. “And when that gas shows up, it’s going to be three times more expensive than it’s ever been.

In his defence, Ketchum’s comments came during the Politico Energy Summit in Washington, D.C., in June 2025, where he was responding to mounting political pressure from Republican-led efforts to roll back clean energy incentives and reinstate fossil fuels as the backbone of U.S. electricity policy. Speaking to an audience of policymakers and industry leaders, Ketchum was not advocating for gas over renewables per se, but rather highlighting that America needs new electricity in the next couple of years, not in the 2030s.

With electricity demand rising rapidly — driven by AI data centers, electric vehicles, and broader electrification — he argued that solar, wind, and storage are the only technologies capable of being deployed quickly enough to avoid reliability crises. While the framing was clumsy and widely criticized, his intent was to underscore that the real constraint isn’t ideology but timeline. Renewables are the only tools fast enough to respond to near-term demand.

So what’s going on with America’s ‘cheap’ gas generation. Right now, gas turbines face extended delivery times, often ranging from five to seven years due to global manufacturing backlogs. This may seem puzzling given that global gas demand growth is sluggish or declining in many key markets.

The primary driver of these delays isn’t surging worldwide demand for new plants, but rather a combination of limited manufacturing capacity, aging production infrastructure, and supply chain disruptions still lingering from the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions. Many turbine manufacturers reduced or consolidated their production capabilities in the past decade, anticipating a market shift toward renewables. The remaining factories operate at reduced throughput, struggling with workforce shortages, supply bottlenecks, and rising costs for critical materials. Ironically, this manufacturing crunch is partly the consequence of the market’s long-term move away from gas.

By contrast, large-scale solar installations and substantial battery storage facilities regularly come online in under two years. In essence, by the time your ordered gas turbine is finally delivered, permitted, constructed, and connected to the grid, the solar facility built simultaneously would have been generating electricity and revenue for several years. Investing in gas infrastructure under these conditions is akin to choosing dial-up internet service in an era of fiber optics: it might technically work, but the opportunity cost is enormous and the rationale dubious at best.

A closer look at the economics underscores the questionable logic behind new gas projects. Even in the historically gas-friendly U.S. market, renewable power and battery storage consistently offer lower levelized costs than new gas-fired plants. Lazard’s latest analysis shows utility-scale solar and wind projects frequently coming in well under the cost of combined-cycle gas generation. Beyond cost, renewables offer price certainty. Gas prices, on the other hand, remain volatile, swinging with global geopolitical events and commodity markets. Locking consumers and investors into this volatility seems not just financially imprudent, but borderline reckless.

The cost of new gas turbines has climbed sharply in recent years, compounding the case against new gas-fired generation. While solar panels and battery packs continue to decline in cost thanks to manufacturing scale and technological improvements, gas turbine prices have moved in the opposite direction. Supply chain disruptions, inflation in materials like steel and rare alloys, and constrained manufacturing capacity have pushed up the price of large turbines by up to 2.5 times what they were a few years ago.

What used to be a relatively economical technology for bulk power is now burdened with capital costs that often exceed $2,000 per kilowatt for combined-cycle installations. These increases make it harder for gas plants to compete with renewables on levelized cost of electricity, especially as storage fills in the flexibility role once held exclusively by gas. The notion that we should wait several years and pay a premium for a technology that is slower, dirtier, and more expensive than the alternatives already scaling today defies both logic and economics.

The rationale further crumbles when we examine headwinds for new gas generation region by region. In the United States, despite recent rollbacks by the Trump administration of EPA’s carbon capture requirements, gas plants still face significant resistance. Many states have adopted aggressive climate targets that implicitly or explicitly discourage new fossil fuel investment. Additionally, social license issues are intensifying. Communities and environmental advocacy groups routinely oppose new gas infrastructure, using litigation and public campaigns to stall or halt projects. Banks and institutional investors are likewise wary of backing gas plants due to increasing pressure from ESG (environmental, social, and governance) criteria, effectively choking off capital for gas development.

Europe is even less hospitable to new gas investment. With carbon prices under the EU Emissions Trading System hovering around €90 per ton, gas plants incur significant financial penalties merely for operating. Even without a formal ban, this carbon tax significantly diminishes the economic viability of gas generation compared to zero-carbon sources. European Union policies explicitly direct investment toward renewables and storage, creating strong economic disincentives for new gas plants. Germany’s abrupt reversal of its planned gas expansion in 2024 provides a stark example. Despite a perceived near-term need, German policymakers backed away from a major gas investment due to mounting economic risks, policy uncertainties, and vocal public opposition. Building more gas capacity in Europe today increasingly looks like trying to swim upstream against both regulatory currents and market realities.

India’s experience highlights yet another dimension of gas’s inherent drawbacks. High LNG import prices have rendered the majority of India’s existing gas power fleet uneconomic and idle. Utilization rates have plummeted to historically low levels, often hovering below 15%. With abundant and affordable solar power rapidly expanding across India, policymakers increasingly see little reason to prioritize gas. Plans for future gas capacity additions are minimal at best, as the country leapfrogs directly into large-scale renewable and storage solutions. Why build gas plants that may rarely run when cheaper, cleaner, and domestically produced solar energy is so readily available?

China provides perhaps the clearest illustration of gas generation’s flawed economic logic. Although China continues to add gas-fired capacity at significant scale, most new plants run at extremely low capacity factors. The reason is straightforward: imported gas is expensive, renewables are abundant and increasingly cheap, and coal remains economically preferable in many regions (although China is burning less coal in 2025). Despite official goals to boost gas usage for cleaner urban air, plants often sit largely idle, used only sporadically to meet peak demand. Building gas infrastructure with no clear economic viability, simply as an occasional backup, makes questionable sense when grid-scale battery storage, pumped hydro, and other alternatives can deliver similar peaking services more reliably and economically. China’s recent experience during periods of high global gas prices when gas plants simply shut down due to fuel costs further underscores this fundamental weakness.

At this point, one must pause to ask a very basic question: why exactly would we build more gas plants after deploying extensive renewable infrastructure? The arguments for gas typically emphasize its flexibility, grid reliability, and energy security. Yet battery storage technologies and advanced grid management are rapidly eroding these supposed advantages. Batteries provide instantaneous response and frequency regulation far superior to gas turbines. Storage solutions require no volatile fuel supply chains and produce no direct emissions. The flexibility once cited as gas’s key advantage is quickly becoming irrelevant.

From a climate perspective, expanding gas infrastructure after investing heavily in renewables is even more illogical. The International Energy Agency has explicitly cautioned that meeting global climate goals means halting new fossil fuel infrastructure immediately. Even ignoring emissions, stranded asset risk looms large. With renewables and storage prices continuing to plummet, gas plants built today may become economically obsolete long before their design lifetimes expire. Institutional investors are increasingly aware of this, shifting portfolios away from new gas exposure. Investing in gas now may soon feel like having poured money into coal plants ten years ago, regrettable, costly, and ultimately avoidable.

Viewed in totality, the notion of renewables as a mere stepping stone toward future gas expansion is economically backward and environmentally misguided. It defies common sense. Renewables and storage are not interim solutions, they are already economically superior, technologically viable, and widely deployable options that have reshaped the energy landscape. The question is not whether renewables can bridge us to a gas-dominated future, but rather why anyone would seriously consider reversing progress to revisit fossil fuels at all. It is time to recognize renewables and storage as the destination, not a convenient short term gap filler.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ChatGPT-Image-Jun-21-2025-03_52_00-PM-800x426.png,N,,2025-06-21 22:00:29.079399

Why It Matters

Trump's opposition to green tax credits represents a dramatic shift from renewable energy policies that have driven hundreds of billions in U.S. clean energy investments since 2022 during former President Joe Biden's administration.

Industry analysts warn that eliminating these incentives could cede America's competitive edge in clean technology manufacturing to China, potentially impacting national security and economic competitiveness.

The budget reconciliation bill's passage could fundamentally reshape America's energy landscape and manufacturing priorities.

What To Know

The president specifically targeted wind energy, claiming windmills are ""the most expensive and inefficient energy in the world"" and are ""destroying the beauty of the environment.""

The budget bill, currently moving through the Senate, would extend Trump's first-term tax cuts while eliminating or limiting clean energy incentives. The proposed legislation would phase out tax credits for electric vehicles, home energy efficiency improvements, and wind and solar farm development.

In his post, Trump claimed windmills are ""10 times more costly than any other energy"" and criticized government subsidies supporting renewable projects. However, Department of Energy (DOE) data contradicts these claims, showing wind and solar projects have become more economically competitive than gas, coal, or nuclear facilities.

The International Renewable Energy Agency reported that onshore wind costs fell 68 percent in 2021, with capacity increasing four-fold from 2010 to 2021.

Trump's windmill criticism extends beyond economics to aesthetics and environmental concerns, though his previous claims about turbines killing whales lack scientific evidence. The president has vowed not to subsidize new windmill farms during his second term, stating he doesn't ""want even one built.""

What People Are Saying

President Donald Trump on Truth Social on Saturday: ""I HATE 'GREEN TAX CREDITS' IN THE GREAT, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL. They are largely a giant SCAM. I would much prefer that this money be used somewhere else, including reductions. 'Anywhere' would be preferable! Windmills, and the rest of this 'JUNK,' are the most expensive and inefficient energy in the world, is destroying the beauty of the environment, and is 10 times more costly than any other energy.""

He added: ""None of it works without massive government subsidy (energy should NOT NEED SUBSIDY!). Also, it is almost exclusively made in China!!! It is time to break away, finally, from this craziness!!!

Elon Musk, in a post X, reposted his company Tesla Energy's post that warns against ending the energy tax credits in May: ""Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America's energy independence and the reliability of our grid - we urge the senate to enact legislation with a sensible wind down of 25D and 48e. This will ensure continued speedy deployment of over 60 GW capacity per year to support AI and domestic manufacturing growth.""

Mike Carr, Solar Energy Manufacturers for America, previously told Newsweek: ""A vote for this bill was a vote to close U.S. factories and concede manufacturing jobs of the most important energy resource of the 21st century to China.""

Abigail Ross Hopper, Solar Energy Industries Association, previously told Newsweek: ""If this bill becomes law, America will effectively surrender the AI race to China and communities nationwide will face blackouts.""

What Happens Next?

The Senate will consider the budget reconciliation bill, with clean energy advocates mobilizing opposition to the proposed cuts.

The bill details Trump’s intentions to use these “savings” to assist in making his 2017 tax cuts permanent, while also increasing military spending and supporting his crackdown on immigration. Additionally, Trump’s administration has sought to weaken limits on greenhouse gas emissions to encourage more production of oil, gas, and coal domestically, putting real commitment behind his famous slogan, “drill, baby, drill.”

On Monday, Senate Finance Committee Republicans released their revised version of Trump’s bill, cutting federal money for renewable energy, electric vehicles, and hydrogen fuel, while increasing subsidies for fossil fuels. In reference to the Republican package, Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, said the bill “will cook the planet and increase prices.” The Senate’s proposal comes two weeks after the House passed its own version of Trump’s bill that would roll back clean energy incentives entirely. It could take several months for the Senate version to pass. Rhodium Group, an independent research firm, says that the proposed legislation will “raise energy costs for American households by as much as 7% in 2035, stifle energy technology innovation, increase pollution, and could put a meaningful portion of half a trillion dollars of new manufacturing, industrial, and clean electricity investments across the country at risk.”

Scientists warn that this undoing of policies in the IRA will have detrimental effects on the climate, including an increase in the Earth’s average temperature by up to 3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century. Last year was the first year in which the global average temperature exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. That rise is already having major consequences, and is tied to increasingly frequent and extreme weather events, rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and major ecosystem shifts.

The fruit crop losses affect not just growers but also sellers, transporters, and packagers.

What happened?

Besides mango farmers, apple orchard owners face erratic weather patterns disrupting India's agriculture. On June 2, a hailstorm damaged 45-90% of potential apple harvests in at least 12 villages of Shopian district.

Locals said marble- or chickpea-size hail fell during a 15- to 35-minute downpour. ""My sister is getting married next month, and I had pinned all my hopes on this harvest. We are left with nothing,"" one farmer said, per Greater Kashmir.

In a FairPlanet interview, locals said hailstorms have become more common in Kashmir since 2022.

Why are erratic weather patterns concerning?

Rising global temperatures drive unpredictable weather that can wipe out harvests, ruin produce, and put pressure on both farmers and consumers. Meanwhile, lower yields and disruptions in produce storage and transport often lead to higher prices for consumers.

In the United States, producers of various fruits have also experienced weather-related crop failures. These include grapes in California ($272 million in losses), blueberries in Georgia and North Carolina ($49 million and $13 million), and strawberries in Florida ($7 million).

Around the world, extreme weather is affecting food supply chains. In Nepal and Côte d'Ivoire, prolonged drought has put livelihoods, nutrition, and mental health at risk with rising food costs.

Meanwhile, flooding in storm-battered Queensland and New South Wales led to steep hikes in produce prices.

What's being done to support farmers in the aftermath of hailstorms?

Jammu and Kashmir's agriculture minister pledged quick relief for affected Shopian farmers and proposed a weather-based insurance scheme after visiting the region.

However, the Kashmir Valley Fruit Growers Cum Dealers Union has long called for a comprehensive policy. The group wants the government to subsidize nets similar to what farmers use in Spain to protect crops from intense hailstorms.

Some environment-focused companies are monitoring hail events, which have become ""silent threats"" to global agriculture, including Kisters, which developed HailSens IoT for that purpose.

Individuals can support food security by choosing products grown through environmentally friendly farming or weather-resilient food systems that feature smarter irrigation, rotating crops, and planting drought-tolerant seeds.

Also, exploring public transportation options and modernizing homes can help reduce harmful pollution that fuels severe hail events. Staying informed about critical climate issues is another way to manage weather challenges.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/apple-crop-lossimage-recn3Vla5NyIlI9HC-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 21:02:11.108118

In the evening of April 8, more than 11% of Texas electricity was coming from batteries, a record.
Meanwhile, NERC expects batteries to juice roughly one-quarter of California’s peak power demand in coming months.
Rosenow, at Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute, said big batteries are surging and affordable enough that their adoption will steepen quickly.
Trump’s spending plan also threatens to throttle big batteries and green energy projects.","In any other year, May 14 may well have been a disaster in Texas.

Temperatures climbed to seasonal levels not seen in over a century: 92 degrees in Dallas, 95 in Houston and 104 in Laredo. Air conditioners hummed en masse and power demand surged. Meanwhile, scores of natural-gas powered generators were offline, getting tuned up for summer.

But Texas skies were pretty sunny and windy and startups had spent the preceding months building big banks of batteries to store electricity. When power demand peaked around 4:30 in the afternoon, almost half of the electricity on the grid was coming from renewables, according to the energy analytics platform GridStatus.IO. As the sun set, battery banks that had been soaking up electrons in the heat of the day stepped up to cover 8% of demand, keeping power flowing.

“Batteries are very good at handling these types of events,” said Andrew Gilligan, director of commercial strategy at Fluence Energy Inc., a battery developer with three storage sites in Texas. “Things have gotten a lot better than a couple years ago.”

This summer will be an energy doozy in the US as climate change exacerbates heat waves and a rash of new data centers and crypto mines come online. But these new power vacuums arrive in concert with a stack of big batteries. America, particularly its Sun Belt, has been a gusher of renewable energy for years; now, utilities will be able to bottle up much of that sun and wind and discharge it around the clock.

In the 12 months through April – the most recent data available – energy storage in the U.S. surged from roughly 18 gigawatts to 25 gigawatts, a 41% increase, according to a Bloomberg Green analysis of federal data. In Arizona, battery bandwidth nearly tripled; in Texas, it has almost doubled. In the evening of April 8, more than 11% of Texas electricity was coming from batteries, a record.

If the U.S. is able to reach the Biden Administration’s goal of emissions-free electricity by 2035 – or even get close – batteries will be a big reason why. Renewable electricity is setting records every few days and comprised almost one-third of all U.S. power generation in March. Batteries can make sure those electrons hit at the most opportune time – or at least that they don’t go to waste. Along the way, they’ll drag electricity prices down, speed the retirement of fossil fuel plants and preclude plans for new ones, according to Jan Rosenow, head of the energy program at Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute.

“Twenty years ago, the main problem with renewables was that they were so expensive,” Rosenow saod. “Now, renewables are cheap, but we need to be able to match that supply to demand. For that, battery storage is clearly one of the best tools in the box.”

104 million face outages

Summer is always a fraught time for grids and utilities. Cooling takes more electricity than heating and with a fast-changing climate, Americans are doing it more and more. Annual cooling degree days, an indicator of AC use, have increased 17% compared with the 1990-1999 average, according to BloombergNEF. Last summer was the fourth hottest on record in North America and meteorologists are forecasting a similarly sweaty sequel.

“An increase in heat extremes is the most obvious symptom of climate change,” Karen McKinnon, a professor who studies the statistics behind climate change at UCLA. “Even seemingly small changes in temperatures of a few degrees can make summers feel substantially more extreme.”

As a result, three of the continent’s six major power grids are at risk of power outages this summer, according to the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. All told, 104 million Americans – roughly 1 in 3 – live in areas where extreme heat and rising demand could shut out the lights, though NERC says the risk would be far higher without the new banks of batteries.

In Texas, for example, NERC’s odds of an energy emergency this summer have dropped from roughly 15% a few months ago to 3.6% thanks to battery capacity. Meanwhile, NERC expects batteries to juice roughly one-quarter of California’s peak power demand in coming months.

“Reliability is the ability to react to sudden changes in the grid,” said Chris McKissack, chief executive officer of Fullmark Energy, which is building two storage sites in Texas. “And when it comes to reacting, nothing moves faster than battery storage.”

Homeowners have realized as much, adding their own small battery systems to keep the lights on and avoid time-of-use electric price peaks. Last year, residential storage surged by 64%, systems that also help lower summer demand peaks and stabilize the grid.

Last summer, there were no major power outages in the U.S., a success the Department of Energy primarily attributed to new solar generation and storage.

Officials who run the Texas grid say batteries have also been critical in lowering prices, particularly in the summer. They expect storage in the state to triple over the next five years.

Where solar was

To be sure, it’s still early days for storage. In 2024, it represented just 2% of U.S. power capacity, but that’s ramping quickly. BNEF expects utility-scale battery storage to nearly double again this year regardless of how much the Trump administration manages to dial down green incentives, with some 18 gigawatts of new capacity.

Utilities and developers are building battery stacks because they are often the most affordable way to add capacity, essentially by stretching power generation that’s already built. The average price for stationary storage systems in 2024 was $125 per kWh, 19% lower than in 2023, according to BNEF.

Storage systems are also getting more resilient. A decade ago, industrial batteries generally discharged all of their electrons in 30 minutes or less. Today, the average system can put out energy for four hours straight, and some are tuned for cycles as high as eight hours. This means, they can kick in more frequently and stay on for longer, not just during brief windows in the morning and evening.

Rosenow, at Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute, said big batteries are surging and affordable enough that their adoption will steepen quickly.

“Storage is now where solar was maybe 10 years ago,” Rosenow said. “That’s kind of how it feels to me. It’s really mind-blowing.”

As the battery blitz evolves, Rosenow said, people will pay less for electricity, outages will abate and the largest energy hogs, including AI data centers, will spool up with minimal added emissions. But there are diminishing returns.

Storage systems thrive on being able to sock in electrons when they are cheap and sell them when power prices surge.

As storage capacity ramps up, those arbitrage opportunities narrow. McKissack at Fullmark said battery executives are becoming much more strategic about what they build and where.

“The race for quantity is over,” he said. “At this point, very few of us want to bolster up the number of dots on a map.”

What’s more, recent federal tariffs will likely raise the cost of big battery projects from 12% to 50%, depending on how high the levies go and how long they stay elevated, according to Woods Mackenzie. While American battery factories are booting up, it will be a long time before domestic supply meets even more than a small fraction of U.S. demand, the company says.

Trump’s spending plan also threatens to throttle big batteries and green energy projects. Sabah Bayatli, chief executive officer of solar and battery developer OCI Industries, traveled to Washington, D.C., this week to encourage senators to maintain Inflation Reduction Act incentives or, at the very least, step them down gradually.

“If (the ‘big, beautiful bill’) passes as is, it’s an overnight kill for the solar industry,” he said.

Bayatli may more easily make his case after a summer of heat-wave drama and power outages, but the solar and storage that’s already been built could preclude all that.

McKissack at Fullmark concedes that most people and businesses won’t realize how big of a part renewables and batteries will play in keeping the grid healthy in coming months. Charts of disaster averted because of them aren’t all that powerful, he explained.

“It’s almost easier to talk about when there’s a blackout, but then people’s lives are at risk,” he said.",https://thumb.spokesman.com/BaiTcNJC7D-IGMDNRsKzv1IIgb0=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/06/21/68574440848aa.hires.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 21:01:35.385480

The Senate bill doesn’t include such a provision.
The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.","WASHINGTON (AP) — House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.

Republicans in the two chambers don’t agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.

The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.

While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.

Here’s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:

Tax break for families

The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.

The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump’s second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.

Trump campaign promises

Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.

The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.

The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that’s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.

The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.

The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.

And on Social Security, the bills don’t directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

More SALT

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That’s a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

Medicaid providers

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

“This needs a lot of work. It’s really concerning and I’m really surprised by it,” he said. “Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.”

Tax breaks for business

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Clean energy tax credits

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden’s climate law. It aimed to boost the nation’s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

Odds and ends

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn’t include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

The other thing is that the cost of battery storage is just declining so rapidly and it’s continuing to decline.
Earlier this month, BLM updated the project timeline for another Nevada solar project – EDF’s Bonanza – to say it would come out imminently, too, but nothing’s been released.
For Shaaron Netherton, executive director of the conservation group Friends of the Nevada Wilderness, these solar project permitting delays mean an uncertain future.
I really don’t think Trump’s going to just start saying no to these energy projects.”","How do you approach working in this field given all the macro uncertainties?

It’s a really fair question. One, macro uncertainties aside, when you look at the levelized cost of energy report Lazard releases it is clear that there are forms of clean energy that are by far the cheapest to deploy. There are all kinds of reasons to do decarbonizing projects that aren’t clean energy generation: storage, resiliency, energy efficiency – this is massively cost saving. Like, a lot of the methane industry [exists] because there’s value in not leaking methane. There’s all sorts of stuff you can do that you don’t need policy incentives for.

That said, the policy questions are unavoidable. You can’t really ignore them and I don’t want to say they don’t matter to the industry – they do. It’s just, my belief in this being an investable asset class and incredibly important from a humanity perspective is unwavering. That’s the perspective I’ve been taking. This maybe isn’t going to be the most fun market, investing in decarbonizing things, but the sense of purpose and the belief in the underlying drivers of the industry outweigh that.

With respect to clean energy development, and the investment class working in development, how have things changed since January and the introduction of these bills that would pare back the IRA?

Both investors and companies are worried. There’s a lot more political and policy engagement. We’re seeing a lot of firms and organizations getting involved. I think companies are really trying to find ways to structure around the incentives. Companies and developers, I think everybody is trying to – for lack of a better term – future-proof themselves against the worst eventuality.

One of the things I’ve been personally thinking about is that the way developers generally make money is, you have a financier that’s going to buy a project from them, and the financier is going to have a certain investment rate of return, or IRR. So ITC [investment tax credit] or no ITC, that IRR is going to be the same. And the developer captures the difference.

My guess – and I’m not incredibly confident yet – but I think the industry just focuses on being less ITC dependent. Finding the projects that are juicier regardless of the ITC.

The other thing is that as drafts come out for what we’re expecting to see, it’s gone from bad to terrible to a little bit better. We’ll see what else happens as we see other iterations.

How are you evaluating companies and projects differently today, compared to how you were maybe before it was clear the IRA would be targeted?

Let’s say that we’re looking at a project developer and they have a series of projects. Right now we’re thinking about a few things. First, what assets are these? It’s not all ITC and PTC. A lot of it is other credits. Going through and asking, how at risk are these credits? And then, once we know how at risk those credits are we apply it at a project level.

This also raises a question of whether you’re going to be able to find as many projects. Is there going to be as much demand if you’re not able to get to an IRR? Is the industry going to pay that?

What gives you optimism in this moment?

I’ll just look at the levelized cost of energy and looking at the unsubsidized tables say these are the projects that make sense and will still get built. Utility-scale solar? Really attractive. Some of these next-gen geothermal projects, I think those are going to be cost effective.

The other thing is that the cost of battery storage is just declining so rapidly and it’s continuing to decline. We are as a country expected to compare the current price of these technologies in perpetuity to the current price of oil and gas, which is challenging and where the technologies have not changed materially. So we’re not going to see the cost decline we’re going to see in renewables.

But the biggest indicator of Trump’s thinking on solar out west was Esmeralda 7, a compilation of solar project proposals in western Nevada from NextEra, Invenergy, Arevia, ConnectGen, and other developers that would, if constructed, produce at least 6 gigawatts of power. My colleague Matthew Zeitlin was first to report that BLM officials updated the timetable for fully permitting the expansive project to say it would complete its environmental review by late April and be completely finished with the federal bureaucratic process by mid-July. BLM told Matthew that the final environmental impact statement – the official study completing the environmental review – would be published “in the coming days or week or so.”

More than two months later, it’s crickets from BLM on Esmeralda 7. BLM never released the study that its website as of today still says should’ve come out in late April. I asked BLM for comment on this and a spokesperson simply told me the agency “does not have any updates to share on this project at this time.”

This state of quiet stasis is not unique to Esmeralda; for example, Leeward has yet to receive a final environmental impact statement for its 700 mega-watt Copper Rays solar project in Nevada’s Pahrump Valley that BLM records state was to be published in early May. Earlier this month, BLM updated the project timeline for another Nevada solar project – EDF’s Bonanza – to say it would come out imminently, too, but nothing’s been released.

Delays happen in the federal government and timelines aren’t always met. But on its face, it is hard for stakeholders I speak with out in Nevada to take these months-long stutters as simply good faith bureaucratic hold-ups. And it’s even making work fighting solar for activists out in the desert much more confusing.

For Shaaron Netherton, executive director of the conservation group Friends of the Nevada Wilderness, these solar project permitting delays mean an uncertain future. Friends of the Nevada Wilderness is a volunteer group of ecology protection activists that is opposing Esmeralda 7 and filed its first lawsuit against Greenlink West, a transmission project that will connect the massive solar constellation to the energy grid. Netherton told me her group may sue against the approval of Esmeralda 7… but that the next phase of their battle against the project is a hazy unknown.

“It’s just kind of a black hole,” she told me of the Esmeralda 7 permitting process. “We will litigate Esmeralda 7 if we have to, and we were hoping that with this administration there would be a little bit of a pause. There may be. That’s still up in the air.”

I’d like to note that Netherton’s organization has different reasons for opposition than I normally write about in The Fight. Instead of concerns about property values or conspiracies about battery fires, her organization and a multitude of other desert ecosystem advocates are trying to avoid a future where large industries of any type harm or damage one of the nation’s most biodiverse and undeveloped areas.

This concern for nature has historically motivated environmental activism. But it’s also precisely the sort of advocacy that Trump officials have opposed tooth-and-nail, dating back to the president’s previous term, when advocates successfully opposed his rewrite of Endangered Species Act regulations. This reason – a motivation to hippie-punch, so to speak – is a reason why I hardly expect species protection to be enough of a concern to stop solar projects in their tracks under Trump, at least for now. There’s also the whole “energy dominance” thing, though Trump has been wishy-washy on adhering to that goal.

Patrick Donnelly, great basin director at the Center for Biological Diversity, agrees that this is a period of confusion but not necessarily an end to solar permitting on BLM land.

“[Solar] is moving a lot slower than it was six months ago, when it was coming at a breakneck pace,” said Patrick Donnelly of the Center for Biological Diversity. “How much of that is ideological versus 15-20% of the agencies taking early retirement and utter chaos inside the agencies? I’m not sure. But my feeling is it’s less ideological. I really don’t think Trump’s going to just start saying no to these energy projects.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTA4MTM0OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2OTUyNTcyN30.EeDFgqlVqkN_g3WDa5aGUzo01ktTyCfOZTknst50qxo/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C286,N,,2025-06-21 20:05:02.859061

Longtime scientists Lewis Ross Brown and Shamira A. Brown created Virginia Environmental Action Network (VEAN) to help individuals and organizations apply for environmental grants and to raise awareness about pressing ecological issues in local communities.

With environmental issues increasingly sidelined at the national level, the pair are moving forward with a new program to monitor local waterways for contaminants that are toxic to community members. They believe their findings will help to hold government officials accountable for enforcing environmental protections.

“The state of Virginia needed an unbiased, detailed water pollution and quality analysis program designed to combat the ever-growing pollution problems caused by harmful algal blooms, organic and inorganic pesticides, organic waste and heavy metals,” said Shamira A. Brown. “Lewis and I felt that the creation of VEAN would be the answer to the water pollution issues from these contaminants. Additionally, we feel that VEAN will be able to make sure federal regulations, like the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Act, are followed throughout the state of Virginia— a duty that the EPA does not do nor has a desire to do under the new administration.”

Two priority areas for the scientists are per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). These man-made, persistent and toxic chemicals have been widely used to resist heat, water and oil, making them ideal for products, like non-stick cookware, firefighting foam and waterproof fabrics.

PFAS and PFBs enter waterways through industrial discharge, firefighting foam runoff, landfill leakage and wastewater systems that can’t filter them out. Once in the water, these chemicals can persist for years without breaking down, accumulating in fish, wildlife and, eventually, human bodies through drinking water and food consumption.

“Generally speaking, PFAS chemicals are known to interfere with human immune systems in a negative manner, rendering humans exposed to them with a very weakened and compromised immune system,” said Shamira A. Brown.

Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are two prominent PFAS. Shamira A. Brown explained that exposure to PFOA can result in significantly elevated cholesterol levels and changes in liver function. Exposure to PFOS leads can increase the risk of several types of cancer, including kidney, testicular, anal, breast and prostate. She said there is also a strong connection between PFOS exposure and changes in hormone levels in men and women between the ages of 16 and 67.

PCBs can also cause a range of health problems.

“Furthermore, we have shown that high exposure levels of PCBs can induce severe liver and kidney damage in humans, as well as developmental effects in children born to mothers with high PCB exposure levels,” said Shamira A. Brown.

The researchers will also be analyzing waterways for lead, arsenic and mercury. They will also collect tissue samples from fish and birds. They plan to publicize the information and to enable community members to learn more about the hazards these contaminants pose to both environmental and human health.

A special focus will be put on aiding underserved communities, who typically bear the brunt of environmental harms.

“We’re going to hold meetings where people can tune in and ask all of the questions they want to ask. We are going to come to your community to help because that’s our job,” said Lewis Ross Brown. “If we don’t help, nobody is going to help us.”

Lewis Ross Brown’s background is in environmental toxicology, researching how exposure to pesticides and chemical pollutants affect living organisms and, in particular, humans. Shamira A. Brown specializes in environmental chemistry and oncology.

The pair met when they were paired up for a biological research project while attending Dillard University, a historically Black college in Louisiana. They previously worked with the Louisiana Environmental Action Network before coming to D.C. to work for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

They left the government agency during the 47th president’s first term, as he sought to reduce support for the EPA and roll back protections for the first time. Now that he is back in office, they are also stepping up to support scientists and researchers who have lost their jobs or fear they may be terminated.

“The biggest fight we have on our hands right now is getting these federal workers to work again and back to doing the things that they love to do, which is to help our society,” said Lewis Ross Brown. “When he laid those people off, it was nothing short of stupid because it’s going to cost a lot of money to build that government agency back up.”

The researchers are helping to connect displaced federal environmental workers with consulting jobs. Lewis Ross Brown noted that these positions offer flexible hours and wages that exceed those from government jobs.

They have set up a hotline for people who are in need of employment. Individuals can call 703-594-2302 for help. Once they must submit a current resume, they will be connected with a range of consulting opportunities.

As the 47th president and his administration continue to defund climate initiatives and research, Lewis Ross Brown and Shamira A. Brown are uneasy. But, through VEAN, they plan to hold institutions accountable for their environmental impact.

“Under the Trump administration, we are mainly concerned about the elimination of research grants in the sciences, especially medical, environmental health, toxicology and chemistry,” said Shamira A. Brown. “Trump’s inane and insensitive gutting of research grants at the federal levels and his asinine policies targeting HBCUs and other colleges who don’t agree with his outdated, moronic policies are enough for anyone to be concerned. VEAN will stand up to these antiquated, outdated policies.”",https://i0.wp.com/afro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Untitled-design-545.jpg?fit=1920%2C1080&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-21 21:02:18.820145

(VDN) – The Mississippi Public Service Commission has approved Entergy Mississippi’s annual rate plan, which aims to keep electricity rates stable and customer bills approximately 20% below the national average. The updated plan will take effect with the July billing cycle, as rising summer temperatures are expected to increase energy usage.

Under the plan, a typical residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per month will see a slight bill decrease of $0.04 beginning in July. Despite growing costs to generate power, maintain infrastructure, and provide service, the plan is designed to keep rates as flat as possible during peak demand.

Entergy Mississippi President and CEO Haley Fisackerly credited strategic planning and oversight from the Public Service Commission for supporting affordability and reliability efforts.

“We’re thankful for the Mississippi Public Service Commission’s continued oversight and support of our efforts to keep rates affordable while making critical reliability improvements and addressing increased challenges caused by vegetation,” Fisackerly said.

Key strategies supporting the rate plan include:

Recruiting new power partners: Entergy is expanding its customer base by attracting large commercial users, helping to distribute infrastructure investment costs more broadly.

Diversifying power sources: A balanced energy mix shields customers from fuel price volatility and enhances grid resilience.

Modernizing generation systems: Upgrades to cleaner, more efficient technology are aimed at long-term cost savings.

Managing fuel costs: Customers pay the actual fuel price without markups, with continuous efforts to secure the lowest available rates.

The plan includes about $525 million for power quality and reliability improvements, and outlines customer-focused programs in 2025 such as energy efficiency rebates and savings incentives.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, cooling makes up more than 52% of the average electric bill during summer months. Entergy urges customers to explore energy-saving tips and tools at billtoolkit.entergy.com/mississippi to manage usage and reduce costs.

Fisackerly emphasized the company’s commitment to affordability. “We’re balancing fuel prices and modernizing generation resources because we know both can fluctuate.

Reasons Why The Mega Bill Would Handicap Wind And Solar Energy.","Green Technologies At Risk In Current Mega Bill

As it was written, the Big, Beautiful Bill (Mega Bill) passed by The House of Representatives in May would handicap certain green projects (solar, wind, and batteries) that are in line to receive tax credits made available by the Biden government. The handicap is hard to understand because in the U.S. over 90% of new energy projects in 2023 and 2024 was generated by solar, wind, and batteries.

What is the handicap? The Mega Bill mandates that such projects must begin within two months of passage of the bill, and would have to be completed, and in service, by the last day of 2028, or the tax credits would be canceled.

To see what impact this would have on green projects, one analysis looked at clean electrical projects that are currently in the interconnection queue, and due to go online during 2028 or later (it wouldn’t be uncommon for projects slated to complete in 2028 to spill over to 2029, which would cancel the tax credits.)

The total for all these at-risk projects in Figure 1 amounts to 600 GW (gigawatts). The largest three projects are CAISO of California at 183 GW, ERCOT of Texas at 128 GW, and MISO (Midwest and South) at 111 GW.

The truth is, current electrical production in U.S. is 1200 GW, and this will need to grow rapidly to power new AI data centers. So, if all these seven green projects lost their tax credits and dropped out of the interconnection queue, it would represent a huge loss that is 50% of current electrical production in the U.S. This loss would be like tossing away 600 traditional power plants that added up to 50% of current U.S. electricity supply.

Granted, a number of projects in Figure 1 would drop out of the queue anyway, due to other factors such as financial commitments that fall through. But still, a loss of remaining projects that would stand to boost current U.S. power by 30% or 40% or 50% would be an unforgiveable loss—especially since solar, wind and battery projects have all the market momentum in the past few years.

Speaking of momentum, in 2023 and 2024 in the U.S., the vast majority (93%--94%) of new energy sources were solar, wind, and batteries. The only commercially proven competitor is gas-fired power plants, which are facing serious delays, and they cost more.

What if projects that lost their tax credits were to go ahead to completion? They might, but it’s obvious this would translate to higher cost of electricity for consumers.

Mega Bill Changes Suggested By Senate.

The House Mega Bill has gone to the Senate, and on Monday June 16 they have proposed some changes.

UtilityDive reports that the harsh “start by – complete by” House requirement to access the tax credits has been removed. In one box, nuclear, geothermal and hydropower can claim the tax credits so long as they start construction by 2033.

But in another box, wind and solar can obtain only 60% of the tax credits and only if they break ground by 2026. Or 20% if by 2027. Or zero if after that. This is a serious handicap for the frontrunners, solar and wind, that have provided over 93% of new electrical capacity in 2023 and 2024. And it comes at a crucial time, because the U.S. needs to quickly boost its power capability by a massive amount to supply AI data centers.

One positive: battery storage or BESS (battery energy storage systems) can access tax credits until 2036, although the credits will be tapered down, according to Canary Media. Also, some solar and wind projects would be able to keep the tax credits beyond the end of 2028—provided they exist on federal land, generate 1 GW or more power, and have obtained right-of-way approval from the BLM (Bureau of Land Management).

The next steps are: the Senate as a whole has to pass these changes, and then attempt to reconcile with the House. The timeline is short as the goal is to get the final version of the Mega Bill to President Trump’s desk by July 4.

Coming out of all the discussion and debate, it seems the Mega Bill wants to handicap wind and solar and batteries. But why?

Reasons Why The Mega Bill Would Handicap Wind And Solar Energy.

First, the Bill will cause electricity prices to rise. If cheap wind, solar and batteries are handicapped in preference to expensive almost-defunct coal power plants, commercially unproven SMRs (small modular nuclear reactors), and next-gen geothermal methods, then prices of electricity will rise. Table 1 lays this out, using the most recent LCOE data from Lazard.

With tax credits and based on a utility scale, solar PV + BESS and wind + BESS are cheaper than geothermal with tax credits, and much cheaper than gas-fired power, nuclear, and coal. If the Mega Bill handicaps wind and solar in the race, electrical costs will zoom upwards.

Second, the Bill seems to be unaware of green energy success in Australia. In the state of South Australia renewables plus batteries have been providing 72% of grid electricity continuously for three years, and this is expected to rise to 100% by 2027. Solar, wind, and batteries have proven the stability and reliability of renewables commercially.

The first grid-scale BESS was started in 2017 by Elon Musk in South Australia, and BESS are expanding rapidly in the U.S. as well as in Australia. Intermittent power is no longer a reason to dismiss renewables, despite what the Energy Secretary says, because BESS have solved this problem and electricity from solar and wind renewables with BESS is dispatchable.

Third, the Bill assumes new investments in old energy (coal, natural gas, and nuclear) will be embraced by the U.S. population. However, global spending on low-carbon power has doubled in the past five years. Solar PV is the leader in this space, with investments that will reach $450 billion in 2025.

Coal is too dirty when it burns, and in the U.S. the market share has dropped from 50% in 2011 to 11% in 2024. Natural gas burns cleaner than coal, but the market for new gas-fired power plants has dropped out in the past two years, due to cost and delays in permitting and supply chains.

The cost of new nuclear reactors, whether traditional reactors or SMRs, is substantially higher than renewable energies (Table 1). There is also the ubiquitous threat of being exposed to nuclear radiation, either from nuclear accidents or from underground storage of nuclear waste.

It has been reported that U.S. nuclear reactors that were decommissioned some time ago can be recommissioned, but at a heavy cost of around $1 billion per unit.

Fourth, the Bill enables China to forge ahead with a green energy economy, while the U.S. goes backward.

Energy from solar, wind, and batteries is cheap, and has a short new-build time. It will continue to provide jobs and grow the economy, and benefits include lower electricity prices and less pollution. A key advantage is already-commercialized power for data centers that will enable the U.S. to compete with China in the race for AI. The handicap and setbacks of a thriving clean industry in the U.S. would be China’s gain.

Fifth, the Bill will force job losses by handicapping green industries.

If projects in the above list of seven in Figure 1 were to be canceled due to the Mega Bill handicaps, there could be serious job losses. To illustrate by results in 2024, one report quotes $80 billion invested in clean power in 2024, which supported 1.4 million jobs in the U.S.

Another answer is that current tax credits would enable strong economic growth by 2035: almost $2 trillion of monetary growth and almost 14 million jobs. This amounts to a return on the federal investment by four-times.

The green energy benefits and financial returns of wind and solar with battery storage apply to both Republican and Democratic states in the U.S.. But so do the losses, if Congress decides to handicap wind and solar renewables.

The biggest losses may be soaring electricity costs in the U.S., and the U.S. bending to China’s clean energy boom of surging solar and BESS projects that will reliably service their AI data center programs.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6857235e09c68e8305c375dc/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-06-21 19:05:13.725652

The LG Energy Solution, the South Korea's top battery manufacturer, has recently established joint ventures in both Europe and the United States -- partnering with France's Derichebourg and Toyota Tsusho Co., respectively.

These initiatives mark LG's first direct entry into recycling operations in these key global markets.

Meanwhile, SK Ecoplant, the construction and engineering arm of SK Group, is expanding its European operations in the Netherlands.

The facility will add an annual processing capacity of 25,000 metric tons of black mass, with the expansion slated for completion in 2025, the South Korean English-language daily newspaper added.

Going further, Posco-GS Eco Materials -- a joint venture between Posco Holdings and GS Energy, with ownership split 51:49 -- has also made a notable move by acquiring full ownership of its recycling unit, Posco HY Clean Metal.

This was achieved by purchasing the 35 percent stake held by China's Huayou Cobalt in April, the South Korea's news platform added.

These strategic shifts come amid a prolonged downturn in the battery recycling sector, fueled by weakened EV demand and falling prices of core battery minerals such as nickel, lithium, and manganese.

Lithium carbonate prices, which exceeded 450 Chinese yuan (USD 63) per kilogram in January 2023, have plummeted to about 50 yuan. Nickel has also seen a steep drop from over USD 31,000 per ton to around USD 20,000.

As a result, SungEel HiTech -- one of only two battery recycling companies listed on Korea's tech-heavy Kosdaq -- has faced falling profitability and declining free cash flow for two consecutive years.

A joint recycling venture between SungEel HiTech and SK Innovation, announced in 2022, has been postponed indefinitely. Additionally, SK Ecoplant's planned facilities in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, and in Kentucky have shown little to no progress for several years.

The news report added that the Korean industry watchers expect a sharp rise in used EV batteries reaching end-of-life status, generally around 10 years after initial use -- a timeline that aligns with the global EV sales boom in the 2010s, which topped one million units by 2015.

With global EV adoption continuing to rise, the battery recycling market -- valued at USD 8 billion in 2022 -- is forecast to grow to as much as USD 53.57 billion by 2030, according to SNE Research.

Experts argue that participating in the recycling segment is becoming crucial for maintaining competitiveness in the battery industry, especially as regulatory pressure mounts globally for the use of recycled materials.

The European Union, for instance, mandates that EV batteries sold in the region must contain minimum percentages of recycled metals by 2031: 16 percent for cobalt, 85 percent for lead, 6 percent for lithium, and 6 percent for nickel. These thresholds will increase by 2036.

Moosa highlighted that the decade from 2020 to 2030 had been globally recognised as a pivotal era for transitioning to clean energy.
He cautioned, however, that Pakistan's local industry was not yet sufficiently developed to meet the growing demand for advanced solar panels in adequate quantity.
He also highlighted the immense untapped potential for solar energy adoption among off-grid rural households.","The imposition of general sales tax (GST) on imported solar panels, regardless of the final tax rate decided by the federal government, will not slow down Pakistan’s accelerating transition towards renewable energy. This progress is driven by the unwavering commitment of end-consumers and businesses dedicated to improving environmental conditions and reducing the carbon footprint of Pakistan’s power sector.

This was the collective view expressed by clean energy experts, academics, industrialists, climate activists and renewable energy traders during a webinar examining the federal government’s recent budgetary proposal to impose GST on imported solar panels. The proposed measure aims to encourage domestic manufacturing of renewable energy equipment.

The webinar, titled ‘Taxing the Sun: Will Solar Still Shine in Pakistan?’, was jointly organised by the Energy Update and Pakistan Solar Association (PSA). PSA Chairman Waqas Moosa opened the discussion by thanking environmental advocates and non-governmental organisations for their continued support of solar energy adoption by households and commercial users. He emphasised that shifting to solar power was a critical means to reduce dependence on polluting fossil fuels.

Moosa highlighted that the decade from 2020 to 2030 had been globally recognised as a pivotal era for transitioning to clean energy. He predicted that Pakistani consumers would persist in embracing solar energy to power their homes and businesses, regardless of the added cost from the GST.

He cautioned, however, that Pakistan's local industry was not yet sufficiently developed to meet the growing demand for advanced solar panels in adequate quantity. As such, relying solely on local production at this stage could risk stalling progress.

He criticised the proposal to tax imported solar panels, calling it a serious setback to Pakistan’s efforts in combating the climate crisis. ""Whether or not a tax is implemented"", he said, ""domestic consumers will continue shifting to solar energy due to persistent power shortages and unaffordable electricity tariffs.""

Muhammad Zakar Ali, chief executive officer of the Inverex Solar Energy, echoed this sentiment. He said that the vast majority of electricity users in Pakistan now understood the long-term value of clean energy and would continue to transition away from grid-supplied electricity, regardless of tax implications.

He argued that Pakistan needed a minimum of 18 to 24 months to establish a viable local industry capable of producing clean energy equipment at scale. Imposing a tax prematurely, he warned, could deter both domestic and international investors.

He noted that high electricity tariffs for industrial users could discourage investment in solar panel manufacturing plants. He, however, predicted that prospective Chinese investors would soon launch joint ventures with Pakistani industrialists to set up such facilities.

Ali explained that establishing local solar panel manufacturing plants could lead to the development of five supporting vendor industries, significantly boosting the clean energy supply chain in Pakistan.

Former Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) office-bearer Tanveer Ahmed Barry stated that industries had little choice but to transition to renewable energy due to the unreliable and unstable power supply from the national grid.

He pointed out that while Pakistan’s installed electricity generation capacity exceeded 45,000 megawatts, only around 27,000 megawatts were currently deliverable to end-users due to the outdated transmission infrastructure. He also highlighted the immense untapped potential for solar energy adoption among off-grid rural households.",https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2025-06-22/l_1323646_023413_updates.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 19:05:17.997532

What Has Trump Said About Windmills ?

Shortly after taking office, the president said the government would not subsidize new windmill farms and added he doesn’t “want even one built” during his second term. Trump called wind turbines the “most expensive energy” that only works “with massive government subsidies, which we will no longer pay.” Trump could potentially impact windmill production on federal lands, but not on privately owned plots. Trump has also falsely claimed windmills kill whales, though there is no evidence supporting the claim about the mammals and offshore turbines.

Are Windmills The Most Expensive Form Of Energy Production?

Not likely. The Department of Energy has said “wind and solar projects are now more economically competitive than gas, geothermal, coal, or nuclear facilities,” though windmills in locations lacking wind could be an exception. Onshore wind turbines saw global costs of energy production fall by 68% in 2021, according to a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency, which noted onshore capacity increased four-fold from 2010 to 2021. The agency also reported onshore wind project costs fell by 13% while offshore wind projects fell by 9% in 2020.

Key Background

Trump once lost a legal battle in which he sought to block the construction of an offshore wind farm in view of a golf course project of his in Scotland. The president lost in court and was required to pay over $290,000 in legal fees to the Scottish government. His scrutiny of windmills is a change from his first term, when former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said he was “very bullish on offshore wind,” adding the harnessing of the energy source was “a big part of the Trump Administration’s made in America energy strategy.”

Mr. Trump on Saturday decided to take a side, and he believes the credits need to go.
“I HATE ‘GREEN TAX CREDITS’ IN THE GREAT, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL,” the president posted on social media.

The clean energy tax credits, many of which were created or expanded as part of President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, have been a point of tension for congressional Republicans as they craft the massive budget reconciliation package carrying Mr. Trump’s legislative agenda.

Fiscal conservatives have pushed to fully repeal the credits and quickly, while more centrist Republicans want to retain some of the tax breaks and phase others out over a slower period of time.

Mr. Trump on Saturday decided to take a side, and he believes the credits need to go.

“I HATE ‘GREEN TAX CREDITS’ IN THE GREAT, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL,” the president posted on social media. “They are largely a giant SCAM.”

Mr. Trump said he would prefer the federal dollars being spent on the tax subsidies “be used somewhere else, including [deficit] reductions.”

“Windmills, and the rest of this ‘JUNK,’ are the most expensive and inefficient energy in the world,” he said.

The president said none of the green energy technologies – “almost exclusively made in China” – work without massive government subsidies.

“It is time to break away, finally, from this craziness!!!” Mr. Trump said.

Neither the House nor Senate versions of the “big, beautiful bill” fully repeal all of Mr. Biden’s clean energy credits. Many are phased out, although more quickly in the House-passed version of the bill than in the Senate’s draft.

The House used a stricter deadline, requiring most clean energy projects to be “placed in service” by certain dates if they are to qualify for the subsidies. The Senate lowered the standard to a “commence construction” deadline for many projects, which effectively extends their credit-qualifying lifespan by years.

Conservative Republicans in both chambers amplified Mr. Trump’s social media post to emphasize their support for fully repealing the clean energy credits.

House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris posted that he 100% agrees with Mr. Trump.

“We should never allow foreign owned offshore wind companies to control our energy supply — much less harm our marine life while doing it,” he said.

Sen. Josh Hawley, Missouri Republican, said the president is “100% correct.”

“Get rid of the Green New Scam credits, protect rural hospitals,” he said, referring to a priority of his that has yet to be included in the measure. “And let’s PASS THIS BILL.”

Alex Epstein, an outside energy expert who has conducted research on the clean energy credits and advises politicians, spoke to Senate Republicans this week and argued for the use of the “placed in service” standard if lawmakers want to see the IRA subsidies end during Mr. Trump’s presidency.

Mr. Trump, 79, campaigned on terminating the “Green New Scam,” as he’s dubbed the IRA.

But in a “best-case scenario,” the Senate’s proposal would keep wind subsidies in place through the president’s 94th birthday, Mr. Epstein said.

“The more likely scenario is the subsidies continue forever because their expiration has been delayed until after the Trump administration,” he said.

Fully repealing the clean energy credits, as Mr. Trump is requesting, will not be an easy task, given several have support from Republicans whose constituencies have benefited from projects the subsidies helped fund.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, posted on social media, without directly referencing Mr. Trump’s post, that his state gets 60% of its electricity from wind energy.

“It’s an important tool for America’s energy independence [and to] keep Iowans’ utility bills low,” he said.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/06/20/Trump_27843_c0-219-5257-3285_s1200x700.jpg?890a74869aecf7cb7cb5bb60d29e8cff1a392519,N,,2025-06-21 18:08:17.749116

An electric vehicle battery is considered dead when its capacity dips below 80 percent of its original value.
The artificial intelligence model determined that three different molecules would fulfill all of the requirements outlined by the scientists.
Making electric vehicle batteries less expensive could have a major impact on what remains a cost-prohibitive transition for many would-be consumers.
Notably, this system does not include electric vehicle batteries, but could provide a launch pad for similar systems geared at the growing EV waste problem.","A team of researchers in China is using artificial intelligence to help breathe new life into old electric vehicle batteries. Extending the lifespan of lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles would be a major boon for making electric vehicles more endurable and cost-effective, help mitigate skyrocketing lithium demand, and slow the flow of critical – not to mention toxic – minerals into landfills.

The China-based scientists wanted to discover a molecule that could re-infuse a dead cell with lithium ions, replenishing its capacity. An electric vehicle battery is considered dead when its capacity dips below 80 percent of its original value. This usually is about eight to ten years after the battery is manufactured. But by pumping lithium ions back into a cell after it reaches the end of its life cycle, batteries could be brought back from the dead.

The question was what molecules would be able to achieve this re-infusion. The possible combinations are enormous and would require enormous amounts of time and resources to test in a lab. So the researchers decided to employ artificial intelligence to figure it out for them. “We had no idea what kinds of molecules could do that job or what their chemical structures would be, so we used machine learning to help us,” Chihao Zhao, part of the research team at Fudan University, was recently quoted by Scientific American.

The artificial intelligence model determined that three different molecules would fulfill all of the requirements outlined by the scientists. Of those three, the researchers determined one to be the best fit – a salt called lithium trifluoromethanesulfinate (LiSO2CF3). In the researchers’ study paper, published in Nature earlier this year, they describe how the identified lithium salt could help to break past traditional battery lifespan limitations “by means of a cell-level Li supply strategy.”

“This involves externally adding an organic Li salt into an assembled cell, which decomposes during cell formation, liberating Li ions and expelling organic ligands as gases,” the paper goes on to say. “This non-invasive and rapid process preserves cell integrity without necessitating disassembly.”

The result is a lithium-ion battery capable of being recharged for 11,818 cycles while still retaining a capacity of 96 percent – an amazing feat with the potential to increase the lifespan of commercial electric vehicle batteries by orders of magnitude. “These systems exhibit improved energy density, enhanced sustainability, and reduced cost compared with conventional Li-ion batteries,” the paper states.

While the research is extremely nascent, it could prove disruptive to the EV sector if refined and scaled. Making electric vehicle batteries less expensive could have a major impact on what remains a cost-prohibitive transition for many would-be consumers. The battery alone represents about 40 percent of the cost of an electric vehicle. Making batteries more cost-effective, efficient, and durable could therefore make a big difference in EV markets.

Plus, it will offer a reprieve to the mounting issue of battery waste. A mini-report from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) says that by 2040, the world will reach 20,500 kilotons of dead lithium-ion batteries, mostly from electric vehicles. But current global battery recycling capacities are just around 350,000 tons per year, with capacities concentrated in China.

Scientists have looked to AI to improve lithium-ion battery recycling capacities as well, motivated in part by a drive to break China’s stranglehold on the sector. A Hong Kong startup is employing artificial intelligence to refine a portable lithium-ion battery recycling system that uses a robot-assisted pilot line to sort, shred, and filter desirable materials from used batteries. Notably, this system does not include electric vehicle batteries, but could provide a launch pad for similar systems geared at the growing EV waste problem.

Proponents, including Rep. Landry, argue that natural gas is necessary to meet the state’s rising industrial demands.
HB692 mandates that Louisiana utilities “shall… use energy generated by hydrocarbons” and grants gas projects access to state funds previously reserved for green initiatives.","In a move drawing sharp criticism from environmentalists and energy policy experts alike, Louisiana lawmakers have passed HB692, a bill that reclassifies natural gas a fossil fuel as “green energy.” The bill, expected to be signed into law by Gov. Jeff Landry, has ignited debate over the state’s energy future, with opponents warning it could entrench fossil fuel dominance at the expense of renewable energy development and grid reliability.

Louisiana has long depended on the oil and gas industry to fuel its economy. While the sector once contributed up to 60% of the state’s revenues, that number has plummeted to just 4.5% as global energy markets shift and environmental concerns grow. Yet HB692 takes a starkly different approach than what experts recommend for a sustainable transition.

Spearheaded by Rep. Jacob Landry (R-Erath), the bill codifies hydrocarbons specifically natural gas and nuclear energy as forms of “green” or “clean” energy. It directs state utilities to prioritize energy generated by hydrocarbons, citing affordability, reliability, and energy security. Critics argue this approach is not only misleading but also harmful.

“There’s nothing clean or green about continued extraction of carbon from underground,” said James Hiatt, a former oil and gas worker and founder of For a Better Bayou.

The National Origins of a State Law

Although marketed as a Louisiana-specific solution, HB692 appears to originate from a national effort backed by fossil fuel lobbyists and dark money groups. Its language mirrors a model bill from the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a Koch-funded lobbying group. ALEC’s model legislation promotes natural gas as an equivalent to renewables under the guise of “clean” energy.

The Empowerment Alliance, another gas advocacy group, celebrated Louisiana’s move, framing it as part of a larger campaign. “That’s three down, 47 more states to go,” the group wrote, referencing similar laws passed in Ohio, Tennessee, and Indiana.

Redefining “Green” and Risking the Grid

Under HB692, “green energy” is redefined to include any energy source that meets National Ambient Air Quality Standards when combusted. This includes gas, despite its high methane emissions a greenhouse gas over 80 times more potent than CO₂ over a 20-year period.

Critics note that the bill ignores the environmental and public health costs of burning gas and fails to define how “affordable” energy should be calculated. The vagueness of the bill, paired with a clear emphasis on hydrocarbons, has left consumer advocates deeply concerned.

“The rest of the bill skews toward fossil fuels,” said Jackson Voss, climate policy coordinator for the Alliance for Affordable Energy. “It implies utilities should have a strong preference for things that use hydrocarbons, at the very least.”

HB692 doesn’t explicitly override municipal regulations, but renewable energy supporters fear it will undercut local efforts. New Orleans, which regulates Entergy New Orleans independently, has a goal of reaching 100% carbon-free energy by 2050. If HB692 is used as a rationale to slow down or reject solar and wind investments, New Orleans’ clean energy goals may be jeopardized.

Similar legislation in Tennessee went further, requiring municipalities to accept gas as a renewable source effectively overriding local standards.

Proponents, including Rep. Landry, argue that natural gas is necessary to meet the state’s rising industrial demands. He cites major infrastructure projects like Meta’s $10 billion data center in Richland Parish and CF Industries’ $4 billion “blue” ammonia facility. Both projects have enormous energy demands, and Entergy has proposed building three new gas plants to meet the load.

However, the cost of this fossil-heavy expansion will fall on ratepayers. Entergy customers are expected to shoulder $470 million in upfront costs for the new power plants. Meanwhile, studies show that Louisianans already pay some of the highest utility bills in the country and suffer some of the longest and most frequent outages.

Louisiana is on the front lines of climate change. Rising sea levels, severe storms, and extreme heat are escalating in both frequency and severity. The state’s overreliance on gas, environmentalists argue, is a major contributor to this crisis.

Gas plants not only emit CO₂ but also spew hazardous pollutants that contribute to poor air quality, exacerbating public health issues in communities already vulnerable due to industrial exposure.

In 2018, a new Entergy gas plant in New Orleans failed during a storm casting doubt on the reliability claims made by gas proponents. Yet, HB692 frames gas as the only dependable option, dismissing storage-enhanced solar and wind as unreliable.

HB692 mandates that Louisiana utilities “shall… use energy generated by hydrocarbons” and grants gas projects access to state funds previously reserved for green initiatives. It also directs the Department of Energy and Natural Resources to collaborate with regulators on enforcing these priorities.

While the bill includes a clause about ensuring a sufficient supply of renewable sources, the emphasis on gas is clear. Rep. Edmond Jordan and others warn that the legislation could face constitutional challenges for encroaching on the regulatory authority of the Louisiana Public Service Commission.

Despite public support for renewables highlighted in recent LSU surveys Louisiana’s political leadership appears to be steering the state in the opposite direction. HB692 represents not just a policy shift but a philosophical one: from planning for a low-carbon future to doubling down on fossil fuels in the face of mounting climate and economic risks.

For environmentalists and consumer advocates, the new law is a dangerous detour on Louisiana’s path toward a sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy future.",https://techstory.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20230313-5068_VG-flare-2-12-23-1827-hrs-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 18:08:48.287503

From a study that tracks just how American your vehicle is to changing consumer sentiments around electric vehicles to a new Honda delivery vehicle, that’s a lot of news that slipped through the cracks this week. Here’s a roundup of some important stories you may not find elsewhere.

Red, White And Who?

First up, Cars.com just released its American-Made Index, a study that “analyzes five major factors to determine just how American your prospective car or truck might be.” OK, cool. Surprisingly, performative patriotism, fast food drive-thru compatibility, and integrated firearms holsters were not factors considered in this study. This is the 20th year the list has been published.

So, what are the most-American vehicles you can buy today? Well, the lineup might shock you. The top four positions are occupied by Teslas: the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model X, respectively. That makes sense, Tesla is American and builds cars right here. And so does Jeep; the off-road brand’s Gladiator landed in spot No. 5. But after that, it’s a whole bunch of Korean and Japanese vehicles, with models like the EV6, Ridgeline, Pilot and Integra landing in higher positions. Products built by the traditional Detroit Three automakers generally fall much farther down the list, which is always a surprise to see, even though it shouldn’t be.

Abbey Road (Studios) Mode

If you love the Beatles, Volvo and the closely related Polestar brand have you covered. Both automakers just announced a new Abbey Road Studios Mode for their optional Bowers & Wilkins audio systems. Soon, this new amenity will be pushed out to vehicles via an over-the-air software update.

The Swedish/Chinese (Swedinese?) company describes this as “a sound technology designed to capture the essence of the iconic recording studio’s unique environment.” Abbey Road Studios is the famous location where the Beatles recorded many of their songs.

Volvo explains this new listening mode “comes with several presets that provide a selection of sounds, optimized for different listening styles. And for those ready to explore new ways of enjoying their favorite tracks, the Producer Mode allows you to engineer your own sound.” Adding a little more meat to that statement, Polestar explains this system comes with four different listening presets: Intimate, Open, Energized, and Expansive. All this provides “a distinct audio experience inspired by the studio’s spaces and equipment.” OK then.

Abbey Road Studios Mode will debut in the all-electric Volvo EX90 utility vehicle. The Polestar 3 EV will also gain this feature. How useful this listening mode will actually and whether drivers even care about fripperies like this remains to be seen.

EVs Keep Losing Their Luster… Or Are They?

Electric vehicles are hugely popular in China, with millions upon millions of battery-bolstered cars and trucks getting snapped up by drivers each year. EVs, however, are proving to be much less popular in other markets, particularly Western countries, something that is underscored by a report from oil company Shell.

According to a recent survey, which includes responses from more than 15,000 motorists in China, Europe, and the U.S., drivers are turned off by the high upfront costs of electric vehicles, and are choosing instead to stick with vehicles powered by traditional combustion engines. Folks that currently own EVs are increasingly satisfied, but affordability is still a top concern of 43 percent of non-EV owners in Europe.

Interest in switching to an electric is waning in the U.S. and Europe. Among drivers that currently own a combustion-powered vehicle, 31 percent would consider an EV compared to 34 percent in 2024. Similarly, in Europe, this decreased from 48 percent last year to just 41 percent now. In comparison, Chinese drivers that own a single vehicle saw a huge jump in EV interest, going from 72 to 89 percent.

Countering Shell’s narrative, however, is another study, one published by the BMW Group. American motorists still have very real concerns about the affordability of EVs as well as the nation’s questionable charging infrastructure, but 92 percent of them still believe that innovation in the electric vehicle field is important. Of that total, 30 percent describe this as very important.

As for hybrids and plug-in hybrids, 66 percent of participants in this BMW study noted that they would consider one of these electrified vehicles before purchasing a pure EV, which makes sense. Plug-ins are a great steppingstone between conventional vehicles and electrics.

Moving in a slightly different but closely related direction, 58 percent of Americans “are open to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles,” which is interesting. If drivers are concerned about the public charging network, good luck finding hydrogen anywhere. Some 44 percent of those folks are open to hydrogen and 14 percent are very open.

Race To The Clouds

Next up, Honda will be the first manufacturer to run a hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicle up Pikes (non-possessive) Peak in Colorado. The Japanese automaker will field its CR-V e:FCEV in The Broadmoor Pikes Peak International Hill Climb (brought to you by Gran Turismo, because apparently that’s important enough to mention in the media release).

The vehicle will compete in the exhibition class and has no powertrain modifications. The CR-V e:FCEV is motivated by one electric motor mounted up front, though the vehicle also has a fuel cell stack that was manufactured in Michigan, as well as two high-pressure hydrogen tanks and a 17.7-kilowatt-hour battery pack. Hopefully this CR-V has enough juice to make it up the nearly 12.5-mile course, which also has a whopping 156 turns and climbs to an altitude of 14,115 feet. Sounds like they’ll need more oxygen than hydrogen.

To see how well the CR-V e:FCEV performs in this Pikes Peak race, the competition is scheduled to take place on June 22, so mark your calendar… or just remember that it’s Sunday.

Rickshaw Of The Future

Aside from all that jazz – or whatever musical genre you prefer, perhaps bluegrass – Honda is making more headlines this week. The company also announced a new last-mile delivery vehicle business called Fastport. This division will provide so-called “micromobility solutions” if you’re an enjoyer of needlessly jargony buzzwords. Resembling a sci-fi motor rickshaw or some sort of futuristic tuktuk, the Fastport eQuad electric quadracycle prototype will make its global debut at the Eurobike conference in Frankfurt Germany next week.

This amusingly odd-looking vehicle is designed for densely congested urban areas and can be driven (or ridden?) in bike lanes. Accordingly, the eQuad has a pedal-assisted powertrain and batteries that can be easily swapped out, so there’s no need to fret about lengthy recharge times.

How large is this 21st century rickshaw? Well, the length clocks in at up to 144 inches, the width a manageable 48 and the height 84 inches. A smaller version will also be offered, and it’s a little trimmer in all dimensions. The large model’s maximum payload is 650 pounds (the small model tops out at 320) and the vehicle can hit a heady top speed of 12 mph.

As with any electric vehicle, range is highly variable, depending on factors like payload, temperatures and weather conditions. Still, Honda estimates the eQuad should be able to travel up to 23 miles with full batteries.

The Fastport eQuad will be built in Ohio of all places at Honda’s Performance Manufacturing Center, the facility that used to be home to the NSX supercar. Initial deliveries of the eQuad are expected to commence in late 2025, with mass production coming online next summer.

Medium-Rare Earths

And finally, rare-earth elements are materials most people have probably never heard of, but are absolutely critical to the functioning of modern society. These metals are used in certain aerospace applications and are particularly useful in powerful electric motors. Unfortunately, China has this market almost completely cornered. As reported by one source, they control 92 percent of global refined rare earth materials and produce up to 90 percent of the world’s permanent-magnet electric motors. Beijing’s supremacy in this field is nearly total.

Breaking this metals hegemony will not be easy, and according to a report from Bloomberg, it’s going to take Western nations years to make any dent in China’s dominance. And this is an obvious problem as the Asian country limits exports, particularly to the U.S.

Fortunately, some folks realize the issue and are working to correct it. According to that Bloomberg story, Mark Smith, CEO of NioCorp Developments Ltd. said this situation is clearly a wake-up call. “We need to have capabilities so that we have something more than zero,” he added. Accordingly, he and the company he runs are “developing a new mine in Nebraska, which could produce rare earth elements as byproducts, including terbium and dysprosium.”

Currently, NioCorp has the necessary permits, a grant from the U.S. Department of Defense and even loans. “Building” of the mine should start later in 2025, a process that is expected to take about three years. Production of rare-earth materials will likely commence in 2029. Getting this stuff up and running domestically is clearly no easy task, so it’s good at least one company is investing in this stuff.",https://static1.topspeedimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/honda-fastport-equad-prototype-front-three-quarter.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 18:07:41.846163

In 2024, state Sen. Celina Villanueva, D-Chicago, proposed a bill to ban natural gas in new buildings. A Chicago alderman, Maria Hadden, introduced similar legislation backed by Mayor Brandon Johnson around the same time.

Marc Brown, vice president of state affairs for the Consumer Energy Alliance, said forced electrification would cost $55,000 for the average single-family home.

“That includes when you’re redoing your panel, heat pumps, changing out a gas furnace, all your appliances,” Brown told The Center Square.

Citing data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the CEA said forced electrification could increase Illinois utility bills by $7.6 billion statewide or about $2,631 per household.

“When it comes to electric heating, it’s a little bit more expensive than gas, so that drives up energy bills,” Brown added.

Brown said the move to ban natural gas is ideological, but most people do not support it.

“They don’t want to be told what to do. I think it just comes from the fringe when it comes to these draconian mandates,” Brown said.

Brown said costs would rise even more if proposed bans were expanded to include the manufacturing and agricultural sectors.

According to the CEA, Illinois manufacturers consume over 25% of the state’s natural gas. The state’s agricultural community relies on natural gas for crop drying.

Brown said other issues include rising electricity demand and warnings about grid reliability.

“Adding this layer of increased electricity load on top of that, we’re seeing a little too much for the electricity grid,” Brown said.

According to regional grid operator PJM, energy is getting more expensive.

“The reason is very simple: Supply is decreasing on the system and demand is increasing. This is happening not just in PJM but all over the country,” PJM told The Center Square in a statement last month.

PJM said the decreased supply is primarily due to state and federal decarbonization policies and some economics, including the proliferation of data centers and the advancement of artificial intelligence.

Brown said gas industry improvements have fueled decreasing energy-related carbon emissions in the U.S. while other countries experienced increases.

“Natural gas is very clean. Companies have drastically reduced methane leakage on the distribution pipeline system like 80-90% over the past 20-30 years,” Brown said.

Tim Mathern, D-Fargo.
The repeal effort includes officials from Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.
South Dakota state Sen. Joy Hohn, R-Hartford, described the tax credits as wasteful spending.
Mathern said repealing the tax credits would put projects like Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed five-state carbon dioxide pipeline “in dire danger.” “And that’s really positive,” he said.
The House recently passed its version of the bill without a repeal of the 45Q tax credits.","PIERRE, S.D. – Over 100 state and local officials from the Midwest and West are asking the U.S. Senate to eliminate tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration as part of a federal budget reconciliation bill.

Established by Congress and then-President George W. Bush in 2008, the 45Q tax credits incentivize companies to capture carbon dioxide from processes such as ethanol production and sequester it underground, so it won’t contribute to climate change by acting as a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. The carbon can also be sequestered as part of enhanced oil recovery, in which pressurized gas is used to push more oil to the surface.

Opponents say the credits don’t work as intended.

“The 45Q tax credits really only make sense to the industries that are poised to make billions of dollars from them,” said North Dakota state Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo. “They are supposedly intended to reduce carbon emissions, but in fact, 45Q tax credits pay polluters for polluting and subsidize private oil production at the expense of the taxpayer.”

Companies receive up to $85 per metric ton for regular sequestration and up to $60 per metric ton for sequestration via enhanced oil recovery — though there is a provision in a draft portion of the Senate reconciliation bill that would raise the maximum oil recovery credit to $85.

The repeal effort includes officials from Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. A few of those officials held a virtual press conference Wednesday.

South Dakota state Sen. Joy Hohn, R-Hartford, described the tax credits as wasteful spending.

“We are concerned about preserving taxpayer dollars, and that’s the main gist of our conference today,” Hohn said.

Mathern said repealing the tax credits would put projects like Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed five-state carbon dioxide pipeline “in dire danger.”

“And that’s really positive,” he said.

Summit’s project alone could qualify for more than $1 billion annually from 45Q credits. It aims to capture some of the CO2 emitted by dozens of ethanol plants and ship the carbon via pipeline to a sequestration area southeast of the oilfields in western North Dakota.

Earlier this year, South Dakota’s legislators and governor adopted a law banning the use of a legal process known as eminent domain to acquire land access for carbon dioxide pipelines. South Dakota regulators also rejected Summit’s project application, saying there was no path forward for the project under the eminent domain ban.

Those moves came after several years of anti-pipeline activism by landowners focused on property rights and the danger from potential leaks of toxic carbon dioxide plumes. The project has permits in other states, but some of those are being challenged in court.

Congressional Republicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move a budget package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster. The House recently passed its version of the bill without a repeal of the 45Q tax credits. U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, voted for the bill.

A spokesperson for Johnson sent a statement when asked via email if the congressman supports repealing the tax credits: “While Dusty wished the reconciliation bill was more conservative, he voted in favor of it when it passed the House. We’ll see what the Senate passes.”

A spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, said Rounds met with a group of South Dakota lawmakers when they traveled to D.C. to voice opposition to the 45Q tax credits.

“Senator Rounds has long held the belief that many industry specific tax credits should not be perpetual, a belief which this group of landowners shares,” the statement said. “However, he has not had a chance to hear details of President Trump’s interest in this program. While many in South Dakota may oppose 45Q, it has been a popular proposal for other states for almost two decades and was included in the House-passed reconciliation bill.”

The office of Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, sent a similar reply that did not disclose his position on the tax credits.

“As congressional Republicans work with President Trump to pass legislation that will create long-term strength, safety, and prosperity for America, Sen. Thune appreciated the opportunity to meet with and hear firsthand from state legislators who have been on the front lines of this issue.”

Anti-pipeline activists are also concerned about a provision in an early draft of the House budget reconciliation bill that they said would have allowed federal regulators to approve natural gas and carbon dioxide pipelines over prohibitions in state law. That provision was removed before the bill passed the House. The rest of the statement from Thune’s office appeared to address that issue: “He understands their concerns, and he conveyed that the provision removed by the House is unlikely to be included in the final bill.”

The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.","WASHINGTON (AP) — House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.

Republicans in the two chambers don’t agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.

The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.

While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.

Here’s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:

Tax break for families

The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.

The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump’s second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.

Trump campaign promises

Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.

The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.

The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that’s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.

The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.

The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.

And on Social Security, the bills don’t directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

More SALT

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That’s a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

Medicaid providers

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

“This needs a lot of work. It’s really concerning and I’m really surprised by it,” he said. “Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.”

Tax breaks for business

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Clean energy tax credits

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden’s climate law. It aimed to boost the nation’s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

Odds and ends

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn’t include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

The LG Energy Solution, the South Korea’s top battery manufacturer, has recently established joint ventures in both Europe and the United States — partnering with France’s Derichebourg and Toyota Tsusho Co., respectively.

These initiatives mark LG’s first direct entry into recycling operations in these key global markets.

Meanwhile, SK Ecoplant, the construction and engineering arm of SK Group, is expanding its European operations in the Netherlands.

The facility will add an annual processing capacity of 25,000 metric tons of black mass, with the expansion slated for completion in 2025, the South Korean English-language daily newspaper added.

Going further, Posco-GS Eco Materials — a joint venture between Posco Holdings and GS Energy, with ownership split 51:49 — has also made a notable move by acquiring full ownership of its recycling unit, Posco HY Clean Metal.

This was achieved by purchasing the 35 percent stake held by China’s Huayou Cobalt in April, the South Korea’s news platform added.

These strategic shifts come amid a prolonged downturn in the battery recycling sector, fueled by weakened EV demand and falling prices of core battery minerals such as nickel, lithium, and manganese.

Lithium carbonate prices, which exceeded 450 Chinese yuan (USD 63) per kilogram in January 2023, have plummeted to about 50 yuan. Nickel has also seen a steep drop from over USD 31,000 per ton to around USD 20,000.

As a result, SungEel HiTech — one of only two battery recycling companies listed on Korea’s tech-heavy Kosdaq — has faced falling profitability and declining free cash flow for two consecutive years.

A joint recycling venture between SungEel HiTech and SK Innovation, announced in 2022, has been postponed indefinitely. Additionally, SK Ecoplant’s planned facilities in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, and in Kentucky have shown little to no progress for several years.

The news report added that the Korean industry watchers expect a sharp rise in used EV batteries reaching end-of-life status, generally around 10 years after initial use — a timeline that aligns with the global EV sales boom in the 2010s, which topped one million units by 2015.

With global EV adoption continuing to rise, the battery recycling market — valued at USD 8 billion in 2022 — is forecast to grow to as much as USD 53.57 billion by 2030, according to SNE Research.

Experts argue that participating in the recycling segment is becoming crucial for maintaining competitiveness in the battery industry, especially as regulatory pressure mounts globally for the use of recycled materials.

The European Union, for instance, mandates that EV batteries sold in the region must contain minimum percentages of recycled metals by 2031: 16 percent for cobalt, 85 percent for lead, 6 percent for lithium, and 6 percent for nickel. These thresholds will increase by 2036.

In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act excludes EVs from tax credits if key battery materials are sourced from “foreign entities of concern,” further pushing manufacturers to procure materials domestically — often through recycling.",https://www.takeonedigitalnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ANI-20250621074548-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 17:05:47.479084

“At the current pace, we are projecting a shortfall of energy,” said David Souder, executive director of PJM operations.
This summer, grid operators expect electricity demand could reach 154,000 megawatts, enough to power more than hundreds of millions of homes.
But in the event of an extreme heat wave, demand could spike to 166,000 megawatts.
“That’s when we look at potentially becoming short our reserves and the need to load what we call demand response,” Souder said.","COLUMBUS, Ohio — The country’s largest electric grid operator is issuing a warning that could directly impact central Ohio, as extreme summer heat and surging electricity demand from massive new developments may push the region’s energy supply to a tipping point.

Officials with PJM Interconnection, which manages the flow of electricity across 13 states, including Ohio, say rising demand from large-scale projects like the Intel chip plant, Google data center and Anduril facility — combined with intensifying summer heat—are straining the grid.

“At the current pace, we are projecting a shortfall of energy,” said David Souder, executive director of PJM operations.

The warning comes as PJM faces a growing challenge: aging power plants are retiring faster than new energy sources can come online. Souder emphasized the need to keep existing generators running longer to avoid outages.

“We really need to keep the generation that is scheduled to retire online until we can basically serve the load reliably,” Souder added.

This summer, grid operators expect electricity demand could reach 154,000 megawatts, enough to power more than hundreds of millions of homes. But in the event of an extreme heat wave, demand could spike to 166,000 megawatts. At that level, PJM says the system could start experiencing reserve shortfalls.

“That’s when we look at potentially becoming short our reserves and the need to load what we call demand response,” Souder said. “Demand response is a product where we will pay in-use customers, whether they be residential or commercial customers, to actually reduce their load and demand to maintain reliable systems.”

Relief may be coming, but not soon enough.

A new natural gas-fired power plant approved for construction in New Albany is expected to help offset central Ohio’s growing energy needs. However, the facility isn’t built yet. It’s unknown when it will be online to help offset PJM’s projected energy shortfall two years from now.

Despite the challenges, Souder said Ohio is in relatively good shape for this summer. PJM has recently secured approval for an additional 47,000 megawatts of capacity across the system, but he stressed that getting that new infrastructure built and operational remains the biggest hurdle.",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WBNS/images/5d3ada9f-aefc-4c5c-8f3c-1901a2afb912/20250621T144055/5d3ada9f-aefc-4c5c-8f3c-1901a2afb912_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 17:06:04.440109

The bill now heads to the Senate, where it faces a final vote, expected next week, before becoming law.
Carney’s goal is to see big projects approved within two years, creating more certainty for companies and investors.
Not all Indigenous groups oppose the bill.

The legislation drafted by Prime Minister Mark Carney’s government aims to fast-track construction by allowing projects that are deemed in the “national interest” to receive a quicker review for environmental and other impacts. The bill now heads to the Senate, where it faces a final vote, expected next week, before becoming law.

Carney’s goal is to see big projects approved within two years, creating more certainty for companies and investors. The legislation, which meets an election campaign promise, creates a new federal office to handle the work of approvals.

“The process to build in this country, which has become too arduous, has taken too long, and has been holding us back, is changing,” he said at a news conference late Friday. “In the past, with every year that a proposal to build a port, a wind energy farm or a highway sat on an official’s desk, we were leaving investment, prosperity and jobs — people’s careers — on the table.”

But some Indigenous groups say they’re concerned the law gives the government power to ram projects through their territories without proper consultation.

If the bill passes, “nothing’s off the table” when it comes to legal challenges, Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, told lawmakers earlier this week. “You’re going to have legal wrangling right up the ying-yang if you don’t do the right thing and do this bill in a proper, respectful and good way. I think Canada can save itself years of litigation if it does that.”

Much of Carney’s news conference after the vote was devoted to addressing these concerns. He was joined by Indigenous Services Minister Mandy Gull-Masty.

“Through Indigenous equity and resource management, these projects will be built with Indigenous nations and communities,” Carney said, mentioning a C$10 billion ($7.3 billion) federal loan guarantee program which he doubled the size of and which has just started to underwrite deals.

Carney also said he’d meet First Nations on July 17, with more meetings afterward. Indigenous groups in Canada are playing a growing role in public and business affairs, following court victories as well as a cultural and political reckoning in the wake of Canada’s 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which advised 94 actions to redress historical wrongs done to them.

The Chiefs of Ontario, representing the province’s 133 First Nations, also pushed back against the bill. “Bill C-5 is a direct attack against the sovereignty and the jurisdiction of every First Nation in Ontario,” Ontario Regional Chief Abram Benedict told reporters this week.

The conflict evokes past controversies over large projects such as Northern Gateway, a proposed oil pipeline in western Canada that ran into significant opposition from Indigenous groups and was ultimately rejected in 2016 by the government of Justin Trudeau.

‘Turning Point’

Carney’s aim with the law is to signal a different approach to his Liberal predecessor. Some energy companies and other investors pulled back on infrastructure plans under Trudeau, citing long approval timelines and regulatory barriers.

First Nations are “not against development” but want to be included in the planning, said Alvin Fiddler, grand chief of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation in northern Ontario. He added that the legislation “will not apply in our territories” if it passes.

Not all Indigenous groups oppose the bill. The First Nations Major Projects Coalition, which has more than 170 members across Canada, said the bill may be “a turning point if it is designed and administered in true partnership.”

Dominic LeBlanc, the minister who would be responsible for designating projects as in the “national interest” under the legislation, and Rebecca Alty, the minister of Crown-Indigenous relations, defended the bill earlier this week in the Senate.

Ministers pointed out that one of the five criteria for a designating a project to be in the “national interest” is that it advances the interests of Indigenous people.

“I can appreciate where people are coming from, because to say, ‘Trust us, here’s the legislation’ — there’s been a lot of broken trust over the years,” Alty said. “We know that failing to uphold our legal responsibilities stopped projects, delayed projects, and we’re looking to advance projects.”

She also said the major projects office would include an Indigenous advisory council.

The bill, which includes a requirement that it be reviewed every five years, received the support of the Conservative Party. But some opposition lawmakers raised concerns and environmental groups have criticized the bill. One Liberal lawmaker voted against it, while one member of Carney’s cabinet — Minister of Canadian Identity and Culture Steven Guilbeault, a long-time environmentalist — did not vote.

The New Democratic Party successfully put forward a motion to split the bill, so that less contentious provisions that dismantle internal trade barriers could be voted on separately. That part of the legislation cleared the House as well.

That money will come from ratepayers instead — for example, as much as 3 cents more per kilowatt hour for a project using the production tax credit.
Alaska’s largest solar developer pulled out of all their planned projects based on uncertainty over tax credits.
If energy projects are canceled now, or infrastructure can’t be replaced, it locks our communities into volatile diesel and imported gas.
We need reasonable ‘start of construction’ eligibility, a more realistic phase out schedule for the production tax credit, investment tax credit and residential clean energy credit, and to replace the impossible paperwork mess of the “prohibited foreign entity” requirements with a workable sourcing rule.","For decades, federal support for renewable energy largely excluded Alaska while building new energy opportunities and capacity in the Lower 48. Nonprofit cooperatives, which generate nearly all of Alaska’s power, didn’t qualify. Hydropower, which is an important energy source in many communities, also didn’t qualify, or received a lesser credit.

Legislation passed in 2022 finally reformed these credits to work for Alaska. Today, the ‘elective pay’ provision allows not-for-profit entities like our electric cooperatives and governments to take the credit in cash, putting them on equal footing with the rest of the country. The new credit is technology-neutral, so hydro and geothermal can qualify. And the entire state of Alaska receives a 10% bonus on top of the 30% baseline.

As the U.S. Senate works on President Trump’s comprehensive budget reconciliation package – his ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ – we urge Sen. Dan Sullivan and Sen. Lisa Murkowksi, as well as Rep. Nick Begich, to safeguard the federal investment tax credit and the production tax credit provisions. The House budget bill stripped the most important parts for Alaska before we can even benefit, and would drive up electric rates. Early Senate edits may soften some of these changes, but most Alaska projects won’t be able to access the incentives before they phase out.

Depending on the final text, the Railbelt stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars, from the state’s proposed Dixon Diversion hydro expansion, planned wind farms, and solar on the Kenai Peninsula. That money will come from ratepayers instead — for example, as much as 3 cents more per kilowatt hour for a project using the production tax credit. This comes as fuel costs are driving up our already high rates, which have risen 10% in the past 18 months. Rural Alaska faces even steeper increases.

That’s if the projects happen at all. Alaska’s largest solar developer pulled out of all their planned projects based on uncertainty over tax credits. It takes years to get projects to the start line, and the state and federal grants that kickstarted them are disappearing. Ratepayers in other communities, like Kodiak, that have already made the move to renewables but must maintain and eventually replace their equipment, will also lose if these incentives are taken away. If energy projects are canceled now, or infrastructure can’t be replaced, it locks our communities into volatile diesel and imported gas. With the Senate expected to vote on final language for these provisions within the next few weeks, Alaska’s window to defend these benefits is rapidly closing.

Draft Senate language means many projects would have to start construction almost immediately to access the full credits, and phases them out fully over several years. Alaska’s remote logistics, long supply chains and short building seasons mean that a single delayed barge could make ratepayer costs jump. Slower-to-build projects like hydro plants don’t have a hope of meeting the schedule.

“Prohibited foreign entity” rules demand that utilities prove that no wire or microchip ever touched a blacklisted country. A small rural co-op has no chance of tracking this and could see money clawed back years later for an honest mistake.

Alaska needs our congressional delegation to help keep the elective pay option, technology neutrality, the 30% baseline, and Alaska’s 10% energy community bonus.

It is also important to fix the parts of this bill that don’t work for Alaska. We need reasonable ‘start of construction’ eligibility, a more realistic phase out schedule for the production tax credit, investment tax credit and residential clean energy credit, and to replace the impossible paperwork mess of the “prohibited foreign entity” requirements with a workable sourcing rule.

Our state has waited decades to benefit from federal clean energy incentives. These credits are our chance to finally diversify our energy system and build a more stable, affordable future. Let’s not eliminate Alaska’s opportunity before we can use it.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/51208-97b2bee208048313c0765f30b9ec55337b175a3e69dc7f98352e5738b28c4e94-2048x1367.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 16:07:03.238534

Average monthly payments have soared to around $745. A record share of Americans—nearly one in five—now shell out more than $1,000 per month for their cars.

Trump and his allies in Congress say they’re working to make cars affordable again. But experts who have examined the policies they've both proposed and enacted say the problem is likely to get even worse.

“It does not appear like any of the policies will result in people paying less to buy and own vehicles in 2028 or 2029 than they do today,” said Chris Harto, a senior policy analyst at Consumer Reports.

Take tariffs, for example. When Trump announced 25% tariffs on imported cars and car parts in April, he audaciously said: “You’re going to see prices go down.” While record-high post-pandemic inflation is finally cooling off, this promise ignores the very basics of what a tariff is. The whole point is to make the domestic industry more competitive by driving up the costs of importing a particular good.

Despite some automakers’ vows to keep prices low, any economist will tell you that vehicle prices will increase over time. It may not happen immediately—prices have remained remarkably stable this spring so far—but it will happen sooner or later.

U.S. tariffs will cost the auto industry $30 billion in 2026, the consulting firm AlixPartners estimates. Car companies will not absorb the hit for the good of the American consumer. Rather, AlixPartners expects them to pass on about 80% of those increased costs to buyers, with the ultimate price hike depending on where in the world a vehicle is made.

Vehicles produced outside of North America will be hit the hardest; prices for those cars will increase by approximately $4,400. AlixPartners expects the average vehicle sold in the U.S. to get $1,760 pricier. Repair bills will go up too, as the cost of car components increases.

At Trump’s direction, federal agencies are preparing to relax the standards that were pushing automakers to boost fuel economy and cut tailpipe emissions over time. The heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Transportation have cheered these rollbacks as a win for consumers, who will see vehicle prices drop as automakers are freed from onerous regulations.

Likewise, Senate Republicans have proposed dropping the fines for noncompliance with Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) rules to zero. They say their measure “Brings down automobile prices modestly by eliminating CAFE penalties on automakers that design cars to conform to the wishes of DC bureaucrats rather than consumers.”

The reality is that more fuel-efficient cars—the EVs and hybrids that these rules push automakers to produce—save people tons of money on gas over time. That’s part of why Americans have been flocking to hybrid cars in unprecedented numbers in the last few years.

“There’s almost a 0% chance—as close to a 0% chance as you can have—that eliminating these standards will reduce the cost of vehicles to consumers,” Harto said. “What it is going to do is drive up the fuel cost for consumers.”

If left to run their course, the Biden-era vehicle rules would deliver $6,000 in lifetime fuel savings for buyers of new vehicles, according to a Consumer Reports analysis.

Meanwhile, repealing tax credits for Americans who buy plug-in hybrids and EVs will inflate the upfront cost to get into some of the country’s cleanest vehicles.The Republicans’ sweeping budget reconciliation package is still making its way through Congress. But the death of EV tax credits seems to be a question of “when,” not “if.” The latest proposal from the Senate Finance Committee would eliminate the $4,000 rebate for buyers of used EVs within 90 days and end the $7,500 program for new EVs after 180 days.

Moreover, the one-two punch of tariffs and ending the EV tax credits threatens a new crop of more affordable electric cars coming soon—not all of which automakers planned to build in America. That leaves people stuck buying more expensive gas-guzzling options when they could have had cheaper alternatives.

Policy changes such as these that derail EV adoption will also increase demand for gasoline, inflating prices at the pump for all Americans. The Rhodium Group, a research firm, projects that gas prices will go up by between 25 and 37 cents per gallon by 2035 as a result of the House’s sweeping domestic policy bill, passed last month.

It may get more expensive to charge up your EV, too. Congress is on track to prematurely torpedo tax credits in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that subsidize the production of clean energy, as well as investments in new clean energy projects. And removing a tax credit is effectively a tax hike. The reversal could add up to $400 to some Americans’ annual electricity bills by 2035, one analysis found.

There are more direct cost increases on the table, too. The House’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes a $250 annual tax on owners of EVs and $100 fee for hybrids. The ostensible goal is to raise money for highway improvements by targeting people who pay less in federal gas taxes. But the fee is out of whack with what most Americans pay in gas taxes; Consumer Reports found that the average driver of a gas-guzzling V8 pickup truck only pays around $100 per year in gas taxes, while many other drivers pay far less.

To be sure, Trump also promised on the campaign trail to allow Americans to deduct car-loan interest from their taxable income. That could save some car buyers a few hundred dollars per year.

But, given the mountain of forces acting to drive costs up, that may be cold comfort for America’s drivers.",https://images.inkl.com/s3/article/lead_image/22153515/trump-car-prices.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 22:01:28.011200

Why it matters: This includes some of the state's most popular hiking, skiing and camping areas across the Western Slope.

The big picture: The Republican-led proposal would require the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to put up to 3.3 million acres on the market for housing development.

The bill's focus is on parcels outside of protected lands (like national parks, monuments or wilderness areas, which are exempt) but near roads and other development deemed suitable by local and state lawmakers.

The Wilderness Society estimates more than 250 million acres across 11 Western states could be eligible for sale.

Zoom in: In Colorado, that means some of its most prized public lands could be up for grabs, including sweeping sections of the Arapaho, San Juan and Rio Grande national forests.

Also on the line are iconic stretches of the Million Dollar Highway and beloved hiking spots near Kenosha and Guanella passes, especially popular during fall leaf-peeping season.

Follow the money: Most of the revenue — projected between $5 billion and $10 billion over the next decade — would go to the U.S. Treasury. Just 5% would trickle down to local governments.

It's unclear how much the sale of public lands would negatively impact the outdoor recreation economy, which generated $1.2 trillion in economic output and supported 5 million jobs nationwide in 2023.

Reality check: A recent Headwaters Economics report found less than 2% of public lands in the West near housing-hungry towns are actually suitable for development, and could be complicated due to high wildfire risk.

The fine print: For the first decade, the land could only be sold for housing or related infrastructure — but after 10 years, that restriction vanishes, opening the door to virtually any kind of development, from strip malls to oil rigs.

What they're saying: Colorado Democratic U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper, who sits on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee, told CPR no Democrats on the committee were given advance notice or could offer input, despite their states being on the list.

""I was shocked,"" Hickenlooper said. ""That's not the way government's supposed to work.""

Now it’s time for policy and investment to catch up.” Battery Storage Grew 41 Percent In 12 Months When it comes to battery storage, Bloomberg agrees.
In 2024, battery storage represented just 2 percent of power capacity in the US.
BNEF expects utility-scale battery storage to nearly double this year despite how hostile to renewables the failed administration in Washington tries to be.
In all, about 18 gigawatts of new battery storage capacity is expected to be added in the US in 2025.","June 21 is the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere. Tomorrow, the days start getting shorter again. What better time for Ember, the clean energy advocacy folks, to release its latest battery report. Here’s the headline: “Batteries are now cheap enough to unleash solar’s full potential, getting as close as 97% of the way to delivering constant electricity supply 24 hours across 365 days cost-effectively in the sunniest places.” OK. First things first. Obviously not everywhere on Earth qualifies as one of the planet’s “sunniest places.” To explain that further, Ember has supplied this helpful graphic.

The Ember report focuses primarily on generating enough solar power to operate a typical residence. What is typical, of course, varies a great deal depending on where you are the world. Ember says, “On an average day in a sunny city like Las Vegas, providing 1 kW of stable, round-the-clock power requires 5 kW of fixed solar panels paired with a 17 kWh battery. This combination can deliver a constant 1 kW of solar electricity every hour over a full 24-hour period — and this amount of battery will be sufficient for most regions across the world.”

CleanTechnica readers, being well above average, will instantly realize that many homes, especially in wealthy societies, consume far more than 1 kW of electricity during many hours of the day. According to Google, the typical home on the US uses about 30 kW of electricity a day, which is more than the 24 kW Ember is projecting. But let’s not get lost in the weeds here. What Ember is really saying is that the levelized cost of electricity from solar plus storage is now the lowest of all available energy sources and that solar is getting closer to being dispatchable — meaning it will be there when needed — with every passing month and year. Here’s the synopsis of the report:

The emergence of 24-hour solar generation marks a fundamental shift in how solar fits into the broader power system. With the ability to deliver electricity around-the-clock, solar can now support 24/7 clean energy contracts (PPAs) for industries which require continuous power, not just daytime supply. This is extremely valuable for emerging economies, where solar-powered industrial and economic zones can emerge in sunny areas far from existing grid infrastructure. At the same time, it can also bring substantial potential savings on grid expansion costs – allowing up to five times as much solar capacity to be installed behind the same grid connection, maximizing existing assets and deferring costly upgrades.

As costs continue to fall and deployment accelerates, solar-plus-storage is emerging as the default model for clean power in the sunniest parts of the world — both on and off the grid. To fully realize its potential, energy policy must now catch up, by integrating 24 hour solar generation into planning frameworks, electricity market design, and infrastructure development strategies.

“This is a turning point in the clean energy transition,” say Kostantsa Rangelova, a ‍global electricity analyst at Ember. “Around-the-clock solar is no longer just a technical possibility and distant dream, but an economic reality. It unlocks game changing opportunities for energy-hungry industries like data centers and manufacturing. Solar will be unleashed. The change is new — the costs and quality of grid batteries have improved so much in the last 12 months. Now it’s time for policy and investment to catch up.”

Battery Storage Grew 41 Percent In 12 Months

When it comes to battery storage, Bloomberg agrees. It says that from April 2024 through April 2025, energy storage in the US surged from 18 gigawatts to 25 gigawatts, a 41 percent increase, according to federal data. In Arizona, battery capacity nearly tripled; in Texas, it has almost doubled.

“Renewable electricity is setting records every few days and comprised almost one-third of all US power generation in March. Batteries can make sure those electrons hit at the most opportune time – or at least that they don’t go to waste. Along the way, they’ll drag electricity prices down, speed the retirement of fossil fuel plants and preclude plans for new ones,” Bloomberg says.

Jan Rosenow, head of the energy program at the Oxford Environmental Change Institute, told Bloomberg, “Twenty years ago, the main problem with renewables was that they were so expensive. Now renewables are cheap, but we need to be able to match that supply to demand. For that, battery storage is clearly one of the best tools in the box.” He says there is a surge in grid-scale battery installations and because costs are dropping, more utilities will adopt storage as their default strategy for increasing the capacity of their grids. “Storage is now where solar was maybe 10 years ago,” he said. “That’s kind of how it feels to me. It’s really mind blowing.”

According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, three of the six US major power grids are at risk of power outages this summer. That could place about a third of all Americans at risk of power failures this summer. NERC told Bloomberg this week that the odds of an energy emergency in Texas this summer are down from about 15 percent a few months ago to 3.6 percent today, thanks to increased storage battery capacity.

“Reliability is the ability to react to sudden changes in the grid,” said Chris McKissack, chief executive officer of Fullmark Energy, which is building two storage sites in Texas. “And when it comes to reacting, nothing moves faster than battery storage.”

Last summer, there were no major power outages in the US, a success the Department of Energy primarily attributed to new solar generation and storage. Officials at ERCOT in Texas say batteries have played a critical role in lowering retail prices of electricity, especially in the summer. They expect storage in the state to triple over the next five years.

In 2024, battery storage represented just 2 percent of power capacity in the US. BNEF expects utility-scale battery storage to nearly double this year despite how hostile to renewables the failed administration in Washington tries to be. In all, about 18 gigawatts of new battery storage capacity is expected to be added in the US in 2025. Those batteries are often the most affordable way for utility companies to add capacity. The average price for stationary storage systems in 2024 was $125 per kWh — 19% lower than in 2023 according to BNEF.

All of this good news about storage batteries — both residential and grid scale — does not mention what the source is of the millions of battery cells needed to construct those storage systems. But the answer is clear. China dominates not only the manufacturing of battery cells but also the supply chains for the raw materials that go into making them. China is also by far the largest supplier of solar panels. In the age of tariff diplomacy (which is really the opposite of diplomacy), the implications for the US could be enormous.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Prevalon_Media-e1712014901623.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 16:06:57.310516

The U.K.’s five existing nuclear power reactors contributed 14 percent of the country’s electricity in 2024, marking a decrease from the peak production of the 1990s, when 18 nuclear reactors provided over a quarter of the country’s power.
The energy secretary said that supporting nuclear power was the only way to achieve the government’s net-zero emissions pledges by mid-century, especially with the U.K. energy demand set to rise.
Critics of nuclear energy say the funds could be better used to expand the U.K.’s renewable energy capacity, which is far cheaper and faster to develop than nuclear power plants.
However, the government and those in the nuclear sector point out that nuclear power plants deliver stable power 24 hours a day, compared to solar and wind farms, which require battery storage to achieve this.","The U.K. is once again backing nuclear power, with plans to develop new large-scale nuclear plants as well as alternative small modular reactors (SMRs) in the coming decades. This is part of a Labour government plan to accelerate the country’s green transition by expanding its clean energy capacity and shifting away from a reliance on fossil fuels.

For decades, the U.K. stopped developing its nuclear energy capacity, due to poor public perception of the energy source, the high costs involved with developing new projects, and a focus on other energy sources, predominantly fossil fuels. The U.K.’s five existing nuclear power reactors contributed 14 percent of the country’s electricity in 2024, marking a decrease from the peak production of the 1990s, when 18 nuclear reactors provided over a quarter of the country’s power. Four of the operational plants are due to close before 2030, even with plans to expand their lifetimes. However, in recent months, there has been talk of a nuclear renaissance in the U.K.

Britain’s energy secretary, Ed Miliband, who has long backed nuclear power, announced plans this month for a $19 billion investment to develop a conventional new nuclear power station, and further funding to support the small modular reactor industry and advance nuclear energy research. The nuclear programme will “get Britain off the fossil fuel rollercoaster”, according to Miliband. The energy secretary said that supporting nuclear power was the only way to achieve the government’s net-zero emissions pledges by mid-century, especially with the U.K. energy demand set to rise. He also stressed the government’s unwavering support for renewable energy.

“I’m doing this because of my belief that climate change is the biggest long-term threat facing us… The truth is that we have this massive challenge to get off fossil fuels. That is the central driving ambition of the government’s clean energy superpower mission. We know that we’re going to have to see electricity demand at least double, by 2050,” said Miliband. “All of the expert advice says nuclear has a really important role to play in the energy system. In any sensible reckoning, this is essential to get to our clean power and net zero ambitions.”

The government will spend billions on the completion of the Sizewell C nuclear plant on England’s south Suffolk coast. The development is expected to support the creation of 10,000 jobs and, once operational, the plant will power up to 6 million homes. The long-awaited investment decision quashes the uncertainty surrounding Sizewell C, where the French operator EDF has been looking to secure funding for 15 years. The government hopes the funding will allow Sizewell C to be developed under a different model to Hinkley Point C, to avoid unnecessary delays and spiralling costs.

The government has also earmarked almost $3.4 billion in funding for the development of the U.K.’s first SMRs, with Great British Energy (GBN) – Nuclear choosing Rolls-Royce as the preferred company to construct one of Europe’s first SMR programmes. Rolls-Royce beat the U.S. companies Holtec and GE Hitachi to win the bid. The U.K. firm has been in wait-and-see mode, as GBN delayed its nuclear competition again and again in recent years, which Rolls-Royce said held them back when it came to SMR development.

Rolls-Royce hopes that the programme will attract higher levels of private investment once established. There are no SMR sites currently operational anywhere in the world, although several countries are investing in developing the technology. It is not clear where Rolls-Royce will develop its first SMRs, although some believe they will be on the site of retired nuclear power stations, such as Oldbury in Gloucestershire and Wylfa in north Wales.

Another $3.4 billion over five years will go to research and development into nuclear fusion energy. The fusion investment in Nottinghamshire will support development on the site of the old West Burton coal-fired power station. The government hopes the investment will support its Just Transition aims by creating new jobs in traditional energy-producing regions.

Critics of nuclear energy say the funds could be better used to expand the U.K.’s renewable energy capacity, which is far cheaper and faster to develop than nuclear power plants. However, the government and those in the nuclear sector point out that nuclear power plants deliver stable power 24 hours a day, compared to solar and wind farms, which require battery storage to achieve this. In addition, the reactors being developed “will produce low-carbon electricity for 80 or possibly 100 years, 24/7, providing around a 10th of the current UK electricity needs”, according to Mark Wenman at Imperial College London.

The U.K. government is supporting a nuclear renaissance, after years of stagnation, which it hopes will help Britain to achieve its net-zero pledges by 2050. In addition to expanding the country’s renewable energy capacity, the government will invest billions in the development of new conventional nuclear reactors and SMR technology to accelerate the U.K.’s green transition.

What's happening?

Mosaic and SunPower also met this fate within the last year, as EnergySage detailed, prompting the question: ""Will more major solar companies follow suit?""

The move was no surprise because of ""an unpredictable political and regulatory landscape, high interest rates, and persistent inflation,"" according to the independent clean energy advocate. These factors have slowed demand for solar energy and financing, particularly among residential customers. From 2023 to 2024, Americans installed 32% fewer solar systems on their homes.

""This model thrived when interest rates were low — particularly in 2020 when the Federal Reserve slashed rates to near zero,"" EnergySage reported. ""But as rates climbed in recent years, the cost of borrowing money skyrocketed, shrinking profit margins for solar companies reliant on financing. Sunnova, SunPower, and others found themselves caught between rising capital costs and slowing customer demand, a squeeze that led to financial distress.""

Why is this important?

The platform highlighted the necessity of government policies and subsidies in the industry's development, noting California solar installations dropped by 45% after a 2023 rule reduced net metering credit values by 75%.

This move may have helped utilities, but it significantly cut residents' ability to benefit from their investments by selling energy back to the grid. Installing solar panels also lowers utility bills to or near $0 and eliminates the production of heat-trapping gases from the use of dirty energy sources. It helped to topple SunPower, too, EnergySage stated.

The high upfront cost of solar systems — about $29,000 — also means many customers take out loans to pay for the infrastructure. But with costs and interest rates rising since the coronavirus pandemic, those circumstances have become untenable.

What's being done about solar adoption?

The Trump administration's push to end Inflation Reduction Act incentives and tax breaks for clean energy investments has had a chilling effect on the solar industry and renewable energy in general, EnergySage said. Those subsidies could be gone next year with an act of Congress, but they are still available now.

EnergySage offers free services that can help you land nearly $10,000 for a solar installation. Enter basic information about your home and situation, and then compare quotes from vetted installers. It has a helpful mapping tool, too, showing state-by-state costs as well as incentive details.

“It does not appear like any of the policies will result in people paying less to buy and own vehicles in 2028 or 2029 than they do today,” said Chris Harto, a senior policy analyst at Consumer Reports.

Take tariffs, for example. When Trump announced 25% tariffs on imported cars and car parts in April, he audaciously said: “You’re going to see prices go down.” While record-high post-pandemic inflation is finally cooling off, this promise ignores the very basics of what a tariff is. The whole point is to make the domestic industry more competitive by driving up the costs of importing a particular good.

Despite some automakers’ vows to keep prices low, any economist will tell you that vehicle prices will increase over time. It may not happen immediately—prices have remained remarkably stable this spring so far—but it will happen sooner or later.

U.S. tariffs will cost the auto industry $30 billion in 2026, the consulting firm AlixPartners estimates. Car companies will not absorb the hit for the good of the American consumer. Rather, AlixPartners expects them to pass on about 80% of those increased costs to buyers, with the ultimate price hike depending on where in the world a vehicle is made.

Vehicles produced outside of North America will be hit the hardest; prices for those cars will increase by approximately $4,400. AlixPartners expects the average vehicle sold in the U.S. to get $1,760 pricier. Repair bills will go up too, as the cost of car components increases.

At Trump’s direction, federal agencies are preparing to relax the standards that were pushing automakers to boost fuel economy and cut tailpipe emissions over time. The heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Transportation have cheered these rollbacks as a win for consumers, who will see vehicle prices drop as automakers are freed from onerous regulations.

Likewise, Senate Republicans have proposed dropping the fines for noncompliance with Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) rules to zero. They say their measure “Brings down automobile prices modestly by eliminating CAFE penalties on automakers that design cars to conform to the wishes of DC bureaucrats rather than consumers.”

The reality is that more fuel-efficient cars—the EVs and hybrids that these rules push automakers to produce—save people tons of money on gas over time. That’s part of why Americans have been flocking to hybrid cars in unprecedented numbers in the last few years.

“There’s almost a 0% chance—as close to a 0% chance as you can have—that eliminating these standards will reduce the cost of vehicles to consumers,” Harto said. “What it is going to do is drive up the fuel cost for consumers.”

If left to run their course, the Biden-era vehicle rules would deliver $6,000 in lifetime fuel savings for buyers of new vehicles, according to a Consumer Reports analysis.

Meanwhile, repealing tax credits for Americans who buy plug-in hybrids and EVs will inflate the upfront cost to get into some of the country’s cleanest vehicles.The Republicans’ sweeping budget reconciliation package is still making its way through Congress. But the death of EV tax credits seems to be a question of “when,” not “if.” The latest proposal from the Senate Finance Committee would eliminate the $4,000 rebate for buyers of used EVs within 90 days and end the $7,500 program for new EVs after 180 days.

Moreover, the one-two punch of tariffs and ending the EV tax credits threatens a new crop of more affordable electric cars coming soon—not all of which automakers planned to build in America. That leaves people stuck buying more expensive gas-guzzling options when they could have had cheaper alternatives.

Policy changes such as these that derail EV adoption will also increase demand for gasoline, inflating prices at the pump for all Americans. The Rhodium Group, a research firm, projects that gas prices will go up by between 25 and 37 cents per gallon by 2035 as a result of the House’s sweeping domestic policy bill, passed last month.

It may get more expensive to charge up your EV, too. Congress is on track to prematurely torpedo tax credits in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that subsidize the production of clean energy, as well as investments in new clean energy projects. And removing a tax credit is effectively a tax hike. The reversal could add up to $400 to some Americans’ annual electricity bills by 2035, one analysis found.

There are more direct cost increases on the table, too. The House’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes a $250 annual tax on owners of EVs and $100 fee for hybrids. The ostensible goal is to raise money for highway improvements by targeting people who pay less in federal gas taxes. But the fee is out of whack with what most Americans pay in gas taxes; Consumer Reports found that the average driver of a gas-guzzling V8 pickup truck only pays around $100 per year in gas taxes, while many other drivers pay far less.

To be sure, Trump also promised on the campaign trail to allow Americans to deduct car-loan interest from their taxable income. That could save some car buyers a few hundred dollars per year.

But, given the mountain of forces acting to drive costs up, that may be cold comfort for America’s drivers.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/KbYKEM/s1/trump-car-prices.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 16:06:53.153311

Our seasons have shifted — just last winter, it still felt like summer well into November. This isn’t normal. It’s a warning sign of a growing public health crisis.

Arizona is heating up faster than much of the country. Our “hot season” now lasts for months, and escaping the heat can be a matter of life or death. For seniors, kids, outdoor workers and those with chronic illnesses, extreme heat combined with aging homes and high energy costs poses a deadly threat.

Arizona’s deadly duo: Extreme heat and air pollution

The health impacts of extreme heat are well-documented. Heat can trigger a heart failure exacerbation, dehydration, heatstroke and worsen respiratory issues. On my floor at the hospital, we often see heart failure cases surge in summer as heat, dehydration and stress all play a role in sending people to the ER. And when patients arrive with multiple health issues — like chronic conditions paired with heat-related exposures — their hospital stays are often longer and their recoveries more difficult.

The threat is worse for those without stable housing. Living outdoors with no shade, water or air-conditioning can be fatal. In Phoenix, over 28,000 people and in Tucson, over 66,000 people, often low-income families and communities of color facing poor infrastructure and limited cooling, live in these hotter zones. This disparity is also evident in our hospitals: those who are hardest hit often have the fewest resources.

But it’s not just the thermometer we need to worry about. Our heat crisis is exacerbated by dangerously high air pollution levels. High temperatures accelerate the formation of ozone, a harmful pollutant that inflames the lungs and exacerbates heart and respiratory issues. The American Lung Association gave Gila, Maricopa, Pima and Pinal counties “F” grades for their high number of unhealthy ozone days, highlighting the urgent need for solutions that address both climate and public health.

Clean energy incentives: A health solution hiding in plain sight

Thanks to investments from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, there’s new hope for families struggling to stay cool and safe. Programs funded by these laws are helping Arizonans weatherize their homes, install energy-efficient cooling systems, and reduce their utility bills. For example, installing a heat pump A/C system could come with a $2,000 tax credit, resulting in an estimated $500 reduction in annual energy costs.

But for too many, the danger doesn’t end indoors. Older homes with poor insulation and outdated cooling systems can quickly turn into ovens. High electricity costs make it difficult for families to run their A/C as often as needed. On average, low-income households spend nearly 14% of their income on energy, compared to just 3% for higher-income families. For seniors on fixed incomes, it can mean an impossible choice: keep the air conditioning on or afford essential medication.

With nearly 1,000 Arizonans lost to heat-related deaths between 2012 and 2022, we need every tool to make homes safer, and Arizona’s newly launched Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates Program is one of the strongest tools we’ve got.

Led by the Governor’s Office of Resiliency and funded through the IRA, HEAR offers up to $14,000 in rebates to help low- and moderate-income families upgrade appliances, insulation and electric panels, covering up to 100% of costs for low-income households and 50% for moderate-income ones. HEAR helps families save money, stay cool, breathe easier and avoid dangerous heat exposure — all while easing strain on the electrical grid.

Arizona is leading, but our progress is at risk

Arizona has already seen the benefits of clean energy investment. Thanks to the IRA, our state has attracted over $12.75 billion and created nearly 13,000 new jobs, building a sustainable economy rooted in community health.

But this progress isn’t guaranteed. Repealing clean energy incentives could raise energy costs by nearly $400 per household and stall momentum. Recent Executive Orders and the recent reconciliation bill, which could cut or pause key federal grants, are putting lives and hard-earned progress at risk. Here in Tucson, it felt like the rug was pulled out from under our community when we learned that a $20 million Community Change Grant, meant to help low-income neighborhoods cope with extreme heat, may be canceled.

As a nurse, I treat the symptoms of extreme heat daily. But if we want real change, we need to address the root causes — and that means doubling down on clean energy solutions. I would ask any policymaker delaying or rolling back these investments: What’s the plan to keep people safe as our summers grow hotter and more dangerous?

This isn’t just about climate. It’s about saving lives.

If we want a healthier, safer Arizona, we must protect the programs and policies that make that possible. Contact your Arizona members of Congress today and urge them to oppose any attempt to cut or divert this vital funding.

In a landmark move that could redefine the roadmap for hardware and manufacturing startups in the cooling sector, Daikin Airconditioning India Pvt. Ltd. has inked a strategic partnership with the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Government of India.

This collaboration isn’t just another corporate MoU. It signals the coming together of two forces: a global air-conditioning powerhouse and a national vision to empower Indian innovators in climate-smart technology.

Daikin-DPIIT - What’s the Big Idea Behind the Partnership?

At its core, the agreement aims to nurture product-centric Indian startups working in key areas like:

Energy optimization

Climate-resilient technologies

Cooling innovations tailored for rural India

While the air-conditioning industry has long been dominated by established players, the need of the hour is innovation that is not just efficient but also sustainable and localized. That’s where this partnership steps in—to bridge the gap between market-ready climate solutions and early-stage manufacturing talent.

Daikin India has committed to offering mentorship, pilot project support, and technical incubation to startups that align with these priorities. The initiative will focus on creating an ecosystem where young Indian companies can thrive with the right backing—technically and commercially.

The Cooling Sector’s Startup Moment

India's air-conditioning market is booming, with growth projections estimating exponential demand—both in urban metros and rural hinterlands. As access to modern amenities becomes more equitable, the need for low-cost, energy-efficient, and sustainable cooling becomes non-negotiable.

“India’s air-conditioning market is poised for robust growth, and this partnership is a timely step to empower Indian startups that are driving innovation in climate tech and localized manufacturing,” the DPIIT said in a statement.

This sentiment finds resonance with the ‘Make in India’ and ‘Startup India’ campaigns, which have consistently pushed for the development of resilient, self-sustaining, and globally competitive manufacturing ecosystems.

For hardware startups in the cooling and climate tech space—traditionally sidelined by software-dominated startup narratives—this partnership could be a game changer.

Why This Partnership Matters

This is not the first time a multinational has joined hands with the Indian government to support local innovation. But Daikin’s focused attention on hardware-led manufacturing startups, particularly in an essential and under-tapped segment like cooling, makes it especially significant.

Let’s look at what makes this collaboration unique:

Bringing Deep Expertise to the Table: As a 100% subsidiary of Japan’s Daikin Industries Ltd., Daikin India brings decades of global experience and cutting-edge R&D in the HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) space.

From Pilot to Product: Startups often struggle to move from idea to scale due to lack of access to real-world testing and market pilots. Daikin’s involvement can give these innovators access to live environments, customer feedback loops, and possibly even procurement opportunities.

Focus on Rural Innovation: In a country where rural India is still underserved in terms of reliable and affordable cooling solutions, this initiative puts much-needed spotlight on rural-first innovations. These could range from solar-powered cooling devices to low-GWP (Global Warming Potential) refrigerant systems tailored for low-energy usage.

Building the Climate-Tech Value Chain: With the climate-tech sector gradually finding its footing in India, this kind of government-industry collaboration adds muscle to the value chain. From concept to commercialization, such partnerships could provide the missing links.

The Larger Context: Climate Urgency Meets Startup Energy

Climate change isn’t knocking at the door—it’s already in. From heatwaves in Delhi to water crises in Bengaluru, India is experiencing the brunt of global warming. Cooling is no longer a luxury; it’s a climate necessity. Yet, the solutions can’t come at the cost of increased carbon footprints.

This is where climate-conscious cooling startups—working on green refrigerants, off-grid cooling, and efficient energy management systems—have a crucial role to play. And with the backing of industry leaders like Daikin and policymakers from DPIIT, they now have the ecosystem to experiment, grow, and scale.

This move is also expected to create ripple effects across related sectors like electronics, clean energy, smart manufacturing, and IoT, fostering a broader innovation culture around sustainable infrastructure.

What’s Next for Startups?

If you’re a startup innovating in climate cooling, rural tech, or green manufacturing, this could be your moment. While the full details of selection criteria and engagement models are yet to be rolled out, DPIIT’s involvement suggests a structured and transparent approach.

We can also expect further announcements in terms of:

Calls for applications and startup cohorts

Industry roundtables and mentoring sessions

Pilots for product validation

Opportunities for co-development and possible procurement

The Daikin-DPIIT collaboration isn’t just about air-conditioning. It’s about building a cooler, greener, and more startup-driven India. It opens up a vital corridor between global industrial knowledge and Indian grassroots innovation.

As India aspires to become a global manufacturing hub and lead the charge in climate action, such partnerships serve as crucial proof points. The next big idea in cooling may well come from a small lab in Bengaluru or a workshop in Pune—with Daikin’s lab doors and DPIIT’s policy windows wide open to help it succeed.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/tice-news-prod/media/media_files/2025/06/21/daikin-india-joins-hands-with-dpiit-to-boost-startup-led-innovation-2025-06-21-12-21-34.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 19:05:27.111604

The full text of the Senate Finance Committee’s 549-page version of the massive tax and spending bill would make permanent a number of business-friendly tax cuts from President Donald Trump’s first term before they expire, including a trio dubbed the “big three.”

Tucked into the lengthy text, the Senate committee proposed to permanently allow 100% corporate bonus depreciation related to capital investments, as well as expensing for corporate research and development costs and the use of more favorable calculations related to interest expenses deductions, according to Marc Gerson, a partner who specializes in tax policy at the law firm of Miller & Chevalier. The House has proposed to extend the relief through 2029, he said.

The tax relief is a big priority for Senate Republicans and also enjoys a lot of bipartisan support but it is costly, Gerson said. “It’s very expensive and has a big deficit impact,” Gerson said in an interview. “That’s probably the most controversial part of it.”

Dive Insight:

The budget legislation lays the foundation for much of President Trump’s domestic agenda, encompassing defense, border security and other priorities. The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” version that already passed the House last month would also further pare back most clean energy production, manufacturing and investment tax credits, according to CFO Dive sister publication ESG Dive.

The Senate language is now going through a process known as the “Byrd Bath,” Gerson said, through which the Senate parliamentarian considers arguments from lawmakers for pulling pieces of the bill out that don’t align with the Byrd rule, which requires that reconciliation bills be focused on fiscal issues.

“You could see extraneous provisions pulled out of the bill just to make sure it doesn’t face procedural problems on the Senate floor,” Gerson said. For example, the Senate parliamentarian blocked a proposal to fold the PCAOB into the SEC due to budget reconciliation rule violations, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.

Debate over the tax provisions could stem from their estimated cost, but the revenue estimates associated with them have yet to be released by the Joint Committee on Taxation, Gerson said Friday. Earlier this week, Gerson said he expected that information to be available in the coming days while calling the bill process “fluid.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/AjxyzyI_J7dU6cXQeveWzWtH7nYLUiXZ3xifdLJnPBs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjE4NjgyMTYwLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-06-21 18:07:22.729305

Entergy also recently proposed a suite of demand response programs with the Louisiana Public Service Commission to help reduce the pressure.
For industrial and commercial users, companies like Enel X will manage large-scale power reductions.","(The Center Square) – The Midcontinent Independent System Operator is warning that “immediate action” is needed to address rising risks to resource adequacy as electricity demand across the region accelerates sharply due to artificial intelligence, electric vehicles and industrial expansion.

“Load growth is accelerating, driven by economic development such as data centers, onshoring and new industries,” the report states. The survey “calls for immediate action on capacity additions, strategic retirements and reliability reforms amid increasingly complex seasonal and load growth challenges.”

MISO, which oversees the power grid in 15 U.S. states including Louisiana, released new projections showing demand could surge by more than 400 terawatt-hours by 2044. This includes up to 241 TWh from data centers alone, 91 TWh from electric vehicles, 105 TWh from industrial electrification and 43 TWh from building electrification.

“At least 3.1 gigawatts of additional capacity beyond the committed capacity will be needed to meet the projected planning reserve margin forecast,” the survey said.

Aubrey Johnson, MISO’s vice president of system planning and competitive transmission said that there were sufficient resources for the current planning year (2025 to 2026), “but beyond that, there are some challenges.”

Tom Butz from Minnesota Power said in a MISO webinar that he was still not totally convinced the planned demand capacity would be enough.

“There is a lot of things coming our way,” Butz said. “And I’m not in the hyper-convinced zone of saying ‘that new generation is going to be able to keep up with all of this.'”

There is currently 100 gigawatts sitting in MISO’s queue,” Casey Baker, senior program manager at GridLab, told The Center Square. “If even a fraction of this generation came online it would greatly improve MISO’s position.”

In Louisiana, some of the most high-profile projects contributing to demand growth are already underway. Entergy Louisiana, the state’s largest utility, has submitted more than $3 billion in transmission and infrastructure upgrades to MISO to accommodate new industrial customers, including Meta’s data center in Richland Parish and Hyundai’s new steel plant in Ascension Parish.

Entergy submitted 14 projects to MISO in 2025 total more than $3 billion, including $498 million in upgrades for two industrial loads at the RiverPlex MegaPark in Ascension Parish, where the Hyundai facility will be located.

“If new resource additions are not made promptly or retirements are delayed, resource adequacy risk will continue to grow,” the MISO report concludes.

Entergy is indeed adding such resources, including new and upgraded transmission lines and substations.

Entergy will construct a new substation in Iberville Parish, called Commodore, that will connect two major voltage systems and help manage large amounts of electricity.

A new 60-mile high-voltage line will be also built between the Waterford and Commodore substations.

MISO, on the other hand, is pursuing a range of grid reforms, including changes to its capacity accreditation rules, resource adequacy modeling, and project deployment timelines, according to the survey. A new accreditation system, Direct Loss of Load is expected by the 2028/29 planning year to better reflect each power source’s actual reliability during high-stress events.

Accreditation refers to the process MISO uses to assign a reliability value to each power resource — such as a power plant — based on how dependable that resource is during times of high electricity demand or grid stress.

To pay for their projects, Entergy Louisiana forecasts a potential $8 rate hike for residential customers over the next five years. Entergy noted that this is an incomplete estimate.

Entergy also recently proposed a suite of demand response programs with the Louisiana Public Service Commission to help reduce the pressure.

“Some items that will increase the cost of rates on one part of the bill, may in fact reduce the cost of total bills in the end,” Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance For Affordable Energy told The Center Square. “For example, if a demand response program is effective, it may reduce congestion costs related to energy markets, or it can even reduce the needed and costs for other generation investments in future. This can also be true for transmission investments.”

Demand response programs offer incentives to customers who reduce or shift their electricity use during peak periods. For residential customers, Entergy is rolling out smart thermostat and EV charging programs. For industrial and commercial users, companies like Enel X will manage large-scale power reductions.

Entergy estimates the demand-side programs could reduce consumption by 95 megawatts in year two and up to 155 megawatts by year five.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/d2/7d22ac8a-061f-4a2a-b9bb-031c00452207/6855c0b352ad3.image.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 19:06:13.540712

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill.
The Senate bill doesn’t include such a provision.
The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.","WASHINGTON (AP) — House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.

Republicans in the two chambers don’t agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.

The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.

While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.

Here’s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:

Tax break for families

The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.

The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump’s second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.

Trump campaign promises

Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.

The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.

The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that’s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.

The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.

The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.

And on Social Security, the bills don’t directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

More SALT

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That’s a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

Medicaid providers

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

“This needs a lot of work. It’s really concerning and I’m really surprised by it,” he said. “Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.”

Tax breaks for business

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Clean energy tax credits

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden’s climate law. It aimed to boost the nation’s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

Odds and ends

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn’t include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

S.C. charts early course on artificial intelligence

By Jack O’Toole and Damian Bertrand | Terrifying threats. Unprecedented opportunities. Change at the speed of a microprocessor. Across the country — and here in rural South Carolina — that’s how experts and leaders are talking about the rapid emergence of artificial intelligence, or AI.

Driving that conversation, experts say, are technological breakthroughs that have placed generative AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini, in the hands of people and businesses across the world over the past three years.

But amid sensational headlines and breathless predictions of super-intelligent machines, governments, businesses and even everyday citizens are scrambling to prepare for — something. Even experts struggle to say exactly what.

As Statehouse Report learned in a series of interviews this week, South Carolina is no exception.

An emerging state strategy: Opportunity with guardrails

At a March 24 AI event sponsored by the nonprofit S.C. Council on Competitiveness, Beaufort County Republican Rep. Jeff Bradley, chair of the House Regulations, Administrative Procedures, Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity Committee, talked up the state’s efforts to get government, business and educational institutions pulling in the same direction on AI.

“This collaborative effort marks a pivotal moment in our state’s technological advancement,” Bradley told attendees. “By leveraging our research institutions and fostering cross-sector collaboration, we can drive applied AI innovation, train and retain a competitive AI workforce, and position South Carolina as AI-ready.”

That effort produced its first tangible result in March 2024, when the S.C. Department of Administration (Admin) released its AI Strategy, which aims to promote and responsibly regulate the use of AI in the delivery of state government services.

At the time, Admin spokesperson Brooke Bailey told Statehouse Report that safety, not speed, would be the agency’s goal as it moved forward. This week, she said Admin is currently tracking 29 proposed use-cases for AI from various agencies, ranging from internal chatbots and image-recognition tools to off-the-shelf software.

“Admin reviews each use case for security, risk, potential benefit and efficiencies, and continuously collaborates and engages with agencies as they implement approved use cases,” Bailey said.

What’s more, she says, the agency has established a Center of Excellence to provide oversight and governance to state agencies using AI, with subgroups focused on risk, compliance, and procurement.

“Additionally, the agency is seeking to initiate statewide pilot programs … for ChatGPT and Microsoft Co-pilot,” she said.

Legislative initiatives: Protecting progress — and people

Lawmakers say they’ve focused early AI legislation on keeping South Carolina business- and consumer-friendly, while cracking down on predators who misuse the technology — an approach Gov. Henry McMaster has lauded.

In particular, he cited the importance of recent legislation to protect minors from AI-enabled abuse in a May social media post.

“I’ve signed two bills into law that combat the creation, possession, and distribution of AI-generated child sexual abuse material,” McMaster said. “These laws will give prosecutors the tools they need to go after predators who use technology to harm and exploit our children.”

Protecting people from AI risk will also be the top priority of the S.C. House AI Regulations subcommittee when it begins meeting next year, according to Chairman Brandon Guffey, R-York. In 2022, Guffey lost his 17-year-old son to suicide after he was victimized by an online predator’s scam.

“The last thing we want to do is stifle innovation,” Guffey said in a June 18 interview. “But we have to be quick to react [to new developments] to ensure we’re protecting people.”

That’s why he’s carefully watching proposed federal legislation that would prevent states from regulating AI for the next 10 years, he said.

“I don’t believe the federal government has any right to tell us we can’t protect our citizens,” he said. “But if the goal is to keep states from stifling a specific industry, then yeah, I would agree states should not have that right.”

Looking ahead to 2026, Guffey said he wants to begin with a bill aimed at preventing companies from exploiting people’s personal information or likeness using AI.

“One of my primary goals is to make sure that people aren’t profiting off your voice or your image just because it’s [generated by] AI,” he said.

Beyond that, he said, he’d like to see a shift in the way AI is understood and regulated.

“Ultimately, I believe if we simply started looking at technology and the tech industry as products instead of services, then a lot of this stuff could be handled through [existing] consumer protection laws,” he said.

Businesses and citizens try to understand — and prepare

While lawmakers and state experts craft policies, Palmetto State businesses and residents are already navigating AI’s real-world impacts.

Charleston attorney and digital forensics examiner Steve Abrams told Statehouse Report this week that AI is already reshaping day-to-day legal work.

“It basically does what a clerk would do,” Abrams said. “If you had a practice with a big enough system to support a law clerk, you’d send them for a couple of days to [prepare a] legal memorandum, and here the AI tool does it in about five minutes.”

But with the ongoing issue of AI “hallucinations” — put simply, made-up facts that popular chatbots sometimes invent out of whole cloth — Abrams noted that it’s not a “set it and forget it” solution. Lawyers need to carefully review every AI-generated document they intend to present.

Less excited about the technology is Jonathan Boncek, a freelance Charleston photographer who’s watching the rise of AI with concern.

“Clients might not want to spend their money to pay me, when they can just do some AI generative fill-in,” Boncek said. “While it’s not massive yet, I do understand how AI is [moving] really quickly. So I’m just trying to prepare myself for what could be next.”

To that end, Boncek said he’s become a certified rapid transformational therapist — if not directly because of AI, at least with a wary eye cast in that direction.

“I’ve moved into a space that I believe AI won’t be able to touch, which is that human interaction and mental health space,” Boncek said. “I don’t think that AI is going to be able to help with mental health.”

But regardless of whether you’re inclined to view the technology with enthusiasm or alarm, experts like College of Charleston Associate Professor of Literacy Education Ian O’Byrne advise against getting ahead of the technology — or the facts.

“I feel like we fall into this trap of hyperbole and hysteria,” he said this week. “And I think a lot of the time, people don’t even understand what AI even is.”

Every day, and at every level, South Carolinians are working to close that AI understanding gap. And maybe, in the process, dispelling just a bit of the hyperbole and hysteria.

McMaster says energy bill will keep ACs blowing

Staff reports | On a hot June day this week, Gov. Henry McMaster ceremonially signed a new energy law aimed at ramping up Palmetto State power production. In addition to regulatory changes, the law clears the way for Dominion Energy and state-owned Santee Cooper to build a 2,000-megawatt natural gas plant in rural Colleton County.

McMaster signed the bill into law more than a month ago, but Wednesday’s ceremony brought utility executives and other workers together with lawmakers to show solidarity and support between the groups.

“This is of course to celebrate a great step for South Carolina,” McMaster said at the ceremony, which lasted less than 15 minutes before most everyone went back into the air-conditioned mansion.

The law took effect immediately. Utilities now can appeal state Public Service Commission rulings directly to the S.C. Supreme Court, meaning projects or rate cases won’t be in limbo for years as they wind through the courts. They can also now ask for smaller rate increases every year instead of hitting customers with what was sometimes a double-digit increase to cover inflation and rising costs after four or five years.

Meanwhile, lawmakers recently cleared the way for private companies to take over the long-abandoned project to build two new nuclear reactors at the defunct V.C. Summer site near Jenkinsville. Ratepayers paid billions of dollars on the failed project, which was abandoned in 2017, well before it generated even a watt of power.

The bill did not get unanimous support. Some legislators from both sides of the aisle worried the state didn’t set limits on data centers and that would allow the computer farms to suck up massive amounts of the new energy and raise costs to homeowners and others while providing few local benefits. – Skyler Baldwin

Let’s not make S.C.’s child poverty worse

By Andy Brack | A recent report on child poverty in South Carolina showed the rate dropped slightly – from 20% of the state’s children in poverty in 2019 to 19% two years ago. On its face, that sounds promising.

But storm clouds are on the horizon with tight-fisted federal fiscal policies from a Trump administration that seems to want to make the rich richer at the expense of the poor and middle class.

Threatened are the very kinds of government programs that reduced child poverty from about one in three kids two decades ago to one in five now – food stamps, special tax credits for the working poor, housing subsidies and the dread of the Republican Party – Obamacare.

If federal safety net programs are cut in South Carolina – and all over the country – tougher, hungrier days are ahead for too many families. The new KidsCount report by the Annie E. Casey Foundation found 215,000 children under 18 are in poverty in the Palmetto State. The study found South Carolina ranked 38th in child well-being, a slight improvement over previous years.

“With too many children lacking health insurance and too many living in areas of concentrated poverty, children and their families are vulnerable in our state,” said Sue Williams, CEO of Children’s Trust of South Carolina, in a statement earlier this month.

During the Obama administration, there was a big statistical drop in what was considered the number of children in poverty because analysts reframed how they measured it. As highlighted in a 2015 Statehouse Report column, the feds implemented the new measure to more accurately reflect reality of the safety net – but all of this came with a caveat:

“The lower number, it seems, reflects the impact of state and federal intervention programs on the poverty rate. In other words, it shows that programs like food stamps, housing assistance, the federal Earned Income Tax Credit for working families and other social interventions are working. Without them, the true child poverty rate would be about one in three kids [in South Carolina] — approximately the same level as has been reported for years.

“‘Tax credits alone have decreased the child poverty rate by nearly one-third. Social Security, SNAP (food stamps) and housing subsidies also have contributed to significantly fewer children living in poverty,’” the report said.

What brought all of this on is that the standard, outdated Federal Poverty Level (FPL) used for years as a basis for distributing aid came under fire when conservatives complained that the nation’s 50-year battle with poverty had done little to cut the poverty rate. So in 2011, the Obama administration set out to measure the impact of assistance programs on people receiving help. This new measure, called the Supplemental Poverty Measure, found that aid programs really do make life better for people — not by giving them cell phones or microwaves, but by providing help with housing or food or credits for working.

But then as now, what all of this means is that today’s policymakers need to understand that what’s slowly working – the intervention programs – don’t need to be cut. In fact, child poverty likely would be reduced more if the state would expand Medicaid, build more affordable housing and boost nutrition programs.

The clear warning here is that if the Trump administration cuts safety net programs that impact more than 200,000 children in South Carolina, more will go hungry and live in poverty.

Fighting poverty in America isn’t easy. And to implement policies that will encourage it to expand would be fiscally and morally wrong.

Policy actions have impacts. Let’s not go down any path that cuts the safety net more. Investments in anti-poverty programs are smart over the long run, not a waste of taxpayer money like some of the talking heads claim.

If you can’t get past the notion of keeping and expanding anti-poverty programs based on your checkbook, take a look at the good book and see what it might suggest.

Remember “we the people”

To the editor:

After reading the S.C. attorney general’s “public warning” concerning June 14 No Kings protests, I was again incensed by the language. The second paragraph of his statement begins, “radical anti-American groups are organizing…”. Who does he think he is referring to peaceful protesters as anti-American.

To Andy Brack: Thank you for having the guts to call out the AG on his aggressive attempt to silence Americans, who simply want to defend the Constitution of the United States of America and all that it provides for its people, people being the key word as in the preamble [of the Constitution] – “We the people.”

This is the first time in my life I have ever publicly and formally spoken out about the state of OUR union. I have been telling my family, since January, how fortunate we have been to live in a country and not have tanks rolling through the streets of our neighborhoods. I’ve told them how great it is that we go to sleep at night with absolutely no fear of chaos or invasion.

That is no longer the peace of mind I, and they, have known our entire lives. Thank you Mr. Brack for your words, and the words of those who also understood what “We the PEOPLE” truly means. My thoughts today are not just with protesters, who can and should peacefully speak out. I also think of the co-equal branches of OUR government. I implore them, all of them, regardless of party affiliation, to stop and think about what they are really tasked to do… “Support and Defend the Constitution, against ALL enemies, foreign and domestic!

The California-based startup intends to build the factory at Greensboro’s airport, investing $4.7 billion. The planned hiring commitments from 2027 through 2036 would be the largest in North Carolina’s history, according to Gov. Josh Stein.

The company previously identified Greensboro as one of three finalists for the factory to build its fixed-wing — also known as all-wing or blended-wing — Z4 aircraft, which JetZero says will be up to 50% more fuel-efficient than traditional tube-and-wing airliners.

JetZero said it’s already raised about $300 million toward investment in the Z4 project, including a U.S. Air Force grant to build and fly a demonstrator model by 2027.

United Airlines and Alaska Airlines also are project investors and have made conditional purchase agreements for their fleets, the company said. JetZero aims for the planes to go into service in the early 2030s, with a goal of completing 20 airplanes per month at full production.

Stein, on hand with JetZero executives and other officials for the formal announcement at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, cited North Carolina’s robust aerospace industry and the first manned powered flights at Kitty Hawk by the Wright brothers in 1903.

“North Carolina is the perfect location,” Stein said. “North Carolina was first in flight. We are also the future of flight.”

The jobs would pay minimum average salaries of more than $89,000, according to the state Department of Commerce, which provided details of the project discussed earlier last Thursday by a state committee that awards economic incentives.

State and local monetary and training incentives for JetZero and the project described at the committee meeting could exceed $2.35 billion by the 2060s, provided that investment and job-creation thresholds and other requirements are met.

A portion of state incentives awarded by the committee — more than $1 billion over 37 years — is based on a percentage of income taxes withheld from plant workers’ paychecks. The incentives also include up to $785 million from Guilford County and Greensboro and up to $450 million from the General Assembly in part to help with infrastructure, officials said. The project includes a research facility for composite structures.

A commerce department official said JetZero, headquartered in Long Beach, California, looked for more than a year for a plant location, examining 25 sites in 17 states.

JetZero, currently with 225 workers, enters a jet purchasing market dominated by industry behemoths U.S.-based Boeing and European Airbus.

“We have already shown strong commercial interest and momentum to meet the real airline demand for this aircraft,” CEO Tom O’Leary said. “So this is more than just a factory. It’s a launchpad for a new chapter of American aerospace.”

While a variant of the Z4 would have tanker and transport uses in the military, JetZero has said that it would focus first on building a commercial jetliner with about 250 seats and a range of 5,000 nautical miles.

The five-year-old company says the plane’s shape will reduce drag, and the mounting of engines on the top and back of the plane will make it much quieter than traditional airliners. The Z4 would run on conventional jet fuel but could be converted to hydrogen fuel, according to JetZero.

JetZero says Z4 travelers will board through larger doors and into shorter but wider cabins, and aisles will be less congested, as bathrooms will be located far away from the galleys where meals are prepared.

“It’s going to deliver a better passenger experience than you’ve ever had before on any other plane,” O’Leary said.

Stein said the state is already home to more than 400 aerospace companies. The Piedmont Triad airport has emerged as an industry hot spot, with Honda Aircraft placing its headquarters there and Boom Supersonic building its first full-scale manufacturing plant for next-generation supersonic passenger jets.

The central location and easy access to interstates also lured Toyota to build an electric battery plant in adjoining Randolph County.

Sign up for their newsletter here.

John Belizaire says he has a secret hiding in plain sight. But before revealing it, the CEO of Soluna, a green data center development firm headquartered in Albany, New York, asks people to picture the last time they drove through a gusty stretch of countryside and saw wind turbines in the distance. But when they zoom into that frame, he asks, did they notice that not all of those turbines were spinning despite it being windy?

It’s not typically because they’re broken, Belizaire said. It’s because they’ve been turned off.

Electric grids across the country don’t always have the capacity to carry all of the energy an intermittent power plant can produce. So while at times there’s more than enough wind to produce more power, Belizaire said, there’s no place for that power to go due to aging transmission systems and a lack of local load.

That’s how we end up with stranded renewable energy—available energy going to waste because there isn’t a user for it. In an analysis of hundreds of renewable projects around the country, Soluna estimates upwards of 30 to 40 percent of renewable energy goes unused.

That’s the secret. There’s power already generated and ready to use, it’s just being curtailed, Belizaire said.

As power demand surges, largely due to data centers servicing artificial intelligence products and cryptocurrency, interested developers, power plant operators and environmentalists are trying to sort out how to use the full capabilities of existing renewable power plants. These decisions are playing out as more data center developers supply their own gas plants to secure onsite power and bypass lengthy wait times to connect to the grid.

More than a third of data centers are expected to adopt onsite power generation by 2030, according to a new survey of data center operators, utility companies, and service providers from Bloom Energy, a fuel cell technology company. By 2035, that figure climbs to nearly half.

Data center developers want to have control over their timelines and have immediate access to power, said Aman Joshi, Bloom Energy’s chief commercial officer. The firm’s survey found there’s a one-to-two-year gap between when developers expect grid power and when utilities can realistically deliver it.

“Decisions around where data centers get built have shifted dramatically over the last six months, with access to power now playing the most significant role in location scouting,” Joshi said. “The grid can’t keep pace with AI demands, so the industry is taking control with onsite power generation.”

Soluna, like other data center developers looking to rely on renewable energy, buys the excess power from wind, hydro, and solar plants that they can’t sell to the grid. By the end of the year, Soluna will have three facilities totaling 123 megawatts of capacity in Kentucky and Texas and seven projects in the works with upwards of 800 total megawatts.

Belizaire and I talked about how in Texas, where I report from, there’s plenty of curtailed energy from wind and solar farms because of the region’s transmission capacity. In West Texas, other data center developers are also taking advantage of the unused wind energy, far from major load centers like Dallas and Houston, by co-locating their giant warehouses full of advanced computers and high-powered cooling systems with the excess energy.

One data center developer using curtailed renewable power in Texas is IREN. The firm owns and operates facilities optimized for Bitcoin mining and AI. It developed a 7.5-gigawatt facility in Childress and broke ground on a 1.4-gigawatt data center in Sweetwater.

IREN purchases power through the state grid’s wholesale market during periods of oversupply, said Kent Draper, the company’s chief commercial officer, and reduces its consumption when prices are high. It’s able to do that by turning off its computers and minimizing power demand from its data centers.

But curtailment is an issue all over the world, Belizaire said, from Oklahoma, North Dakota, South Dakota, California, and Arizona in the US, to Northern Ireland, Germany, Portugal, and Australia.

“Anywhere where you have large utility-scale renewable development that’s been built out, you’re going to find it,” Belizaire said.

In a March analysis, the US Energy Information Administration reported that solar and wind power curtailments are increasing in California. In 2024, the grid operator for most of California curtailed 3.4 million megawatt hours of utility-scale wind and solar output, a 29 percent increase from the amount of electricity curtailed in 2023.

A Soluna report, using data from regional transmission organizations and independent system operators, estimated that at the end of 2021 there were 14.9 terawatt hours of wind and solar generation curtailed, or the equivalent of $610 million in lost revenue. The renewable electricity wasted in 2021 was enough to power 1.3 million households for a year, the report found.

So how does Soluna go about using curtailed energy?

The firm co-locates its data centers at a renewable energy plant and signs a power purchase agreement with the plant for a portion of its capacity. That way, the power producer can still satisfy its other obligations, like to the grid. The contracts used to be for around five years, but now they average about 10.

Soluna’s behind-the-meter strategy allows the company to source power in three ways. Its officials can buy it directly from the source at a low fixed price. It’s a cheap rate as that power would have been otherwise wasted. Or Soluna can use subtractive energy, paying for electrons directly from the wind farm that would have been sold to the grid. As a last resort, they can buy power directly from the grid. (It’s a less ideal option because depending on the makeup of the grid, it’s a mix of renewable and fossil fuel sources.)

This distributed generation approach has allowed Soluna to score some of the lowest prices for power this kind of data center has seen, Belizaire said, and source upwards of 75 percent of its energy from green sources.

Because of the intermittent nature of renewables, grids are grappling with how to maintain stability and reliability as they become more reliant on variable energy sources. Battery storage technology has made meaningful contributions but is still working to scale and upgrading transmission lines infamously takes a long time.

Soluna sees its flexible load data centers as a solution. The data centers can ramp down their computing when the grid needs more energy and ramp up when there’s excess energy to take.

“We’ve become almost like a battery,” Belizaire said. “I like to say computing is a better battery than battery systems.”",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2203288771-2560x1440.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 14:05:46.487987

The North Carolina legislature has retreated from its aggressive targets to reduced hydrocarbon-fueled electricity in the state, eliminating the goal of being 70% carbon free by 2030. Strong Republican majorities in both chambers supported Senate Bill 266 last week, but so did some Democratic legislators.

That smattering of Democratic support could weigh on Democratic Governor Josh Stein as he considers a veto. The final version of the bill leaves in place the ultimate target of the full elimination of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, and there are other important regulatory changes in the bill, touted by supporters as the Power Bill Reduction Act.

This follows a decision in Maryland, approved by its Democratic governor, to authorize additional use of natural gas for generation in that state. There are glimmers of energy sanity in both Virginia’s northern and southern neighbors. Virginia retains its laws mandating expensive wind and solar energy buildouts and prohibiting new natural gas. The weather in the next two weeks is going to prove again that reliable hydrocarbon plants keep the air conditioning running, not solar.

North Carolina’s legislature passed the emissions reduction targets in 2021, one year after the Virginia General Assembly placed similar mandates in the Virginia Code. The North Carolina target for 2030 of 70% is far more aggressive than those for that year in the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA).

An Associated Press report on the North Carolina bill indicated North Carolina and Virginia are the only two southern states among the 18 states with laws mandating electricity emission reductions targets or deadlines.

Under VCEA, Virginia’s major utility, Dominion Energy Virginia, must reach a carbon free target of 49% by 2032, with the smaller Appalachian Power’s targets on a slower timeline. In Dominion’s case, its nuclear reactors count as non-carbon sources, so the 49% target is just for the other forms of generation, coming from non-nuclear sources.

The Virginia non-CO2 target rises higher year by year. Failure to meet the goals internally carries financial costs to the utility, which are simply passed on to its customers. The North Carolina law has only the 2030 and 2050 targets.

Even before this recent action by its legislature, North Carolina’s carbon emission regulations did not include a prohibition on building new natural gas generation, and the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) had approved additional natural gas assets in its most recent integrated resource plan. But advocates for removing the 2030 target argued it was creating a major constraint on the choices available to North Carolina’s power provider. Reliability and low cost were being sacrificed, even though its law makes them the paramount considerations.

Dominion, on the other hand, is having to battle to get permission to plan any new natural gas generation, both in its pending integrated resource plan and in an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for a gas-powered Chesterfield facility. To get permission for new gas use the utility must prove that energy reliability is threatened and gas is the only choice to maintain it. Other hurdles are created by the VCEA, which is hostile to all hydrocarbon fuels.

The free-market John Locke Foundation in North Carolina was a major proponent of the legislation now pending with its governor. It argued that the looming 70% target was forcing the utilities and the utilities commission to make more expensive choices, adding billions to ultimate consumer costs. It backed that up by paying for its own generation model, less expensive to consumers but also not constrained by the 70% 2030 target, which it presented to NCUC and to the legislature.

“When the General Assembly passed the Carbon Plan law (House Bill 951) in 2021, we warned that it could work only by strict adherence to the law’s least cost and reliable guardrails,” wrote Jon Sanders of the Locke Foundation. “Early Carbon Plan orders have strayed far from affordable and reliable resources, and it turns out the modeling was aimed at reaching the plan’s interim goal of 70 percent reduction in CO2 emissions regardless of affordability and reliability.”

The Locke Foundation’s alternative, however, also eliminated coal and natural gas by 2050 and replaced them with nuclear plants. The legislation just passed also makes is easier for the utility to finance future nuclear plants by charging consumers for them during construction, something already allowed in Virginia.

In Virginia, the integrated resource plan presented by the Dominion did not really include a low cost, “what if we just ignored carbon targets” alternative. But as was pointed out by critics, its generation models also ignored the hard target of 2045 set by the VCEA for the elimination of all hydrocarbon plants. Dominion set only a 15-year time window on its models and cost estimates and offered no outline for how it would transition five years later. The integrated resource plan case before the State Corporation Commission appears to completed, and simply awaiting a final decision.",,N,,2025-06-21 18:08:33.887317

The Senate’s draft represents a substantial cut to the existing climate-friendly energy tax credits, but some Republicans are pursuing a less aggressive rollback than their House counterparts, according to a report from The Hill.

Several GOP senators who oppose a full repeal argue that even the Senate’s scaled-back proposal goes too far in dismantling the clean energy tax credits established under the Biden Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. (RELATED: Green Energy Think Tank Reportedly Cuts Staff After DOE Grant Cancellations)

Republican Senators who have voiced concerns or pushed back against a “full-scale” repeal of energy tax credits include Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, Utah Sen. John Curtis and West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito.

Republican West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, whose state hosts one of the “hydrogen hubs” created under the Biden administration, expressed concern over the bill’s deadline requiring projects to begin construction by the end of the year to qualify for tax credits.

Capito said she’s working to delay that deadline, calling it “a pretty tight timeline,” and adding, “I’m trying to get the date pushed back. I don’t know if I’ll be successful,” according to another report from The Hill.

She has also received $49,200 in campaign contributions from Williams, a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based energy company with significant investments in hydrogen infrastructure during the 2024 election cycle, according to OpenSecrets data.

Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford likewise received $54,500 in contributions from Williams during the same time period.

Capito also took $45,325 during the 2024 election cycle from First Energy, an electric utility that has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

A group of four Republicans — Sens. Murkowski, Curtis, Moran and Tillis — have jointly cautioned against a “full-scale” repeal of the energy tax credits enacted by Democrats in 2022.

In their message, they called for each credit to be assessed based on its potential to boost U.S. manufacturing, lower utility costs — particularly in rural communities — and provide stability for businesses that have already made investments under the current framework.

“The United States produces some of the cleanest and most efficient energy in the world, and an all-of-the-above approach — including support for traditional and renewable energy sources — has long been a hallmark of our energy strategy,” the senators wrote.

“To that end, many American companies have made substantial investments in domestic energy production and infrastructure based on the current energy tax framework. A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,” their letter read.

Tillis, has advocated for a “targeted, pragmatic approach” to the energy tax credits, rather than supporting a full repeal.

He also received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions during the 2022 and 2024 election cycles — both individually and through political action committees — from major financial institutions including Blackstone Group, Apollo Global Management, Truist Financial and Goldman Sachs, according to OpenSecrets (OS).

The firms have collectively invested millions of dollars in clean energy initiatives and companies in recent years.

Collins received tens of thousands of dollars in contributions during the 2022 and 2024 cycles from Blackstone, Goldman and Nextra Energy, which reports to have 55% of its portfolio invested in renewable energy.

Capito also received tens of thousands of dollars from Blackstone during the 2022 and 2024 election cycles.

OpenSecrets also shows Murkowski received tens of thousands of dollars through PACs or individually over the same two cycles from companies like ConocoPhillips, a company dedicated to be the first in the U.S. oil and gas company to set a goal of reaching net-zero operational emissions.

This follows Capital Group Companies‘ announcement in March that it was committing $30.57 million to fossil fuel investments, including a stake in ConocoPhillips.

Curtis has likewise received $59,700 in contributions during the 2024 election cycle from Sunrun, which markets itself as “the #1 home solar and battery company in America.”

“I think that Senator Crapo did a really good job, but there’s more work to be done,” Curtis told The Hill when asked about the big beautiful bill, referring to the Idaho Republican who chairs the Senate Finance Committee. Curtis offered no further details.

Moran adjacently received $38,500 in campaign contributions during the 2024 election cycle from Kit Bond Strategies Group, according to OpenSecrets records.

The firm actively lobbied on behalf of multiple renewable energy companies throughout that time. (RELATED: ROBERT WALKER: GOP Should Rethink Cutting Energy Tax Credits)

Many low-income countries are open to exploiting their natural resources to develop their renewable energy capacity, through wind and solar, and other energy projects. However, establishing new energy sectors and transitioning away from a reliance on fossil fuels will require significant financing, and many countries simply do not have the funds to invest in green energy. Now, the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) may offer the financial plan needed to help expand the global renewable energy capacity.

In 2024, the UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD) established a new collective quantified goal, or NCQG, of at least $300 billion annually for developing countries' climate action by 2035 and the aim of working toward mobilising $1.3 trillion in international climate finance over the same timeframe. The funding includes bilateral finance (country to country), multilateral finance (from multilateral development banks (MDBs) and multilateral climate funds), and private finance mobilised by public funds. However, achieving this level of financing is no easy feat, as many high-income countries fail to live up to their climate pledges.

At COP29, MDBs pledged to provide $120 billion in climate finance to low- and middle-income countries by 2030, around double the amount they contributed in 2022. “Nearly half of the climate finance flowing from developed countries to emerging economies comes from the system of multilateral development banks (MDBs), where developed countries are typically the main shareholders,” said Avinash Persaud, a special adviser on climate change to the president of IADB. However, pushing this financing even higher will be difficult and may require innovative approaches to climate funding.

Persaud has developed a plan aimed at spurring billions of dollars of investment in the green economy of low-income countries worldwide, which is supported by the IADB. The plan may even be able to provide the bulk of the $1.3 trillion in annual climate investment. “This could be an engine for green growth, and produce the trillions needed for climate finance in the future… It could be a transformation,” Persaud stated.

This week, Persaud will present his plan at a UN meeting in Germany that focuses on the November COP30 climate summit to be held in Brazil. He plans to buy up loans for renewable energy projects in the developing world to allow for billions of dollars in private investment to flood into the sector, thereby increasing global climate finance. This would require getting taxpayer-funded development banks to buy existing loans for green energy projects in low-income countries to free up investment from private sector lenders.

The loans are viewed as relatively low risk as they are already performing. However, many private sector investors are prohibited from getting involved in these types of financial agreements, as they are in developing countries, many of which have credit ratings that are too low to meet loan requirements. However, if those loans were to be backed by a development bank, which was willing to provide a guarantee against default, the “repackaged” loan finance could meet private sector criteria.

“The lightbulb moment was realising there was $50 billion in performing green loans in Latin America,” said Persaud. “Why not buy that to enable new projects to be created?” he added.

To be eligible for the loan payment, the originators of the renewable energy projects would need to agree to use the funding to finance new green energy projects. This would allow developers with experience in establishing renewable energy projects to expand their portfolios by investing in new projects, which may attract further private sector investment.

The IADB aims to launch the initiative immediately and send request proposals over the coming months, ahead of COP30. The initial loan portfolio is expected to be between $500 million and $1 billion. The initiative is already gaining traction, as experts in climate financing see the potential in the scheme.

Mattia Romani, a senior partner at the COP30 climate finance consultancy Systemiq, stated, “It is a very powerful initiative, both pragmatic and innovative. Given the constraints we will inevitably face in the coming years, securitisation is one of the few realistic tools to reach [the required financing]. Romani added, “This initiative is designed to unlock institutional capital by leveraging the balance sheets of domestic commercial banks – securitising their loans so that they can meet the fiduciary needs of institutional investors, and turning them into engines for transition finance. What’s new is the direct engagement with local banks – we are starting with a pilot in Latin America.”

Innovative approaches to climate funding could help increase financing for green energy projects across developing countries and tackle some of the institutional hurdles to climate funding. As several high-income countries fall short on their climate pledges, including promises of funding for green energy projects in low-income countries, the repackaging of loan finance could allow private investors to increase their investment in the energy transition.

By Liam Denning / Bloomberg Opinion

Under attack from US President Donald Trump, the cause of greening the US’ power grid now relies to a large degree on some of his most recent converts in Silicon Valley. This has nothing to do with politics; rather wealth, scale and urgent need are working together to advance renewable energy and nuclear power, albeit in different ways.

The Trump tax bill working its way through the US Congress is a huge blow to renewables. Republicans in the US Senate were expected to dilute the zealous anti-greenery in the US House of Representative’s version of the bill, but the latest language out of the Senate Finance Committee is only a little less harsh.

Tax credits supporting wind and solar projects will phase down to zero by the end of 2027. That might pull forward some projects, but it will ultimately bump renewable energy costs up considerably.

For example, removing the investment tax credit raises a typical solar project’s electricity price by about 40 percent, according to Lazard Inc.

Together with regulatory efforts to boost the fortunes of coal and gas-fired electricity, this would ultimately suppress appetite for new renewables projects.

By how much depends on whether pricing is the overriding factor at play. When it comes to Big Tech, it is not. What is more, Big Tech is pretty much the ball game for new renewables projects.

Just four so-called “hyperscalers” — Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Meta Platforms Inc and Microsoft Corp — dominate the corporate power purchase agreements (PPA) signed with wind and solar projects in the past half decade, putting in place multi-year contracts to buy their output and thereby providing them with the certainty required to secure financing.

Overall, PPAs for 98 gigawatts of US wind and solar capacity have been signed in that time, according to Bloomberg NEF, a figure equivalent to 74 percent of the new capacity that began operating.

The growing power needs of data centers developing artificial intelligence (AI) tools is well established, even if the ultimate level of those needs is debatable. For the hyperscalers, renewable energy has two attractions: The projects are relatively quick to build and they help with decarbonization pledges. Data centers, nearly always on, clearly are not running anything like 100 percent on intermittent renewable energy, even with batteries in the mix. So, natural gas plants, old and new, also benefit from the AI race, which, in turn, supports more renewable PPAs being signed to offset the emissions from fossil-fuel sources.

Such contracts are also relatively cheap after years of underlying price declines for clean technologies and, of course, federal tax credits.

Corporate PPAs signed in the second half of last year undercut average electricity futures by at least 10 percent, according to estimates from Bloomberg NEF.

Removal of the credits, alongside trade frictions, would upend that, meaning gas will likely account for a larger share of new electricity generation through the second half of this decade than it might have otherwise, although prices and wait times for new gas turbines have also increased significantly.

Yet price might not be the decisive factor for the decisive customer segment.

The four big hyperscalers spent an average 1.6 percent of their revenue on electricity bills last year, analysts at UBS Group AG estimated.

Losing the tax credits would bump that up by an average of just 19 basis points, according to the estimates.

Provided Big Tech does not abandon its ambitions in AI or decarbonization altogether, that rounding error offers some potential insurance for renewables developers.

Of course, a sector built on subsidies will still take a hit if those subsidies are rapidly withdrawn. We saw, analogously, how a jump in interest rates chilled offshore wind power in recent years. Demand for new projects will suffer and, as with any fragmented industry faced with an oligopsony and suddenly souring economics, the field of US renewable energy is poised for potentially brutal consolidation.

The top 10 project developers accounted for only 37 percent of US wind and solar capacity that secured financing or began construction last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg NEF.

A stronger, more concentrated sector should emerge somewhere down the line.

The other, longer-term bet for a decarbonized grid concerns nuclear power. This gets a relative pass from Republicans, with the latest Senate language improving on the House tax bill by preserving production tax credits for nuclear plants, provided they are not using fuel from the likes of Russia.

Trump has also signaled support through executive orders and is reportedly planning to reorient the US Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office toward financing new reactor technologies.

Even so, Big Tech’s role is crucial, perhaps decisive. Hyperscalers clearly value the large quantities of dispatchable, carbon-free power that reactors provide. Thus far, though, this has meant contracting with existing nuclear plants or reviving the relative handful of recently closed ones. There is a good reason for this: Building new reactors is costly, risky and often takes a decade or more. The last reactors built in the US were a case study in busted budgets and schedules, leaving utilities reluctant to plunge into a new round.

Federal support helps defray some of the costs and risks involved, but what is really needed are customers with a thirst for emissions-free power that is matched only by the depth of their pockets. Big Tech is the obvious candidate. PPAs signed with nuclear plants at above-market rates by the likes of Amazon and Microsoft demonstrate a willingness to pay up for decarbonized power, which is also an encouraging sign for renewables facing the loss of tax credits.

In addition, several hyperscalers have taken preliminary steps to encourage development of new technologies, such as small modular reactors, but these remain far from committing to the sort of long-term PPA that a nuclear start-up could take to the bank. That would be the difference between talking about new nuclear plants and actually getting them built.

As with renewable power’s resilience, therefore, the prospects for a nuclear revival rest largely with the tech bros. Not the most comforting message in these times, perhaps, but far more hopeful than anything likely to emerge from Capitol Hill.",https://www.taipeitimes.com/assets/images/TaipeiTimesLogo-1200X1200px_new.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 14:05:51.072393

Water provider Veolia is removing toxic PFAS chemicals from drinking water for more than 100,000 New Castle County residents — meeting federal regulations four years before a compliance deadline.

The investor-owned utility unveiled a $35 million treatment facility in Stanton this week, where the so-called “forever chemicals” were previously detected at high levels.

The PFAS treatment facility, which is the size of a regulation hockey rink and boasts 21 towering filters that can treat 30 million gallons of water per day, is Veolia’s largest in the U.S.

“Today starts that new chapter of ensuring that we are providing the highest quality water to the communities that we serve, and I think our customers can rest assured that we’ll be there for generations to come with this new facility,” said Larry Finnicum, regional president of mid- Atlantic operations for Veolia North America.

PFAS — widely used in consumer products such as nonstick cookware and waterproof clothing, as well as in firefighting foam — have been linked to serious health problems, including some cancers, thyroid disease, developmental delays in children and other health conditions.

The health risks associated with PFAS, which can stay in the human bloodstream for years, have sparked numerous lawsuits against chemical manufacturers, such as DuPont and 3M.

About a third of Veolia’s water supply is sourced from the Red Clay Creek, which environmental regulators say is contaminated with high levels of “forever chemicals.” The area is home to chemical companies, but the source of contamination in the creek has not been determined.

PFAS at Veolia’s Stanton plant were previously detected at levels as high as 29 parts per trillion on average, according to the company’s 2024 water quality report. Veolia said it’s partnering with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control to determine the source of contamination at its intakes.

The plant is now reducing PFAS to non-detectable levels by utilizing granular activated carbon, which is the current mainstay for PFAS removal. The technology essentially works by acting like a magnet. Chemicals become attached to the carbon, as the water continues to flow through the system, free of PFAS.

The upgraded facility also includes an on-site pilot system, meaning the company can test different technologies to determine the best means for treating the chemicals.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implemented regulations last year requiring water providers to test and treat “forever chemicals” to almost zero by 2029. The agency pivoted last month, proposing to rollback some PFAS restrictions and extend the compliance deadline to 2031.

The proposed changes come after water providers sued the EPA last year, arguing the treatments required to meet the regulations are too costly, and would hit the pockets of ratepayers. While former President Joe Biden set aside billions of dollars to address PFAS, water providers say more resources are needed.

Veolia will attempt to recoup the cost of the new filtration system by raising water bills. The company has asked the Delaware Public Service Commission for a 44% rate increase. If approved, the average monthly bill would increase by about $19 a month. Ratepayers currently pay about $40 a month.

Veolia would not say whether the company is pursuing legal action to help recover the cost of filtering PFAS, as other water providers have done.

Gov. Matt Meyer said public health must remain a top priority. During a ribbon cutting ceremony this week, the governor said Veolia’s new treatment facility is critical for households that can’t afford to install costly filtration systems on their homes.

“With this project, we’ll be able to provide cleaner drinking water to thousands of Delawareans who have been historically underserved,” he said.

From expediting the licensing process for nuclear reactors to examining the potential for nuclear fuel recycling, Trump addressed a range of issues that had hindered the industry's growth for years.

With enthusiasm for the nuclear energy industry surging through Washington, many are eager to find stocks that can benefit from the industry's apparent renaissance. For these investors, NuScale Power (SMR -4.92%), Constellation Energy (CEG -0.49%), and Cameco (CCJ -2.01%) look like smart choices to power their portfolios.

NuScale Power has a large advantage with its small modular reactors

Long gone are the days of massive nuclear power plants that require enormous capital investments and take years to construct. Nowadays, companies like NuScale Power are developing small modular reactors (SMRs) that offer a variety of advantages over conventional nuclear power plants.

For one, SMRs require considerably smaller footprints, making them more attractive to project developers, which can scale these reactors to their individual site's needs. And SMRs have improved safety profiles including the ability to shut down and self-cool indefinitely, unlike traditional nuclear power plants. Among other advantages, NuScale's SMRs are built in a factory, which helps to keep costs down and expedite project development.

With $491 million in cash and no debt, the company is on strong financial footing, an appealing situation for those looking to balance a quality growth stock that's not rife with risk. To state its competitive advantage over other SMR providers, NuScale Power says that it's the only near-term deployable SMR company with design approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Shoot for the stars with utility powerhouse Constellation Energy

While Constellation Energy's portfolio includes about 10 gigawatts (GWs) of natural gas, oil, hydroelectric, wind, and solar generation assets, it's nuclear energy that represents the lion's share of its generating capacity -- about 21 GWs, or enough power to meet the demands of 16 million homes.

The company's nuclear assets caught the attention of Microsoft in 2024, and the two inked a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) that will see the tech company purchase power in support of its data centers, generated from the restart of operations at the Three Mile Island plant, now dubbed the Crane Clean Energy Center.

More recently, Meta Platforms showed its enthusiasm for nuclear energy as a power source for its growing AI-related operations. Earlier this month, Meta and Constellation signed a 20-year PPA for nuclear energy that will be generated at the Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois.

The deals that Constellation inked with Microsoft and Meta are merely two small examples of the vast investments that AI companies are making to support their data centers. And it wouldn't be all that surprising if Constellation Energy announces similar deals with AI leaders that recognize the allure of nuclear energy as a route to meeting the steep power demands that AI computing requires.

Fuel your portfolio with uranium producer Cameo

Interest in developing new nuclear power plants is great, but it means little if there's no uranium to fuel said power plants. That's where Cameco comes in. The company is the largest uranium producer based on market capitalization found on American stock exchanges.

Operating throughout the nuclear fuel value chain, Cameco is involved in exploratory activities as well as uranium refining and fuel manufacturing services.

And with one of President Trump's executive orders stating specifically that ""It is the policy of the United States to expedite and promote to the fullest possible extent the production and operation of nuclear energy..."" Cameco clearly stands to benefit as the pathway for developing uranium assets, and other potential regulatory hurdles may be less burdensome now.

In 2024, Cameco reported uranium production of 23.4 million pounds, and it has ample resources to ensure production for years to come. As of the end of 2024, for example, the company reported 457 million pounds of proven and probable reserves.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/821063/businesswoman-in-front-of-coolling-tower-at-nuclear-power-plant.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 15:04:19.151618

“These data centers need power — we’re talking about a very significant amount of power, 500 megawatts of power, that these (centers) consume,” he said.
When it’s finished, it looks like right now it (would work for) some sort of a data center development project.
“(But) our board will do anything possible to bring in new opportunities to our county,” Commissioner Tony Morelli said.
ETEM is asking us to go through the process which (involves) commissioners designating it as a priority investment area.","STEUBENVILLE — The current owners of the old Sammis plant property are hoping to bring a data center to Jefferson County — but to make it happen, they need a declaration that it is one of Ohio’s priority investment areas.

House Bill 15, which takes effect in mid-August, authorizes local governments — in this case, the Jefferson County commissioners — to pass resolutions asking the Ohio Director of Development to designate sites in their jurisdictions as priority investment areas. That designation brings with it accelerated permit reviews, brownfield funding for site preparation and development costs plus a utility tax exemption.

Brownfield sites and former coal mines are eligible for the designation.

The Sammis site, acquired by Houston-based Energy Transition and Environmental Management in 2023, is in the demolition and remediation stage, with the structure above state Route 7 in Stratton slated to go in the first quarter 2026.

“We’ve knocked down most of the buildings, and we expect to finish that project in the first quarter of 2027,” Dan McDevitt, co-founder and general counsel, told the Jefferson County commissioners Wednesday. “We’re now starting to think about what happens next at that site.”

Initially, McDevitt said they figured “some kind of industrial development,” perhaps a multi-modal transportation, would be a good site fit, “but the world has changed. What didn’t exist a year ago are these massive data centers … think of them as server farms, thousands and thousands of computers running artificial intelligence algorithms or serving cloud storage functions.”

McDevitt said the property has an on-site switching station and substation, so power can be imported or exported.” There’s water and rail access as well as a large loading and unloading area.

“These data centers need power — we’re talking about a very significant amount of power, 500 megawatts of power, that these (centers) consume,” he said. “We’re not data center developers — our business is buying these difficult properties, we take on all the risks and responsibilities (to clean them up) and then we find someone else to do the forecast. When it’s finished, it looks like right now it (would work for) some sort of a data center development project. And the way they typically work these things is, we would sell it to a developer, they would build out the campus and then they lease it, lease the services from the server farms, to like a Google or an Amazon or something like that.”

McDevitt told commissioners if it happens that way it would be “a significant investment. You’re looking at billions of dollars in investment, jobs during construction … I think we tossed out a number of, say, 1,000 jobs while the thing’s being built, there’d be a couple, three years of construction time then maybe a couple hundred permanent jobs, (with) follow on employment that comes from that.”

McDevitt figures that priority investment designation is critical, saying HB 15 “is basically a reworking of Ohio’s energy policy. The bill was built around the theory of trying to encourage the redevelopment of power in the state.”

“There’s a very specific tax benefit. It’s not a property tax on a real estate tax payment, but it’s a relief from what we call the ‘utility’ tax and a particular part of it — the part of the tax that’s relevant here is building out the infrastructure to either deliver power or natural gas to the site. And one of our plans at this site is to build a natural gas pipeline to come into the site, bring fuel, CCGT (combined cycle gas turbine) or other gas-fired generation, to either sell into the grid, to resell just as a power play or else to power up the data centers. They need power, they’re power hogs.”

McDevitt said the priority investment area designation “will make this site incrementally more attractive than a site that (doesn’t have it).”

“I think it’s a good thing for the county — we’re optimistic about securing a data center development here at the site,” McDevitt said.

Commissioners say they’re intrigued, but said they need to “run it by the prosecutor’s office” first.

“(But) our board will do anything possible to bring in new opportunities to our county,” Commissioner Tony Morelli said. “HB 15 gives renewable energy companies tax relief if the property was used for specific industry, brownfields, abandoned coal or energy companies. The Sammis plant checks the boxes. ETEM is asking us to go through the process which (involves) commissioners designating it as a priority investment area. Once that is completed the site would be marketed for energy development (so they can) use the specific tools the bill was written for.”

Morelli said AI — artificial intelligence — “is one business that needs extreme amounts of energy.”

“Designating this property (as a priority investment area) will open up opportunities to be in the game, right here in our county,” Morelli said.

Commissioner Jake Kleineke said the Sammis site “probably would be a good place for an alternative power source, I think it would be a great opportunity to spark interest in other technology companies to come to our region.

“I see it as a great opportunity for the county to grow,” he said. “I just think it’s a good opportunity for the county to experience some growth versus it just sitting stagnant, growing grass.”

He said similar developments have brought “gigantic growth” already along the Interstate 270 corridor in Franklin County.

“It’s created a lot of opportunity, jobs for people who would like to relocate here,” he said. “And there’s construction benefits as well — we still have vibrant trades here … electrical unions, pipefitters, carpenters, etc., that could benefit from this type of growth.”

Kleineke said they have to be forward-thinking.

“I don’t see a downside to it, honestly,” Kleineke said. “We’re not going to bring coal-fired plants back, we’ve got to do something with that property. I would like to see something more diverse than a server farm. I’d like to see alternative-fueled power generation. Those server farms take up a lot of power to run, but they’ll also put a strain locally on our power grid. These things are happening all over the state of Ohio and consuming more power than we’re making. With the abundance of gas we have here, I would love to see a gas-fired power plant there, and maybe in addition to the dam that’s already there … hydroelectric power generation.",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.heraldstaronline.com/images/2016/08/19083717/fbLIKE.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 13:08:48.409817

Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the opinion for the 7-2 majority, with Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissenting.

""The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,"" Kavanaugh wrote.

While the federal government typically sets vehicle emission standards, the Environmental Protection Agency has occasionally granted California a waiver to impose stricter standards due to its persistent air-quality issues.

Automakers have often adhered to these tighter controls even for vehicles sold outside California.

The waiver was contested by Diamond Alternative Energy, a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation, along with other companies and groups representing fuel manufacturers.

Although the fuel producers challenged the waiver itself, the Supreme Court declined to review that question, denying an appeal in December that raised the issue.

The justices focused solely on whether the companies and trade associations had standing to sue.

A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., had previously ruled that market forces, rather than California's regulations, were driving the national shift toward electric vehicles.

The court determined that the fuel makers could not proceed with the case.

The argument on both sides of the debate posed skepticism was whether consumers' demand alone was driving the shift to electric vehicles.

The EPA reduction of fossil fuel reliance was a part of the waivers justification.

Justice Jackson, in her dissent, questioned the timing of the court's decision, given the likelihood of Trump withdrawing the waiver if he returns to office.

""President Trump rescinded this exact same waiver the last time he was in office,"" Jackson wrote. ""Because a withdrawal of the waiver would moot this case, an obvious question arises: Why would this court rush to opine on whether the fuel industry’s legal challenge can proceed when all involved – including petitioners themselves – believe that any such 'case' or 'controversy' will soon vanish?""

California Attorney General Rob Bonta expressed disappointment with the decision but vowed to continue the fight.

He said, ""Congress intended for California to be able to regulate emissions from new vehicles sold in our state, and we remain firmly committed to advancing and implementing strong standards that safeguard public health and reduce climate pollution.""

A bill moving through Congress may put these financial incentives in jeopardy.

""It's going to increase demand for things like gas and coal, and that's going to increase energy costs. It's also going to make it more expensive for people who want to put solar panels on their roof,"" Zach Schalk, the Indiana program director for Sun Action, said.

Schalk is referring to a spending and tax cut bill making its way through Congress that could eliminate the Residential Clean Energy Credit as a measure to reduce federal spending.

""Right now, the 25D residential solar tax credit is at 30% and will stay at 30% until at least 2032. This bill will end the tax credit much easier,"" Schalk said.

Without that credit, homeowners who have already added solar panels to their properties say it would be too expensive for others to make the same decision.

""Since we got it, the savings are amazing, and we were able because I'm getting that 30% back of what you pay,"" Anne Mills, a Greensburg solar homeowner, said.

Homeowners aren't the only ones impacted by the proposed changes. The bill would also eliminate the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, which businesses and nonprofits are eligible to use.

The study, led by founder Vrushabhraj Tanawade, introduces a bio-integrated insulation method using thermophilic and mesophilic microbial consortia to regulate heat inside battery modules. The results are striking: up to a 22% reduction in internal temperature and a 30% improvement in carbon lifecycle efficiency.

“This innovation is about biology meeting infrastructure,” says Tanawade. “We’ve discovered how nature’s mechanisms can dramatically extend the life of our clean energy systems.”

Unlike conventional synthetic cooling solutions, MountBay’s microbial approach is circular, biodegradable, and scalable—opening up new frontiers for climate resilience and fire-risk reduction in hot environments.

The research aligns perfectly with MountBay’s mission to power the AI economy through clean, sustainable, and advanced infrastructure. It also positions the company as a frontrunner in biological material integration across the energy sector.

Additionally, MountBay has released a preliminary transformative feasibility report for a Lunar Solar Belt—a continuous solar array on the Moon that can beam uninterrupted, clean energy back to Earth.

The report outlines how in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), autonomous lunar robotics, and microwave power transmission could enable the construction of a moon-based solar plant by the 2030s. With an energy return on investment (EROI) of 8:1, the system offers a scalable, emission-free solution to humanity’s growing power demands.

“This is not just an energy project—it’s a civilization-scale investment in global stability,” said Tanawade. “We believe the Moon should be a cooperative utility, not a geopolitical race.”

MountBay is also proposing a new diplomatic framework—The Earth-Moon Energy Accord (EMEA)—to ensure equitable access, safety, and international cooperation.

The concept directly supports MountBay’s mission: to push the frontiers of clean power while securing energy independence for AI-driven economies.

Tanawade is rallying governments, institutions, and innovators to join him. “It’s time for America to lead the most ambitious energy project in human history,” he said.

Then Trump stepped in.,"Tracy Ross, Tamara Chuang, Tracy Ross Rural",,,,,https://coloradosun.com/2025/06/21/rocky-ford-environment-grant-trump/,"The site in question spans city blocks in Rocky Ford, a town in need of a facelift.
On May 2, Rocky Ford learned its grant was included in the slashing.
But without funding from the federal government, Rocky Ford isn’t getting so much as an assessment of the environmental and health issues the building damage brings as well as the economic impacts.
That means the eyesore stays, the asbestos particles float and the sorely needed facelift for the commercial district and north side of Rocky Ford won’t likely happen in the near future.
Despite it all, Rocky Ford tries to remain hopeful.","The site in question spans city blocks in Rocky Ford, a town in need of a facelift.

The city council and Mayor Duane Gurulé knew this, which is why they sent a letter to U.S. Sens. John Hickenlooper and Michael Bennet and U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd on April 22, following a wave of executive orders from President Donald Trump.

Rocky Ford, in Otero County, was a finalist for a $166,000 grant from the Environmental Protection Agency’s Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program to assess and clean up asbestos-laden buildings in the city that had been damaged by fires. The grant was in danger due to funding freezes, they wrote in the letter.

If they received the money administered through the Mountains and Plains Environmental Grants Hub, it would start planning of the much-needed cleanup and begin the revitalization of 20-plus acres of land for essential commercial space and housing, they added.

That fit perfectly with the goal of the program, which was to fund solutions to serious environmental challenges in underserved communities, including clean drinking water, food access and climate readiness. The program fell under the Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act Environmental and Climate Justice Program, through which Congress had appropriated $2.8 billion for community groups to provide block grants to address pollution that takes a disproportionately heavy toll on communities of color and low-income and rural areas.

But during the first few months of 2025, the EPA teamed up with the Department of Government Efficiency to cut at least $67 million in grant money earmarked for such programs.

On May 2, Rocky Ford learned its grant was included in the slashing. About 550 applications with requests for $137 million were submitted to the program — “a clear sign of both the urgency and the local energy behind this work,” according to Mountains and Plains administrators.

And now every time Gurulé travels U.S. 50 between the Rocky Ford City Hall and the Sonic Drive-In, he’s reminded of the time his town came this close to getting the funding it needed to start addressing its hulking, blackened problems, including the unavoidable eyesore visible down 10th street if he’s driving east, which some Rocky Ford locals have to look at it every day whether they want to or not.

It’s the Brewer Construction burn site, which went up in flames in April 2024.

What’s left — thousands of pounds of contaminated rubble — looks like it could live in a “Mad Max” film. But even worse than how it looks is how toxic it is, Gurulé said. It’s full of asbestos that breaks free when the wind blows. Pieces of tin and shingles fly through the community. And there’s a good chance the patients walking into the doctor’s office nearby are breathing in toxic chemicals, he said.

Spoiler alert: This story has no happy ending.

But that’s why Gurulé wants it told “loudly and clearly,” starting with the fire.

Or fires.

Two blazes in one year and no cleanup

The second fire, in December, burned a hole through the middle of Liberty Elementary School, built in 1950 to accommodate the post-World War II baby boom, by then in grades 1 through 6, according to the Kiowa County Independent. It bustled for a while, but as schools in some rural towns sometimes do, enrollment dwindled until it was forced to close in 2011.

The fire inside it was bad, but two wings remained after it was extinguished. The town council had big plans for it in part because of its location: “It’s more or less connected to the fairgrounds,” which each August hosts the Arkansas Valley Fair, the “oldest continuous in Colorado,” and Crystal Lake, which along with the fairgrounds is undergoing an ambitious transformation with planned parking, a nature trail, a mountain bike park and playgrounds, thanks to a grant from Great Outdoors Colorado.

Rocky Ford will continue to develop this project, for which they received $150,000 in 2022 to begin community engagement and assessment, and another $400,000 in 2024 for planning and design, Gurulé said. They’re applying for $21 million from GOCO and numerous other funders to bring the project to life.

While the Brewer burn site, if demolished, decontaminated and cleaned up, would be perfect for mixed residential and commercial use, the Liberty School site could house a hotel or other lodging, something the city desperately needs, Gurulé said.

But without funding from the federal government, Rocky Ford isn’t getting so much as an assessment of the environmental and health issues the building damage brings as well as the economic impacts. That means the eyesore stays, the asbestos particles float and the sorely needed facelift for the commercial district and north side of Rocky Ford won’t likely happen in the near future. “It’s hurting us in several different ways,” Gurulé said.

Now what?

Despite it all, Rocky Ford tries to remain hopeful.

“We’re waiting to see what new programs the EPA will release and we’re working with the Colorado Department of Local Affairs and Colorado Department of Public Heath and Environment to identify funding we can use,” said Gurulé.

In an ideal scenario, Rocky Ford “receives technical assistance to apply for funding from the EPA to address this cleanup, is able to support and attract new business expansion or growth, and has development of homes that meet the needs of our region across all housing types and all income levels,” he added. “We nurture the growth of a Rocky Ford for the next generations.”

But hope becomes challenging when Gurulé thinks about Trump terminating the program that could have helped them, with the grant that “was more than just dollars, it was a rare opportunity for a small city with limited staff and resources to finally address long-standing environmental hazards.

“It didn’t just cancel a funding stream. It sent a message that rural communities like Rocky Ford — where people pay federal taxes just like folks in big cities, but don’t have full-time grant writers or million-dollar budgets to chase federal funds – don’t matter. That our health, our environment and our future are not a priority.”

So Gurulé keeps telling the story. “Because when policies are made without rural voices at the table, we are the ones left cleaning up the mess, sometimes literally, like with asbestos in our neighborhoods. And if we don’t speak up, these decisions will keep happening in D.C., while our communities are left to ‘make do’ with less and less.”

On Tuesday, a tiny stroke of luck may have arrived, when a federal judge ruled that cancelling $600 million in environmental justice grants, including those administered through the Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program, was illegal.

More Colorado Safeway stores go on strike

Safeway stores in Boulder, Brighton and Lone Tree joined the ongoing labor strike on Thursday, even as negotiations between the union and Safeway management resumed this week.

But in a note to members of United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Local 7 late Thursday, President Kim Cordova said, “the company remains unwilling to offer an agreement that meets the needs of workers.”

Negotiations have ended for the week and more stores are expected to join the strike in a staggered rollout to keep the company guessing which store will need temporary workers next.

Stores in Pueblo, Fountain and Estes Park first hit the picket lines on Sunday. And nearly every day since, more stores joined, including locations in Grand Junction, Littleton and Castle Rock.

Union workers are asking for management to address the issue of understaffed stores. They’re also concerned about reduced benefits, especially to retired workers.

Safeway spokesperson Heather Halpape said in an email that the company is trying to “achieve a balanced agreement that rewards our associates, benefits our customers, and is sustainable for our company in the competitive grocery industry.”

➔ April hiring in Colorado saw largest one-month drop in the U.S. Local employers eased up on hiring in April, compared with March, more so than any other state nationwide, according to the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover summary from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In April, Colorado employers hired an estimated 113,000 people, down from the 146,000 in March. On the other hand, the number of layoffs saw a sharp decline, dropping to 23,000, from 39,000 in March. The change was the second-largest decline in layoffs.

The employees apparently love their jobs and their boss but, Winkler said, there’s concern that O’Brien is on his third and final term and “this glaring fact had been noticed by the workers and they wanted to form a Union to maintain the conditions and culture they are currently in, knowing that that could change through leadership in the future.”

Location: Las Cruces, NM

Today, U.S. Representative Gabe Vasquez (NM-02) joined conservation advocates, local leaders, and community members at the Organ Mountains–Desert Peaks National Monument (OMDP) to rally against renewed efforts to sell off federal public lands. The event featured a press conference and community hike, highlighting the cultural, economic, and environmental importance of public lands to southern New Mexico.

The event comes amidst a revived push by Senate Republicans to advance one of the most extreme public land sell-off proposals in recent history of over 3.3 million acres. While these provisions were blocked in the House thanks to Rep. Vasquez’s leadership in the bipartisan Public Lands Caucus, they have resurfaced in the Senate’s version of the budget reconciliation bill, reigniting concern across the West.

“Standing here at Organ Mountains–Desert Peaks, I’m reminded that what’s at stake isn’t just this monument—it’s the future of millions of acres of public lands across New Mexico and the West that could be sold off because of Republican proposals in Congress,” said Vasquez. “These lands are part of our identity. They support local jobs, protect sacred Tribal sites, and give our kids a chance to connect with the outdoors. Our public lands are not for sale. Period.”

“There are a number of reasons why keeping OMDP intact and untouched is so important. Not only are conservation and preservation instrumental in this argument, but in Las Cruces, our community has embraced this monument because of the hiking and camping, the outdoor recreation opportunities, and so much more,” said Carrie Hamblen, CEO and President of the Las Cruces Green Chamber of Commerce and New Mexico State Senator. “Our local businesses rely on the tourism that brings visitors into our stores and restaurants and creates a memorable experience for all to enjoy. Our monument isn’t for sale, and our community has proven to this administration that it should be left alone.”

“Our community in Southern New Mexico understands that our landscape brings us together. These lands hold so much more than what can be extracted or profited from them. They hold our stories, they are homes to essential wildlife, they improve the health of our communities,” said Patrick Nolan, Executive Director of Friends of Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks. “The value of our lands cannot be summed up by what can be extracted from them. We hope Congress, with the help of Representative Vasquez, understands that the value of our lands cannot be summed up by what can be extracted from them. That these lands hold value as they are protected and conserved for generations to come.”

“New Mexico Wild and our thousands of members object in the strongest possible terms to any attempts to shrink, eliminate, or remove protections for Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks or any other national monument. These monuments were created as a result of local communities working for years to protect these one of a kind places,” said Mark Allison, Executive Director of New Mexico Wild. “Nearly 90% of New Mexicans — people of all political persuasions — support keeping our monuments intact. They are not merely lines on a map but critical ecological havens, sacred cultural sites, and irreplaceable natural treasures that help define our identity. Public lands are the backdrop to our state’s outdoor heritage and way of life. Plans to sell off our children’s inheritance to benefit connected billionaires is a theft of historic proportions and should make all Americans ashamed and outraged.”

“To New Mexicans public lands aren’t some line item on a budget spreadsheet. Public lands are our lifeblood. Wild, public places and the wild things that inhabit those places are integral to the culture, traditions and lifestyle of countless people across the West,” said Jesse Duebel, Executive Director of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation. “Public lands are not just about outdoor recreation and all the health and economic benefits associated with that. These places house our identity. It’s where we go to obtain our food, the firewood to heat our homes, and the solace we need to overcome the challenges of modern society. Public lands are our gym, our church and our grocery store. In short, our public lands are not for sale, they are in our DNA.”

“The broad scheme to sell off our public lands, national heritage, and outdoor access to the wealthy and well-connected will block access to regular Americans for hiking, camping, hunting, and fishing. It also willfully ignores or disrespects the Indigenous, Hispano, and local communities who rely on these lands for cultural, spiritual, economic, and recreational reasons, said Romir Lahiri, Associate Program Director for Conservation Lands Foundation. “These lands are part of what makes New Mexico so special. New Mexico’s national monuments, including Organ Mountains–Desert Peaks and Río Grande del Norte, exist because the people demanded it. From local business owners and family campers to mountain guides and outdoor adventurers, the majority—regardless of political affiliation—want these treasured natural places protected and accessible for generations to come.”

“Our public lands are living landscapes. Any effort to weaken their protections threaten the health, heritage, and well-being of their connected communities and stand in direct opposition to the voices of New Mexicans. Despite overwhelming support for our public lands, the Trump Administration is systematically degrading the laws and agencies that manage these irreplaceable places and jeopardizing the legal duty to engage meaningfully with Tribal leadership,” said Maude Dinan, New Mexico Program Manager for the National Parks Conservation Association.“Prioritizing oil and gas drilling or mining, erasing national monuments, or transferring public lands to states is short-sighted and will cause irrevocable harm to our landscapes and people.”

Earlier this year, Vasquez launched the bipartisan Public Lands Caucus alongside Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-MT-01) to bring together lawmakers from both parties who support the protection of public lands. The caucus has quickly become a driving force behind efforts to conserve our public lands and fight for the outdoor recreation economy.

In addition to fighting against this latest effort to sell public lands in order to pay for tax breaks for billionaires, Vasquez also joined a letter earlier this year to the administration urging the Department of Interior to leave OMDP intact, highlighting its significant landscapes, cultural resources and economic impact.

McCrady expects public health to worsen as a result of EPA rollbacks.","As President Donald Trump touts a bill currently making its way through Congress as a win for the public, a former regional Environmental Protection Agency administrator is prepared to see devastating cuts to the office that could negatively impact human health.

“It’s proposing severe cuts to both the scientific work that EPA’s Office of Research and Development does and to the agency as a whole,” said Debra Shore, former administrator for EPA Region 5. “It would severely reduce the agency’s ability to fulfill its mission of protecting public health and the environment.”

As the “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act has passed the U.S. House of Representatives and moved to the Senate, activists nationwide have worried about the consequences.

Shore said it’s heartbreaking to see public servants at the EPA go through these cuts, especially as the administration tries to make the “One Big Beautiful Bill” seem like a win.

“I have never worked with a group of such smart, devoted professionals who had a shared sense of mission as EPA employees,” Shore said. “I know that’s the case across the agency. … They could be working for far higher salaries in many cases, but they are dedicated to the foundational mission of the EPA, which is to protect public health and the environment.”

On Tuesday and Wednesday, the EPA posted on Facebook, saying it “delivers for all Americans.”

“One Big Beautiful Bill is putting American workers, taxpayers and families first,” the EPA’s Tuesday post said. “Under (Trump), the U.S. can unleash American energy while ensuring we have the cleanest air, land and water on (Earth).”

The bill eliminates hundreds of billions of dollars in Green New Deal tax credits, repeals former President Joe Biden administration’s electric vehicle mandates, and opens federal lands and waters to oil, gas, coal, geothermal and mineral leasing, according to the EPA’s Tuesday post.

According to the Wednesday post, the bill also “streamlines onerous permitting processes,” refills the Strategic Petroleum reserve and “delivers certainty to energy producers, saves and creates energy jobs, lowers energy costs for families.”

A spokesperson for Sen. Todd Young, R-Indiana, provided a statement about the bill Friday.

“Senator Young continues to have conversations with his colleagues and stakeholders about improving the House-passed bill and addressing our nation’s debt and deficit challenges,” said Leah Selk, spokesperson for Young.

Representatives for Sen. Jim Banks, R-Indiana, did not respond to a request for comment Friday.

Within the bill, the White House would also have the ability to cut federal agencies and reduce workforce, Shore said.

“This is just an utter abrogation of Congress’ authority and power,” Shore said. “It requires an annual report of planned reorganizational moves, and it also streamlines the ability of any future president to rebuild federal agencies because of some of the language in it.”

Susan Thomas, director of policy and press for Just Transition Northwest Indiana, said it’s concerning that EPA is treating the “One Big Beautiful Bill” like a win, especially on social media platforms that are easily accessible.

“No one can take any information for granted anymore,” Thomas said. “You must do your own research with trusted sources because the amount of greenwashing that’s coming down is so dangerous. … This is becoming increasingly difficult, but it’s more important than ever.”

Thomas and Gary Advocates for Responsible Development board member Carolyn McCrady are both worried about the effects that environmental justice communities will face if the bill passes the Senate.

McCrady expects public health to worsen as a result of EPA rollbacks.

An October report from Industrious Labs found that most residents in Gary are in the top 10% of U.S. residents most at-risk for developing asthma and at-risk of low life expectancy. In 2020, Indiana had a lung cancer rate of 72.5 per 100,000 people, with Lake County as one of the state’s counties with the highest cancer mortality rates, according to the American Lung Association.

A 2016 JAMA Network report also found Gary as one of the top five U.S. cities with the lowest life expectancy at one point.

“I think people are going to be sicker faster,” McCrady said. “I don’t think people will be able to be served in the medical community in the same way, because in Indiana, millions of people are going to lose their health insurance because of the Medicaid cuts.”

Although McCrady believes the EPA cuts are devastating, she isn’t surprised to see them included in “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

Cuts will continue to put communities like Gary at a greater disadvantage, McCrady said.

Thomas also believes that Northwest Indiana’s environmental justice communities will struggle as a result of the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

“They’ve already stripped away all of the environmental justice provisions that had taken years to recognize and acknowledge and to start to put in place,” Thomas said. “This is just a very sad state that we’re in.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2023/05/15/AVOQFLH6NRHSFE6WCT2X3ZFTGU.jpg?w=1024&h=670,N,,2025-06-21 13:09:24.411575

Michael Shanks, a minister working under energy secretary Ed Miliband, will be visiting Scotland on Thursday with a decision set to be made on the government’s intervention on legal cases won by environmentalists last year over an oil project by Equinor at Rosebank and a gas field by Shell in Jackdaw.

The government has given extra funds for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero to invest between 2026 and 2029, with £14bn set aside for a new nuclear plant at Sizewell C and an industrial strategy set to outline government plans on reducing energy bills.

The oil and gas sites have received heavy criticism from Miliband while courts in Scotland blocked projects on the basis projects were approved without greenhouse gas emissions being considered, putting millions of pounds of investment into jeopardy.

Developing offshore sites

A new draft of guidance on emissions is reportedly set to be unveiled and it will signal how energy giants can regain licences and develop offshore sites.

The shift in policy comes after City AM revealed the government admitted low carbon technologies were more expensive to use than fossil-fuel powered alternatives.

The admission came in the minutes for a PAC report, which is publicly available online, detailing the government’s responses to recommendations made on energy policy.

The statement explains that high electricity prices in the UK may be due to the costs of operating renewable energy such as solar power and offshore wind, as well as other technologies, which may include energy storage methods and energy infrastructure.

“Low carbon technologies can be more expensive to run than fossil-fuel powered alternatives,” the government said in its response to the PAC recommendations on energy bills.

“The price disparity between electricity and gas needs to be addressed to make it more attractive for consumers to install clean technologies like heat pumps.”

Hopes oil and gas sites will ease prices

Recent data showed standard electricity bills reaching £1,067 last year compared to £814 for gas, making average energy bills stand at around £1,881 in 2024.

The previous government supported rolling out projects to boost energy supplies, with Rosebank expected to generate thousands of jobs for construction.

Jackdaw was projected to provide up to six per cent of the UK’s gas demand before it was blocked by judges due to the “interest of members of the public in climate change”.

Miliband would still have to give projects the go-ahead if Shell and Equinor return with proposals.

Confederation of British Industry (CBI) boss Rain Newton-Smith was the latest industry leader to call for the government to tackle high energy costs.

""This decision opens the door to more oil industry lawsuits attacking states' ability to protect their residents and wildlife from climate change.""
While the Clean Air Act sets emission standards for new vehicles nationally, the EPA has granted California the ability to set tougher standards for in-state vehicle sales to combat air pollution.
In 2022, a lower court had ruled that a lawsuit brought by fossil fuel industry groups arguing that California's regulations could cause the fossil fuel industry financial harm did not have the necessary legal standing.
The justices 7-2 ruling released on Friday overturned that lower court ruling.","The Supreme Court on Friday ruled that fossil fuel companies do in fact have standing to challenge a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency waiver given to California, which allowed the state to set stricter limits on vehicle emissions and require automakers to increase the percentage of electric vehicles they produce.

The Center for Biological Diversity, a conservation and environmental advocacy group, swiftly denounced the decision.

""This is a dangerous precedent from a court hellbent on protecting corporate interests,"" said David Pettit, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity's Climate Law Institute. ""This decision opens the door to more oil industry lawsuits attacking states' ability to protect their residents and wildlife from climate change.""

While the Clean Air Act sets emission standards for new vehicles nationally, the EPA has granted California the ability to set tougher standards for in-state vehicle sales to combat air pollution.

In 2022, a lower court had ruled that a lawsuit brought by fossil fuel industry groups arguing that California's regulations could cause the fossil fuel industry financial harm did not have the necessary legal standing. The justices 7-2 ruling released on Friday overturned that lower court ruling.

Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, who is considered liberal, sided with the conservative majority.

""Nowhere in the Constitution does it say that oil industry profits must be protected even at the cost of destroying the climate that has sustained humanity for millennia. The 7-2 majority ruled for polluters, putting the rest of us at risk,"" Pettit added.

Even before the court's ruling, California's clean air waivers were under threat. Earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a measure passed by Congress that would roll back the waivers, though California sued in response.

Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented in the case, but offered separate opinions.

According to Slate, Jackson authored a ""furious"" opinion in which she criticized the majority for deciding the case when the issue may soon be irrelevant, and accused them of bending the usual rules of standing to help fossil fuel companies.

""Also,"" wrote Jackson, ""I worry that the fuel industry's gain comes at a reputational cost for this court, which is already viewed by many as being overly sympathetic to corporate interests.""

What's more, according to Jackson, ""the court's remarkably lenient approach to standing in this case contrasts starkly with the stern stance it has taken in cases concerning the rights of ordinary citizens.""

Reacting to the ruling, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) noted that it was fairly narrow and that the court declined to adopt a broader standing rule.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=56529977&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C291%2C0%2C292,N,,2025-06-21 13:09:54.968655

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina legislators finalized a bill Thursday that would eliminate an interim greenhouse gas reduction mandate set in a landmark 2021 law, while still directing regulators to aim to cancel out power plant carbon emissions in the state within the next 25 years.

With some bipartisan support, the state Senate voted to accept the House version that would repeal the 2021 law’s requirement that electric regulators take “all reasonable steps to achieve” reducing carbon dioxide output 70% from 2005 levels by 2030. The law’s directive to take similar steps to meet a carbon neutrality standard by 2050 would remain in place.

The bill’s Republican supporters pushing the new measure say getting rid of the interim goal benefits ratepayers asked to pay for future electric-production construction and is more efficient for Duke Energy, the state’s dominant electric utility.

The bill now goes to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, who can veto the measure, sign it or let it become law without his signature. Stein previously expressed concerns about the Senate version of the measure, worried that it could hurt electricity users and threaten the state’s clean-energy economy. His office didn’t immediately provide comment after Thursday’s vote.

With over a dozen House and Senate Democrats voting for the final version, the chances that any Stein veto could be overridden are higher. Republicans in charge of the General Assembly are only one House seat shy of a veto-proof majority.

The bill also contains language that would help Duke Energy seek higher electric rates to cover financing costs to build nuclear or gas-powered plants incrementally, rather than wait until the project’s end.

The 2021 greenhouse gas law marked a rare agreement on environmental issues by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Republican lawmakers.

At least 17 other states — most controlled by Democrats — have laws setting similar net-zero power plant emissions or 100% renewable energy targets, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. North Carolina and Virginia are the only ones from the Southeast.

The legislation came about as President Donald Trump’s administration has proposed rolling back federal environmental and climate change policies, which critics say could boost pollution and threaten human health. Republicans are promoting them as ways to reduce the cost of living and boost the economy.

The state Utilities Commission, which regulates rates and services for public utilities, already has pushed back the 2030 deadline — as the 2021 law allows — by at least four years. The panel acknowledged last year it was “no longer reasonable or executable” for Duke Energy to meet the reduction standard by 2030.

Bill supporters say to meet the goal would require expensive types of alternate energy immediately. If the interim standard can be bypassed, GOP bill authors say, Duke Energy can assemble less expensive power sources now and moderate electricity rate increases necessary to reach the 2050 standard.

“Our residents shouldn’t be saddled with higher power bills to satisfy arbitrary targets,” Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said in a news release after the vote.

Citing an analysis performed by a state agency that represents consumers before the commission, GOP lawmakers say removing the interim goal would reduce by at least $13 billion what Duke Energy would have to spend — and pass on to customers — in the next 25 years.

Bill opponents question the savings figure given uncertainty in plant fuel prices, energy demand and construction costs. They say the interim goal still holds an aspirational purpose and was something that Duke Energy had agreed in 2021 to meet.

Provisions in the measure related to recouping plant construction expenses over time would reduce accumulated borrowing interest.

Environmental groups argue the financing option would benefit Duke Energy’s bottom line on expensive projects even if they’re never completed, and the bill broadly would prevent cleaner energy sources from coming online sooner. They also contend another bill section would shift costs to residential customers.

“This bill is bad for all North Carolinians, whether they’re Duke Energy customers or simply people who want to breathe clean air,” North Carolina Sierra Club director Chris Herndon said after the vote while urging Stein to veto the measure.

Bill support came from the North Carolina Chamber and a manufacturers’ group, in addition to Duke Energy.

“We appreciate bipartisan efforts by policymakers to keep costs as low as possible for customers and enable the always-on energy resources our communities need,” the company said this week.

The company and supporters of the bill say the changes will save customers money.

Critics say the state is backing away from its commitment to clean energy, which can slow climate change. And with the shift in the way new power plants would be financed, customers could end up paying for projects Duke Energy may never build or bring online.

Senate Bill 266 was approved on Thursday in the state legislature and now goes to Gov. Josh Stein.

The carbon-emissions component

In 2021, Democrats and Republicans in the legislature worked together to approve House Bill 951 that committed North Carolina to a 70% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by public electric utilities from 2005 levels by the year 2030. It set a goal of carbon neutrality – meaning for every ton of carbon dioxide power plants emit, an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide emissions is prevented — to achieve by 2050.

Duke Energy, the N.C. Sustainable Energy Association and others helped craft that bill, which favors transitioning to cleaner energy sources such as large-scale solar power as coal plants are retired.

SB 266 leaves in place the 2050 goal of carbon neutrality but drops the requirement of the 70% reduction by 2030.

That comes as a disappointment to clean-energy advocates, including Mel Mackin, director of state policy for Ceres, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit.

“Leading businesses across North Carolina have supported the state’s plan to reduce power sector emissions by 70% by 2030, both to reduce their own exposure to climate risk and to experience the economic benefits of clean energy investment,” Mackin said. “This decision not only delays that goal, but it also sets a worrying precedent.

“While we will continue to push for greater ambition from Duke moving forward, including through increased investment in clean energy resources and transmission upgrades, this outcome is a reminder that achieving our climate, energy, and economic goals will require concerted and aligned effort from all levels of government and the private sector.”

Paying for new power plants

Markin said Friday that North Carolina and other states are expecting a large increase in the demand for electricity with the development of data centers and growth in manufacturing. To compete for new industry, the state must assure businesses they’ll have access to reliable power.

SB 266 would make a major change in how Duke Energy would finance new projects to provide that power. Typically, the utility builds first and recoups the cost of the investment by billing customers later.

Under the new law, the utility would finance new construction in advance, getting the money from rate-payers instead of borrowing it from commercial lenders with interest.

Duke says the method, called Construction While in Progress, or CWIP, saves customers money by avoiding interest charges.

“We appreciate bipartisan efforts by policymakers to keep costs as low as possible for customers and enable the always-on energy resources our communities need,” Garrett Poorman, a Duke spokesman, said Friday. “Policies which build on our state’s strong customer protections while helping meet growing energy demands from population growth, business expansion and a resurgence of manufacturing can play a critical role in supporting North Carolina’s thriving economy.”

Josh Brooks, chief of policy strategy and innovation for the N.C. Sustainable Energy Association, said he’s concerned that customers here could end up like those in South Carolina, who still are paying for two nuclear reactors that were never built, or those in Georgia, where a nuclear plant came online seven years late and more than $17 billion over budget.

Duke’s spokesman said SB 266 “includes important safeguards to protect customers, adding to the strict oversight North Carolina policymakers have granted the Utilities Commission over the construction of new generation resources.”

Brooks disagreed.

“Conceptually there is an argument to be made that CWIP, with guardrails, could help with financing costs as long as the project is actually built and all costs are just and reasonable to provide the best reliable service to the state,” he said. “While (SB) 266 does have some guardrails, they are not sufficient to ensure that happens.”

The bill is headed to Stein, who will have 10 days to make a decision on it. If the Democratic governor decides to veto the bill, SB 266 would go back to the Republican-controlled legislature, where it would likely need support from at least one Democrat to become law.

Published by Canary Media, Renewable Energy World Floodlight is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates the powers stalling climate action.","Republicans and Democrats alike are less likely to support renewable energy than they were five years ago, according to a survey released June 5 by the Pew Research Center. Floodlight examines the survey results, which mirror growing pockets of opposition to solar farms, reignited political support for coal plants and moves by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to kill federally funded clean energy projects.

This shift in opinion dates back to when Democratic President Joe Biden took office, said Brian Kennedy, Pew senior researcher and one of the study’s authors. “This isn’t a new trend,” he said.

Still, Kenneth Gillingham, professor of environmental and energy economics at the Yale School of the Environment, was surprised.

“I see this shift … as a successful effort to link climate change and renewable energy to broader culture war issues,” Gillingham said. He added that in the past, “prominent” Republicans supported renewables and sought solutions to climate change, but those stances could now be seen as “disloyal” to Trump.

Pew Research Center

The survey of 5,085 U.S. adults taken April 28 to May 4 revealed that while 79% of Americans favored expanding wind and solar production in 2020, that number has dropped to 60%. And 39% of Americans today support expansion of oil, coal and natural gas — almost double the 20% that supported it in 2020.

Combustion of fossil fuels — in transportation, energy generation and industrial production — is the No. 1 cause of climate change.

Much of the change in opinion is driven by Republicans, whose support of oil and gas grew from 35% in 2020 to 67% today. But Democrats also indicated less support for renewable energy and more for fossil fuels than five years ago.

While many results reflect Trump’s policies opposing most renewables and boosting fossil fuels, Pew found a few notable exceptions: 69% of all respondents favor offshore wind — a technology Trump has specifically targeted.

Both Democrats and Republicans indicated stronger support for nuclear power, with Republicans’ favorable opinions increasing from 53% in 2020 to 69% in 2025. Democrats’ support rose from 37% to 52%. The Trump administration has signaled support for a nuclear renaissance, despite its high cost.

There were wide partisan splits on several topics. In March, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it would scale back environmental regulations. Pew asked whether it was possible to do that and still protect air and water quality: 77% of Republicans said yes and 67% of Democrats said no.

Pew didn’t ask the respondents why their attitudes have shifted. But Kennedy said in Pew’s past surveys, Republicans have expressed concern about the economic impacts of climate change policies and transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.

Mike Murphy, a Republican consultant and electric vehicle backer, said when the environmental benefits of clean technologies are touted, it polarizes Republicans. Instead, Murphy said messages should be about pocketbook issues — like lower fuel costs — and jobs.

“It’s hard for pro-climate people to understand,” said Murphy, who has advised dozens of state and national GOP campaigns including John McCain’s 2008 presidential bid. “(They think) we just need to shout louder and hit people over the head about climate, climate, climate. The key is you want to talk about jobs and national security and other events that naturally resonate a lot more with right-of-center people.”

That’s what Murphy’s groups, the EV Politics Project and the American EV Jobs Alliance, are trying to do to depoliticize electric vehicles. “Whenever electric cars are seen through a climate lens,” Murphy said, “their appeal narrows.”

It’s a strategy also being used by the Electrification Coalition, a left-of-center pro-EV group. Ben Prochazka, the coalition’s executive director, echoed Murphy’s strategy, adding that EVs have “become overly politicized and caught in the culture wars, impacting markets and ultimately hurting our ability to realize their many benefits for all Americans.”

Prochazka noted that once introduced to EVs, consumers support them: “EV drivers love their vehicles, with more than eight out of ten reporting that their next car will also be electric.”

Pew Research Center

Perhaps those practical messages are getting through. In the Pew survey, electric vehicles were the one item that saw an uptick in support — 4 percentage points in the past year.

But popular support might not be enough to stop Congress from killing a $7,500 electric vehicle credit, which Murphy said would be “policy disaster.”

Republicans, he said, are in a “real squeeze,” because “they don’t have enough money for the tax cuts the president has promised.”

Murphy said: “It’s easier for Republicans to cut Biden electric cars … than it is for them to cut more Medicaid.”

Gillingham is still optimistic that solar, wind and other greenhouse gas-reducing technologies will move forward — because they are the cheapest.

“The continued decline in the price of renewable energy and battery technologies, as well as other new technologies, is a reason to continue to have hope that the worst impacts of climate change can be addressed,” he said.

And some of President Trump’s policies risk making things worse, despite his promises to slash energy prices, companies and researchers say.

This week, the Senate is taking up Mr. Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill, which has already passed the House. In its current form, that bill would abruptly end most of the Biden-era federal tax credits for low-carbon sources of electricity like wind, solar, batteries and geothermal power.

Indiana wind projects can be a source of revenue through taxes, land leases, and economic development agreements. The latest figures reveal that in 2023, the industry generated $23 million in state and local tax payments. The revenue helps fund areas including schools, hospitals and local businesses, contributing to the overall economic health of the areas. Rural landowners are also benefitting from an additional stream of revenue, sharing in $22 million in annual land lease payments in 2023.

Clean energy manufacturers and advocates say they’re perplexed how the repeal of tax credits in President Donald Trump’s “one big beautiful bill” will keep their domestic production lines humming across the United States, particularly in states that elected him to the Oval Office.

While some Republicans have labeled the billions in tax credits a “green new scam,” statistics reviewed by States Newsroom show the jobs and benefits would boost predominantly GOP-leaning states and congressional districts. Now the industry is already slowing amid Trump’s back-and-forth tariff policy and mixed messaging on energy and manufacturing.

Two Northwest Indiana activism groups joined other environmental groups in sending a petition to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in objection to an air monitoring permit recently approved for Cleveland-Cliffs’ Indiana Harbor facility.

“If this permit is approved as is, the Cleveland-Cliffs facilities (at Indiana Harbor in East Chicago) will likely release harmful emissions into the air…” Ellis Walton, associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said in a Monday news release. “The communities of East Chicago and Gary suffer many environmental injustices already and shouldn’t be forced to bear even more harms from local industry.”

A sweeping Republican-led proposal, referred to as the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” is charging through Congress and threatens to wipe out the popular electric vehicle (EV) tax credit for most vehicles in 2025.

The credit was originally launched in 2008, but received a major overhaul under former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. That legislation supercharged incentives, expanding the $7,500 credit for new EVs and rolling out a $4,000 credit for used electric vehicles.

“The purpose of the tax incentives was simply to spur EV adoption by giving a literal ‘incentive’ for people to buy EVs,” says Dave Thomas, director of content marketing and automotive industry analyst at CDK Global, a technology firm serving car dealerships.

However, President Donald Trump and other Republicans have vowed to eliminate the credit, but analysts say the tax credit has been a driving force behind the EV boom.

According to J.D. Power’s E-Vision Intelligence Report, 87 percent of EV shoppers in 2024 took advantage of the tax credit — many citing it as a key reason for their purchase.

That momentum could stall if the bill clears the Senate and makes its way to the president’s desk. Here’s what’s at stake under the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

Here’s how the EV tax credit works now

Under the current law, which covers cars purchased in 2023 or later, taxpayers can claim the electric vehicle tax credit if they meet specific income and purchase requirements.

For new electric vehicles, you may qualify for a credit of up to $7,500, as long as the vehicle is primarily used in the United States. To be eligible, your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) must fall below the following limits:

$225,000 for head of household filers

$150,000 for all other filers

The IRS allows taxpayers to apply the income limit based on the year they take possession of the vehicle or the prior year — whichever is more favorable.

For used electric vehicles purchased in 2023 or later, the credit is worth up to $4,000 or 30 percent of the purchase price, whichever is less. The vehicle’s purchase price must not exceed $25,000, and you must buy the car from a licensed dealer.

Also, the car must be at least two years old when you purchase it; for example, if you bought the car in 2025, it would have to be a 2023 model or older to qualify for the credit.

Used EVs have lower income limitations than newer EVs as follows:

$150,000 for married couples filing jointly or a surviving spouse

$112,500 for head of household filers

$75,000 for all other filers

Another benefit: You can receive the credit at the time of the purchase instead of waiting until tax time to claim it, by transferring the tax credit to the dealer. If you choose this option at the dealership, you must still meet all the IRS requirements when filing your tax return.

House and Senate agree on ending the credit, but not on when

Much like the House-approved tax bill, the Senate proposal seeks to eliminate the electric vehicle tax credit for both new and used vehicles. But the Senate’s timeline moves even faster.

Here’s how the two versions compare:

EV tax credit: House vs. Senate bills

The main difference between the House-approved bill and the Senate’s version is how quickly the EV tax credit would end.

Under the Senate’s proposal, the $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles would expire 180 days after the bill becomes law. The $4,000 credit for used EVs would phase out even sooner — just 90 days after enactment.

By contrast, the House bill would end the EV tax credit for most vehicles at the end of 2025. However, some vehicles could still qualify through the end of 2026.

Plus, the House version includes a manufacturer-based phaseout. Automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 EVs could still offer the credit until the end of 2026.

“So, Tesla for example will not have any incentives on its vehicles after the bill passes,” Thomas says. “It will likely be hard for car shoppers to track this in real-time, and they will have to rely on research or their local car dealer to keep on top of it.”

New EV fee in House bill dropped in Senate’s plan

While the House-approved bill includes a $250 annual fee, the Senate’s version omits any mention of an annual EV charge. The House’s proposed fee for electric vehicle owners is a measure aimed at ensuring all drivers contribute equally to maintaining the nation’s roadways.

Currently, owners of gas-powered cars help fund highway infrastructure through the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax. But that tax has remained unchanged since 1993, even as the cost of maintaining roadways has skyrocketed. Plus, cars have become more fuel-efficient — and some drivers have switched to electric cars.

But some experts argue the proposed $250 EV fee is excessive. The proposed fee would be nearly three times what the average driver pays annually in gas taxes, according to a Consumer Reports study.

“The proposal of an annual fee for EVs makes sense on its face as those owners don’t pay the federal or local gasoline taxes,” Thomas says. “However, most calculations say the average driver pays around $100 in gas taxes a year and this fee is clearly more than that.”

And EV owners often do pay state and local fees tied to their cars, depending on the tax rules of the state where they live.

Bottom line

While the Senate bill wouldn’t charge EV owners an annual fee and the House includes it, both chambers agree on one thing: Eliminating the federal EV tax credit altogether. With the EV credit potentially ending soon, drivers considering an EV purchase may want to act quickly. Waiting could mean missing out on valuable tax incentives that can help lower the cost.",https://www.bankrate.com/brp/2025/06/21101803/electric-vehicles-at-charging-station-in-california.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 11:08:02.566241

This translates into significant cost savings, particularly for cooling — one of the largest energy loads in commercial buildings during the summer.
Adopting energy storage now helps reduce electricity costs, increases resilience and prepares buildings for coming regulations, just like how parking became a planning standard decades ago.","In the 1940s-1950s, cities across the U.S. started embedding minimum parking requirements into zoning ordinances, mandating that new developments include a set number of off-street parking spaces based on use and square footage.

The City of Los Angeles was among the first major U.S. cities to mandate off-street parking requirements in its zoning code. The 1946 Los Angeles Zoning Plan introduced provisions requiring new developments to include a minimum number of off-street parking spaces tailored to the building’s use and size.

These mandatory parking lots were part of the urban planning zeitgeist of the time. But even as cities reverse the trend in favor of more walkable city centers, it’s worth remembering that the architects of mandatory parking requirements got at least one thing right.

They understood that a city’s commercial and industrial buildings require a great deal of urban infrastructure resources, yet are also uniquely capable of providing resources that benefit both city residents and themselves.

Therefore, in the late 60s, a dramatic mandatory step started rolling out regarding commercial building permitting across the country: a demand to acquire underground car storage capabilities, or underground parking lots.

What seems now like a very natural and reasonable demand for a permit was, at that time, rather extreme. Building a high-rise six levels below ground level was not an ordinary or a natural part of the required investment from the developer’s point of view. But today, we cannot imagine the evolution of big cities without embracing these regulations.

Building owners today face rising electricity costs, growing energy demand and increasing pressure to maintain reliability without compromising budgets. These challenges are especially pronounced during peak hours, when energy prices spike and outages are more likely, putting operations and tenants at risk.

Although lithium-ion battery systems are often discussed as a solution, they are rarely viable for commercial buildings. Safety concerns, along with complex insurance, permitting and regulatory hurdles, prevent this technology from becoming a feasible solution.

But thermal energy storage, in which my company specializes, offers a more practical alternative. By storing energy in the form of ice during off-peak hours, when electricity is cleaner and cheaper, these systems reduce daytime energy use without changing how buildings operate.

This translates into significant cost savings, particularly for cooling — one of the largest energy loads in commercial buildings during the summer. Ice-based systems such as ours can cut cooling costs by 30 to 50 percent.

Unlike lithium-ion batteries, thermal storage is safe, clean and durable and doesn’t require grid-interconnection permits, which can take years, making it easier to deploy and manage.

As energy storage becomes a standard expectation in modern building design, much like parking once did, thermal solutions give “looking-forward” ownership a way to stay ahead of regulatory shifts while gaining immediate operational and financial benefits

Energy storage is quickly becoming a critical part of commercial building strategy, with strong signals that it may soon be mandated in many jurisdictions. Regulatory shifts, such as New York City’s Local Law 97 and California’s Title 24, are pushing buildings toward lower emissions; storage will likely be a required part of compliance in the near future.

Nationally, the House Committee on Ways and Means proposed a draft 2025 Budget Reconciliation bill that could reshape the storage market, further incentivizing behind-the-meter solutions.

Energy storage is increasingly recognized in LEED certification for its role in demand response and energy optimization, and in states like California and New York, qualified systems can participate in wholesale electricity markets, unlocking new revenue and reducing operational costs.

Buildings with accredited systems can now earn resource adequacy credits, as seen in programs by the California Public Utilities Commission, turning passive energy consumers into active market participants.

Adopting energy storage now helps reduce electricity costs, increases resilience and prepares buildings for coming regulations, just like how parking became a planning standard decades ago. For building owners and managers, the time to act is now.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/commercial_construction_05132025_GettyImages-2214753287.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-21 12:17:06.663028

Prices start at $57,400.

I'm sharing my impressions of vehicles after living with them for a few days or as a make or model evolves. The car this week is the 2025 Volvo XC90 AWD T8.

What is it?

It's a plug-in hybrid version of Volvo’s six- or seven-seat three-row luxury SUV. Volvo calls it a 2025.5 model, but U.S. regulations, which govern model years, don’t recognize half-model years. (Sorry, Mustang fans; there wasn’t a 1964.5 either.)

How much?

I tested an $80,700 XC90 T8 AWD Ultra. Prices start at $57,400. Prices exclude $1,295 destination charge and import tariffs.

How’s it selling?

The XC90 is one of Volvo’s core vehicles. It sold 39,492 in 2024 and 39,920 in 2023. The updated 2025 went on sale in December. Volvo has sold 16.744 XC90s so far in 2025. U.S. tariffs may affect XC90 prices and availability.

What I liked most the first time I drove the XC90

Typical Volvo style and safety. Quiet ride, smooth power.

What does it compete with?

It competes with the Acura MDX hybrid, Cadillac Vistiq EV, Hyundai Ioniq 9, Kia EV9, Lexus TX 550h+ plug-in hybrid and Tesla X EV.

Why I want it

Room, comfort and sustainability. Volvo says owners worldwide average 48% of their miles driven on electric power. The 2.0L turbocharged engine and electric motor deliver 455 horsepower and 523 pound-feet of torque. The interior is roomy, attractive and safe ― Volvo hallmarks. The interior is quiet at highway speeds and the air suspension delivers a smooth ride and commendable handling for a big heavy vehicle.

What needs work

There’s no change to the updated XC90’s range on electric power. The XC90’s price puts it in competition with new EVs like the Cadillac Vistiq and Hyundai Ioniq 9 — improved range wouldn’t hurt.

The lack of wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto goes in the same file: It wasn’t a big deal in 2015 but constitutes a significant competitive failing today.

By Ren Brabenec | June 21, 2025

Michigan’s natural beauty is no mystery to anyone who’s put their feet in our sand, their hands on our lake stones, or turned their face up toward the summer sunshine that brings it all together. Across the state, several nonprofits operate in quiet reverence of the landscapes we hold dear, advocating tirelessly for Michigan’s water, earth, and air.

We checked in with two, Conservation Resource Alliance (CRA) and the Northern Michigan Environmental Action Council (NMEAC), to hear about their latest projects, wins, and concerns.

Funding Pauses Hamper Important Environmental Projects

Suzie Knoll, executive director of CRA, says her organization has been deeply affected by changes at the federal level.

“We recently finalized a three-year strategic plan in early 2025, less than a month before the U.S. Office of Management and Budget issued the federal funding freeze memo, immediately casting uncertainty over previously-awarded funds from CRA’s largest federal agency partners,” Knoll says.

The funding freeze is already affecting critical environmental projects. Many of CRA’s projects rely on support from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA Forest Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

“Millions of dollars in newly awarded grants to CRA—including one large grant that was earmarked for 31 road/stream crossing replacements and bridge projects—are currently on hold,” says Knoll.

Knoll gave two examples of stream crossing replacements in the Cedar River watershed (Leelanau County), funded through the Farm Bill’s Regional Conservation Partnership Program that have been put on hold. The supply ordering window for the projects was missed due to payment uncertainty, resulting in a delay of at least a year.

What Happens Next?

Knoll says continued delays stemming from White House funding freezes could result in increased erosion and sedimentation in critical streams, further degrading habitat for aquatic species.

Even more urgently, some sites involve aging dam infrastructure. Without timely intervention by the CRA and its partners, further deterioration could lead to dam failure.

And it’s not just funding freezes CRA is concerned about. Knoll referenced the current administration’s staffing of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with pro-deregulation leadership, including EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who stated during his confirmation hearing that under his leadership, the EPA would not be required to regulate fossil fuel emissions.

Everything about Michigan’s natural resources is influenced by the human populations who live in and near those resources, and the federal policies governing how humans operate in their environments make all the difference in the world.

For example, Knoll explained that one of CRA’s greatest challenges is balancing rapid population and tourism growth with the need to protect and restore the natural landscapes that draw people to northern Michigan in the first place.

“Federal funding shortfalls will require us to put more time and resources into pursuing private funding sources and will undoubtedly take away from our work on the ground,” Knoll says.

Knoll used a map to show us which 2025-2027 projects are at risk due to funding pauses, revealing that 31 of the 60 projects listed, including dam removals, wetland restorations, and stream crossing repairs, are at risk because of paused federal funding.

Decisions from D.C. Could Have Lasting Effects

Mike Foley, co-chair of the Northern Michigan Environmental Action Council, says he’s most concerned about the Trump Administration’s efforts to clamp down on clean energy initiatives, especially considering Michigan’s strong leadership in this industry.

Foley says that what’s worse is that the current administration is fast-tracking all the wrong energy projects.

“The declaration of an energy emergency by the current administration has led to certain projects that NMEAC strongly opposes [e.g., the proposed Line 5 tunnel under the Straits of Mackinac] being fast-tracked in their permit review process,” says Foley. “We’re working with partner organizations on how best to respond to these accelerated threats. We continue to raise awareness with the public, educate citizens on the dangers inherent with the current Line 5 operations and the proposed tunnel, and contact the governor, the head of the DNR, and our congressional delegations to voice our opposition to this project.”

Foley emphasized that the Line 5 project has implications for the climate, critical ecosystems around the Straits of Mackinac, and the untold thousands of habitats located along the pipeline’s 645-mile-long transit.

“Every bit of effort pushing for the pipeline from the feds to local pipeline supporters is effort that could be put towards clean energy,” Foley adds.

Foley also shared concerns about the pollution of Michigan waterways from the illegal discharge of wastewater, concerns about deregulation, the excessive removal of mature trees and tree canopies in northern Michigan cities, development sprawl with associated increases in impervious surfaces leading to increased stormwater runoff, and an increase in chlorides in local waters from the use of road salt in winter.

Drawing Strength from Victories

It’s never all bad news when a majority of the public supports healthy ecosystems, because even in the face of opposition, concerned residents can still come together and make changes for the better.

On his highlight reel, Foley pointed to several land conservation victories his organization has been involved in.

“We’ve been very happy to support and see some significant land protection by the Grand Traverse Regional Land Conservancy, Leelanau Conservancy, and the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians,” he says.

Foley also emphasized his hope that the point-of-transfer septic regulations his organization has advocated for—recently approved by the Grand Traverse County Commissioners—will become a first step toward a more comprehensive, uniform septic code for the northern Lower Peninsula, and perhaps for the entire state.

Knoll says she takes hope in the projects her organization was able to secure funding for and begin implementing before the federal funding freeze hit.

“For decades, clogged and undersized culverts degraded the Crystal River’s health, disrupting natural stream flow and fragmenting habitat for fish and wildlife,” she says. “The Crystal River Initiative was launched to address four critical road-stream crossings at the heart of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore—one of our region’s most treasured landscapes.”

The initiative will reconnect the Crystal River to Lake Michigan, opening nearly five miles of stream below the watershed’s lowermost sea lamprey barrier.

“Our organization has taken a supporting role, as this work is being led by the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians in partnership with CRA, the Leelanau County Road Commission, and the National Park Service,” Knoll continues. “Together, we’re restoring natural river function, improving public safety, and helping to deepen cultural and spiritual connections to the land and water.”

Contact. Educate. Volunteer. Donate.

According to Foley and Knoll, the public remains the decision-makers in what happens to Michigan’s natural lands, at least for now. That’s why the theme is always “contact, educate, volunteer, donate.”

“Contact local, state, and federal government representatives about environmental issues that matter to you, your family, friends, and neighbors,” Foley says. “Educate yourself with trusted, verifiable sources on the impact of rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere and the importance of reducing energy consumption and accelerating our transition to a low-carbon energy future. Volunteer and donate if you are able.”

Knoll mirrors Foley’s sentiment. “We urge our supporters to reach out to their congressional representatives, share what they know of CRA’s impactful work in your region, and advocate for federal agencies to expedite their review of conservation programs,” she says.

“Swift action is needed to allow restoration projects to move forward, supporting the rural communities that depend on them.”",https://eyesonly.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/IMG_9849.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 19:05:58.422387

This is the third time in the space of a month that Tesla made headlines for a situation like this.

A life weeks ago, somebody noticed a gaggle of Cybertrucks abandoned in a parking lot near Detroit.

Then, an old story about a similar situation in Missouri went viral again.

Probably because the Google algorithm did its job.

But jokes aside, the same thing happened again, and once again it happened in Michigan.

A few days ago, 100 Tesla Cybertrucks were spotted in a parking lot in Farmington Hills, a northwestern suburb of Detroit.

People are saying that’s because Teslas aren’t selling anymore, but that’s not entirely accurate.

It is true that Tesla is no longer dominating the electric vehicle market like it used to, having lost market share to automakers from China like BYD and Xiaomi.

But it’s also true that the best-selling EVs in the US are still the Tesla Model Y and Tesla Model 3.

As for the Cybertruck, the very thing that made it successful might be the reason why it’s not doing so well now: its styling.

The Tesla CEO’s polarizing political involvement certainly hasn’t helped, but the reality is that Cybertrucks are probably simply too out there to be considered a ‘normal’ vehicle.

The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed new Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) targets for 2026 and 2027, to expand U.S. biofuel production and lessen dependence on foreign energy. If finalized, these would be the highest volume requirements in the program’s history. The proposal prioritizes U.S.-grown biofuels and limits the value of renewable fuel credits (RINs) for imports. The plan also includes eliminating electricity as a qualifying renewable fuel under the RFS and establishing a two-tiered system that gives greater value to biofuels produced in the U.S.

“We are creating a new system that benefits American farmers while mitigating the impact on gas prices and ensuring the continued existence of liquid fuels,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. “We can no longer afford to continue with the same system where Americans pay for foreign competitors.”

Utahns’ energy bills would increase $230 per household in 2030 and $510 in 2035 — adding up to $2.8 billion in higher statewide energy bills cumulatively through 2034.
Building new energy projects takes millions in private investment and years of planning.
Repealing federal energy policies would pull the rug out from proposed energy projects and manufacturing facilities across our state, and we may never recover.
Sara Baldwin is senior director of electrification policy at non-partisan energy policy think tank Energy Innovation, a resident of Salt Lake City and a fifth generation Utahn.","When my ancestors settled in what is now Beaver County 170 years ago, they carved out a living with few economic options beyond lumber, mining or hard labor. They had even fewer choices for energy — their best options were burning things like wood or coal.

They’d barely believe their eyes if they saw Beaver County today: From the world’s most advanced geothermal project using fracking technology to tap the Earth’s heat, to massive batteries that strengthen the grid, to solar and wind farms that turn abundant elements into electrons, new energy projects are meeting surging power demand and creating local economic development.

Beaver County is evidence that innovation generates income for communities that could have become ghost towns, but are now thriving with strong schools and public services. Zoom out statewide and you’ll see this dynamic generating jobs and millions in investment.

Just a few weeks ago, Utah beat several states to secure a next-generation small modular nuclear test reactor in Emery County. “To be honest, it was a tight race,” said Governor Spencer Cox. But “Utah is the place where we get to do innovation.”

Unfortunately, our economic engine could grind to a halt if the “One Big Beautiful Bill” working its way through Congress isn’t changed.

The bill, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives by only one vote and is now being debated in the U.S. Senate, would repeal nearly every federal policy like tax credits, grants and loans for the cutting-edge technologies that have sparked our Made-In-America energy boom.

At least one of our federal officials is standing up for Utah. When Sen. John Curtis toured Fluence’s Tooele County battery manufacturing facility in late May, he said proposed energy policy repeals in Congress’ bill is “a problem for the future, and I’ll say not just to clean energy, but for all energy.” His proposed solution is phasing out the clean energy tax credits instead of abruptly ending them — a good compromise so our utilities and the investors building projects here can plan accordingly. Sen. Curtis’ pragmatic stance has drawn attacks from the Washington, D.C.-based political organization Club for Growth, which says his support for our true all-of-the-above energy strategy is a “liberal mistake.” But that out-of-state organization’s attack isn’t the reality for those of us who live here.

These federal policies have attracted more than $13 billion in total announced clean energy and transportation investments across 74 new projects since late 2022, creating thousands of new announced jobs putting Utahns to work building high-tech products that produce homegrown energy. Energy Innovation, the non-partisan research firm where I work, analyzed the economic damage the “One Big Beautiful Bill” could do to our state. Utah would lose 9,400 jobs in 2030 and another 2,900 jobs in 2035, while cumulative statewide GDP would fall $10 billion in a decade. Utahns’ energy bills would increase $230 per household in 2030 and $510 in 2035 — adding up to $2.8 billion in higher statewide energy bills cumulatively through 2034.

These economic losses stem from fossil fuels’ inherently volatile prices, limiting the ability to build all forms of energy cuts off options to cut our energy bills and grow our economy. Natural gas prices could nearly double this year, and the statewide cost of coal-fired power skyrocketed 70% from 2021-2024. Eventually, utilities pass that cost onto families and businesses. Meanwhile wind, solar and geothermal have zero fuel costs once built.

Utahns already dodged one bullet on this front — Rocky Mountain Power’s 2024 request to increase residential power rates 30.5% was cut to about 4% in April by the Utah Public Service Commission, but the utility admitted fossil fuels were the culprit. “These costs are specifically for fuel, for power plants, that’s primarily coal and natural gas,” said a Rocky Mountain Power spokesperson.

Holding back our ability to build diverse energy resources also threatens Utah’s “Operation Gigawatt” goal of doubling power production over the next decade to meet rising demand. Solar power composed 93% of all the energy capacity added statewide since 2015, and clean energy is the fastest available resource we can build to can meet soaring power demand. But if the federal bill passes as currently written, Utah would lose out on 4.3 gigawatts of electricity generation capacity by 2030 and 4.6 gigawatts by 2035.

Building new energy projects takes millions in private investment and years of planning. Repealing federal energy policies would pull the rug out from proposed energy projects and manufacturing facilities across our state, and we may never recover.

There’s so much at stake for Utahns in the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” and energy is no exception. Inflation is rising, and we simply can’t afford being endlessly stuck on the fossil fuel roller coaster.

As Congress deliberates the bill, we deserve an energy future that empowers us to grow. Any other outcome means Utah loses.

But with Ireland now generating a lot more renewable energy nowadays, coal burning is no longer such an urgent need.
Energy think tank Ember data states Ireland generated 37% (11.4 TWh) of its electricity from wind in 2024.
“Ireland has quietly rewritten its energy story, replacing toxic coal with homegrown renewable power,” said Alexandru Mustață, campaigner on coal and gas at Europe’s Beyond Fossil Fuels.
“We also can’t ignore that the government is targeting the installation of at least 2 GW of gas power plants with no strategy to reduce Ireland’s dangerous gas dependency,” he added.","Ireland today (June 20) became the 15th coal-free country in Europe, having ended coal power generation at its 915 MW Moneypoint coal plant in County Clare. Initially commissioned in the mid-1980s by ESB, Moneypoint was intended to help Ireland offset the impact of the oil crises in the 1970s by providing a dependable source of energy.

But with Ireland now generating a lot more renewable energy nowadays, coal burning is no longer such an urgent need. Energy think tank Ember data states Ireland generated 37% (11.4 TWh) of its electricity from wind in 2024. Solar is not near wind levels of generation, (0.97 TWh in 2024) but it has been continuously breaking generation records in recent months and local stakeholders are confident this positive trend will continue.

Following the closure, the Moneypoint plant will continue to serve a limited backup role, burning heavy fuel oil under emergency instruction from Ireland’s transmission system operator EirGrid until 2029.

This strategy is in line with previous plans made by EirGrid and ESB to exit coal-fired generation by the end of 2025, which stipulated that Moneypoint would no longer be active in the wholesale electricity market.

“Ireland has quietly rewritten its energy story, replacing toxic coal with homegrown renewable power,” said Alexandru Mustață, campaigner on coal and gas at Europe’s Beyond Fossil Fuels.

“But this isn’t ‘job done’. The government’s priority now must be building a power system for a renewable future; one with the storage, flexibility, and grid infrastructure needed to run fully on clean, domestic renewable electricity,” Mustață warned.

Jerry Mac Evilly, Campaigns Director at Friends of the Earth Ireland, appealed to the government to ensure oil backup at Moneypoint is kept to an absolute minimum and ultimately decommissioned. He also appealed for the government to prevent further development of data centers, which he said are increasing Ireland’s reliance on fossil gas.

By using drilling technology advanced by the oil and gas industry, Fervo is drilling deeper, drilling sideways and drilling in new places to unlock new reserves of heat energy.
""There's no reason why geothermal energy wells should be using older, more outdated rigs,"" Jewett said.
Traditional geothermal energy relies on finding steam-bearing resources and drilling into them vertically to capture the steam heat.
That made geothermal power geographically limited to those places with just the right combination of factors.","The U.S. oil and gas industry sparked an energy revolution a few decades ago by thinking in a different direction—literally. Horizontal drilling, combined with hydraulic fracturing, unlocked new petroleum reserves and quickly propelled the U.S. to global leadership in oil and gas.

Fervo Energy, a company headquartered in oil capital Houston, is aiming for a similar revolution in geothermal energy by borrowing a page from the oil industry's playbook.

""Drilling is drilling,"" Fervo's Vice President of Strategy Sarah Jewett told Newsweek. ""That is kind of the 'aha' moment that our founders really found when they started this business.""

By using drilling technology advanced by the oil and gas industry, Fervo is drilling deeper, drilling sideways and drilling in new places to unlock new reserves of heat energy.

""There's no reason why geothermal energy wells should be using older, more outdated rigs,"" Jewett said.

Traditional geothermal energy relies on finding steam-bearing resources and drilling into them vertically to capture the steam heat. It requires not only hot rock but also enough permeability in the rock to allow water and heat to come together. That made geothermal power geographically limited to those places with just the right combination of factors.

Fervo is developing an enhanced geothermal system (EGS) that creates some of those conditions by making rock permeable and injecting liquid where hot rock is available.

Instead of just drilling vertical wells, the company uses horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques to harvest naturally occurring heat.

""We are just using the heat from rock under the earth rather than steam directly to create electricity,"" Jewett explained.

The U.S. Department of Energy calls EGS ""the next frontier"" for renewable energy. Because the technology can tap a much wider range of geothermal resources, the DOE estimates that EGS has the potential to power more than 65 million American homes and businesses.

""Really, hot rock is everywhere,"" Jewett said. ""It's just a question of how deep that rock exists and how economic is it to actually get to [that] depth.""

Rock that reaches 400 to 500 degrees Fahrenheit is, generally speaking, closer to the surface in the western U.S. than in the eastern states. Fervo is focusing efforts in southwestern Utah, site of the company's Cape Station development where the company is building three power plants.

Jewett said Fervo's first power plant is scheduled to come online next summer with the first phase delivering 100 megawatts of clean power. An additional 400 megawatts of capacity is scheduled at the same site by 2028, and power purchasers include Shell Energy and Southern California Edison.

Last week the company announced that a new round of funding for the Cape Station development had secured $206 million from investors including Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, founded by Bill Gates.

In another announcement last week, Fervo shared results from one of its exploration wells that pushed the boundaries of geothermal technology. The company's deepest well yet reached more than 15,750 feet, nearly 3 miles beneath the surface. Rock temperature at that depth is greater than 500 degrees, Jewett said, and the company is testing what happens to drill bits, casings and electronics at very high heat.

""One of our paths to innovation we call 'boring is beautiful,'"" she said. As wells reach greater depth and higher heat, companies providing parts and services test the performance of drilling equipment under increasingly harsh conditions. ""That has been a really virtuous cycle of innovation between us and our partners.""

In another parallel with the oil and gas industry, Fervo had the petroleum consulting company DeGolyer & MacNaughton conduct an independent energy reserve estimate for the Cape Station project. Such reserve estimates are common when oil companies develop a new resource, but the practice is new for the geothermal industry, Jewett said.

DeGolyer and MacNaughton applied similar principles from oil analyses to evaluate the thermal energy potential at the site and concluded that Fervo's site could yield 5 gigawatts of power. A gigawatt is enough to power a city of 750,000 homes.

With those positive developments on the technical and financial fronts, Fervo is clearly on a hot streak. But like the rest of the clean energy sector, the company is also closely watching policy developments in Washington.

Tax credits from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act were a boon for new clean energy technology developers, not only because of the size of the credits but because the 10-year lifespan of the credits provided long-term stability to attract private investors.

The ""one big beautiful"" bill approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives late last month would end most of those clean energy credits and debate is underway on a Senate version.

""We're fighting pretty hard to preserve tax credits because for these very early projects, it's incredibly useful to have that that support,"" Jewett said. Fervo's first phase of development would not be affected by the changes, she said, because construction is already underway, but future projects could become more challenging.

Regardless of policy changes, however, she said she is confident that EGS power will find a market as a steady source of electricity to meet surging demand.

""Geothermal energy projects are capable of providing that 'always on' power,"" she said. ""And I think that's why it's become so attractive.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2668095/fervo-energy-geothermal-drill-rig.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 11:08:07.682500

As the world pivots from fossil fuels to sustainable alternatives, companies leading the clean energy revolution are not just solving environmental issues; they’re creating multi-billion-dollar opportunities for investors.

Whether you’re building a retirement portfolio or aiming for financial independence, the renewable energy sector holds promise. As governments, corporations, and consumers commit to a greener future, savvy investors are seeking out long-term renewable energy stocks that offer stability, innovation, and growth. This article highlights eight standout stocks positioned to thrive in the clean energy boom and potentially make you a millionaire.

Why Renewable Energy Stocks Are Booming?

The global transition toward clean energy isn’t a trend; it’s a structural shift. Driven by climate change concerns, rising oil volatility, and supportive policy, renewable energy is now a core pillar of national and corporate strategies alike. The Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. and similar legislation worldwide have unlocked billions in tax credits and incentives for renewable projects.

These factors have fueled a surge in green investments. But while the sector is hot, not all green energy stocks are created equal. Some companies are speculative, while others are proven leaders with scalable technology, steady cash flows, and growing global footprints. Knowing where to place your bet matters.

8 Best Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy in 2025

As we look toward 2025, several companies stand out for their strong performance, innovation, and potential to deliver lasting gains. Below are eight of the best renewable energy stocks that could build serious wealth over the next decade.

Each company brings something unique to the table, from solar tech pioneers and wind energy giants to battery producers and dividend-paying green utilities. These are not just green energy stocks, but businesses with clear growth paths and real-world impact.

How to Choose the Right Renewable Energy Stocks?

With so many options, how do you pick the winners? Here are a few guiding principles:

1. Look for Consistent Revenue Growth

Companies like NEE and BEP have proven, reliable business models with years of positive earnings.

2. Pay Attention to Policy Tailwinds

U.S. and global subsidies are tilting the playing field. Firms like First Solar are positioned to benefit from American industrial policy.

3. Understand the Tech Curve

Innovators like Enphase and Tesla are pushing the envelope in energy management, storage, and grid tech.

4. Balance Risk and Reward

Mix conservative dividend plays (Clearway) with aggressive growth stocks (Plug Power) to balance your portfolio.

Business Implications: Why Investors Are Paying Attention

The renewable energy sector isn’t just an ethical play; it’s a massive capital rotation story. Institutional investors, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds are pouring money into long-term renewable energy stocks because they see decades of growth ahead.

Key trends to watch:

Corporate ESG mandates are pressuring companies to decarbonize, boosting demand for clean power.

Grid modernization and energy storage will create new profit centers.

M&A activity may reward early investors in smaller firms acquired by industry giants.

Risks to Consider Before Investing

Every opportunity carries risk. Renewable stocks, particularly smaller or newer firms, can be volatile.

House and Senate Republicans are working on a massive tax and spending cuts bill, but they disagree on key provisions. Differences include the size of the child tax credit, state and local tax deductions, and clean energy tax credits. The House and Senate also differ on deductions for tips, overtime, and interest paid on auto loans.

House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.

Republicans in the two chambers don't agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.

The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.

While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.

Here's a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:

Live Events

Tax break for families

The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.

The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump's second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.

Trump campaign promises

Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.

The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.

The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that's equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.

The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.

The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.

And on Social Security, the bills don't directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

More SALT

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That's a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

Medicaid providers

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or ""Obamacare,"" until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

""This needs a lot of work. It's really concerning and I'm really surprised by it,"" he said. ""Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.""

Tax breaks for business

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Clean energy tax credits

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden's climate law. It aimed to boost the nation's transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

Odds and ends

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn't include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

Acting sooner rather than later is encouraged, as the GOP's proposed ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" is seeking to slash tax provisions, including the tax incentives that save you money on improving your home through clean energy.

How it's helping

The IRA offers tax credits and discounts for a slew of energy-efficient improvements from solar panels to electric vehicles.

One particularly high rebate includes $840 for induction ovens and stoves. This figure can even be higher when accounting for the substantial amount of savings that come from slashing your gas bill.

Induction ovens are also known to be better for your health, while they also make cooking seamless by heating up food faster. The benefits are endless; however, it's understandable that some may not be able to completely revitalize their kitchen, especially amid the growing cost of living in the United States.

The ruling notes the Advanced Clean Cars I EV requirements in question have been adopted at least in part by 17 states and the District of Columbia, and are in effect through vehicle model year 2025, which for many automakers is already over, while the GHG emissions regulations are indefinite.

With the new ruling remanding the case back to district court, the GHG regulations are set to face a renewed challenge from fuel producers, who have argued the rules will reduce demand for their products.

Advanced Clean Cars II, which was supposed to take effect for model year 2026, was recently overturned after President Donald Trump signed a resolution passed by Congress. Lawmakers used the Congressional Review Act to overturn the Biden administration’s Environmental Protection Agency waiver allowing the regulation to take place.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom has since ordered the state to continue enforcing the Advanced Clean Cars II standard, an act that could violate federal law.

Federal law generally pre-empts state law. But under the Clean Air Act, California was granted the ability to set its own emissions regulations, as the air quality regulations to combat the state’s notorious and toxic smog predated the EPA.

The ruling outlines the history of the EPA waivers, which have to be granted for each California standard that is more stringent than the federal standard. They are supposed to be granted only to meet “compelling and extraordinary conditions.”

“Beginning in 2005, California also attempted to use its unique preemption exception as one means to address global climate change,” wrote Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the official court opinion. “In 2008, under the George W. Bush administration, EPA denied California’s first such request.”

“EPA explained that the Clean Air Act permits California to enact standards to address local and regional pollution where the causal factors are tied to California,” continued Kavanaugh. “But EPA reasoned that the authority granted to California did not extend to efforts to combat global climate change.”

The regulations the fuel producers are challenging were first approved by the Obama administration’s EPA in 2013 and reversed under the first Trump administration in 2019. The rules were re-approved by the Biden administration in 2022, after which the producers filed their case in the District of Columbia.

The producers argued “the regulations did not target a local California air-quality problem — as they say is required by the Clean Air Act — but instead were designed to address global climate change.”

California defended the waiver and sought to intervene, focusing on the importance of selling fewer gasoline-powered vehicles, and selling more electric vehicles. After its motion to intervene was approved, allowing California to be added as a party to the lawsuit, the state’s argument changed course. California said the producers lacked standing because “surging consumer demand” for electric vehicles meant that reversing the regulations would not result in the production of more gasoline-powered vehicles.

The D.C. Circuit sided with California, holding the producers did not have standing, leading to the appeal to the Supreme Court, and now ruling that the producers do have standing to pursue their lawsuit.

Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote separate dissenting opinions.

Sotomayor argued the Supreme Court overreached by deciding on the issue of standing, and that the court should have only ruled on the factual error regarding the fact that some of the regulations extend beyond model year 2025, and thus create redresseable issues for producers.

Sotomayor also noted that it’s likely the Trump administration will withdraw the challenged rules.

Jackson’s dissent included many of the same arguments made by Sotomayor, but focused more on the reputational damage to the court from selectively granting standing to producers, while often failing to grant standing to citizens against the government.

“If the Court privileges the interests of one class of litigants over others, even unintentionally, it can damage Americans’ faith in an impartial Judiciary and undermine the long-term credibility of its judgments,” wrote Jackson. “Time will tell if today’s decision portends a broader shift in the Court’s view of Article III standing for all litigants.

“If it does not, and if the Court is not fastidious in maintaining consistency across its certiorari decisions and substantive rulings, its decisions will come to represent, like so many marble façades, another mere facsimile of justice,” concluded Jackson.

American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, a plaintiff in the case, celebrated the ruling as the opportunity to make their case against California’s regulations in court.

“Today the Supreme Court put to rest any question about whether fuel manufacturers have a right to challenge unlawful electric vehicle mandates,” said Chet Thompson, AFPM President and CEO, in a statement to The Center Square. “We do, and we look forward to finally having our day in court.”

“Congress did not give California special authority to regulate greenhouse gases, mandate electric vehicles or ban new gas car sales — all of which the state has attempted to do through its intentional misreading of statute,” continued Thompson.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/c7/ac795dcc-7a0d-11ef-a492-fb1649f673b9/66f20abe45824.image.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 17:07:44.116214

To attract new data centers, lawmakers have also flirted with an age-old yet ineffectual solution: corporate welfare.
Shapiro’s call for expedited permitting for data centers appears to be yet another half-measure that won’t accomplish much.","Pennsylvania is on the short list of destinations for cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI). However, the commonwealth – thanks to ill-advised policies pushed by Gov. Josh Shapiro – remains ill-equipped to handle this emerging market.

Recently, the governor announced a $20 billion investment by Amazon to develop data centers statewide. Though a laudable investment, the governor’s publicity stunt highlights a glaring issue: State policies make it extremely expensive to set up shop in Pennsylvania and tap into the state’s abundant energy resources.

And the governor’s proposals to address this issue will actually make things worse.

Shapiro’s policies to reduce the amount of reliable electricity are the most concerning.

Even without the new influx of data centers, electricity costs are rising in Pennsylvania. On June 1, utility companies increased rates statewide. These companies regularly adjust rates based on market conditions.

And those conditions aren’t great for ratepayers. In this year’s first quarter, wholesale prices in Pennsylvania were up 44%.

What are driving costs? It’s simple supply-and-demand economics. Supply continues to dwindle as regulations force reliable power plants to retire prematurely and force-feed more unreliable solar and wind energy into the state’s energy portfolio.

Meanwhile, demand – driven by AI – keeps escalating.

AI guzzles electricity. A ChatGPT query devours 10 times more electricity than a conventional Google query. To satiate AI’s growing power needs, conservative estimates suggest the United States needs at least 18 gigawatts of additional grid capacity by 2030 – roughly three times the annual consumption of New York City.

Tech companies have already begun to stake claims for increased energy capacity. Case in point: Microsoft’s recent reboot of Three Mile Island. Partnering with Constellation Energy, the tech giant will commandeer the once-shuttered nuclear power plant to power its growing AI capabilities with around-the-clock energy.

And while such deals are great for Big Tech, Pennsylvania households and small businesses remain stuck with ever-increasing electricity bills. Even before the recent rate hike, new polling reveals 78% of Pennsylvanians report increased energy bills over the past two years.

Meanwhile, misguided lawmakers push policies that only exacerbate the problem. For example, Gov. Shapiro’s Lightning Plan – which includes a carbon-tax scheme and mandates more unreliable “green” energy – will add about $157 billion in statewide electricity costs by 2035, according to a new report by Always On Energy and the Commonwealth Foundation. These added costs will double household electricity bills.

So long as these ill-advised policies continue to throttle capacity and generation, the grid will remain a bottleneck to future innovation in Pennsylvania.

To attract new data centers, lawmakers have also flirted with an age-old yet ineffectual solution: corporate welfare. Despite the political appeal, government favors (i.e., tax incentives and subsidies) to attract new businesses often fail.

Pennsylvania’s Independent Fiscal Office found that the commonwealth’s tax credits netted a lousy return on investment, about 25 cents on the dollar.

Others have proven useless: The Pennsylvania Economic Development for a Growing Economy (EDGE) tax credit, which Shapiro wants to expand. has had no takers since its inception in 2022 – not a single dollar.

The best medicine is regulatory reform. Lawmakers should revise electricity regulations to account for reliability and consider all infrastructure costs associated with electricity generation. Also, energy markets need a more predictable permitting process for energy extraction and power plant construction.

Shapiro alluded to fast-tracking permitting for new data centers. Competing with neighbors like West Virginia, which recently passed a bill allowing “microgrid” districts for data centers with standalone power plants, could be beneficial. But there again, the track record of industry-specific reforms is spotty.

Nearly a year ago, Pennsylvania passed the Streamlining Permits for Economic Expansion and Development (SPEED) program to create an expedited permit review and approval process associated with energy production. Today, SPEED remains under development. Shapiro’s call for expedited permitting for data centers appears to be yet another half-measure that won’t accomplish much.

Pennsylvania can’t afford to stop with just one industry. Regulatory reform must be comprehensive and universal, freeing up all economic sectors from onerous red tape.

Pennsylvania, with more than 160,000 individual regulations and restrictions throttling genuine economic development, is one of the most-regulated states. Research suggests a 36% cut in regulations would yield 1% growth in Pennsylvania’s GDP, according to a report coauthored by the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Commonwealth Foundation.

Before Pennsylvania’s Wyoming Valley can become the next Silicon Valley, the commonwealth must rethink its strategy. Lawmakers must cut red tape, not blank checks to big corporations. Moreover, they must unleash affordable energy, not shackle it with climate-alarmist policies. Without genuine regulatory and energy reform, the commonwealth won’t be able to power the future and will be left in the dark.

June 16 – Tax and spending plans in President Trump’s ‘One Big Beautiful” bill passed by the House of Representatives on May 22 would hobble the nascent U.S. green hydrogen industry in the United States by removing crucial tax credits earlier than previously planned.

Introduced in the Biden administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, base 45V production tax credits (PTCs) of up to $3/kg are offered depending on emissions. The credits are available for ‘green’ hydrogen projects, which use electrolyzers powered by renewable energy, and ‘blue’ hydrogen projects using steam methane reformation coupled with carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS).

Trump’s tax bill would bring forward the deadline for projects to qualify for the 45V credits, requiring them to begin construction by January 1, 2026 compared with the previous deadline of January 1, 2033 set out by the Biden administration. A revised bill released by the Senate Finance Committee on June 16 retained the changes.

Final guidance on how to qualify for the credits was only published by the U.S. Treasury Department in January 2025 and is complex, requiring projects to source clean power from either nuclear plants “at risk of retirement” or new renewable energy projects, to minimize the impact on wider electricity supply.

Many projects “will not be able to meet the end of 2025 deadline” set out in the proposed tax bill, Lee Beck, Senior Vice President for global policy and commercial strategy at green fuel developer HIF Global, told Reuters Events.

Beck, said:

It takes four to six years to develop large infrastructure projects,

“Having just a few months to make the required project changes, commence construction, and reach financial close is unrealistic in infrastructure timeframes.”

In one example, HIF Global requires until the end of 2027 to begin construction of a green hydrogen plant in Matagorda County, Texas, Beck said. The project will require $7 billion of investment and the company has already spent more than $200 million developing the plant, which would produce 1.4 million tons/year of e-methanol using hydrogen and captured CO2 to supply the automotive, shipping and aviation sectors.

The shortened deadline for the 45V credits Beck, said:

would pull the rug out from under the whole industry,

Many investors would pivot to other regions. HIF Global has plans to develop projects around the world and “will allocate capital to the places that are most competitive,” Beck said.

Economic impact

Approved by a single vote majority in the House of Representatives, the tax bill is currently with the Senate and changes may yet be made. Many Republican states have benefited from the tax credits while some Republicans fear the bill will inflate the federal deficit.

Dozens of stakeholders including the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the FCHEA sent a joint letter to Senate majority leader John Thune and Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance Mike Crapo on June 5, calling for the retention of the 45V credits for projects that start construction by December 31, 2029.

The early withdrawal of 45V tax credits would “send yet another destabilising signal to the market—stranding investment and halting project development,” FCHEA President and CEO Frank Wolak told Reuters Events.

Eliminating the credits early would impact American job creation and industrial competitiveness, Wolak said.

He, said:

Walking away from the 45V credit would cede our competitive edge to China and Europe, where governments are aggressively supporting their hydrogen industries,

Demand challenge

Current hydrogen production is mostly ‘grey’ hydrogen produced from gas using steam methane reformation processes.

The cost of green hydrogen is currently far higher than the cost of grey hydrogen and the 45V tax credits were introduced to help clean hydrogen developers move from pilot projects to larger commercial facilities and drive down costs. The Biden administration aimed to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen to $1/kg by 2031, compared with around $5/kg in 2022.

,EPA,2025-06-21 12:20:11+00:00,CNN,Supreme Court lets fuel companies sue over California's tough emission standards - CNN,John Fritze,,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/20/politics/california-emissions-standards-supreme-court,"The Supreme Court on Friday revived a lawsuit from fuel producers challenging California’s strict vehicle emission rules, allowing the companies to fight an on-again, off-again climate policy that President Donald Trump has previously opposed.
While the federal government generally sets vehicle emission standards, the Environmental Protection Agency has at times granted a waiver to California – because of its longstanding air-quality problems – to set tougher standards.
Although the fuel producers challenged the waiver itself, the Supreme Court specifically declined to review that question, denying an appeal in December that raised that issue.
Instead, the only issue before the justices was whether the companies and trade associations had standing to sue.
The conservative Supreme Court has repeatedly sided against the EPA and environmental groups in past cases.","The Supreme Court on Friday revived a lawsuit from fuel producers challenging California’s strict vehicle emission rules, allowing the companies to fight an on-again, off-again climate policy that President Donald Trump has previously opposed.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the opinion for a 7-2 majority. Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.

“The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,” Kavanaugh wrote.

While the federal government generally sets vehicle emission standards, the Environmental Protection Agency has at times granted a waiver to California – because of its longstanding air-quality problems – to set tougher standards. Given the state’s size, automakers have long hewed to its tighter emissions controls even for cars sold in other states.

That waiver was challenged by Diamond Alternative Energy, a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation, and several other companies and groups that advocate on behalf of fuel manufacturers.

Although the fuel producers challenged the waiver itself, the Supreme Court specifically declined to review that question, denying an appeal in December that raised that issue. Instead, the only issue before the justices was whether the companies and trade associations had standing to sue.

A federal appeals court in Washington, DC, concluded that market forces are driving the national push toward electric vehicles far more than California’s tough regulations. Given that, the court ruled that the fuel makers could not proceed with the case.

One of the factors a party must demonstrate to establish standing is redressability, which essentially means that the court’s order can actually fix the problem the plaintiffs have raised. California said that even if courts eliminate the waiver, it wouldn’t help the fuel producers because consumer demand was motivating people to buy electric vehicles on their own.

During oral arguments, both conservative and liberal justices seemed to be skeptical of that position, noting that the EPA had pointed to a reduced reliance on fossil fuels as part of the justification for the waiver.

Perhaps sensing a win in their case, the fuel producers advocated for a categorical rule that would have made it easier for companies challenging the federal government to sue over similar decisions in the future.

It’s not clear how much practical impact the court’s decision will have. Trump seems almost certain to withdraw the waiver, just as he did during his first administration. The waiver was later reinstated by President Joe Biden.

That is a point that Jackson zeroed in on in her dissent.

“President Trump rescinded this exact same waiver the last time he was in office,” Jackson wrote. “Because a withdrawal of the waiver would moot this case, an obvious question arises: Why would this court rush to opine on whether the fuel industry’s legal challenge” can proceed “when all involved – including petitioners themselves – believe that any such ‘case’ or ‘controversy’ will soon vanish?”

Jackson said she worried that allowing the fuel producers to sue now would make it easier for other groups to challenge the Clean Air Act in the future.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, said he was disappointed in the decision but will continue fighting the case.

“Congress intended for California to be able to regulate emissions from new vehicles sold in our state, and we remain firmly committed to advancing and implementing strong standards that safeguard public health and reduce climate pollution,” he said.

The conservative Supreme Court has repeatedly sided against the EPA and environmental groups in past cases. Last year, the court upended a Biden administration effort to reduce smog and air pollution wafting across state lines. In 2023, the justices cut back on the EPA’s ability to regulate wetlands under the Clean Water Act.

Indeed, in 2024 alone, 95% of new capacity to the American electricity grid came from clean energy.

Rather than hurting the business of crucial American companies like Tandem PV, Republicans should champion clean energy because it aligns with core conservative principles.
Let’s keep our clean energy tax credits—for America’s families, businesses, and future.","Last month, the Republican-led House of Representatives passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, a comprehensive budget reconciliation bill that aims to lengthen major provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed during President Donald Trump’s first presidency, currently set to expire by the end of this year. Earlier this week, the Republican-led Senate Finance Committee introduced its version of the bill. Among several provisions intending to reduce the federal government’s deficit, the bill would majorly scale back clean energy tax credits instituted by the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022.

In doing so, the OBBBA would terminate the IRA’s Domestic Content Bonus Credit, which provides an additional 10% refund for clean energy projects that use American-made technology. Over the last three years, this IRA tax credit has boosted American manufacturing, created thousands of jobs here in the United States, and strengthened our domestic energy supply chain.

As our Senators from both sides of the aisle consider the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, those who believe in American economic growth and individual liberty should champion reversing course from the bill introduced by the Senate Finance Committee and keeping the IRA’s clean energy tax credits. The Domestic Content Bonus Credit in particular advances Republican values while enhancing America’s standing in the international energy market. This America-first, market-based policy generates American economic competition and innovation, while giving middle-class homeowners greater choice over their energy systems.

Rather than hurting the business of crucial American companies like Tandem PV, Republicans should champion clean energy because it aligns with core conservative principles.

Most new energy contributing to the American electricity grid is clean—including solar and wind—because of how cheap, fast, and naturally abundant these sources are. Indeed, in 2024 alone, 95% of new capacity to the American electricity grid came from clean energy. Because of this reality, the OBBBA’s impacts on federal clean energy incentives would reduce overall energy additions to the American electricity grid by about half by 2035, undermining American energy growth.

Meanwhile, China continues to maintain a near monopoly over solar energy technology, possessing an over 80% share of the international marketplace and currently on a growth trajectory. In 2023 alone, China installed more solar panels than America has over the course of its history and saw its solar panel exports increase by 38%. How did China come to lead the global solar energy technology market? In part, through government subsidies, including cheaper land for solar panel factories and low-interest loans to solar panel companies to expand these critical, nascent industries and spur their success. It is clear from a comparative perspective that the Domestic Content Bonus Credit is essential to strengthening American global energy leadership: In a market that China dominates, this tax credit helps American solar energy technology manufacturers compete.

I spoke to Scott Wharton, CEO of Tandem PV, an American solar energy technology company focusing on groundbreaking tandem perovskite solar panels, about 30% more efficient and powerful than the typical solar panel. With a perovskite layer 200 times thinner than silicon, the production of tandem perovskite solar panels requires only 10% of the energy needed to make conventional panels—a true testimony to American ingenuity. While in 2022 about 88% of U.S. solar panel shipments industry-wide were imports, primarily from Asia, Tandem PV announced plans in 2025 to construct a commercial-scale tandem perovskite solar panel manufacturing facility in the United States. Scott’s plans will increase American energy independence, growth, and innovation, enabling us to harness the abundant power of the Sun to power our future prosperity.

Scott said that Congress’s intention to scrap the Inflation Reduction Act clean energy tax credits would hurt his business, as American-made tandem perovskite solar energy technology would become less financially attractive to investors looking to support new capacity to the electrical grid. Given that the U.S. has developed the most advanced tandem perovskite technology globally, the current version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would adversely impact innovation, jobs, and growth in an emerging American industry. Moreover, Scott emphasized that the bill would undermine individual homeowners’ choice and liberty over their energy systems, as it would reduce their ability to own their energy production and increase their reliance on the greater energy grid.

It’s easy to get caught up in a game of partisan politics that puts emotional loyalty to party over rational best of interest of our country. When we really look underneath the surface, it’s clear that saving the Inflation Reduction Act clean energy tax credits, including the Domestic Content Bonus Credit, would advance Republicans’ own goals: long-term American economic and energy growth and international competitiveness through market-based solutions that promote innovation, create American jobs, and increase individual liberty. Rather than hurting the business of crucial American companies like Tandem PV, Republicans should champion clean energy because it aligns with core conservative principles.

The United States continued to produce more energy than it consumed in 2024. This surplus energy production helped energy exports grow to a record high 30.9 quadrillion British thermal units (quads) in 2024, up 4% from 2023. Energy imports stayed flat at 21.7 quads in 2024, meaning the United States exported 9.3 quads more energy than it imported, the highest net exports in our records, which date back to 1949.

Energy consumption in the United States totaled 94.2 quads in 2024, remaining below the peak of 99.0 quads set in 2007. Petroleum remained the largest source of primary energy consumption in the United States in 2024, totaling 35.3 quads, about the same as in the three previous years. Natural gas consumption reached an all-time high in 2024 at 34.2 quads, driven by growth in natural gas used for electricity generation.

Renewable energy consumption increased by 5% to hit a new record of 8.6 quads in 2024, largely due to growth in biofuels, wind, and solar. Nuclear energy consumption remained flat at 8.2 quads. Coal consumption fell to 7.9 quads, the least in our records dating back to 1949.

Primary energy production in the United States increased to a record 103.3 quads in 2024, the third consecutive year that production has surpassed a previous record. Natural gas, crude oil, natural gas plant liquids, wind, biofuels, and solar all reached or tied record production in 2024.

U.S. exports of petroleum products, crude oil, and natural gas each reached records in 2024. Petroleum product exports totaled 11.5 quads and accounted for 37% of total U.S. exports across all energy sources. Crude oil exports totaled 8.6 quads, making up 28% of the total. Natural gas exports grew to 7.8 quads, driven by continued growth in liquefied natural gas exports. Coal exports totaled 2.6 quads and have increased every year since 2020. Other energy sources such as biomass, electricity, and coal coke combined accounted for 1% of exports.

Crude oil has been the largest source of U.S. energy imports every year on record since 1973, accounting for 67% of energy imports in 2024. Crude oil is often imported and then refined into other petroleum products such as motor gasoline, distillate fuel oil, or jet fuel and then exported as petroleum products.

The study, led by founder Vrushabhraj Tanawade, introduces a bio-integrated insulation method using thermophilic and mesophilic microbial consortia to regulate heat inside battery modules. The results are striking: up to a 22% reduction in internal temperature and a 30% improvement in carbon lifecycle efficiency.

“This innovation is about biology meeting infrastructure,” says Tanawade. “We’ve discovered how nature’s mechanisms can dramatically extend the life of our clean energy systems.”

Unlike conventional synthetic cooling solutions, MountBay’s microbial approach is circular, biodegradable, and scalable—opening up new frontiers for climate resilience and fire-risk reduction in hot environments.

The research aligns perfectly with MountBay’s mission to power the AI economy through clean, sustainable, and advanced infrastructure. It also positions the company as a frontrunner in biological material integration across the energy sector.

Additionally, MountBay has released a preliminary transformative feasibility report for a Lunar Solar Belt—a continuous solar array on the Moon that can beam uninterrupted, clean energy back to Earth.

The report outlines how in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), autonomous lunar robotics, and microwave power transmission could enable the construction of a moon-based solar plant by the 2030s. With an energy return on investment (EROI) of 8:1, the system offers a scalable, emission-free solution to humanity’s growing power demands.

“This is not just an energy project—it’s a civilization-scale investment in global stability,” said Tanawade. “We believe the Moon should be a cooperative utility, not a geopolitical race.”

MountBay is also proposing a new diplomatic framework—The Earth-Moon Energy Accord (EMEA)—to ensure equitable access, safety, and international cooperation.

The concept directly supports MountBay’s mission: to push the frontiers of clean power while securing energy independence for AI-driven economies.

Tanawade is rallying governments, institutions, and innovators to join him. “It’s time for America to lead the most ambitious energy project in human history,” he said.

“Trelleborg is at the forefront of EV sealing technology, developing solutions from the ground up rather than relying on technology derived from the combustion engine era,” Gay said. “With CellXProTM, developed from our advanced battery testing and R&D regime, we are ideally equipped to advise customers on material selection.”

CellXPro sealing materials include ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM), fluoropolymer (FKM), and perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) compounds. These are tailored along with various specialist formulations to meet demanding battery cell requirements.

Advanced sealing extends battery performance

A critical factor for battery efficiency and longevity is the quality of cell components, especially the seals within the cell housing. These components must withstand high operational demands and maintain excellent chemical compatibility. Chemical interactions between sealing materials and electrolytes can degrade the chemical makeup and shorten battery life.

Understanding the chemical interplay between electrolytes, seals, metal terminals, and other cell elements is key to optimizing cell performance. Trelleborg supports battery manufacturers with expert material specification and testing focused on EV battery sealing solutions.

“Leveraging our experience, we launched the CellXProTM portfolio,” Gay added. “The range positions Trelleborg as the sealing partner of choice for battery manufacturers. It enables them to select the right materials with confidence.

“Trelleborg has a multi-decade history of working successfully with all the major automotive manufacturers. Customers benefit from our global manufacturing footprint and unsurpassed R&D. But they also have access to local supply options and global flexibility for a robust supply chain, an important asset in times of geopolitical uncertainty.”

Recently we have read about devastation from wildfires and strong storms. Climate scientists say we will see more of this as a result of climate change.

To reduce air pollution that causes climate change we must reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

Senator Lindsey Graham said, “CO2 emissions generated by man is creating our greenhouse gas effect that traps heat, and the planet is warming.”

Our government needs to do much more to promote clean energy, such as wind, solar, and geothermal, and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. This includes maintaining tax credits for clean energy — not reducing them.

I encourage readers to email their U.S. Senators and Representative. Joining Citizens’ Climate Lobby and similar groups is another great way to fight climate change.

Make earth great again. There is no planet B.

When our grandchildren ask what we did about climate change, let’s have an answer.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.
The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill.
The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.","WASHINGTON — (AP) — House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.

Republicans in the two chambers don't agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.

The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.

While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.

Here’s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:

The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.

The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump's second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.

Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.

The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.

The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that’s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.

The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.

The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.

And on Social Security, the bills don't directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That's a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

“This needs a lot of work. It’s really concerning and I’m really surprised by it,” he said. “Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.”

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden's climate law. It aimed to boost the nation's transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn't include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

A state that, by comparison, should be in the same category of success as West Virginia.
On the policymaking side, we see more divisions between West Virginia and North Carolina.
Much like West Virginia, North Carolina’s legislature hosts a (near) veto-proof Republican majority.
Griffin Bradley is a lifelong Wood County resident, graduate of West Virginia University, and a contributing author for Mid-Ohio Valley Climate Action.","As a lifelong West Virginian, I have a soft spot for seeing my state succeed. With all of its grit, tenacity and work ethic, there’s no reason that West Virginia shouldn’t be a national leader in many respects. But yet, we see our state struggle to keep up as new opportunities arise, trading in progress for the same old, worn out tagline. We all know the jingle. “Coal is West Virginia,” right?

Over the last four years, America has been at an important moment for innovation and expansion of the clean energy economy. For all its supposed faults, the Inflation Reduction Act produced thousands of jobs, billions of dollars of economic value, and spurred industrial innovations at a rate rarely seen since the Industrial Revolution. But for those of us who call the Mountain State home, we have not reaped much of those benefits. Rather, we’ve seen business after business make their home in other states. States that, frankly, share many characteristics with West Virginia.

So then what gives? Despite the opportunities, West Virginia flounders. In order to get a better understanding of exactly why West Virginia fails to meet the moment, let’s compare to a similar state. Join me as we take a quick trip down I-77 to the Tar Heel State of North Carolina. A state that, by comparison, should be in the same category of success as West Virginia. Nestled in the shadow of the Appalachian Mountains, both states have strong blue-collar roots and a favorable cost-of-living, yet one outdoes the other by leaps and bounds. Why?

Let’s break it down a bit further.

North Carolina has been named in the top 2 of CNBC’s annual “Best States For Business” reports for the last four years, continually trading the #1 and #2 spot with another of West Virginia’s neighbors, Virginia. North Carolina’s spot as a top state for business development is due in no small part to its early support for clean energy growth. Not only does North Carolina benefit from its nearly 110,000-strong clean energy workforce, but it also sees new businesses that manufacture clean energy technologies pouring into the state on what feels like a monthly basis. Not to mention the traditional businesses that have increased their existing footprint in the state due to their supportive clean energy environment.

On the policymaking side, we see more divisions between West Virginia and North Carolina. Much like West Virginia, North Carolina’s legislature hosts a (near) veto-proof Republican majority. The only difference between the two is the latter’s executive branch has been controlled by a Democrat in recent years, with former Gov. Roy Cooper and current Gov. Josh Stein. Despite the many ideological differences of North Carolina’s legislative and executive branches, the legislature and governor(s) have come together in many instances to support policy that creates a conducive environment for the clean energy economy to flourish. As such, North Carolina has been a leader in nearly every sense of the word.

Now, back in West Virginia, we can better outline where we have failed. In terms of clean energy jobs, well, it’s safe to say we are dwarfed by much of the United States with only around 10,000 dedicated jobs. This is all while the supposed backbone of our economy and culture, old “King Coal,” continues to see dwindling jobs numbers and overall economic value amid a volatile international coal market.

Despite the writing being on the wall for most forward-thinking, commonsense folks, we see little policy coming out of Charleston that would suggest West Virginia is headed toward an economic renaissance anytime soon. And to be fair, why would we? In a state where there are presumably more janitors wandering the halls of the Capitol than elected Democrats and a super-duper Republican majority that has long looked at the prospects of the coal industry through rose colored glasses, it’s no surprise that West Virginia hasn’t seen the same success as our neighbors when it comes to the national clean energy boom.

Now more than ever, West Virginians should be angry. Angry that we aren’t a national trendsetter. Angry that our leaders didn’t grasp the enormous opportunity that is now in the rearview mirror. Angry that we are being left in the dust by very comparable states. If economic mediocrity and complacency from leadership is what you want, look no further. As for me, I find inspiration in our neighbors’ successes. I wish those in Charleston did, too.

With dominance in solar panels, wind turbines, and EV batteries, China is positioning itself as the indispensable partner for decarbonization—regardless of trade barriers. This article explores strategic investment opportunities in sectors poised to capitalize on this dynamic, emphasizing urgency driven by policy tailwinds and supply chain leverage.

Solar Manufacturing: China's Unassailable Lead

China's solar industry commands 75% of global manufacturing capacity, with polysilicon production concentrated in Xinjiang (40% of global output). Key players like TW-Solar and JA Solar dominate polysilicon-to-module production, leveraging cost advantages (10-35% lower than rivals) and vertical integration.

Investment angle:

- Polysilicon producers: Companies like GCL-Poly Energy (03800.HK) benefit from rising demand and concentrated supply.

- Module manufacturers: Tongwei Solar (TW-Solar) and LONGi Green Energy are scaling to meet 1.8 TW of global solar capacity by 2025.

-

Wind Power: From Local Dominance to Global Expansion

Chinese wind OEMs like Goldwind and Envision now hold 60% of global wind installations, with Goldwind alone installing 20 GW in 2024. Their advantage lies in technological innovation (e.g., 5.5 MW turbines, medium-speed drivetrains) and cost leadership.

Investment angle:

- Offshore wind: Mingyang Smart Energy leads in 10+ MW turbines, targeting Asia-Pacific and Europe.

- Supply chain plays: Companies like Sinovel Wind Group benefit from rising rotor demand (58% of turbines now exceed 180m rotor diameter).

EV Batteries: CATL and BYD's Unmatched Scale

China's CATL and BYD control 55% of global EV battery production, leveraging lithium iron phosphate (LFP) dominance (66% of China's EV market) and cost leadership. Despite U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) subsidies, U.S. manufacturers still rely on Chinese expertise: Ford's Michigan plant partners with CATL, while Honda-LG's Ohio venture faces supply chain bottlenecks.

Investment angle:

- CATL (300750.SZ): Its 38% global market share in 2025 and partnerships with automakers make it a cornerstone for EV supply chains.

- BYD (002594.SZ): Battery sales to Tesla and European OEMs highlight its global reach.

-

U.S. Climate Retreat: A Tailwind for Chinese Firms

The IRA's localization requirements have backfired, driving U.S. firms to collaborate with Chinese partners (e.g., Ford-CATL) rather than decouple. Meanwhile, China's control over critical minerals (100% of spherical graphite, 69% of lithium processing) ensures its grip on supply chains.

Geopolitical leverage:

- China's dominance in polysilicon, graphite, and cobalt processing creates monopoly rents, enabling price hikes.

-

Investment Priorities: Where to Deploy Capital Now

Solar and Wind Supply Chains:

Invest in polysilicon and turbine component manufacturers (e.g., JinkoSolar (JKS) for modules, United Wind Force for blades).

Batteries and Critical Minerals:

CATL and BYD remain core holdings.

Mineral plays: Ganfeng Lithium (01772.HK) and Sinomine Resources for lithium and rare earths.

Technology Leaders:

Envision Energy (battery management systems) and Tongwei Solar (cell efficiency innovations).

Geopolitical Arbitrage:

Export-oriented firms like Goldwind targeting Africa and South America.

The Clock Is Ticking

China's clean energy dominance is a self-reinforcing cycle: scale drives cost advantages, which attract global demand, further entrenching market share. With U.S. policies failing to dislodge this structure, investors ignoring Chinese exposure risk missing the energy transition's biggest winners.

Act now: Allocate to China's clean energy leaders before geopolitical tensions force irrational sell-offs. The energy transition is here—and its backbone is Made in China.

The nonprofit Wilderness Society released an analysis and interactive map, showing that even more land could be impacted than originally anticipated. In updated text of the bill obtained by the Wilderness Society on June 14, land with grazing permits would be included as eligible for sale. Around 250 million acres of land would be eligible for sale across eleven Western states, including Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming.

Republicans in the Senate say the sales would be for affordable housing, though nothing in the bill mandates that the sale be for housing, let alone affordable housing. The bill outlines criteria for lands that should be prioritized for sale, but none of those guidelines are mandatory for a sale to take place. It mandates that between 2 and 3 million acres of U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands are sold. National parks, national monuments, wilderness areas, and national recreation areas would be excluded from any sale.

From the bill’s introduction on June 11, the criticism has been swift and plentiful.

Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) called it “shameful.”

“It is a five-alarm fire for hunters here in Colorado, for fishermen, for conservationists, for recreationists, and for every Coloradan folks who enjoy these lands and who are committed to preserving them for future generations,” he said.

Neguse credited bipartisan cooperation between Democrats and Republicans like Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.) and Jeff Hurd (R-Colo.) for the defeat of a smaller lands sale provision in the House version of the budget bill. In that proposal, several hundreds of thousands of acres would have been sold in Nevada and Utah, but it was axed from the megabill at the last minute.

Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said that once these lands are sold, it’s nearly impossible to get them back.

“It's an important part of our obligation as elected officials in our state and in the West to protect the work that our parents and grandparents did for us, much less the legacy that our kids and grandkids are gonna want to embrace,” he said.

148 environmental advocacy groups signed a letter to the Senate, calling on the language outlining the sale of public lands to be struck from the budget bill.

“Selling off public lands is short-sighted, self-serving and irreversible,” the letter reads. “These lands belong to all Americans. Once they’re sold, they’re gone for good — fences go up, access disappears and they are lost to the public forever. Westerners and people across the country overwhelmingly support the protection of public lands and have consistently rejected attempts to sell them off. Time and again, the public has made it clear: our forests, desert lands and open spaces are not and should not be for sale.”

Conservative responses to public land sales

This larger Senate version of the land sale has drawn criticism from both sides of the aisle, including from the conservative American Conservation Coalition, whose founder called it “an anti-American action.”

Isaiah Menning, the ACC’s external affairs director, said there were a few different reasons conservatives weren’t happy with the bill.

“Our concern with the provision in this bill, is that it sets an arbitrary limit or mandate on how much land ought to be sold, and we’re concerned that land could be sold and impair some of the benefits that we get from federal land,” he said. “Our ideal scenario is that broadly, we don’t do mass land sales, but we’d rather equip local communities to help us steward those lands for the benefit of the entire nation.”

“Those benefits are primarily around hunting access, hiking access, recreational access, and then also the great ecosystem benefits that we can get from that land,” he said. “American biodiversity and the wildlife we have, especially big game, is a major part of the American heritage, and we should conserve our sublime landscapes that we have in the West. Theodore Roosevelt identified this.”

Menning said public lands with grazing permits was another aspect that was especially concerning for the ACC.

“Now there are ranching families who, for generations, have been stewarding these lands,” he said. “The grazing allotments are transferable and usually attached to a certain piece of property, and so it’s really quite important to many of these families. Including these kinds of land in a sale is a point of concern for us, because these… ranchers have been so important in stewarding these landscapes. So we’d like to see those kinds of voices be more involved in the stewardship of federal lands, ultimately for the benefit of all Americans.”

He also said that though one of the stated goals of the bill is to reduce the federal deficit, this could actually hurt the government’s ability to make money off of federal public lands, and identified economic prosperity and energy abundance as conservative values.

“You could also see sales of lands that are really useful for mineral development or energy development that are really beneficial for the American public,” he said. “That could hamper our ability to use those resources, and… also hamper the ability of the federal government to gain revenue from those resources.”

Montana is the only Western state excluded from the proposal. Montana Republicans have previously been opposed to the sale of federal public lands, which could potentially hamper Republicans’ ability to guide any budget across the finish line. Both chambers of Congress are closely divided.

In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Zinke said he was still against the sale of public lands.

Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who chairs the Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee, has not responded to requests for comment, but has been actively posting in defense of the public lands sale on X.

Lee posted repeatedly on both his official Senate account and his personal account @BasedMikeLee in defense of the proposal.

Lee also went on conservative talk show host Glenn Beck’s radio show on June 19 to defend the proposal.

“This is not the crown jewel land,” he said. “This is garden-variety land that's just sitting there vacant where people can, do, and should live.”

During his approximately 12 minutes on the show, Lee also said that there would be further limitations on what land would be eligible for sale.

“(We’re) working on changes to further limit eligible lands, to those Forest Service-owned lands within two miles of a population center, and lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management within five miles of a population center,” he told Beck. “So this deals with land that is only in or near a place where people live, and it doesn't authorize the sale, it authorizes a process.”

Lee’s office has not responded to requests for that information, nor when those updated limitations would be released.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/528b19c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5184x2722+0+367/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa3%2F7e%2Fa2fcc5da427f866c7dff926d9195%2Fimg-0554.JPG,N,,2025-06-21 13:09:30.901453

The EPA’s rapid deployment was crucial from day one.

Under the Trump administration’s second term, the EPA is confronted with budget cuts of up to 55% and massive layoffs that will impact research, enforcement and emergency response.

Environmental disasters can strike anywhere, and the stakes are deadly serious. So a well-funded and well-equipped Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) isn’t just a policy nicety—it’s a lifeline for the health, safety and well-being of every single Ohioan, every single American. We can’t afford to be unprepared.

I learned this firsthand. On a frigid Friday night in February 2023, my hometown of East Palestine became the epicenter of a national crisis when a Norfolk Southern train derailed, becoming engulfed in flames and ultimately releasing a cocktail of toxic substances, including 1.1 million pounds of vinyl chloride. This chemical is a known carcinogen linked to brain, liver, lung and blood cancer, among others.

Emergency responders, including those from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), swiftly mobilized to assess and mitigate the damage. While its response was not perfect, the EPA’s rapid deployment was crucial from day one, with many personnel spending more time stationed in East Palestine during the first year of cleanup than with their own families.

The EPA helped guarantee that Norfolk Southern was accountable for its actions, ensuring the polluter followed federal remediation regulations. The agency directed extensive clean-up efforts, removing over 224,000 tons of contaminated soil and 74 million gallons of wastewater, and collecting over 115 million air monitoring data points.

The agency also leveraged every enforcement tool available under its purview, with the Justice Department and EPA reaching a $310 million settlement with Norfolk Southern, including $25 million for a 20-year community health program to monitor and provide services for affected individuals. Several experienced immediate symptoms such as headaches, nosebleeds, skin rashes and breathing problems, and others are now identifying long-term ailments like asthma, PTSD and cancers.

The EPA also coordinated with federal, state and local partners to help restore my community, shared information on its dedicated webpage, organized a cross-functional community group that provided regular updates, and served more than 1,200 visitors at its Community Welcome Center.

The East Palestine incident underscores the broader role of the EPA in managing environmental and human health disasters, from hurricanes and floods to chemical spills and oil leaks. In 2022, the EPA supported local response efforts after 20 major storms, demonstrating its commitment to disaster management across the country. With petrochemical incidents occurring every three days, the agency responds to an average of 1,000 chemical spills annually. Since the 1970s, the EPA has been involved in more than 50,000 oil spill cleanups, playing a critical role in protecting waterways and ecosystems from long-term damage.

These statistics paint a picture of an agency consistently on the front lines, providing essential expertise and resources.

The increasing frequency and complexity of these disasters pose significant challenges. Yet under the Trump administration’s second term, the EPA is confronted with budget cuts of up to 55% and massive layoffs that will impact research, enforcement and emergency response. Funding cuts will severely hamper the agency’s ability to respond to crises, maintain its regulatory oversight and support local communities in their recovery efforts.

Effective disaster response needs rapid action and robust funding to address modern environmental crises. Adequate funding ensures rapid mobilization of teams, equipment and expertise, reducing immediate health and environmental risks.

Tight budgets, however, compromise advanced monitoring, assessments and enforcement, leading to delayed and inadequate responses with dire consequences.

Stable funding is also vital for post-disaster community health. The emotional and psychological toll on families is immense, and full funding allows the EPA to provide essential support, ensuring access to clean water, air, and recovery resources. It also enables ongoing research, improving response strategies and preparing the agency for future challenges, making the agency more effective.

The United States spares no expense in defending its citizens from external threats. We should apply the same level of commitment to defending against domestic tragedies like the toxic chemical spills in East Palestine and other environmental disasters.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill.
The Senate bill doesn’t include such a provision.
The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.","WASHINGTON (AP) — House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.

Republicans in the two chambers don’t agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.

The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.

While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.

Here’s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:

Tax break for families

The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.

The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump’s second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.

Trump campaign promises

Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.

The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.

The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that’s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.

The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.

The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.

And on Social Security, the bills don’t directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

More SALT

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That’s a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

Medicaid providers

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

“This needs a lot of work. It’s really concerning and I’m really surprised by it,” he said. “Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.”

Tax breaks for business

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Clean energy tax credits

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden’s climate law. It aimed to boost the nation’s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

Odds and ends

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn’t include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

Fairfield County is home to the top two towns for EV ownership — Weston and Westport — with 10.1% and 10.4% percent of registered vehicles classified as EVs.

Teslas account for 35.4% of all EVs registered in Connecticut as of Dec. 31, 2024, according to EV Connecticut. Other manufacturers don’t even come close; Toyota takes second but accounts for only 9.5% of all registered EVs statewide.

As the state continues to encourage residents in the market for a car to buy electric, President Donald Trump’s proposed spending bill could cut federal EV tax credits completely. The bill proposes annual federal registration fees on electric and hybrid vehicles to go towards highway and road maintenance.

The state offers credit on qualifying EVs under the Connecticut Hydrogen and Electric Automobile Purchase Rebate, falling somewhere between $750 to $1,500, depending on the type of vehicle. This program is part of the state’s commitment to clean air goals, and for “creating cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable communities,” according to the EV Connecticut dashboard.

And to make EV purchases more equitable, the state offers an additional credit program called Rebate+. Qualification for the program is determined by either income level, participation in federal assistance programs or location of residence.

So with Rebate+ and CHEAPR, those in the market for an EV who qualify can receive up to $4,500 from the state.

The cheapest model from Tesla, the most popular EV manufacturer in both the state and the nation, costs over $40,000.

Electricity prices are rising quickly for U.S. households, even as overall inflation has cooled.

Electricity prices rose 4.5% in the past year, according to the consumer price index for May 2025 — nearly double the inflation rate for all goods and services.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated in May that retail electricity prices would outpace inflation through 2026. Prices have already risen faster than the broad inflation rate since 2022, it said.

""It's a pretty simple story: It's a story of supply and demand,"" said David Hill, executive vice president of energy at the Bipartisan Policy Center and former general counsel at the U.S. Energy Department.

There are many contributing factors, economists and energy experts said.

At a high level, the growth in electricity demand and deactivation of power-generating facilities are outstripping the pace at which new electricity generation is being added to the electric grid, Hill said.

Prices are regional

U.S. consumers spent an average of about $1,760 on electricity in 2023, according to the EIA, which cited federal data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Of course, cost can vary widely based on where consumers live and their electricity consumption. The average U.S. household paid about 17 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity in March 2025 — but ranged from a low of about 11 cents per kWh in North Dakota to about 41 cents per kWh in Hawaii, according to EIA data.

Households in certain geographies will see their electric bills rise faster than those in others, experts said.

Residential electricity prices in the Pacific, Middle Atlantic and New England regions — areas where consumers already pay much more per kilowatt-hour for electricity — could increase more than the national average, according to the EIA.

""Electricity prices are regionally determined, not globally determined like oil prices,"" said Joe Seydl, a senior markets economist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.

The EIA expects average retail electricity prices to increase 13% from 2022 through 2025.

That means the average household's annual electricity bill could rise about $219 in 2025 relative to 2022, to about $1,902 from $1,683, according to a CNBC analysis of federal data. That assumes their usage is unchanged.

But prices for Pacific area households will rise 26% over that period, to more than 21 cents per kilowatt-hour, EIA estimates. Meanwhile, households in the West North Central region will see prices increase 8% in that period, to almost 11 cents per kWh.

However, certain electricity trends are happening nationwide, not just regionally, experts said.

Data centers are 'energy hungry'

Elijah Nouvelage | Bloomberg | Getty Images

Electricity demand growth was ""minimal"" in recent decades due to increases in energy efficiency, according to Jennifer Curran, senior vice president of planning and operations at Midcontinent Independent System Operator, who testified at a House energy hearing in March. (MISO, a regional electric-grid operator, serves 45 million people across 15 states.)

Meanwhile, U.S. ""electrification"" swelled via use of electronic devices, smart-home products and electric vehicles, Curran said.

Now, demand is poised to surge in coming years, and data centers are a major contributor, experts said.

Data centers are vast warehouses of computer servers and other IT equipment that power cloud computing, artificial intelligence and other tech applications.

Data center electricity use tripled to 176 Terawatt-hours in the decade through 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Department. Use is projected to double or triple by 2028, the agency said.

Data centers are expected to consume up to 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023, the Energy Department said.

They're ""energy hungry,"" Curran said. Demand growth has been ""unexpected"" and largely due to support for artificial intelligence, she said.

The U.S. economy is set to consume more electricity in 2030 for processing data than for manufacturing all energy-intensive goods combined, including aluminum, steel, cement and chemicals, according to the International Energy Agency.

Continued electrification among businesses and households is expected to raise electricity demand, too, experts said.

The U.S. has moved away from fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas to reduce planet-warming greenhouse-gas emissions.

For example, more households may use electric vehicles rather than gasoline-powered cars or electric heat pumps versus a gas furnace — which are more efficient technologies but raise overall demand on the electric grid, experts said.

Population growth and cryptocurrency mining, another power-intensive activity, are also contributors, said BPC's Hill.

'All about infrastructure'

Thianchai Sitthikongsak | Moment | Getty Images

As electricity demand is rising, the U.S. is also having problems relative to transmission and distribution of power, said Seydl of J.P. Morgan.

Rising electricity prices are ""all about infrastructure at this point,"" he said. ""The grid is aged.""

For example, transmission line growth is ""stuck in a rut"" and ""way below"" Energy Department targets for 2030 and 2035, Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment Strategy for J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management, wrote in a March energy report.

Shortages of transformer equipment — which step voltages up and down across the U.S. grid — pose another obstacle, Cembalest wrote. Delivery times are about two to three years, up from about four to six weeks in 2019, he wrote.

""Half of all US transformers are near the end of their useful lives and will need replacing, along with replacements in areas affected by hurricanes, floods and wildfires,"" Cembalest wrote.

Transformers and other transmission equipment have experienced the second highest inflation rate among all wholesale goods in the US since 2018, he wrote.

Meanwhile, certain facilities like old fossil-fuel powered plants have been decommissioned and new energy capacity to replace it has been relatively slow to come online, said BPC's Hill. There has also been inflation in prices for equipment and labor, so it costs more to build facilities, he said.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108160044-1750103665589-gettyimages-1418634136-9x3a1548.jpeg?v=1750103715&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-06-21 07:01:57.336587

When biogenic fuel is taken into account, mill greenhouse gas emissions are almost as high as the dirtiest U.S. oil refineries, according to EIP.
Nationwide, EIP found that paper mills’ greenhouse gas emissions were 350 percent higher than public-facing EPA estimates.
Sappi and Woodland Pulp also disputed EIP’s claims that their total mill greenhouse gas emissions are underreported.
Further greenhouse gas reductions may instead have to come from paper companies deciding to invest in clean technologies and reduce pollution.","Two of Maine’s largest paper mills are among the dirtiest in the country, according to a new study on U.S. pulp and paper plants, putting their emissions on par with some oil refineries.

The May report from the Environmental Integrity Project, a non-profit advocacy group, calls attention to the industry’s overreliance on dirty fuels and the old, inefficient technologies they use to burn them.

“In Maine, there are several plants that are still burning coal and… tires,” said Courtney Bernhardt, EIP’s director of research who co-authored the report. “We wanted to raise awareness about that.”

The group analyzed greenhouse gas emissions from 185 paper plants across the country, which Bernhardt says are undercounted by federal estimates because of a loophole in the reporting process: the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency doesn’t include greenhouse gas emissions from “biogenic” fuel sources like biomass or black liquor, a wood byproduct of the chemical papermaking process, both of which mills burn to power their operations and can be dirtier than coal.

The agency’s rationale for excluding those sources from total emissions estimates in its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, according to EIP, is “because trees can grow back in the future” and offset the carbon emissions from biomass fuels.

Until the EPA accurately reports and regulates all facility emissions, mill owners will have less of a reason to pursue energy efficiency upgrades that can both cut back reliance on dirty fuels and maintain profits, the report claims.

The study’s recommendations for tightening limits on the paper industry’s emissions come as the Trump administration eyes drastic rollbacks of federal rules curtailing greenhouse gases and hazardous air pollutants released by American power plants, according to reporting from The New York Times.

Maine is home to two of the last remaining paper plants in the country that burn tires as fuel. As other mills move away from so-called “tire-derived fuels,” Maine plants have increased their use in recent years, adding to their output of harmful pollutants.

The combination of coal, tires and other fuels burned by ND Paper’s plant in Rumford made it the second-largest emitter of mercury out of the 185 facilities included in EIP’s analysis of 2023 EPA data. The Sappi Somerset mill in Skowhegan, which also burns tires, was a top-20 emitter of hazardous air pollutants in 2020.

Both plants’ emissions have local and global effects. Common mill byproducts like nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and fine particulate matter all harm the respiratory system and can linger in the atmosphere, where nitrogen oxide creates acid rain.

When biogenic fuel is taken into account, mill greenhouse gas emissions are almost as high as the dirtiest U.S. oil refineries, according to EIP. Sappi Somerset mill’s total greenhouse gas emissions balloon from 316,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide to nearly 1.6 million when including biogenic fuel sources — a 400 percent increase.

Nationwide, EIP found that paper mills’ greenhouse gas emissions were 350 percent higher than public-facing EPA estimates.

At the state level, these emissions are counted. Maine ditched the EPA’s model and began including biogenic sources of carbon dioxide in a 2022 update on its climate change goals.

Maine lawmakers recently codified a new 2040 deadline to reach net zero carbon emissions, and one effective way to do so nationwide, according to Bernhardt, is upgrading the inefficient boilers that many mills have relied on for decades to power operations.

The EIP report estimates that 40 percent of all analyzed pulp and paper mills have a boiler that is at least a half century old, including the power boiler that Woodland Pulp’s Washington County mill still uses 54 years after it was installed.

A representative for Woodland Pulp said that the company’s Baileyville mill has reduced its emissions over the past two decades by switching from fuel oil to natural gas. Mill energy needs are also supported by on-site hydropower.

Although many boilers are upgraded and retrofitted to add pollution controls — including the one used by Woodland Pulp — EIP recommends replacing them with zero-emission industrial heat technologies where possible, reducing overall emissions and the amount of heat lost by inefficient boilers during the papermaking process.

Sappi has pursued similar efficiency updates at its Somerset mill in recent years, according to Sappi communications manager April Jones. The company no longer burns coal and has reduced reliance on other dirty fuels, setting a 2030 deadline to reduce the mill’s 2019 greenhouse gas emissions by 41.5 percent per ton of product.

Sappi and Woodland Pulp also disputed EIP’s claims that their total mill greenhouse gas emissions are underreported. Despite EPA’s reporting framework, both companies stated that they still publish their mills’ biogenic emissions. (ND Paper did not respond to requests for comment).

The paper industry hasn’t yet been targeted by rollbacks on hazardous air pollution limits the same way power plants have, according to Bernhardt, but broad changes in emissions regulations could impact industries across the board. Further greenhouse gas reductions may instead have to come from paper companies deciding to invest in clean technologies and reduce pollution.

“There’s a real role for paper to play in a more sustainable economy,” Bernhardt said. “It really comes down to dollars. Can companies afford it?”",https://themainemonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ND-Paper-Mill-Rumford.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 07:02:00.666680

These solar projects could equal 15 percent of the solar that’s already been built globally and help triple renewables before the end of the decade.

“Constructing solar on upheaved lands isn’t just land reclamation—it’s a chance to align land restoration, clean energy goals, and local job creation,” Global Energy Monitor (GEM) said in a briefing.

This first-time analysis shows that “coal-to-solar transition offers a rare chance to repair the environmental hazards and eyesores of open pits and generate an estimated 259,700 permanent jobs in the solar industry,” according to GEM.

Some coal-to-solar projects are underway in China. With a 90 operational coal mine-to-solar conversions, there is currently a capacity of 14 GW in construction and another 46 future projects at 9 GW in planning, GEM reported.

“And that’s just the beginning of possibility,” GEM said in a briefing. “While recent closures are the likeliest candidates for new development, plenty of other closed mines may still be in suitable condition. The world has closed over 6,000 coal mines since 2010, most of them in China during the coal industry’s restructuring and in the U.S. where economic headwinds forced operators to slash their 1 billion tonne industry in half.

Since most abandoned coal mines are in close proximity to existing grid infrastructure, they are known as grid-ready sites near substations and transmission lines. According to the report, “96 percent of recently abandoned mines are less than 10 km from the grid and 91 percent are within 10 km of a grid connection point.”

The electric vehicle (EV) giant’s first set of cars have arrived in the country – Model Y rear-wheel drive SUVs shipped from Tesla’s China factory, according to the sources, who asked not to be identified as the information is private, as well as documents seen by Bloomberg News. The Model Y is the world’s largest-selling electric car.

Tesla is set to open its first showroom in Mumbai as early as mid-July, which will be followed by one in New Delhi, according to the sources. It has also imported Supercharger components, car accessories, merchandise and spares from the US, China and the Netherlands, the documents show.

The debut will end a years-long on-again, off-again saga over Tesla’s entry into India – a market Musk has long eyed but held back from entering due to disagreements over tariffs and local manufacturing. The breakthrough in bringing Tesla to India comes after Musk met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the US in February.

Bloomberg News reported in February that Tesla was set to ship a few thousand cars to a port near Mumbai.

Tesla spokespersons did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the opening of the India showrooms and the preparations underway.

Premium price

Five Model Y vehicles have already arrived in Mumbai from Tesla’s Shanghai factory, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg News. The cars were declared at 2.8 million rupees (S$41,558) and attracted more than 2.1 million rupees in import duties – a levy that’s consistent with India’s 70 per cent tariff on fully-built imported cars under US$40,000 plus surcharges, the documents show.

The model is expected to go on sale for more than US$56,000 before taxes and insurance, though Tesla will determine the final sticker price based on its margin and positioning strategy, according to sources familiar with the plans.

That compares with an ex-showroom price of US$44,990 for the same model in the US, which sells for US$37,490 once tax credits are applied.

The premium price tag will likely be a major hurdle to Tesla’s plans as the automaker will need to convince value-driven consumers to open their wallets. EVs account for just over 5 per cent of new passenger vehicle sales in India, but premium cars still represent less than 2 per cent of the market, data with the Indian government’s vehicle registration portal shows.

Beefing up

The company has not appointed a new country head following the departure of Prashanth Menon, but is beefing up hiring across charging, retail and policy teams, according to sources familiar with the matter.

The Model Y imports represent an initial foray into the market and Tesla plans to expand its presence, including offering more models.

It’s leasing warehouse space in Karnataka, in India’s south, and is adding more in Gurugram, outside New Delhi, the sources said.

Tesla executives from other countries are making weekly visits, the sources said, to the Mumbai and New Delhi showrooms, which are in high-profile, luxury business precincts in an effort to attract affluent shoppers.

Apartments in Chapel Hill to allow the developer to run air conditioning units to prevent mold and mildew from taking hold. Triple-digit temperatures and high humidity are forecast for next week, which would create ideal conditions for mold and mildew growth.

The energy company had previously refused to run power to the apartments for low-income residents, citing the developer’s decision to use a single meter for billing purposes, according to a consumer complaint the developer, EMPOWERment Inc., filed with the North Carolina Utilities Commission.

EMPOWERment Inc. Executive Director Delores Bailey had expressed concern about the potential damage mold and mildew could cause to the 10-unit affordable housing complex while Duke Energy and the nonprofit work out differences about the meter.

On Friday, Bailey was hopeful that Duke and her organization will soon reach a permanent settlement about the single meter so that tenants can begin moving in August or September at the latest. EMPOWERment Inc., decided to use one meter for the entire apartment complex to accommodate rooftop solar panels and to reduce energy costs for low-income residents who would rent the apartments.

“Duke has set up the power on a single meter, which is what we asked in the complaint,” Bailey said.

Now that the power has been turned on, Bailey said EMPOWERment Inc.’s contractor, Focus Design Builders, can put the finishing touches on the project, which is more than 85% complete.

The remaining work consists mostly of “punch list” items such as making sure appliances are working and water is running properly, Bailey said. Outside, there is some landscaping and grading left to do, she added.

“They’ve (contractors) have got to come back and do a cleanup of the units and make them livable construction-wise,” Bailey said.

The disagreement between Duke and EMPOWERment Inc., stemmed from differing interpretations of a state law prohibiting master meters for electric and natural gas service in new residential buildings. One section of the law outlines an exception to the prohibition if the tenant and landlord agree in the lease that the cost of the electric service or natural gas service, or both, will be included in rental payments. North Carolina has generally required individual meters and service in tenants’ names for each unit in new residential building constructed on or after Sept. 1, 1977.

Bailey previously told NC Newsline that electric bills would be paid by tenants in monthly rent payments under lease agreements between the nonprofit and tenants. The amount charged would depend on the number of bedrooms in the apartment, she said.

Duke Energy told NC Newsline last week that it cannot comment on specific customers’ accounts. But did provide a statement in an email from spokesman Jeff Brooks:

“Duke Energy service regulations, in compliance with North Carolina law, require residential units to have individual meters, no one master meter covering the entire building. These guidelines are in place to promote consistency in the quality and reliability of service to all customers.”

Rewiring the units so that each has a meter would have cost the nonprofit about $86,000, Bailey said. “We don’t have that,” she said last week. It would take three-to-six months to receive the parts needed to rewire the apartments if the nonprofit decided to go that route, she said.

The Southern Environmental Law Center filed the complaint on behalf of the nonprofit.

The decision is seen as a step towards rebalancing federal regulations and enhancing American energy capabilities.

NAM President and CEO Jay Timmons commented on the development, stating, ""The EPA’s decision to repeal the unworkable power plant rule for existing coal-fired and new natural gas-fired power plants is a critical and welcome step toward rebalanced regulations and American energy dominance. This change will strengthen grid reliability and support manufacturing growth in the United States.""

Timmons emphasized that NAM had consistently warned about the potential negative impacts of the rule. He explained that the rule's requirements were unrealistic, particularly regarding timelines for adopting emerging technologies at a commercial scale. According to Timmons, this would have threatened America's energy security and hindered leadership in advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence.

He further noted that existing natural gas plants are vital for providing affordable and reliable energy necessary for manufacturing operations in the U.S. The now-repealed rule was perceived as an additional burden on an already strained electric grid, risking energy security.

The repeal aligns with efforts initiated by NAM in December 2024 when they led a letter campaign involving over 100 manufacturing organizations.

The question for the justices was whether the challengers had suffered the sort of injuries that gave them standing to sue. When the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in December, it said it would not address whether the Environmental Protection Agency program granting California a waiver to set its own standards for greenhouse gas emissions was lawful.

A federal law authorizes the EPA to grant California a waiver even though other states and localities are not free to set their own limits. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in an unsigned opinion last year, rejected the fuel producers’ lawsuit, ruling that the challengers lacked standing. The appeals court reasoned that the challengers would not be directly harmed by the waiver, since its immediate impacts were only on vehicle manufacturers.

Writing for a seven-member majority Friday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said fuel producers would suffer harm from the waiver and so had standing to sue.

“Without California’s regulations in effect,” he wrote, “manufacturers would likely make more cars powered by gasoline and other liquid fuels, thereby increasing purchases of those fuels.”

Kavanaugh stressed the limits of the ruling. “This case concerns only standing, not the merits,” he wrote. “EPA and California may or may not prevail on the merits in defending EPA’s approval of the California regulations.”

Created under the 1970 Clean Air Act, the California waiver has for decades served as a tool to allow the state, which has historically had the most polluted air in the nation, to enact tougher state-level clean air standards than those set by the federal government.

During his first term, Trump revoked an Obama-era version of the California waiver, but in 2022, President Joe Biden reinstated it. During his presidential campaign last year, Trump promised to “rip up” the California waiver as part of his broader battle to destroy policies intended to combat climate change.

Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson each filed dissents. In hers, Jackson wrote that the court should not have decided the issue, given that Trump was likely to once again rescind the waiver and make the issue moot.

The California waiver can be used to rein in toxic, smog-causing pollutants including soot, nitrogen dioxide and ozone that lead to asthma and lung disease. But in the 21st century, California rulemakers have used the waiver to curb emissions including carbon dioxide, the invisible greenhouse gas emitted by burning coal and oil that is the chief cause of global warming.

Because the tailpipes of gasoline-powered cars are the nation’s largest source of carbon dioxide pollution, California’s use of the waiver to address that pollution soon grew into one of the nation’s, and then the world’s, most transformative and ambitious programs to fight climate change by transitioning to electric vehicles.

Vickie Patton, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund, emphasized the limits of the Supreme Court’s ruling.

“While the Supreme Court has now clarified who has grounds to bring a challenge to court,” she said in a statement, “the decision does not affect California’s bedrock legal authority to adopt pollution safeguards, nor does alter the lifesaving, affordable, clean cars program itself.”

Rob Bonta, California’s attorney general, said in a statement that the ruling was a disappointment. “The fight for clean air,” he said, “is far from over.”",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/06202025_CalTraffic-tzrJune20_tzr_141439.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-06-21 12:16:44.027802

The conservative Supreme Court has repeatedly sided against the EPA and environmental groups in past cases.","The Supreme Court on Friday revived a lawsuit from fuel producers challenging California’s strict vehicle emission rules, allowing the companies to fight an on-again, off-again climate policy that President Donald Trump has previously opposed.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the opinion for a 7-2 majority. Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.

“The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,” Kavanaugh wrote.

While the federal government generally sets vehicle emission standards, the Environmental Protection Agency has at times granted a waiver to California – because of its longstanding air-quality problems – to set tougher standards. Given the state’s size, automakers have long hewed to its tighter emissions controls even for cars sold in other states.

That waiver was challenged by Diamond Alternative Energy, a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation, and several other companies and groups that advocate on behalf of fuel manufacturers.

Although the fuel producers challenged the waiver itself, the Supreme Court specifically declined to review that question, denying an appeal in December that raised that issue. Instead, the only issue before the justices was whether the companies and trade associations had standing to sue.

California leaders said the ruling was unfortunate, but not a fatal setback for their environmental rules.

“While we are disappointed by the Supreme Court’s decision to allow this case to go forward in the lower court, we will continue to vigorously defend California’s authority under the Clean Air Act,” said California Attorney General Bonta. “Congress intended for California to be able to regulate emissions from new vehicles sold in our state, and we remain firmly committed to advancing and implementing strong standards that safeguard public health and reduce climate pollution. The fight for clean air is far from over.”

A federal appeals court in Washington, DC, concluded that market forces are driving the national push toward electric vehicles far more than California’s tough regulations. Given that, the court ruled that the fuel makers could not proceed with the case.

One of the factors a party must demonstrate to establish standing is redressability, which essentially means that the court’s order can actually fix the problem the plaintiffs have raised. California said that even if courts eliminate the waiver, it wouldn’t help the fuel producers because consumer demand was motivating people to buy electric vehicles on their own.

During oral arguments both conservative and liberal justices seemed to be skeptical of that position, noting that the EPA had pointed to a reduce reliance on fossil fuels as part of the justification for the waiver.

Perhaps sensing a win in their case, the fuel producers advocated for a categorical rule that would have made it easier for companies challenging the federal government to sue over similar decisions in the future.

It’s not clear how much practical impact the court’s decision will have. President Donald Trump seems almost certain to withdraw the waiver, just as he did during his first administration. The waiver was later reinstated by President Joe Biden.

The conservative Supreme Court has repeatedly sided against the EPA and environmental groups in past cases. Last year, the court upended a Biden administration effort to reduce smog and air pollution wafting across state lines. In 2023, the justices cut back on the EPA’s ability to regulate wetlands under the Clean Water Act.

NRG AS A POTENTIAL SITE The NRG power plant has been idle since 2016.","Next month, some experts will be meeting with select Chautauqua County lawmakers regarding the possibility of using the former NRG plant as a micro-nuclear energy site.

To prepare for that meeting, the county’s Department of Planning has developed a resource guide regarding nuclear energy.

This week, the county legislature’s Planning and Economic Development Committee received an eight-page “Nuclear Energy Resource Guide” from the Department of Planning. Each page, when viewed electronically, is linked to numerous sources, giving background.

Some the topics the guide addresses include: defining nuclear energy, the need for next generation alternative renewable energy sources, status of microreactor nuclear technology development, the regulatory environment, projects currently in development around the world, pros and cons of small modular reactors and microreactors as power sources, and the status of repurposing/repowering the NRG Dunkirk station.

The section on the status of repurposing/repowering NRG has a link to Phase I NRG Power Plant Feasibility Study and Alternatives Analysis. That was originally published in June, 2021.

A Phase II and a “white paper” which will offer a realistic approach to the reuse of NRG site by repowering with Small Modular Reactors with natural gas as a bridge, are in process but currently incomplete.

County Planning and Economic Development Director Mark Geise said both the “white paper” and Phase II documents should be available soon. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority has some final comments before the Phase II document will be available for review.

Geise said in July a professor from the University at Buffalo, who is an expert in nuclear energy, will be at the legislature’s Planning and Economic Development Committee meeting, along with a representative from Phillips Lytle.

WHAT ARE SMALL MODULAR REACTORS

Small modular reactors (SMRs) are advanced nuclear reactors that have a power capacity of up to 300 MWe per unit. This is about one-third of the generating capacity of traditional nuclear power reactors.

SMRs, which can produce a large amount of low-carbon electricity, are:

– Small – physically a fraction of the size of a conventional nuclear power reactor.

– Modular – making it possible for systems and components to be factory-assembled and transported as a unit to a location for installation.

– Reactors – harnessing nuclear fission to generate heat to produce energy.

The International Atomic Energy Agency, one of the sources cited in the county’s Nuclear Energy Resource Guide, notes that given their smaller footprint, SMRs can be sited on locations not suitable for larger nuclear power plants. Prefabricated units of SMRs can be manufactured and then shipped and installed on site, making them more affordable to build than large power reactors, which are often custom designed for a particular location, sometimes leading to construction delays. SMRs offer savings in cost and construction time, and they can be deployed incrementally to match increasing energy demand.

According to the Atomic Energy Agency, in comparison to existing reactors, proposed SMR designs are generally simpler, and the safety concept for SMRs often relies more on passive systems and inherent safety characteristics of the reactor, such as low power and operating pressure. This means that in such cases no human intervention or external power or force is required to shut down systems, because passive systems rely on physical phenomena, such as natural circulation, convection, gravity and self-pressurization. These increased safety margins, in some cases, eliminate or significantly lower the potential for unsafe releases of radioactivity to the environment and the public in case of an accident.

WHAT IS A MICROREACTOR

Microreactors are not defined by their fuel form or coolant. Instead they have three main features: factory fabricated, transportable, and self-adjusting. While microreactor designs vary, most would be able to produce 1-20 MWe of thermal energy that could be used directly as heat or converted to electric power.

The U.S. Department of Energy, which is also one of the resources cited in the county’s Nuclear Energy Resource Guide, states that microreactor designs vary, but most would be able to produce 1-20 megawatts of thermal energy that could be used directly as heat or converted to electric power. They can be used to generate clean and reliable electricity for commercial use or for non-electric applications such as district heating, water desalination and hydrogen fuel production.

The Department of Energy notes that a handful of microreactor designs are under development in the United States, and could be ready to roll out within the next decade.

These compact reactors will be small enough to transport by truck and could help solve energy challenges in a number of areas, ranging from remote commercial or residential locations to military bases.

NRG AS A POTENTIAL SITE

The NRG power plant has been idle since 2016.

At the Planning and Economic Development Committee meeting, Legislator Fred Larson, D-Jamestown, asked Geise that, following next month’s discussion, would it be worthwhile for the legislature to pass a resolution for NYSERDA to consider the former NRG plant in Dunkirk as a small modular nuclear site.

Geise said he hadn’t thought a lot about the value of a resolution, but added, “It probably makes sense.”

In March During Chautauqua County Executive PJ Wendel’s State of the County address he announced that he would be launching a committee that would explore nuclear opportunities, saying, “I strongly feel that micro-nuclear energy could make Chautauqua County a major electricity producer that would not only meet our community’s energy needs but those in the entire region across New York state.”",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.observertoday.com/images/2017/01/31094407/fb.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 06:01:16.028913

Most clean energy jobs created since the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act have been in Republican districts.","Proposed federal legislation threatens Kansas's booming wind energy industry, which generates over 40% of the state's electricity.

The bill's tight deadlines and restrictions on foreign-made components could halt future wind projects.

While some Senate provisions offer flexibility, the overall impact could stifle clean energy growth and related jobs in Kansas.

Kansas is a national leader in renewable energy. Over 40% of our electricity is generated by wind. This has created thousands of jobs, over $11 billion in capital investment, and tens of millions of dollars in revenue to Kansas communities.

A new federal tax and spending measure in Congress, though, threatens to stifle this success.

The bill, supported by the Trump administration and referred to by some as the “big beautiful bill,” proposes severe cuts to clean energy tax credits that have propelled Kansas to a leadership position in wind energy.

Presented as a way to cut expenses and encourage conventional energies, the legislation risks undermining the very industry that has brought economic development and energy independence to our state.

The House bill includes unrealistic timelines. Developers would have just 60 days after enactment to start construction, and projects must be completed by the end of 2028 to qualify for tax credits. For large wind farms that take years to plan and finance, this is simply unworkable.

These provisions would effectively exclude nearly all future solar and wind projects from federal assistance.

The bill also imposes strict supply chain rules. Beginning in 2026, projects using major components made in China or Russia would be ineligible for tax credits. While meant to reduce dependence on foreign adversaries, the rules ignore reality. Most critical materials are no longer made in the U.S., and substitute supply chains are note yet available. This could stall or stop Kansas wind projects entirely.

It also threatens Kansas' clean energy supply chain. Tax credits for wind factories would expire in 2028, endangering thousands of local jobs. The bill would also end leasing incentives for small-scale solar, making it harder for families and small businesses to access clean energy.

The Senate version tempers some of the House’s provisions but still poses major risks. It keeps restrictions on foreign materials but adds flexibility for publicly traded firms using Chinese-sourced materials. Notably, it allows projects to qualify for credits based on when construction begins, not when they finish.

Still, it phases out wind and solar tax credits through 2028 while ramping up support for nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal.

Resistance to renewable energy is not purely ideological. Concerns about land use, aesthetics, and community effects draw skepticism across the partisan divide. In Kansas, where windmills sweep the prairie, opponents have raised objections about visual impact, noise, and land use.

But Kansas is not a left outlier on clean energy. Most clean energy jobs created since the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act have been in Republican districts. Kansas has benefitted from this boom. These are jobs that can’t be outsourced. They can energize our economy and communities.

This bill threatens to roll back that progress. Instead of locking in a clean, affordable, and jobs-rich energy future, it ties Kansas' renewable energy economy up in red tape and uncertainty.

In 1915, Kansas City Power & Light convinced regulators that stringing copper wires across the prairie would bring “abundant, cheap light for every home”. Today, a data center developer requesting 300 MW for a new facility is instructed to join a five-year interconnection queue. While the physical infrastructure has expanded and loads have become smarter, the core regulatory framework—cost-of-service regulation (COSR)—remains stuck in an era defined by rotary telephones.

This institutional mismatch is not mere trivia. Global data center electricity demand, fueled primarily by artificial intelligence workloads, is projected to nearly double to 945 terawatt-hours (TWh) by 2030, more than Japan’s current annual consumption. Simultaneously, the U.S. anticipates adding 217 gigawatts (GW) of distributed energy resources (DERs) by 2028, accounting for 70% of new generation capacity. Advanced transmission technologies capable of doubling line capacity remain underutilized, leaving 118,821 miles of existing wires untouched. As technology accelerates forward, regulation lags conspicuously behind.

Of course, thoughtful deliberation is justified. Major investments affecting ratepayers over decades deserve rigorous review, and public participation is a fundamental civic virtue of democracy. Yet technological evolution increasingly challenges how and when regulation should be applied to serve the public interest effectively.

Why traditional regulation is technology-contingent

Early 20th-century regulation was built for a capital-intensive, centralized grid designed for universal service and exploiting economies of scale and scope. Three outdated regulatory assumptions now hinder innovation:

Embedded Asset Bias: Utilities profit from tangible infrastructure rather than digital solutions. A transformer can enter the rate base easily; software enabling EV charging flexibility struggles for recognition.

Rate-Case Latency: Multi-year rate-case cycles clash with rapidly evolving technology, such as weekly software updates orchestrating virtual power plants.

Static Customer Classes: Traditional residential, commercial, and industrial categories fail to accommodate modern organizational realities—hyperscale data centers running microgrids or widespread adoption of EVs and solar+storage.

These inherent characteristics render cost-of-service regulation technology-contingent. When the tech stack changes, these rules become brittle constraints rather than flexible safeguards.

The pacing problem and the concept of opportunity cost

Institutional scholars call this lag the pacing problem: law and regulation evolve incrementally while innovation leaps. The cost of that lag is not only higher bills: it is the opportunity cost of foregone futures.

Opportunity cost isn’t static. As society, technology, and economics evolve, the alternatives we give up through stasis gain greater value. Economist Frédéric Bastiat cautioned that policy debates fixate on “the seen” and neglect “the unseen”. Today’s visible benefits—reliable power and stable rates—are increasingly strained. The unseencost is the innovation and value lost by maintaining traditional regulation in a digital, bidirectional future grid.

Mapping the unseen losses

Consider these illustrative examples highlighting how the opportunity cost of traditional regulation materializes:

Dynamic tariffs and transactive energy: Time-differentiated pricing and automated price response remain uncommon, though millions of EVs could arbitrage wholesale price swings and coordinated PV-EV charging would shrink duck curves.

Grid-enhancing technologies: Upgrading half the untouched transmission lines mentioned above could avoid gigawatts of new generation, reducing land use and resource intensity while also accommodating increasing demand from data centers.

DER market innovation: Scaling virtual power plants (VPPs) could save billions annually, yet regulatory frameworks limit market entry; DOE estimates increasing virtual power plant (VPP) capacity from today’s 30-60 GW to 80-160 GW could save $10 billion/year.

Regional economic growth: Delays force data-center firms to contract directly with generators or build their own power plants (make or buy), limiting local economic benefits in less flexible areas.

Capital efficiency: Regulatory incentives promote investment in physical infrastructure while neglecting digital solutions that could reduce system costs significantly.

A rough back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests the opportunity cost’s potential magnitude: If utilities rolled out Conservation Voltage Reduction (CVR) on just half of U.S. distribution feeders, the program would touch roughly 1,930 TWh of the 3,861 TWh that Americans purchased in 2023. Field research finds that CVR trims energy use by 1–4 percent; using a conservative 3 percent estimate delivers an annual savings of about 58 TWh, equivalent to the output of seven large nuclear reactors. Valued at a conservative $40 per MWh, that reduction translates into roughly $2.3 billion each year of savings, achieved through nothing more than smarter set-points on voltage regulators: no new wires, no new permits. This thought experiment in opportunity cost, in the seen and the unseen, suggests that the status quo institutional framework is an invisible tax.

Low-friction, high-return regulatory fixes

Closing the gap need not upend every statute overnight, nor need it abandon the foundational regulatory principles of public interest and consumer protection. A phased approach can chip away at these opportunity costs while preserving regulatory principles. Again, some illustrative examples:

Process tweaks: Enforce a 90-day DER interconnection timeline and mandate open data standards (IEEE 2030.5, Green Button), dramatically reducing queue bottlenecks and empowering third-party solutions. Interconnection queues rather than hardware costs are now the dominant bottleneck for rooftop solar, community storage and flexible EV chargers. DOE’s i2X Roadmap frames the national goal as “cut median study time to months, not years” by 2035. Flexible demand, real-time VPP dispatch and fintech energy tools all depend on machine-readable telemetry and usage data. IEEE 2030.5 provides a secure DER control protocol. California Rule 21 already requires it for smart inverters, and adoption is spreading to Australia and Canada. Green Button Connect My Data (CMD)standardizes interval-billing data sharing; roughly 36 million U.S. customer accounts are now covered.

Incentive realignment: Implement earnings-adjustment mechanisms (EAMs) tied to performance metrics, rewarding utilities for system efficiency and innovation rather than mere capital investment. National Grid’s New York EAMs pay up to $5.9 million for beating DER-utilization and peak-reduction targets; the utility hit the DER metric and collected the full incentive in 2024. This approach requires establishing benchmarks against which to calculate reductions, which is still administrative and artificial but at least aligns utility incentives to reduce total system costs. Hawaii’s performance-based rate plan, implemented in 2021, is a multi-year plan indexing revenue and layering on performance incentives plus an expedited pilot cost-tracker. [At some point I’m going to write a whole post on performance-based regulation, but today is not that day.]

Market access: Enable distribution-level transactive tariffs and fully implement FERC Order 2222, monetizing DER contributions and scaling flexible resources. Time-varying and locational retail prices give DER owners a cash signal that matches local grid stress, converting appliances and EVs into grid assets. DOE’s December 2024 paper, Sourcing DERs for Distribution Grid Services, catalogues jurisdictions shifting from static TOU to dynamic, distribution-targeted rates and local flexibility markets. [I will write a post about transactive energy!] With respect to FERC 2222 on integrating retail aggregators into wholesale markets, wholesale markets cannot mobilize flexible load if aggregators are blocked at the distribution interface.

Structural pilots: Explore independent Distribution System Operators (i-DSOs) and time-boxed regulatory sandboxes, facilitating continuous innovation within controlled, low-risk environments. The Camus Energy DSO framework of “local grid management” is an emerging model to consider. Sandboxes lower entry barriers for novel business models while protecting consumers through scale and duration limits, and protect new ideas from “utility death by pilot”. The State of Utah has implemented a regulatory sandbox that “allows businesses to experiment with products, production methods, or services by temporarily waiving state law and allowing entrepreneurs to determine if customers value products that don’t fit within the state’s current regulatory framework”. In Canada, Ontario’s OEB Innovation Sandbox has issued guidance to dozens of pilots since 2019.

Each example incrementally reduces the unseen opportunity cost, turning potential benefits into tangible economic and societal value. These levers share a common DNA: they price optionality, they bring data to the surface, and they shift utility profit from volume to value creation. None requires a wholesale dismantling of public-utility regulation; each can nest inside existing authority and rate-case calendars. Yet together they chip away at unseen welfare loss: the invisible tax of institutional drag.

Making the invisible visible

Opportunity cost seldom appears explicitly in regulatory deliberations, but it shapes electricity economics significantly. Maintaining yesterday’s regulatory frameworks imposes costs far beyond monetary expenses; it curtails the innovation essential for a resilient, abundant, and low-carbon future. Regulators, legislators, and utilities need not predict every future scenario; they must simply recognize that institutional inertia’s unseen cost accumulates, steadily.

The clock is ticking for Wisconsin homeowners who want to take advantage of tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency as Republicans in Congress seek to phase out those incentives.

The most recent federal data shows more than 73,000 families in Wisconsin have taken advantage of the tax credits. However, those incentives would disappear as soon as the end of this year under the House budget bill and six months after a bill is passed in the Senate version introduced this week.

Republicans have taken aim at the expanded tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, which were intended to combat climate change, as they seek to pay for President Donald Trump’s $4.5 trillion tax cuts.

Kevin Kane, chief economist with Green Homeowners United, said the repeal will make it more difficult for middle- and low-income families to make home upgrades or install rooftop solar.

“I think there’s going to be a mad dash for people to try to use it,” Kane said.

Tax credits provide a dollar-for-dollar reduction on what people owe in federal taxes. Residents can claim 30 percent of the cost for heat pumps up to $2,000 each year and up to $1,200 each year for insulation, air sealing and ventilation. They can also claim 30 percent of the cost to install geothermal heating, solar panels and battery storage.

In Wisconsin, families claimed an average of more than $5,100 on clean energy investments like rooftop solar, according to the most recent federal data. On home improvements, they claimed an average of $761 on things like heat pumps, air conditioners and windows.

Angie Kochanski, director of business development at Arch Solar, said they’re expecting that the elimination of tax credits will dramatically shrink the market for residential solar installations.

“We’ll adjust. It’s going to be a new era, and there’s going to be a smaller market of buyers, and we’re all going to have to work a little bit harder,” Kochanski said.

Solar companies have already been facing a dip in residential solar installations, which declined 31 percent last year due in part to higher interest rates.

Arch Solar installed solar on about 240 homes in southeastern Wisconsin last year, and the company anticipates that number could grow to 300 homes this year as homeowners try to act before tax credits disappear.

Rooftop solar installations could drop by half next year

Cory Neeley, executive director of SolarShare Wisconsin Cooperative, said the repeal is a huge slap in the face for businesses that have been scaling up their operations.

“These companies are going to have a hard time planning for any additional work. They’re also just going to see a huge glut of solar panels on the market,” Neeley said. “Because this market existed, and then all of a sudden, there’s no demand for it.”

Under ideal circumstances, Kochanski added, contractors need around six to 10 weeks to obtain permits or approval from utilities to connect with the grid.

Energy data firm Ohm Analytics estimates residential solar installations could fall by half next year. Wisconsin labor and clean energy advocates have said repealing the tax credits could jeopardize thousands of jobs.

Kathy Kuntz, director of the Dane County Office of Energy and Climate Change, said it’s not the time to sit on the fence if residents and businesses are thinking about home energy upgrades.

She said installation of solar and energy efficient appliances helps reduce costs for homeowners and demand on the grid at a time when the nation has seen increased electricity demand from data centers.

“I’m just concerned that it’s the wrong moment to slow down the consumer and business investment in clean energy given what else is going on with the grid,” Kuntz said.

All Wisconsin Republicans in the U.S. House voted for the budget bill and its provisions to repeal tax credits. In a social media post Tuesday, Republican Rep. Tom Tiffany urged people to tell their senators not to “water down” the House bill.

“We must terminate the IRA and stop wasting taxpayer dollars on wind and solar subsidies,” Tiffany said.

In Green Bay, the city’s sustainability commission unanimously passed a resolution Thursday to support the retention of clean energy funding and tax credits. Ahead of the vote, the commission’s chair Christa Kananen said the city’s clean energy plan relies heavily on leveraging tax credits to reach its goal to become carbon-neutral by 2050.

“The loss of that federal spending would significantly impact the plan that’s already been outlined and is in progress,” Kananen said. “It would, at a minimum, slow it down significantly.”

As tax breaks seem likely to fade away, Kuntz noted Wisconsin residents can still take advantage of home rebates under the Home Efficiency Rebate, or HOMES, program for installing insulation and energy efficient heating and cooling systems.

Wisconsin received $149 million to administer home rebates under the program and the Home Electrification and Appliance Rebate, or HEAR, program for households installing heat pumps and other electrical appliances. That funding is not in jeopardy, and it’s expected to last another two to three years.

Analysts emphasize the necessity of engaging in recycling to maintain industry competitiveness, as regulatory demands for recycled materials intensify worldwide.","South Korea's top industrial leaders are actively expanding their roles in the electric vehicle (EV) battery recycling industry as the market, though sluggish now, is expected to become critical in the future. On June 20, the Korea Herald reported that LG Energy Solution, the country's premier battery maker, has initiated joint ventures in Europe and the United States. They are partnering with France's Derichebourg and Toyota Tsusho Co., respectively.

This development signifies LG's inaugural direct entry into the recycling sector within these pivotal markets. Similarly, SK Ecoplant, part of the SK Group, is broadening its European operations in the Netherlands. In particular, the facility is set to enhance its annual processing capacity by 25,000 metric tons of black mass, with plans to complete the expansion by 2025, as disclosed by a South Korean English-language publication.

In a separate move, Posco-GS Eco Materials, a joint venture established by Posco Holdings and GS Energy, has secured complete ownership of its recycling entity Posco HY Clean Metal after buying China's Huayou Cobalt's 35 percent stake. Such strategic repositioning occurs amidst a downturn in the battery recycling market, precipitated by reduced EV demand and declining prices of battery components like nickel, lithium, and manganese.

Prices of lithium carbonate have dramatically declined from 450 Chinese yuan per kilogram earlier in 2023 to roughly 50 yuan, while nickel's price has dropped from over USD 31,000 per ton to about USD 20,000. Consequently, SungEel HiTech, one of the few battery recycling firms on the Kosdaq index, reports decreasing profits and cash flow for two consecutive years.

A projected recycling venture between SungEel HiTech and SK Innovation, publicized in 2022, is now deferred indefinitely. Additionally, SK Ecoplant's planned expansions in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, and Kentucky have shown minimal advancement recently. Industry experts in Korea predict a sharp uptick in end-of-life EV batteries, often around a decade post initial use, coinciding with the global sales boom of EVs in the 2010s.

EVs' rising market penetration hints at the battery recycling sector's potential growth, valued at USD 8 billion in 2022, and anticipated to surge to USD 53.57 billion by 2030, according to SNE Research. Analysts emphasize the necessity of engaging in recycling to maintain industry competitiveness, as regulatory demands for recycled materials intensify worldwide.

The European Union mandates by 2031 that EV batteries must include minimum recycled metal percentages: 16 percent cobalt, 85 percent lead, 6 percent lithium, and nickel. These figures will rise by 2036. On the other hand, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act restricts EV tax credits for batteries sourced from ""foreign entities of concern,"" urging manufacturers to primarily use domestic, recycled materials.

""This program will help deliver clean, affordable electricity to families and businesses across Sri Lanka,"" said David Sislen, World Bank Division Director for the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
A core feature of the initiative includes $40 million in World Bank Group guarantees in the first phase.
“Sri Lanka’s energy transition is an opportunity to expand clean energy, improve energy access, and build long-term resilience,” said Imad N Fakhoury, IFC's Regional Director for South Asia.

The program—Secure, Affordable, and Sustainable Energy for Sri Lanka—will support the country reduce its reliance on expensive fossil fuel imports and accelerate its shift toward solar and wind.

""This program will help deliver clean, affordable electricity to families and businesses across Sri Lanka,"" said David Sislen, World Bank Division Director for the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka. “We are excited to work with both the government and private sector to make this shared vision a reality.”

The program will support new solar and wind energy projects that will add 1 gigawatt of clean electricity to the grid – bringing Sri Lanka closer to its goal of generating 70 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. The program is also expected to mobilize more than $800 million in private investment, helping to lower electricity costs and improve reliability for families and businesses.

A core feature of the initiative includes $40 million in World Bank Group guarantees in the first phase. This will help reduce risks for private investors and energy producers. It is targeted to derisk payment obligations from Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), thus improving investors’ confidence and attract financing on more favorable terms. The World Bank Group’s private sector arms - the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) – will provide complementary support through direct investments and political risk insurance.

“Sri Lanka’s energy transition is an opportunity to expand clean energy, improve energy access, and build long-term resilience,” said Imad N Fakhoury, IFC's Regional Director for South Asia. “Achieving this requires close collaboration and investment from both public and private sectors. As one World Bank Group, we are uniquely positioned to enable and mobilize private capital and foster partnerships that deliver affordable, reliable electricity while driving sustainable growth and creating jobs that strengthen Sri Lanka’s economy and expand opportunities for its people.”

MIGA will support the program by offering political risk insurance to help reduce uncertainty for international investors.

“Investors need confidence to take bold steps in new markets,” said Muhamet Fall, Director of Operation with MIGA. “Our guarantees will help de-risk projects and attract the private capital needed to scale up clean energy in Sri Lanka.”

The program also supports the upgrades to Sri Lanka’s electricity grid, enabling it to better handle renewable energy and reduce power outages. This modernization will help stabilize electricity prices and improve energy access for households and businesses across the country.

In addition, the initiative will provide technical assistance to the CEB to strengthen planning, procurement, and operations, and supports government-led reforms to improve competitiveness, utility management, and regulatory oversight.

Now as secretary of energy, Wright will be responsible for overseeing solar energy research and development, solar energy tax credits, and the Energy Department’s clean energy loan program, which has included solar projects.
A 1991 paper he copublished with other researchers focused on electrical engineering, but it made no mention of applications for solar energy.
In July 2022, Liberty Energy invested $10 million in Fervo Energy, a geothermal energy company.
This marked Liberty Energy’s first-ever foray into solar energy, according to Tom Curran, a senior securities analyst who covers Liberty Energy at Seaport Research Partners.","During Chris Wright’s January 2025 confirmation hearing as secretary of energy, his home state senator, John Hickenlooper (D-CO), expressed concern about the pace of climate change. Wright agreed that climate change was a serious issue, citing his twenty-year career in diverse energy sectors, including renewables.

“The solution to climate change is to evolve our energy system,” he told Hickenlooper. “I’ve worked on that most — all of my career, again in nuclear and solar, and geothermal and new battery storage technology now.”

This is far from the first time Wright has noted he’s worked in solar. Wright — the former founder, chief executive, and chair of Colorado-based Liberty Energy, one of the country’s top fracking companies — has claimed in public appearances, organizational biographies, on his LinkedIn profile, and even formal testimony before Congress that he spent parts of his career working in solar energy.

But despite such claims, there’s no evidence that Wright ever studied, invested in, or worked in solar energy, according to a Lever investigation of Wright’s school records, corporate disclosures, and several close followers of his career and companies.

In fact, the entire notion that Wright has ever worked in solar energy exclusively stems from vague public claims he’s made on the matter. The one time he elaborated on this notion, he submitted a résumé with what appears to be false information about his solar experience to Congress, the Lever found.

In response to requests for comment from Wright and the Department of Energy, an agency spokesperson noted in an email, “During his decades-long career working in the energy sector, Wright worked with and advised on a variety of different energy sources and technologies, including oil, natural gas, nuclear (including [small modular reactors]), solar, and geothermal.”

The spokesperson did not respond to repeated follow-up requests for evidence supporting Wright’s claims that he studied and worked in solar energy.

One expert says Wright’s allegedly false claims about his experience in solar energy suggest an insincere interest in using the Energy Department to support, or even treat fairly, the country’s $70.3 billion solar energy industry.

Now as secretary of energy, Wright will be responsible for overseeing solar energy research and development, solar energy tax credits, and the Energy Department’s clean energy loan program, which has included solar projects. All of these programs are under threat from Wright and the Trump administration’s vague and far-reaching emergency powers, as well as Congress’ proposed “Big Beautiful Budget” bill.

These developments come as scientists urge the United States to quickly transition its energy system away from fossil fuels and toward renewables like solar — or else face existential, ecological threats.

“Wind and solar are seen as being primarily promoted by Democrats and entities that support Democrats, and Trump is attacking all policies that he perceives as supporting his political opponents,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. “This is just crass politics.”

Nothing but Hot Air?

Wright studied undergraduate mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1981 to 1985, according to the school. He enrolled at MIT as an undergraduate student “specifically to work on [nuclear] fusion energy,” Wright testified before the Democrat-led House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis in 2019.

His undergraduate thesis focused on the use of semiviscous materials to dampen vibrations of stiff, constrained materials. This work could have applications in spacecraft, Wright argued in the thesis. After he graduated, Wright pivoted to study electrical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, school records state.

“As a graduate student at UC Berkeley, Chris Wright developed regulating charging circuits to connect batteries to solar in order to power remote instruments,” a Department of Energy spokesperson told the Lever over email, but failed to provide evidence supporting the claim.

In fall 1985, Wright enrolled for just one semester at Berkeley. Berkeley did not maintain records of Wright’s academic coursework, research, or the classes he taught; the school could only confirm he was employed as a teaching assistant that semester in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Like any electrical engineering student, Wright could have spent a week learning about solar or teaching it in a single class, but absent hard evidence, there is no way to be sure.

In February 1986, Wright returned to MIT, where he would remain until January 1988 before dropping out, the school confirmed. A 1991 paper he copublished with other researchers focused on electrical engineering, but it made no mention of applications for solar energy.

More than forty academics who were enrolled in or taught graduate school at either Berkeley or MIT in those years either did not respond or denied recalling Wright, much less what classes he took or what he researched.

According to a 2019 résumé Wright submitted to Congress, he published fifty-seven research articles between 1989 and 2019, most of which were presented at fossil fuel industry conferences, symposia, and meetings. Besides his first two articles on spacecraft and power converters, all other research has been directly related to fossil fuel extraction.

According to his 2019 résumé, from 1985 to 1989, Wright worked at Hunter Geophysics, a company based in California’s Bay Area, while he was still enrolled at MIT for graduate work on the other side of the country. It is unclear, and a spokesperson for the Energy Department declined to comment on, how Wright accomplished both decades before the remote-work era.

On the Case

Wright’s known career consists entirely of working in or leading fracking companies. The few recent investments that he or his companies have made in alternative energy sources like advanced nuclear, geothermal, and battery power have been widely publicized, but none of them are related to solar energy.

In August 2019, Wright suggested otherwise when he appeared before a now-dismantled House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis in a hearing focused on renewable energy solutions in Colorado. At the hearing, he submitted a résumé claiming that immediately after ending his graduate work at Berkeley, he joined Hunter Geophysics. At that firm, Wright claimed that he “designed charging circuits for solar panels to remotely and continuously power electronic monitoring equipment.”

But Hunter Geophysics never did any work related to solar energy, according to Bruce Braden, the now-defunct company’s chief financial officer. Instead, the Mountain View, California–based company was an early pioneer in fracking technology.

Not every congressional hearing is under oath, but Wright filled out a standard “Truth in Testimony” disclosure before his appearance asking about any potential conflict of interest (he didn’t list any). Even if congressional witnesses aren’t under oath, “they are supposed to be truthful when they give comments, because that could be considered lying to Congress,” noted a staffer for the now-defunct climate committee’s chair, Rep. Kathy Castor (D-FL). It is unclear whether Wright was under oath during that 2019 hearing, and the staffer did not respond to additional questions.

Wright and Braden would go on to cofound two fracking companies together, Pinnacle Technologies and Stroud Energy, Braden said. Both were sold in 2006. Braden isn’t aware of any solar energy work that Wright has ever done.

In 2010, Wright started Denver-based Liberty Resources, and in 2011, he started Denver-based Liberty Oilfield Services. Both are types of fracking companies; Liberty Resources, like ExxonMobil or Chevron, is an exploration and drilling company, while Liberty Oilfield Services, like Halliburton, fracks, pumps, and transports the oil and gas. Other companies Wright worked for or helmed — Resources Engineering Systems and Liberty Midstream Solutions — were also fracking companies with no involvement in solar.

Liberty Oilfield Services went public in 2018, and in 2022, the company changed its name to Liberty Energy.

In July 2022, Liberty Energy invested $10 million in Fervo Energy, a geothermal energy company. In September 2022, the company invested in Natron Energy, a sodium-ion battery manufacturer. In January 2024, Liberty announced an investment in Oklo, an alternative nuclear-fission company that until recently had Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, as its chairman.

Wright joined Oklo’s board and bought company shares in July 2024 before becoming energy secretary. Wright has not submitted a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure noting he has sold those shares, even as his office recently maintained a $575 million loan in the small modular nuclear reactor industry while cutting loans to other carbon-cutting sectors.

Prior to joining the government, Wright also owned shares in EMX Royalties, which acquires mineral mining royalties, including for precious, battery, and base minerals, according to his executive branch ethics disclosure form. Wright was also a director of Urban Solution Group, a private company that creates physical barriers, processes permitting, and provides public relations help for oil and gas drilling companies seeking to work near residential areas, according to his executive branch financial disclosures. Neither of these companies work in the solar energy industry.

On his executive branch disclosure, Wright also listed many nonprofits, foundations, and trade groups for which he serves as a board member, including fossil fuel advocacy organizations like Western Energy Alliance and the Domestic Energy Producers Alliance as well as dark money-funded free-market think tanks like Property and Environmental Research Center and the Pacific Research Institute. None of these organizations are involved in solar energy.

In January 2024, Wright’s fracking company Liberty Energy announced the creation of the Bettering Human Lives Foundation with a $1 million seed donation, which lists Wright as its principal officer and Anne Hyre, Wright’s sister-in-law, as its executive director and sole employee. So far, the new and small nonprofit exclusively “supports” liquid petroleum gas nonprofits and “social enterprise” companies in Ghana and Kenya.

Wright also serves as the managing member of four holding companies, his executive branch disclosure stated. Three are used as holding companies for his shares in other endeavors: an oil and gas production company called Urban Solutions Group, and an IPO shell company. But it is unclear what the fourth shell company, Sol 2 LLC, is for. Wright has held “one unreportable asset” in the LLC since May 2021 and is a comanaging member of the Cherry Hills, Colorado, company. Does “Sol” stand for solar? The Energy Department spokesperson would not say.

On the now-scrubbed corporate biographies of Wright at Liberty Energy and EMX Royalty Corporation, both publicly traded companies, Wright’s biographies do not mention him working in solar energy. Public companies that state false information could be liable for securities fraud.

Three entities affiliated with Wright — the Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, Liberty Energy, and Nomad Proppant, LLC — are party to a battle-royale federal lawsuit to kill a Biden-era rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose some of their climate risks and greenhouse gas emissions. The rule would make greenwashing or other false statements about climate change a securities law violation. The rule and the litigation have both been paused but not thrown out — even as the Trump SEC has exited the litigation — because blue-state attorneys general intervened, asking the court to reject arguments that the rule exceeded SEC authority.

Why Lie?

Wright has been a pioneer in fracking technology. He has worked in oil and gas as far back as 1985, started over half a dozen fracking companies, and has authored dozens of papers and presentations on oil and gas industry research. However, the solar endeavor he described to Congress in 2019, Hunter Geophysics, appears to be a fabrication.

Even if he took a class on solar at Berkeley, or Sol 2 LLC represents a minimal investment in solar, for him to at times give such circumstances equal billing as his four decades of investment in oil and gas is, at a minimum, deeply misleading.

Why would a fossil fuel mogul like Wright fabricate experience in solar? Possibly because Wright likes to fashion himself as not just another fossil fuel executive. According to his LinkedIn bio, Wright is a “tech nerd turned entrepreneur,” a black turtleneck on an oil rig. Chris Wright doesn’t mention solar when he needs to green wash his career; he mentions it when he needs to green wash himself.

“Secretary Wright has been sharply critical of renewable energy and solar, specifically that it is unreliable and that it is not an advantageous energy source in comparison to fossil fuels,” said Slocum at Public Citizen. None of these criticisms are factual, Slocum added.

Solar energy’s benefits are myriad, according to the Department of Energy’s own website: In addition to lowering energy bills, solar energy is plentiful, clean, raises home values, and reduces water usage and greenhouse gas emissions. It can also serve as a useful way to get energy to remote communities and places with expensive electric grids, the agency has asserted.

The Department of Energy currently oversees an energy loan portfolio that includes eleven solar energy projects with issued loans worth $10 billion and one conditional commitment worth $62 million, according to its website. Five of the project loans total over $1 billion.

On climate and energy policy, Wright’s approach is no different from any past Republican Secretary of Energy, said Slocum: manipulate all possible regulatory authority to artificially prop up fossil fuels.

Wright, for example, has reportedly lobbied Congress to extend Inflation Reduction Act clean energy tax credits for nuclear and geothermal, but not for wind and solar.

Wright’s greenwashing of his own career appears to have paid political dividends: The Senate confirmed Wright, 59-38. No Republican voted against him, and seven Democrats and one Democratic-affiliated independent voted for him, including both of Colorado’s Democratic senators, John Hickenlooper and Michael Bennet.

Neither Hickenlooper nor Bennet responded to multiple requests for comment.

Wright left Liberty Energy on February 3, 2025, so he could become the secretary of energy. A month after Wright left, on March 5, 2025, Liberty Energy acquired IMG Energy Solutions, a diverse energy company that provides “microgrids,” which are on-site, modular natural gas plants accompanied by grids of solar arrays. The Pittsburgh International Airport is currently powered by an IMG hybrid gas/solar grid.

This marked Liberty Energy’s first-ever foray into solar energy, according to Tom Curran, a senior securities analyst who covers Liberty Energy at Seaport Research Partners. Two days later, Wright sold the last of his shares in Liberty Energy.",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20144902/GettyImages-2209243919.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 13:09:42.824136

All four SMRS are to be located next to the Darlington nuclear power plant east of Toronto and are expected to be running by 2035.","Ontario has always been a clean-energy giant, deriving half of its electricity from nuclear power and 25 percent from hydroelectricity.

Now, the central Canadian province is preparing to expand its nuclear energy capacity to meet rising electricity demand.

Under a strategy released June 12 called ‘Energy for Generations’, ""nuclear power will continue to serve as the backbone of the province's electricity system providing the 24/7 baseload power the province's economy requires.”

Electricity demand is expected to rise by 75 percent by 2050. The framework aligns with previously announced nuclear spending, including CAD$20.9 billion for small modular reactors (SMRs), and could total 10,000 megawatts of additional nuclear capacity costing more than $150 billion.

According to World Nuclear News, Energy for Generations builds on a 2024 vision paper setting out a comprehensive assessment of the challenges facing the province's energy system, including the need to meet rapidly growing demand, electrify key sectors, and maintain reliability, all while keeping energy rates down.

“With this blueprint, Ontario has the opportunity to lead the world in both small and large nuclear development,” the publication quotes Ontario Power Generation’s president and CEO Nicolle Butcher. ""Coupled with our expanding hydroelectric portfolio and other low-carbon technologies, the growth of a reliable provincial grid will also boost economies and strengthen our energy security.”

To accomplish its goal, the province plans to refurbish existing nuclear power plants. Bruce units 1 and 2 have already been refurbished and were returned to service more than a decade ago. A second refurbishment of those units “remains an available option that can be explored under the existing contract between Bruce Power and the IESO,” Ontario's Independent Electricity System Operator, the plan said.

Ontario is also looking at new large-scale nuclear generation. World Nuclear News states: Pre-development work has already begun to site the first large-scale nuclear build in Ontario since 1993 at the existing Bruce nuclear site; OPG is advancing early-stage planning for new large-scale nuclear generation at Wesleyville, Port Hope.

The Ontario government has green-lit Ontario Power Generation to build the first of four Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) at the Darlington New Nuclear Project site.

OPG says it will be the first commercial grid-scale SMR in North America, with an in-service target date of 2030, and the first new nuclear build in Ontario in more than three decades.

Ontario government support for the CAD$20.9 billion project came after OPG received a Licence to Construct in April from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. The first SMR would cost $7.7 billion. All four SMRS are to be located next to the Darlington nuclear power plant east of Toronto and are expected to be running by 2035.

SMRs are constructed with prefabricated modules and can be transported by truck or by rail — making them ideal for remote locations where a conventional reactor would not be feasible. Another important advantage is they are less likely to overheat, because their small cores produce less heat than those of large reactors. They also have fewer moving parts, including coolant pumps, which reduces the likelihood of failures that could cause an accident. The fuel, steam and generator are all in one vessel.

Their small size and lower cost compared to large nuclear reactors makes Small Modular Reactors more versatile, meaning significantly more utilities will be able to use them.

Meanwhile, Ontario wants to expand power transmission to supply major mining developments including critical minerals projects in the remote Ring of Fire region. Industrial demand for electricity is forecast to rise 50 percent in the next five years.

With provincial trade barriers poised to fall — a goal of the new federal government elected in April — The Northern Miner reports Ontario could source uranium from Saskatchewan’s Athabasca Basin, a global hotspot for uranium production.

Ontario’s plan also proposes building new east-west transmission corridors to support energy security and critical minerals development.

Analysts suggest the nuclear expansion could sustain long-term uranium demand, despite challenges, including Ontario’s lack of uranium enrichment facilities, reliance on foreign suppliers, and the risk of cost overruns and delays that have affected other SMR projects.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.
The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill.
The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.","WASHINGTON (AP) — House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.

Republicans in the two chambers don't agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.

The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.

While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.

Here’s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:

The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.

The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump's second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.

Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.

The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.

The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that’s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.

The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.

The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.

And on Social Security, the bills don't directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That's a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

“This needs a lot of work. It’s really concerning and I’m really surprised by it,” he said. “Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.”

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden's climate law. It aimed to boost the nation’s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn't include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

The company has entered into a five-year agreement to purchase Green-e’s certified renewable energy certificates (REC), which are expected to offset 100% of its electricity consumption in North America.
By sourcing Green-e’s RECs, Yokogawa ensures its energy use is matched by electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar.
The REC initiative is one of several sustainability measures Yokogawa is implementing to meet its long-term, environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives.
“Our renewable energy purchase is a critical part of our sustainability roadmap,” says Bhavin Patel, EVP of Yokogawa’s North American operations.","Yokogawa Corp. of America reported May 22 that it’s launching a long-term, renewable energy initiative as part of its sustainability strategy. The company has entered into a five-year agreement to purchase Green-e’s certified renewable energy certificates (REC), which are expected to offset 100% of its electricity consumption in North America.

The contract took effect on Apr. 1 and runs through Mar. 31, 2030. It will offset approximately 6,000 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity use per year. This is equivalent to Yokogawa’s total annual energy consumption at its North American operations.

By sourcing Green-e’s RECs, Yokogawa ensures its energy use is matched by electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar. This move underscores the company’s commitment to environmental responsibility, and aligns with broader corporate goals to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and support the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Environmental Justice in Regulatory Actions The EPA proposed a suite of regulatory actions in 2024, several with Environmental Justice implications.
Environmental Justice in the ABA In 2021 the ABA House of Delegates adopted Resolution 513, which committed the ABA to advancing environmental justice principles and considerations in its programs, policies, and activities, with the ABA Board of Governors concurrently establishing the “Environmental Justice Task Force” (EJTF) to lead implementation efforts.","I. Environmental Justice Executive Orders

In 2024 the Biden-Harris Administration, expanded on the supporting frameworks of Executive Order 14008 - Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad (2021) and Executive Order 14096 - Revitalizing our Nation’s Commitment to Environmental Justice for All (2023), establishing tools and strategies to address inequities experienced in environmental justice communities and communities throughout the country.

In late 2023 and throughout 2024, many federal agencies held virtual community engagement listening sessions, as departments accepted public comments and input in drafting their environmental justice strategic plans. The Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Interior(DOI), Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) each released updated Environmental Justice Strategic Plans in 2024. In May 2024, President Biden announced twelve additional members to the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council, created by E.O. 14008.

In May 2024, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Implementing Regulations Revisions Phase 2 rule. The Phase 2 rule directs agencies to consider “disproportionate and adverse effects on communities with environmental justice concerns” when determining the appropriate level of NEPA review, considering alternatives, and analyzing the proposed action’s environmental impacts. Soon thereafter, twenty states filed a lawsuit against the White House CEQ attempting to block the rulemaking. On November 12, 2024, in Marin Audubon Society v. FAA, a divided panel of D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the rules as “ultra vires” and are non-binding on federal agencies.

II. Environmental Justice Screening Tools

On April 23, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released their Environmental Justice Clearinghouse website providing an online collection of environmental justice resources to assist stakeholders. In July, the Biden Administration updated the Environmental Justice Scorecard to Phase Two. The Environmental Justice Scorecard is a government-wide assessment of Federal agencies’ efforts to advance environmental justice, providing transparency and accountability to the federal government’s efforts to secure environmental justice for all. Additionally in July, EPA updated the EJScreen tool to EJSCREEN 2.3, adding data on nitrogen dioxide levels, drinking water non-compliance, Superfund sites boundaries, extreme heat, private drinking wells, air toxics cancer risk, and EJ grants from EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights (OEJECR).

III. Environmental Justice in Environmental Enforcement

In 2024, approximately 50% of EPA inspections and enforcement cases addressed facilities in overburdened and underserved communities. In fiscal year (FY) 2024, the EPA concluded forty-nine enforcement cases, including agreements to perform voluntary Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs), collectively generating more than $9.5 million. Some notable enforcement cases include: The County of Hawai’i and the Guam Waterworks Authority Clean Water Act wastewater treatment cases, including more than $1 billion of injunctive relief; a $1.4 million settlement with Sasol Chemicals over violations of the chemical accident prevention provisions of the Clean Air Act at the company’s facility in Westlake, Louisiana, near the historic Mossville community; and the Heritage Crystal-Clean, LLC settlement for violations of hazardous waste and used oil waste management requirements in communities overburdened by pollution, including Indianapolis, IN; Shreveport, LA; Atlanta, GA; Fairless Hills, PA; and Denver, CO.

DOJ, in conjunction with the EPA, concluded significant environmental enforcement cases resulting in notable impacts for environmental justice communities, such as a Hilcorp Energy Company settlement resolving Clean Air Act violations at the company’s oil and gas production operations in New Mexico resulting in the reduction of more than 113,000 tons’ of CO2; the Lima Refining Company settlement enforcing a civil penalty of $19 million and implementation of an estimated $150 million in capital investments, for unlawfully exposing the surrounding community in Ohio to toxic benzene emissions and other hazardous pollutants; and the $310 million settlement reached with Norfolk Southern to address harms caused by the East Palestine Train Derailment. Information about other significant enforcement actions is found in the Department of Justice Comprehensive Environmental Justice Enforcement Strategy Second Annual Report, December 2024.

IV. Environmental Justice in Regulatory Actions

The EPA proposed a suite of regulatory actions in 2024, several with Environmental Justice implications. In late March - early April, the EPA released multiple rules targeting the reduction of hazardous air pollutants ethylene oxide and chloroprene, including fenceline monitoring. In June 2024, the EPA released its Climate Adaptation Plan promoting efforts to prepare for climate impacts, build resilience, and support climate-smart solutions and investments that work for communities across the country. In October, EPA finalized strengthened standards for identifying and cleaning up lead paint dust in pre-1978 homes and childcare facilities and finalized a rule to Protect Farmworkers, Families and Communities from Pesticide Exposures. In November 2024, the EPA proposed New Source Performance Standards on Stationary and Combustion Turbines - to help limit harmful nitrogen oxide pollutants.

One of the most monumental regulatory actions by the Biden-Harris Administration was the issuance of a final rule requiring drinking water systems across the country to identify and replace lead pipes within ten years, paired with the investment of $2.6 billion in newly available drinking water infrastructure funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Finally, in late 2024, the EPA released a draft of the Interim Framework for Advancing Consideration of Cumulative Impacts,providing agency programs and regional offices with tools and principles to consider cumulative impacts in their work.

V. Environmental Justice and Title VI

Under Administrator Michael Regan, EPA has accepted for investigation an unprecedented number of civil rights complaints filed under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as part of an agency-wide commitment to enforce civil rights and advance environmental justice. Title VI prohibits recipients of federal financial assistance from discrimination based on race, color, or national origin with the potential to provide a remedy for decades of discriminatory decisions that have shaped access to clean air, water, soil, and now protection from extreme weather. EPA recently published a transparent, searchable database of the agency’s civil rights docket, joined DOJ in issuing a 2024 Joint Interagency Statement of Shared Commitment to Ensure Compliance with Civil Rights Laws and Advance Environmental Justice and issued Civil Rights Guidance on Procedural Safeguards: Requirements and Best Practices.

A. Title VI Resolution Agreements

In February 2024, EPA entered an Informal Resolution Agreement with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, committing Illinois EPA to address civil rights and environmental justice in construction air permitting for major sources. The agreement resolved a Title VI complaint filed by a coalition of two Chicago-based environmental justice organizations regarding the proposed relocation of the General Iron metal shredding operation from a predominantly wealthy white area to Chicago’s Southeast Side, a neighborhood with significant populations of residents of color and non-English speakers and already overburdened by polluting facilities. The resolution agreement requires Illinois EPA to screen permit applications for potential disparate impacts and, in such cases, consider past compliance history, cumulative impacts, and potential mitigation through increased agency resources or permit conditions for disproportionate and adverse impacts identified through the analysis. The agreement follows a May 2023 agreement resulting from findings of noncompliance relating to the same proposed General Iron relocation by HUD. The HUD negotiations spurred the issuance of Chicago’s Executive Order to Advance Environmental Justice and a baseline Cumulative Impacts Assessment co-designed by the City and community representatives, environmental leaders, and local partners. The City met many of its obligations under that agreement in 2023, however, progress on others stalled in 2024.

Resolving a civil rights complaint filed through a State of Michigan grievance procedure, Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) entered into an agreement on August 29, 2024, with members of Detroit’s Eastside community regarding the renewal of a hazardous waste facility license. The agreement commits EGLE to conduct environmental justice analyses and cumulative impact reviews before issuing or renewing a license to a hazardous waste facility and must deny such a license if it will cause unlawful impacts to the environment or human health.

B. Challenges to Enforcement of Title VI

On August 22, 2024, Judge James D. Cain, Jr. of the Western District of Louisiana issued a permanent injunction against EPA and DOJ, blocking them from enforcing their disparate impact regulations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The ruling came in the Louisiana v. EPA case filed in 2023.

The suit responded to EPA’s investigation and a subsequent Letter of Concern issued in response to three civil rights complaints filed by residents of St. John the Baptist and St. James Parishes in Louisiana’s Cancer Alley. These complaints alleged racial discrimination under Title VI in the permitting of industrial facilities in communities long facing some of the nation’s highest cancer risks from toxic air pollution. The EPA Letter of Concern outlined the “substantially disproportionate” cancer risk borne by Black residents living nearest to sources of harmful emissions and identified a possible “causal link” between state agency action and “the adverse and disproportionate distribution of the cancer and toxicity risks” for Black residents.

The permanent injunction followed a preliminary injunction issued in early 2024, prohibiting both agencies from enforcing the decades-old disparate impact provisions of their Title VI regulations against the state of Louisiana or any Louisiana state agency, and expanded its reach to any entity receiving federal funds. In dicta, Judge Cain wrote he “agrees that the unlawful disparate-impact regulations are illegal anywhere in the United States.” On September 19, 2024, Louisiana filed a Motion to Amend the Judgment requesting that the court vacate EPA’s and DOJ’s disparate impact regulations “without any geographic limitations.”

On April 16, 2024, prior to the Louisiana v. EPA ruling, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody filed a petition for rulemaking on behalf of a twenty-three state coalition requesting EPA rescind its disparate impact regulations. The petition has garnered responses from advocacy groups and a coalition of attorneys general. To date, Judge Cain has not ruled on the Motion to Amend, nor EPA on the petition for rulemaking.

VI. Environmental Justice and Federal Funding

On December 12, 2024, the Biden-Harris Administration announced nearly $1.6 billion in Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grants to 105 applicants. EPA cited the Community Change Grants Program as “the single largest investment in environmental and climate justice in history.” The grant program dedicates $600 million to Target Investment Areas intended to benefit disadvantaged communities with unique circumstances, geography, and needs, including approximately $150 million for Alaska Native communities and organizations.

In December 2023, EPA awarded $600 million to eleven Grantmakers in each of EPA’s regions through the Environmental Justice Thriving Communities Grantmaking program. These funds are intended as sub-grants to community-based nonprofits and other eligible subrecipients to alleviate much of the burden that the federal grants process places on small, resource-constrained community-based organizations supporting underserved communities and marginalized populations. Grantmakers in most regions began accepting applications in 2024.

2024 saw New York adopt or institute several EJ-related measures. On December 21, 2024, Governor Hochul signed into lawS.8357/A.8866, which expands the state’s ban on hydraulic fracturing by prohibiting the use of carbon dioxide in the process, in part to advance EJ. On December 26, 2024, the Governor signed into lawS.2129-B/A.3351-B, which establishes a “Climate Superfund,” making large fossil fuel companies responsible for climate change adaptation projects in the state. Lastly, on December 30, 2024, Section 70-0118 of the Environmental Conservation Law went into effect, which prohibits state agencies from issuing permits that would impose a “disproportionate pollution burden” on an EJ community.

2. Massachusetts

Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey and Lt. Governor Kim Driscoll released the first-ever Environmental Justice Strategy on February 15, 2024. The strategy aims to integrate environmental justice principles into state policies and programs, ensuring equitable environmental protections for all residents. The plan includes meaningful community engagement, analysis of project benefits and burdens, staff training, and progress tracking, as well as each agency’s plan to incorporate environmental justice initiatives into their work.

3. Maryland

On October 1, 2024 Maryland enacted HB 233. This bill updates the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area Protection Program to require equity in the distribution of burdens and benefits associated with development, restoration, conservation, and adaptation efforts, including public access to water, shorelines, and other natural areas, particularly for underserved or overburdened communities.

VIII. Environmental Justice in the Courts

A. Montana

On December 18, 2024, the Montana Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s decision that the state’s constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment includes a right to a stable climate system. The court found that the state’s prohibition on consideration of greenhouse gas emissions during environmental reviews harmed the youth plaintiffs.

B. New Jersey

On October 29, 2024, a New Jersey appellate court affirmed the trial court’s denial of leave to amend the complaint to include substantive due process claims, finding that a fundamental right to a stable environment is not explicitly stated in the New Jersey Constitution and is not “objectively and deeply rooted in the traditions, history, and conscience of the people of [New Jersey].”

C. Louisiana

In January 2024, a state trial court held that Louisiana’s public trust doctrine “requires consideration of ‘economic, social, and other factors’ broad enough to constitute an analysis of environmental justice, as defined by EPA.” The court nonethelessdecided that LDEQ’s EJ analysis was sufficient. The Louisiana Supreme Court declined to review the decision.

D. North Carolina

In September 2024, North Carolina’s Environmental Justice Community Action Network agreed to a proposed consent decree with the owners of North Carolina’s largest landfill following two notices of intents to sue. The agreement mandates the elimination of PFAS discharges, the implementation of air monitoring systems, and other protections for the rural, predominantly Black and Latino neighborhood of Snow Hill in Roseboro, North Carolina.

On December 4, 2024, the Town of Carrboro, North Carolina brought suit against Duke Energy Corporation on behalf of underserved and marginalized communities, alleging that the company engaged in a deception campaign regarding the dangers of fossil fuel that contributed to the climate crisis. The lawsuit includes claims for negligence, public nuisance, and private nuisance.

IX. Environmental Justice in the ABA

In 2021 the ABA House of Delegates adopted Resolution 513, which committed the ABA to advancing environmental justice principles and considerations in its programs, policies, and activities, with the ABA Board of Governors concurrently establishing the “Environmental Justice Task Force” (EJTF) to lead implementation efforts.

The EJTF and Section co-sponsored a spate of EJ programs in 2024. On October 30, 2024, they co-hosted a webinar, “Environmental Justice: Where are We Now and Where are We Headed.” This was a pre-symposium webinar to explore the legal strategies, challenges, and future of environmental justice, including recent legal actions against the EPA and shifts in policy.

On November 14, 2024, they co-sponsored an Environmental Justice Day of Service. Section members and other program partners visited classrooms in three Washington, D.C. schools to discuss the history and current practice of environmental protection and justice in the United States, offering insight into the role of environmental law in addressing daily issues and shaping equity.

On November 15, 2024, they co-sponsored an Environmental Justice Symposium, ""Legal Strategies & Solutions for Putting Equity into Action,"" at Howard University School of Law. The symposium was preceded by a career roundtable and reception geared toward students and early-career professionals in environmental law and policy, pairing senior mentors from the Section and other program partners with mentees to discuss the diverse ways in which legal practice incorporates environmental justice.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-kids-123318225.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 07:02:46.699326

June 20, 2025

Canada is the world’s third-largest exporter of oil, fourth-largest producer, and top source of imports to the United States. Much of Canada’s oil wealth is concentrated in the oil sands in northern Alberta, which hosts 99 percent of the country’s enormous oil endowment: about 160 billion barrels of proven reserves, of a total resource of approximately 1.8 trillion barrels. This is the major source of oil to the United States refinery complex, a large part of which is optimized for the oil sands’ heavy oil.

Reliability of energy supply has remerged as a major geopolitical issue. Canadian oil and gas is an essential component of North American energy security. Yet a proposed cap on emissions from the sectors promises to cut Canadian production and exports in the years ahead. It would be hard to provide less environmental benefit for a higher economic and security cost. There are far better ways to reduce emissions while maintaining North America’s security of energy supply.

The high cost of the cap

In 1994 a Liberal federal government, Alberta provincial conservative government and representatives from the oil and gas industry, working together through the national oil sands task force, developed A New Energy Vision for Canada. Their efforts turned what was then a middling resource into a trillion dollar nation-building project. Production has increased tenfold since the report came out.

The task force acknowledged the need for industry to “put its best efforts toward … reducing greenhouse gas emissions.” However, it also expected governments to “understand” that there “is no benefit to Canada or to the environment to have production and value-added processing done outside of the country in less efficient jurisdictions … policies set by regulator must not result in discouraging oil sands production.”

As part of its efforts to meet its climate goals under the Paris Accord, the Canadian government proposed a regulatory framework for an emissions cap on the oil and gas sector in December 2023. It set a legally binding limit on greenhouse gas emissions, targeting a 35 to 38 percent reduction from 2019 levels by 2030 for upstream operations, through regulations to be made under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA).

The federal government has not yet finalized its proposed regulations. However, industry experts and economists have criticized the current iteration as logistically unworkable, overly expensive, and likely to be challenged as unconstitutional. In effect, this policy layers a cap-and-trade system for just one sector (oil and gas) on top of a competing carbon pricing mechanism (the large-emitter trading systems, often referred to as the industrial carbon price), a discriminatory practice that also undermines the entire economic rationale of a carbon pricing system.

While the Canadian government has maintained that it is focused on reducing emissions rather than production – the latter of which would put it at odds with provincial jurisdiction over non-renewable resources – a series of third party analyses as well as the Parliamentary Budget Office’s own impact assessment find it would indeed constrain Canadian oil and gas production. The economic cost of the emissions cap far exceeds any corresponding benefit in reduced emissions.

How much will the emissions cap cost in terms of dollar per tonne of carbon in avoided emissions, both domestically and globally? Based solely on the cost to the Canadian economy, we estimate the emission cap is equivalent to a C$2,887/tonne carbon price by 2032.

Assuming no impact on global demand and full substitution by non-Canadian crudes, it finds that the cost of each tonne of carbon displaced globally is between C$96,000 to C$289,000 for oil sands bitumen production. For displaced Canadian conventional and natural gas, the cost is infinite, i.e. global emissions would actually be higher for every barrel or unit of Canadian oil and gas displaced with competitor products as a result of the emissions cap.

Canadian oil and gas emissions reduction efforts

The oil and gas sector is the highest emitting economic sector in Canada. However, it has made substantial efforts to reduce emissions over the past two decades and is succeeding. Absolute emissions in the sector peaked in 2014, despite production growing by over a million barrels of oil equivalent since (see Figure 1).

Much of this success can be attributed to methane capture, particularly in the natural gas and conventional oil sectors, where absolute emissions peaked in 2007 and 2014 respectively.

Since 2014, the oil sands have dramatically increased production by over a million barrels per day, but at the same time have reduced the emissions per barrel every year, leaving the absolute emissions of the oil and gas sector relatively flat. The oil sands are performing well vis-à-vis their international peers, seeing their emissions per barrel decline by 30 percent since 2013, compared to 21 percent for global majors and 34 percent for US E&Ps (exploration and production companies) (see Figure 2).

On an emissions intensity absolute basis, the oil sands have significantly outperformed their peers, shaving off 25kg/barrel of emissions since 2013 (see Figure 3) and more than 65kg/barrel since the oil sands task force wrote their report in 1994.

As emissions improvements from methane reductions plateau, the oil sands are likely to outperform their conventional peers in emissions per barrel reductions going forward. The sector is working on strategies such as solvent extraction and carbon capture and storage that, if implemented, would reduce the life-cycle emissions per barrel of oil sands to levels at or below the global crude average.

The high cost of the cap

Several parties have analyzed the proposed emissions cap to determine its economic and production impact. The results of the assessments vary widely. For the purposes of this commentary we rely on the federal Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO), which published its analysis of the proposed emissions cap in March 2025. Helpfully, the PBO provided a table summarizing the main findings of the various analyses (see Table 1).

The PBO found that the required reduction in upstream oil and gas sector production levels under an emissions cap would lower real gross domestic product (GDP) in Canada by 0.33 percent in 2030 and 0.39 percent in 2032, and reduce nominal GDP by C$20.5 billion by 2032. The PBO further estimated that achieving the legal upper bound would reduce economy-wide employment in Canada by 40,300 jobs and full-time equivalents by 54,400 in 2032.

However, the PBO does not estimate the carbon price per tonne of emissions reduced. This is a useful metric as Canadians have become broadly familiar with the real-world impacts of a price on carbon. The federal government quashed the consumer carbon price at $80/tonne in March 2025, ahead of the federal election, due to its unpopularity and perceived impacts on affordability. The federal carbon pricing benchmark is scheduled to hit C$170 in 2030. ECCC has quantified the damages of a tonne of carbon dioxide – referred to as the “Social Cost of Carbon” – as C$294/tonne.

Based on PBO assumptions that the emissions cap will reduce emissions by 7.1MT and reduce GDP by $20.5 billion in 2032, the implied carbon price is C$2,887/tonne.

Emissions cap impact in a global context

Even this eye-popping figure does not tell the full story. The Canadian oil and gas production that must be withdrawn to meet the requirements of the emissions cap will be replaced in global markets from other producers; there is no reason to assume the emissions cap will affect global demand.

Based on life-cycle GHG emissions of the sample of crudes used in the US refinery complex, Canadian oil sands produce only 1 to 3 percent higher emissions than a global average[1] (see Figure 4), with some facilities producing lower emissions than the average barrel.

As such, the emissions cap, if applied just to oil sands production, would only displace global emissions of 71,000 to 213,000 tonnes (1 to 3 percent of 7.1MT). At a cost of C$20.5 billion for those global emissions reductions, the price of carbon is equivalent to C$96,000 to C$289,000 per tonne (see Figure 5).

For any displaced conventional Canadian crude oil or natural gas, the situation becomes absurd. Because Canadian conventional oil and natural gas have a lower emissions intensity than global averages, global product substitutions resulting from the emissions cap would actually serve to increase global emissions, resulting in an infinite price per tonne of carbon.

The C$100k/tonne carbon price estimate is probably low

We believe our assessment of the effective carbon price of the emissions cap at C$96,000+/tonne to be conservative for the following reasons.

First, it assumes Canadian heavy oil will be displaced in global markets by an average, archetypal crude. In fact, it would be displaced by other heavy crudes from places like Venezuela, Mexico, and Iraq (see Figure 4), which have higher average emissions per barrel than Canadian oil sands crudes. In such a circumstance, global emissions would actually rise and the price per carbon tonne from an emissions cap on oil sands production would also effectively be infinite.

Secondly, emissions cap impact assumptions by the PBO are likely conservative. Those by ECCC, based on a particular scenario outlook, are already outdated. ECCC assumed a production loss of only 0.7 percent by 2030, with oil sands production hitting approximately 3.7 million barrels (MMbbls) per day of bitumen production in 2030. According to S&P Global analysis, that level is likely to be hit this year.[2]

S&P further forecasts oil sands production to reach 4.0 MMbbls by 2030, or about 300,000 barrels more than it produces today. This would represent a far lower production growth rate than the oil sands have experienced in the past five years. But assuming the S&P forecast is correct, production would need to decline in the oil sands by 8 percent to meet the emissions cap requirements. PBO assumed only a 5.4 percent overall oil and gas production loss and ECCC assumed only 0.7 percent, while Conference Board of Canada assumed an 11.1 percent loss and Deloitte assumed 11.5 percent (see Table 1). Production numbers to date more closely align with Conference Board of Canada and Deloitte projections.

Let’s make the Canadian oil and gas sector better, not smaller

The Canadian oil and gas sector, and in particular the oil sands, has a responsibility to do their part to reduce emissions while maintaining competitive businesses that can support good Canadian jobs, provide government revenues and diversify exports. The oil sands sector has re-invested for decades in continuous improvements to drive down production costs while improving its emissions per barrel.

It is hard to conceive of a more expensive and divisive way to reduce emissions from the sector and from the Canadian economy than the proposed emissions cap. Other expensive programs, such as Norway’s EV subsidies, the United Kingdom’s offshore wind contracts-for-difference, Germany’s Energiewende feed-in-tariffs and surcharges, and US Inflation Reduction Act investment tax credits, don’t come close to the high costs of the emissions cap on a price-per-tonne of carbon abated basis.

The emissions cap, as currently proposed, will make Canada’s oil and gas sector significantly less competitive, harm investment, and undermine Canada’s vision to be an energy superpower. This policy will also reduce the oil and gas sector’s capacity to invest in technologies that drive additional emission reductions, such as solvents and carbon capture, especially in our current lower price environment. As such it is more likely to undermine climate action than support it.

The federal and provincial governments have come together to advance a vision for Canadian energy in the past. In this moment, they have the opportunity once again to find real solutions to the climate challenge while harnessing the energy sector to advance Canada’s economic well-being, productivity, and global energy security.

The clean energy jobs boom is also happening in the communities that need it most: 81% of investment in clean energy industries since the IRA passed has flowed into counties with below-average weekly wages.
In March, Administrator Zeldin notified National Clean Investment Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator recipients of the termination of their grant agreements under the Biden-Harris Administration’s $20 billion ‘gold bar’ scheme.
“To unlock the full potential of rooftop and community solar, we need private capital at the table.
“As federal support for crucial climate projects becomes uncertain, the leadership of local governments, paired with private capital, is essential to fill the gap,” Dollaride CEO Su Sanni said.","The Trump administration’s economic policies have been summarized by most major financial institutions under the industry’s greatest pejorative: uncertainty. It’s bad enough when applied to yo-yo-ing tariffs that can send the economy teetering toward recession. And perhaps even worse when playing with the future of the planet: $27 billion in funding for companies and funds addressing the climate crisis that, if unabated, the World Economic Forum has estimated costing society as much as $75 trillion by 2050. Why was this funding frozen, and what can private investors do about it?

GGRF Funds in Limbo

Over the past 100+ days, there has been a bitter battle over the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), a $27 billion vehicle approved during the Biden administration designed to “finance clean technology deployment nationally, finance clean technology deployment in low-income and disadvantaged communities while simultaneously building the capacity of community lenders that serve those communities, and spur adoption of clean distributed solar energy that lowers energy bills for millions of Americans in low-income and disadvantaged communities.”

One of the goals of this fund was to more effectively de-politicize what has too often been a hot potato industry in Washington: renewable energy, by focusing on the concrete, economic benefits that climate change mitigation and technological development can bring to communities. As noted in Forbes, clean energy jobs have historically grown at twice the national rate, and are more accessible to the average American: “Clean energy jobs create economic mobility, with 21% higher wages than average, increasing access to unions, and expanding accessibility – 75% of expected jobs from IRA [Inflation Reduction Act]

investments won’t require a four-year degree. The clean energy jobs boom is also happening in the communities that need it most: 81% of investment in clean energy industries since the IRA passed has flowed into counties with below-average weekly wages. From wind turbine technician being the fastest-growing job in America to auto manufacturing jobs hitting a 34-year peak – all signs point to clean energy as the path to building a stronger U.S. economy.”

And yet, despite this strong economic data, on March 11, The EPA ordered Citibank to freeze the fund, in a move Senator Schumer, Markey, Warren, Whitehouse, Van Hollen and Merkley referred to as “ jeopardiz[ing] private investment, job creation, and economic opportunity in communities across the country” in a subsequent letter to Citibank.

Citibank, very much stuck in the middle, first received a judge’s order saying they should proceed with funding, with presiding Judge Tanya Chutkan ruling that the EPA “acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it failed to explain its reasoning and acted contrary to its regulations in suspending and terminating Plaintiffs’ grants.” The very next day, however, an appellate court granted a stay to the EPA that refroze the funds until the courts can arrive at a long-term solution.

An EPA spokesperson responded to a request for comment via email, stating: “Unlike the Biden-Har[r]is administration, this EPA is committed to being an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars. In March, Administrator Zeldin notified National Clean Investment Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator recipients of the termination of their grant agreements under the Biden-Harris Administration’s $20 billion ‘gold bar’ scheme. This termination is based on substantial concerns regarding the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) program integrity, the award process, and programmatic waste and abuse, which collectively undermine the fundamental goals and statutory objectives of the award.”

Private Investment Steps Up

Caught in the middle are companies across the country in the business of getting clean energy into communities, or in the case of many Native Americans who live off-grid, like 30% of the Navajo Nation, any source of energy at all. Many entrepreneurs who were either approved or in the process to receive GGRF funds refuse to sit on their hands waiting to see what the courts decide and are forging a path with the support of private investors—a process I know well, given my firm Candide Group launched Afterglow, a climate justice debt fund, in 2024. The stories of these organizations not only exemplify the value potentially being destroyed by the delay of the GGRF, but also, represent opportunities for private capital to step in.

Solar Holler (West Virginia)

Solar Holler is a West Virginia-based solar developer and installer serving Appalachia, including Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio. Working with households, churches, schools and other non-profit organizations, Solar Holler has sought to build on the region’s history as an energy producer, without the staggering long-term threats to public health generated by coal. This month, it completed five of seventeen intended solar projects installed on the roofs of West Virginia public schools.

Their CEO, Dan Conant, commented on LinkedIn, “It's these sorts of projects that get me out of bed in the morning—the kind that cram as much good into one place as possible. The kind that provide educational opportunities for West Virginian kids to stay home. The kind that support American manufacturing and union labor. The kind that lower bills for organizations doing God's work.”

He added, “every panel we put up means more money for teachers and supplies, and…actual education. The electricity generated by the solar is 20% cheaper than what the out-of-state monopoly utility is charging.”

“Allume’s mission is to bring rooftop solar to the more than 110 million people living in multifamily housing, many of whom are low-income,” Aliya Bagewadi, Alume’s Director of US Strategic Partnerships, said in an email. “Our SolShare technology allows solar energy to be shared across multiple units in the same building, enabling apartment tenants to directly consume solar and reduce their electricity bills by an average of 40 percent. Without the federal Investment Tax Credit, affordable housing providers won’t be able to reduce financial strain or strengthen housing resilience in the communities they serve. The rollback would halt projects that deliver immediate and lasting savings to the families who need it most.”

Georgia Bright (Georgia)

Georgia BRIGHT is a program of the Capital Good Fund (CGF), a Rhode Island-based nonprofit social finance organization grappling with poverty and environmental injustice in America. Capital Good Fund offers solar leases, low-interest loans, and one-on-one financial coaching for lower-income residents of Georgia, Rhode Island, Texas, Illinois, Florida, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Colorado.

This federally funded solar power program makes solar leasing more accessible for homeowners and nonprofits. In addition to helping low- and moderate-income communities save money, this work also enhances grid stability — increasingly essential as climate change strains grids.

“$156 million in Solar for All funding is an amazing start, but if we are going to serve 16,000+ Georgia families over the next four years, we can't rely on public investment alone,” Alicia Brown, Georgia BRIGHT Director said. “To unlock the full potential of rooftop and community solar, we need private capital at the table. The Georgia BRIGHT initiative isn’t just about clean energy—it’s about saving families money as utility bills rise, boosting Georgia's economy, and strengthening our grid that is straining under the weight of rapid load growth.”

Dollaride (New York)

Dollaride is a New York-based company electrifying fleet vehicles in transit deserts, starting with New York City’s locally essential “dollar vans.” Roughly 1.4 million people in NYC live with limited access to public transit, which hinders economic mobility. Dollar vans provide an informal transit network that serves more than 100,000 riders daily in the outer boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn.

“As federal support for crucial climate projects becomes uncertain, the leadership of local governments, paired with private capital, is essential to fill the gap,” Dollaride CEO Su Sanni said. “Ultimately, this ensures that disadvantaged communities retain access to essential transportation and breathe cleaner air. This is the kind of high-impact, scalable model that private capital can and should be amplifying nationwide.”

Companies like these who are developing climate projects in low-income communities — which are already feeling the substantial strain of climate change —may struggle if GGRF funds ultimately can’t reach their intended recipients. This may lead to political ramifications in red and blue states alike.

The good news is that renewable energy not only has the potential to save money for consumers, according to the Department of Energy, but also make money for investors, with an International Energy Agency report finding clean energy outperformed fossil fuels for both 5 and 10 year periods.

Chevron Corporation CVX has reportedly begun the sale process for its 50% stake in Singapore Refining Company (“SRC”), inviting non-binding bids from potential buyers. Among those approached is PetroChina, which already owns the remaining 50% through its Singapore Petroleum Co Ltd unit and holds the first right of refusal.

The move is part of the U.S. oil giant’s broader efforts of global restructuring and streamlining operations. Chevron has been optimizing its global portfolio by prioritizing core growth assets, aiming to cut costs and enhance profitability. Earlier this year, Chevron announced plans to lay off 15-20% of its employees to restructure operations.

Global Restructuring in Singapore and Beyond

Last month, Chevron divested its interest in Chevron Phillips Singapore Chemicals to Aster Chemicals and Energy, a joint venture between Chandra Asri and Glencore. The potential sale of the refinery would mark the second recent departure by a global energy major from Singapore’s refining sector, which faces higher operating costs due to a carbon tax that has impacted its competitiveness compared with other regions.

The company’s restructuring is not limited to Singapore. Chevron is also assessing the market for other assets in Asia, including terminal and fuel storage facilities in Australia and the Philippines. Morgan Stanley has been appointed to oversee the sale process for these assets, including the SRC refinery.

Taking a Look at Singapore Refining Company

Singapore Refining Company is a 50/50 joint venture between Chevron and China’s state-owned oil and gas major, PetroChina. With a crude processing capacity of 290,000 barrels per day, it is the smallest refinery in Singapore. The facility features seven shipping berths capable of accommodating very large crude carriers. Its fuel products are traded regionally and internationally, supported by a well-established distribution network across Singapore and Jurong Island.

Growing Interest, High Valuations

Global trading house Glencore is among the entities reportedly invited to assess the refinery stake. Estimates suggest Chevron’s share in SRC could be valued between $300 million and $500 million. The sale process, with offers expected in July, comes at a time when energy majors are sharpening their focus on profitability and efficiency in a volatile market.

Bloomberg News reviewed official import documents that confirm the arrival of at least five Model Y vehicles at the Mumbai port. These units were declared at ₹27.69 lakh (approx. $31,988), with over ₹21 lakh levied in import duties, reflecting India’s high tariffs on completely built units.

The Model Y, recognized globally as the best-selling electric car, is expected to be priced above $56,000 in India before taxes and insurance. That’s significantly higher than its U.S. price of $44,990, and even more when U.S. tax credits bring the price down to $37,490. This substantial price gap highlights one of Tesla's main challenges in India—convincing price-sensitive consumers to invest in a premium electric vehicle.

Despite EVs making up just over 5 per cent of new passenger vehicle sales in India, the premium segment still remains under 2 per cent of the market. This presents a tough landscape for Tesla, which must carefully balance pricing, product positioning, and consumer appeal.

Tesla's India strategy has gained momentum following a meeting between CEO Elon Musk and Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this year. While the company has yet to appoint a new country head following the departure of Prashanth Menon, it is actively hiring for roles in retail, charging infrastructure, and public policy.

To support its operations, Tesla is also securing warehousing space in Karnataka and Gurugram. Furthermore, executives from international teams have been making regular visits to oversee preparations in the luxury business districts of Mumbai and New Delhi, where the first showrooms are being established.

As Tesla makes its long-awaited Indian debut, the company is banking on its global brand appeal and premium technology to carve out space in a rapidly evolving but price-conscious market.

It’s not just about turning on the lights or plugging in a phone, it’s about staying warm through the long, dark winters. It’s about making sure a remote community hundreds of miles from the road system has access to affordable, reliable power. And it’s about keeping the cost of living from climbing even higher.

That’s why Alaskans can be thankful to our senators for standing up for something that may sound technical — federal clean energy tax credits — but in reality, makes a world of difference to real people, right here in our state. Both our senators should keep up the good work.

Clean energy tax credits like the ones passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act have enabled Alaskan households, businesses and communities to strengthen their energy efficiency while getting major clean energy projects off the ground in Alaska, creating and protecting good union jobs in the process. Without these energy tax credits, we risk seeing economy-growing projects stalled or canceled, jobs lost and energy costs pushed even higher for Alaskan families already feeling the pinch.

The Alaska AFL-CIO represents 50,000 workers in 50 local affiliates across the state. These are hardworking men and women who build and maintain the critical infrastructure that keeps Alaska running. These are the skilled electricians, laborers, teamsters and tradespeople who have powered our oil and gas industry, and who are now also ready and trained to build the next generation of energy, including wind, solar, hydropower and more. They take pride in what they do, and they deserve the chance to keep working, supporting their families and strengthening their communities.

Many Alaska workers have spent months out on remote job sites, away from their families, helping install wind turbines or repair transmission lines. They are not just doing a job, they’re building a future for their children and for Alaska. And they know, like I do, that the sooner we get more local, affordable energy online, the better it will be for everyone — whether you live in Anchorage or Aniak.

But these projects don’t just happen on their own. They take time. They take investment. And in Alaska, where the terrain is tough and the permitting process can stretch for years, they take strong policy support. The Inflation Reduction Act’s federal renewable energy tax credits have been critical for getting projects to the finish line. Take them away, and we’re back to square one with projects delayed, jobs lost and energy bills creeping up.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski said it well in her letter to Senate leadership earlier this year: Eliminating these credits would disrupt progress and hurt American workers. She’s absolutely right. Here in Alaska, it’s not just about policy, it’s about people. And our people are ready to work. Our unions have already trained workers to build these projects. They’re just waiting on the green light to get going.

We may not always agree with our elected leaders on every issue, but when it comes to energy, we share common ground: We all want a future that’s affordable, reliable and built right here at home. That’s what these tax credits help make possible.

The Alaska AFL-CIO is proud to support an “all of the above” energy approach that includes oil, gas and clean energy resources. We believe in building it all, as long as it creates good union jobs and keeps Alaskans warm, working and thriving.

Let’s keep moving forward. Let’s keep building. And let’s make sure the next generation of energy in Alaska is one we can all be proud of — union-built, Alaskan-made, and here to stay. Sens.

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina legislators finalized a bill Thursday that would eliminate an interim greenhouse gas reduction mandate set in a landmark 2021 law, while still directing regulators to aim to cancel out power plant carbon emissions in the state within the next 25 years.

With some bipartisan support, the state Senate voted to accept the House version that would repeal the 2021 law’s requirement that electric regulators take “all reasonable steps to achieve” reducing carbon dioxide output 70% from 2005 levels by 2030. The law’s directive to take similar steps to meet a carbon neutrality standard by 2050 would remain in place.

The bill’s Republican supporters pushing the new measure say getting rid of the interim goal benefits ratepayers asked to pay for future electric-production construction and is more efficient for Duke Energy, the state’s dominant electric utility.

The bill now goes to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, who can veto the measure, sign it or let it become law without his signature. Stein previously expressed concerns about the Senate version of the measure, worried that it could hurt electricity users and threaten the state’s clean-energy economy. His office didn’t immediately provide comment after Thursday’s vote.

With over a dozen House and Senate Democrats voting for the final version, the chances that any Stein veto could be overridden are higher. Republicans in charge of the General Assembly are only one House seat shy of a veto-proof majority.

The bill also contains language that would help Duke Energy seek higher electric rates to cover financing costs to build nuclear or gas-powered plants incrementally, rather than wait until the project’s end.

The 2021 greenhouse gas law marked a rare agreement on environmental issues by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Republican lawmakers.

At least 17 other states — most controlled by Democrats — have laws setting similar net-zero power plant emissions or 100% renewable energy targets, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. North Carolina and Virginia are the only ones from the Southeast.

The legislation came about as President Donald Trump’s administration has proposed rolling back federal environmental and climate change policies, which critics say could boost pollution and threaten human health. Republicans are promoting them as ways to reduce the cost of living and boost the economy.

The state Utilities Commission, which regulates rates and services for public utilities, already has pushed back the 2030 deadline — as the 2021 law allows — by at least four years. The panel acknowledged last year it was “no longer reasonable or executable” for Duke Energy to meet the reduction standard by 2030.

Bill supporters say to meet the goal would require expensive types of alternate energy immediately. If the interim standard can be bypassed, GOP bill authors say, Duke Energy can assemble less expensive power sources now and moderate electricity rate increases necessary to reach the 2050 standard.

“Our residents shouldn’t be saddled with higher power bills to satisfy arbitrary targets,” Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said in a news release after the vote.

Citing an analysis performed by a state agency that represents consumers before the commission, GOP lawmakers say removing the interim goal would reduce by at least $13 billion what Duke Energy would have to spend — and pass on to customers — in the next 25 years.

Bill opponents question the savings figure given uncertainty in plant fuel prices, energy demand and construction costs. They say the interim goal still holds an aspirational purpose and was something that Duke Energy had agreed in 2021 to meet.

Provisions in the measure related to recouping plant construction expenses over time would reduce accumulated borrowing interest.

Environmental groups argue the financing option would benefit Duke Energy’s bottom line on expensive projects even if they’re never completed, and the bill broadly would prevent cleaner energy sources from coming online sooner. They also contend another bill section would shift costs to residential customers.

“This bill is bad for all North Carolinians, whether they’re Duke Energy customers or simply people who want to breathe clean air,” North Carolina Sierra Club director Chris Herndon said after the vote while urging Stein to veto the measure.

Bill support came from the North Carolina Chamber and a manufacturers’ group, in addition to Duke Energy.

“We appreciate bipartisan efforts by policymakers to keep costs as low as possible for customers and enable the always-on energy resources our communities need,” the company said this week.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25170680520513-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 02:59:57.959756

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill.
The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.","WASHINGTON — (AP) — House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.

Republicans in the two chambers don't agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.

The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.

While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.

Here’s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:

The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.

The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump's second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.

Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.

The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.

The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that’s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.

The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.

The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.

And on Social Security, the bills don't directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That's a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

“This needs a lot of work. It’s really concerning and I’m really surprised by it,” he said. “Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.”

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden's climate law. It aimed to boost the nation's transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn't include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

That is particularly so when the government regulation itself may be skewing the market at issue.
So courts should exercise caution before denying standing because of a claimed lack of redressability rooted in questionable economic speculation.
I see no need to expound on the law of standing in a case where the sole dispute is a factual one not addressed below.
Barring that, we should have simply vacated and remanded for the D. C. Circuit to reconsider its ruling on a clarified factual record.…","Producers of gasoline and ethanol fuels have Article III standing to challenge the Environmental Protection Agency‘s approval of California regulations requiring automakers to limit average greenhouse-gas emissions across their vehicle fleets and manufacture a certain percentage of electric vehicles, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7-2 in reversing a decision from the D.C. Circuit.

Click here to read the full text of the June 20 decision in Diamond Alternative Energy v. Environmental Protection Agency.

BULLET POINTS: “To deny standing based on a theory that invalidating an important regulation would actually have zero impact on a dynamic and heavily regulated market requires a degree of economic and political clairvoyance that is difficult for a court to maintain. That is particularly so when the government regulation itself may be skewing the market at issue. So courts should exercise caution before denying standing because of a claimed lack of redressability rooted in questionable economic speculation. …

“In sum, this case does not present the unusual scenario where invalidating a challenged government restriction on businesses in a competitive market is not likely to have any effect. Here, it may not be certain, but it is at least ‘predictable’ that invalidating the California regulations would likely result in the fuel producers ultimately selling more gasoline and other liquid fuels.”

— Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, opinion of the court

“Having granted certiorari, the Court relegates to a footnote the actual basis for the D.C. Circuit’s decision [which was based on an apparent misunderstanding about when the California fleet-wide emissions standards expire]. A version of that footnote should have been the Court’s entire opinion in this case. For reasons unknown, the majority instead conjures up a ‘heightened “proof of redressability” requirement’ that the D. C. Circuit did not adopt and that no party advanced, and then laboriously ‘decline[s] to adopt’ that requirement. I see no need to expound on the law of standing in a case where the sole dispute is a factual one not addressed below. Indeed, as JUSTICE JACKSON explains, this case is unlikely to present a live controversy for much longer regardless of petitioners’ standing, as the administration is likely to withdraw the challenged rules. I would simply have vacated the case and remanded it to the D.C. Circuit to reconsider its redressability analysis, keeping in mind the now corrected timeline for the challenged vehicle-emissions programs.”

— Justice Sonia Sotomayor, dissenting

“In my view, we should have either denied certiorari outright or held this matter in abeyance pending EPA‘s reconsideration of its waiver grant. Barring that, we should have simply vacated and remanded for the D. C. Circuit to reconsider its ruling on a clarified factual record.…",https://rilawyersweekly.com/files/2022/03/image_2022_03_25T10_21_29_846Z.png,N,,2025-06-21 13:10:44.115856

But Democrats also indicated less support for renewable energy and more for fossil fuels than five years ago.
Democrats' support rose from 37% to 52%.
“(They think) we just need to shout louder and hit people over the head about climate, climate, climate.
Published by Canary Media, Renewable Energy World Floodlight is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates the powers stalling climate action.","Republicans and Democrats alike are less likely to support renewable energy than they were five years ago, according to a survey released June 5 by the Pew Research Center. Floodlight examines the survey results, which mirror growing pockets of opposition to solar farms, reignited political support for coal plants and moves by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to kill federally funded clean energy projects.

This shift in opinion dates back to when Democratic President Joe Biden took office, said Brian Kennedy, Pew senior researcher and one of the study’s authors. “This isn’t a new trend,” he said.

Still, Kenneth Gillingham, professor of environmental and energy economics at the Yale School of the Environment, was surprised.

“I see this shift … as a successful effort to link climate change and renewable energy to broader culture war issues,” Gillingham said. He added that in the past, “prominent” Republicans supported renewables and sought solutions to climate change, but those stances could now be seen as “disloyal” to Trump.

Pew Research Center

The survey of 5,085 U.S. adults taken April 28 to May 4 revealed that while 79% of Americans favored expanding wind and solar production in 2020, that number has dropped to 60%. And 39% of Americans today support expansion of oil, coal and natural gas — almost double the 20% that supported it in 2020.

Combustion of fossil fuels — in transportation, energy generation and industrial production — is the No. 1 cause of climate change.

Much of the change in opinion is driven by Republicans, whose support of oil and gas grew from 35% in 2020 to 67% today. But Democrats also indicated less support for renewable energy and more for fossil fuels than five years ago.

While many results reflect Trump's policies opposing most renewables and boosting fossil fuels, Pew found a few notable exceptions: 69% of all respondents favor offshore wind — a technology Trump has specifically targeted.

Both Democrats and Republicans indicated stronger support for nuclear power, with Republicans' favorable opinions increasing from 53% in 2020 to 69% in 2025. Democrats' support rose from 37% to 52%. The Trump administration has signaled support for a nuclear renaissance, despite its high cost.

There were wide partisan splits on several topics. In March, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it would scale back environmental regulations. Pew asked whether it was possible to do that and still protect air and water quality: 77% of Republicans said yes and 67% of Democrats said no.

Pew didn’t ask the respondents why their attitudes have shifted. But Kennedy said in Pew’s past surveys, Republicans have expressed concern about the economic impacts of climate change policies and transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.

Mike Murphy, a Republican consultant and electric vehicle backer, said when the environmental benefits of clean technologies are touted, it polarizes Republicans. Instead, Murphy said messages should be about pocketbook issues — like lower fuel costs — and jobs.

“It's hard for pro-climate people to understand,” said Murphy, who has advised dozens of state and national GOP campaigns including John McCain’s 2008 presidential bid. “(They think) we just need to shout louder and hit people over the head about climate, climate, climate. The key is you want to talk about jobs and national security and other events that naturally resonate a lot more with right-of-center people.”

That's what Murphy's groups, the EV Politics Project and the American EV Jobs Alliance, are trying to do to depoliticize electric vehicles. ""Whenever electric cars are seen through a climate lens,"" Murphy said, ""their appeal narrows.""

It's a strategy also being used by the Electrification Coalition, a left-of-center pro-EV group. Ben Prochazka, the coalition's executive director, echoed Murphy's strategy, adding that EVs have ""become overly politicized and caught in the culture wars, impacting markets and ultimately hurting our ability to realize their many benefits for all Americans.""

Prochazka noted that once introduced to EVs, consumers support them: ""EV drivers love their vehicles, with more than eight out of ten reporting that their next car will also be electric.""

Pew Research Center

Perhaps those practical messages are getting through. In the Pew survey, electric vehicles were the one item that saw an uptick in support — 4 percentage points in the past year.

But popular support might not be enough to stop Congress from killing a $7,500 electric vehicle credit, which Murphy said would be “policy disaster.”

Republicans, he said, are in a “real squeeze,” because “they don’t have enough money for the tax cuts the president has promised.”

Murphy said: “It’s easier for Republicans to cut Biden electric cars … than it is for them to cut more Medicaid.”

Gillingham is still optimistic that solar, wind and other greenhouse gas-reducing technologies will move forward — because they are the cheapest.

“The continued decline in the price of renewable energy and battery technologies, as well as other new technologies, is a reason to continue to have hope that the worst impacts of climate change can be addressed,” he said.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill.
The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.","WASHINGTON — (AP) — House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.

Republicans in the two chambers don't agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.

The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.

While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.

Here’s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:

The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.

The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump's second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.

Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.

The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.

The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that’s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.

The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.

The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.

And on Social Security, the bills don't directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That's a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

“This needs a lot of work. It’s really concerning and I’m really surprised by it,” he said. “Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.”

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden's climate law. It aimed to boost the nation's transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn't include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That's a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

“This needs a lot of work. It’s really concerning and I’m really surprised by it,” he said. “Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.”

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden's climate law. It aimed to boost the nation’s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn't include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

“Republicans are attempting to ram through a provision to sell millions in acres in California, including land around Yosemite, Mt.
“Our federal public treasures shouldn't be sold off to the highest bidder.
""If Republicans have their way, we will never get our public lands back once they are privatized,"" Sen. Alex Padilla said in a statement.
Large swaths of the Cleveland National Forest and Los Padres National Forest.","Millions of acres of public lands in California and across the West could be put up for sale over the next five years under the legislation in Congress that President Donald Trump has called the “big beautiful bill.”

More than 250 million acres of federal lands — including an estimated 10 million acres in California, according to the state — would be eligible to be sold off if the budget reconciliation bill from Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican and chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, is approved. Senate Republicans set a deadline of July 4 for a vote on the bill.

What’s in the bill?

The bill mandates selling at least 3 million acres of public lands to “interested parties,” which adds up to an area about the size of Connecticut. States would have the first opportunity to buy the land, but the ability to do that could be affected by each state’s budget — especially, environmentalists worry, when competing with large, well-financed corporations.

Kirsten Macintyre, a spokesperson for the California Natural Resources Agency, said the agency and the state ""strongly oppose the haphazard sell-off.""

""California does not have enough funding to buy federal lands proposed for sale or to manage those lands long-term,"" Macintyre wrote in an email to LAist. ""California is currently working to understand the extent of impacts to community safety, emergency readiness, biodiversity and culturally protected areas if the sell-off comes to fruition.""

The bill would also open new oil drilling in the Arctic and offshore drilling in the Gulf and Alaska, and eliminate funding for renewable energy projects on federal lands overseen primarily by the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service. Locally, chunks of the Angeles, Los Padres, San Bernardino and Cleveland national forests could be on the auction block.

Environmentalists, elected leaders and others worry the sales could be detrimental both for people who recreate in these areas, as well as for wildlife.

""The BLM, the Forest Service and the federal land management agencies for years have balanced development with conservation on federal public lands,” said Michael Carroll, the BLM campaigns manager with environmental group the Wilderness Society, which created a map of the public lands that could end up for sale.

“Once they're sold, they're gone for good,” Carroll said.

Though national parks and national monuments are exempt from the proposed sell-off, the Trump administration has indicated it may target those spaces in the future as part of its efforts to expand domestic fossil fuel production. (The U.S. has been the world’s top crude oil producer since 2018). In a recent opinion, the Department of Justice stated the Trump administration has authority to undo national monuments established by his predecessors.

Why sell off public lands?

Lee, the Utah senator, has argued the bill would open land to build affordable housing, while reducing the budget deficit and expanding local sources of oil, gas and coal.

Not everyone agrees. In May, House Republicans struck down a public lands sales provision that was supported by most House Republicans. But Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana pushed back, and the provision was eliminated.

“I do not support the widespread sale or transfer of public lands. ... God isn’t creating more land,” Zinke said in a news release. “Public access, sportsmanship, grazing, tourism … our entire Montanan way of life is connected to our public lands.”

Democrats oppose the provision in the Senate version of the bill.

In a social media post, Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, blasted the idea.

“Republicans are attempting to ram through a provision to sell millions in acres in California, including land around Yosemite, Mt. Shasta, Lake Tahoe and Big Sur, as part of their big ugly bill,” Schiff wrote. “Our federal public treasures shouldn't be sold off to the highest bidder. I will fight this, tooth and nail.”

California's other U.S. senator said the ""proposal is riddled with anti-environment provisions.""

""If Republicans have their way, we will never get our public lands back once they are privatized,"" Sen. Alex Padilla said in a statement. ""Our public lands and natural spaces are some of our nation’s greatest gifts, and I will do everything I can do to protect them.""

After the vote on the larger bill, it will need to go back to the House. Congressional committees are submitting their concerns about provisions in the reconciliation bill. The bill won’t become law until Trump signs the final version.

SoCal public lands that could be affected

Using data from the BLM, the Forest Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Park Service and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee budget reconciliation bill text, nonprofit environmental advocacy group the Wilderness Society created a comprehensive map of the lands that would be eligible for sale.

Some Southern California areas that could be affected include:

More than 240,000 acres in the Angeles National Forest, largely areas that are home to old growth trees.

Much of the San Bernardino National Forest, including near Lake Arrowhead and Big Bear Lake.

Large swaths of the Cleveland National Forest and Los Padres National Forest.

Popular hiking areas such as Strawberry Creek in Idyllwild.

BLM lands near Joshua Tree National Park.

Large portions of forest land surrounding Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.

Large portions of the Santa Ana Mountains.

Portions of the Chaney Trail Corridor in Altadena.

BLM lands south of Chuckwalla National Monument, which are the ancestral lands of the Fort Yuma Quechan Tribe.

The map includes links to elected leaders for each area.

“Republican lawmakers from California have a duty to stand up and say, ‘I'm a no on this until the public land sale provisions are taken out of the bill,’” Carroll said. “ We need people to contact their lawmakers and ask them to demand that this provision that's in the Senate bill be stripped out of it.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/57c391a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/864x454+0+25/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa0%2Fb4%2F69bb21e44fb8a9fa8490ff33f31f%2F22335121258-978bccb807-o.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 04:00:39.433461

The Senate bill doesn’t include such a provision.
The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.","WASHINGTON (AP) — House and Senate Republicans are taking slightly different approaches when it comes to the tax cuts that lawmakers are looking to include in their massive tax and spending cuts bill.

Republicans in the two chambers don’t agree on the size of a deduction for state and local taxes. And they are at odds on such things as allowing people to use their health savings accounts to help pay for their gym membership, or whether electric vehicle and hybrid owners should have to pay an annual fee.

The House passed its version shortly before Memorial Day. Now the Senate is looking to pass its version.

While the two bills are similar on the major tax provisions, how they work out their differences in the coming weeks will determine how quickly they can get a final product over the finish line. President Donald Trump is pushing to have the legislation on his desk by July 4th.

Here’s a look at some of the key differences between the two bills:

Tax break for families

The child tax credit currently stands at $2,000 per child.

The House bill temporarily boosts the child tax credit to $2,500 for the 2025 through 2028 tax years, roughly the length of President Donald Trump’s second term. It also indexes the credit amount for inflation beginning in 2027.

The Senate bill provides a smaller, initial bump-up to $2,200, but the bump is permanent, with the credit amount indexed for inflation beginning next year.

Trump campaign promises

Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would seek to end income taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Also, he would give car buyers a new tax break by allowing them to deduct the interest paid on auto loans.

The House and Senate bills incorporate those promises with temporary deductions lasting from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, but with some differences.

The House bill creates a deduction on tips for those working in jobs that have customarily received tips. The House also provides for a deduction for overtime that’s equal to the amount of OT a worker has earned.

The Senate bill comes with more restrictions. The deduction for tips is limited to $25,000 per taxpayer and the deduction for overtime is limited to $12,500 per taxpayer.

The House and Senate bills both provide a deduction of up to $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles made in the United States.

And on Social Security, the bills don’t directly touch the program. Instead, they grant a larger tax deduction for Americans age 65 and older. The House sets the deduction at $4,000. The Senate sets it at $6,000.

Both chambers include income limits over which the new deductions begin to phase out.

More SALT

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That’s a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

Medicaid providers

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

“This needs a lot of work. It’s really concerning and I’m really surprised by it,” he said. “Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.”

Tax breaks for business

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Clean energy tax credits

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden’s climate law. It aimed to boost the nation’s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

Odds and ends

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn’t include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

But perhaps the biggest impact is intangible: showing that clean energy isn’t scary, or political, or far-fetched.","In a town known more for Bucknell University and its rustic charm than clean energy innovation, St. Andrew’s is leading a quiet but significant shift toward sustainability. Shapiro’s Lightning Plan is about to make it easier for more folks to get onboard.

When Maggie Chappen drives past St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church on Route 15 in Lewisburg, she can’t help but smile.

“I actually detour now just to go past the church and look at the solar panels,” Chappen, a parishioner, said. “They look great. I think they’re beautiful.”

But the panels are more than just decoration for the church. They’ve become an opportunity for the church to continue spreading their mission.

In a town known more for Bucknell University and its rustic charm than clean energy innovation, St. Andrew’s is leading a quiet but significant shift toward sustainability. And it was Chappen—a physician, senior warden with the church, and someone with experience in solar energy—who led the charge on installing the panels.

More than a mission of faith

St. Andrew’s didn’t leap into solar energy because the congregation were proponents of clean energy. In fact, it started out as a matter of survival.

“We were looking for ways to conserve costs but also care for creation,” Chappen said.

The church’s energy bills were becoming so high, they were forced to use resources from its community outreach programs—programs like the local after-school center and the food bank.

“We would have to take our donations and cut them in half just to keep the lights on,” Chappen said.

The solar solution wasn’t an easy sell to the congregation at first. Some feared the aesthetics. Others doubted the payoff.

“My husband, for example, always said, ‘I don’t mind being on the cutting edge—I just don’t want to be on the bleeding edge,’” Chappen said.

But Chappen had an advantage few others did: her own home had been solar-powered since 2013. She knew the risks, the fears, and the reality. Like, for instance, the time when squirrels chewed through her wiring.

“That was a nightmare,” she said.

But after she learned more about managing the panels, the system worked for her home. She hoped it would work for her church as well.

“Healthy patients need a healthy planet,” said Chappen, who’s a physician. “It was worth it.”

Eventually, with some research and an anonymous donor willing to fund the upfront costs—$65,000 for 52 rooftop panels—the church started its clean energy journey.

“It was zero cost to the congregation,” Chappen said. “That’s what made everyone get on board.”

Now that the panels are live, St. Andrew’s electric bill has dropped by at least $200 a month. They even got a surprise overage payment this May—$150 back for producing more power than they used.

But the savings, Chappen said, are only half the story. The panels have started conversations far beyond their church’s congregation.

“People in the local neighborhood know,” Chappen said. “I was 10 miles down the river getting a plaque engraved when someone said, ‘Oh, that’s the church with the solar panels.’”

Chappen admits Lewisburg isn’t exactly ground zero for clean energy initiatives. She describes her region as “a little blue dot in a red area.” But what she finds interesting is that some of the biggest solar installations in the region belong to farmers with “Trump 2024” signs still in their yards.

“They’re not climate change advocates, but they understand a good financial deal when they see one,” Chappen said.

Busting solar myths

Chappen said there are still some folks who have questions, or preconceptions about clean energy.

“People worry: What if it snows? Do I have to climb up and clean them off?” Chappen said. “No. They’re slanted enough that the snow just melts off. And no, you don’t need to clean them otherwise.”

Another fear: damage to the roof. But Chappen said that the panels may actually protect the roof underneath from sun damage. The only unexpected expense was that the church had to replace part of its 20-year-old shingles—an extra cost not covered by energy rebates. But that, she says, is just part of smart planning.

Eyes on the future

St. Andrew’s clean energy future doesn’t have to stop at cost savings, Chappen said. The church could become a “climate resilience center”—a place with battery storage to provide power during outages or storms. But storage batteries are expensive and difficult to fund for religious organizations, thanks to state rules about public dollars going to faith-based groups.

One possibility to reach this next stage is the Lightning Plan—a series of bills aimed at revamping the commonwealth’s energy sector. It was introduced by Gov. Josh Shapiro earlier this year. The plan would help organizations like churches, libraries, and community centers install battery storage systems. It would also offer low-interest loans, technical assistance, and bulk purchasing options to make backup energy storage more affordable.

“It would let us store solar power for emergencies—keeping the lights on for community meals or warming shelters during storms,” Chappen said. “It’s something we’d love to pursue if the funding lines up.”

Shapiro’s administration has said the plan will create nearly 15,000 energy jobs and attract over $11 billion in clean energy investments. It will also save energy customers in the state $252 million in the first five years and $664 million by 2040.

If you ask Chappen, there are no real downsides to the solar project—just opportunities to dispel myths. Aesthetic concerns proved unfounded. Energy production has exceeded expectations. Even community reputation has improved.

“It’s had a ripple effect that surprised us,” Chappen said.

But perhaps the biggest impact is intangible: showing that clean energy isn’t scary, or political, or far-fetched. It’s practical. It’s economical. And in St. Andrew’s case, it’s faithful.

“It’s good stewardship. Of our money, our resources, and the planet,” Chappen said.",https://keystonenewsroom.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/06/st-andrews-solar-array.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 06:01:40.387108

*** Griffin Bradley is a lifelong Wood County resident, graduate of West Virginia University, and a contributing author for Mid-Ohio Valley Climate Action.","As a lifelong West Virginian, I have a soft spot for seeing my state succeed. With all of its grit, tenacity and work ethic, there’s no reason that West Virginia shouldn’t be a national leader in many respects. But yet, we see our state struggle to keep up as new opportunities arise, trading in progress for the same old, worn out tagline. We all know the jingle. “Coal is West Virginia,” right?

Over the last four years, America has been at an important moment for innovation and expansion of the clean energy economy. For all its supposed faults, the Inflation Reduction Act produced thousands of jobs, billions of dollars of economic value, and spurred industrial innovations at a rate rarely seen since the Industrial Revolution. But for those of us who call the Mountain State home, we have not reaped much of those benefits. Rather, we’ve seen business after business make their home in other states. States that, frankly, share many characteristics with West Virginia.

So then what gives? Despite the opportunities, West Virginia flounders. In order to get a better understanding of exactly why West Virginia fails to meet the moment, let’s compare to a similar state. Join me as we take a quick trip down I-77 to the Tar Heel State of North Carolina. A state that, by comparison, should be in the same category of success as West Virginia. Nestled in the shadow of the Appalachian Mountains, both states have strong blue-collar roots and a favorable cost-of-living, yet one outdoes the other by leaps and bounds. Why?

Let’s break it down a bit further.

North Carolina has been named in the top 2 of CNBC’s annual “Best States For Business” reports for the last four years, continually trading the #1 and #2 spot with another of West Virginia’s neighbors, Virginia. North Carolina’s spot as a top state for business development is due in no small part to its early support for clean energy growth. Not only does North Carolina benefit from its nearly 110,000-strong clean energy workforce, but it also sees new businesses that manufacture clean energy technologies pouring into the state on what feels like a monthly basis. Not to mention the traditional businesses that have increased their existing footprint in the state due to their supportive clean energy environment.

On the policymaking side, we see more divisions between West Virginia and North Carolina. Much like West Virginia, North Carolina’s legislature hosts a (near) veto-proof Republican majority. The only difference between the two is the latter’s executive branch has been controlled by a Democrat in recent years, with former Gov. Roy Cooper and current Gov. Josh Stein. Despite the many ideological differences of North Carolina’s legislative and executive branches, the legislature and governor(s) have come together in many instances to support policy that creates a conducive environment for the clean energy economy to flourish. As such, North Carolina has been a leader in nearly every sense of the word.

Now, back in West Virginia, we can better outline where we have failed. In terms of clean energy jobs, well, it’s safe to say we are dwarfed by much of the United States with only around 10,000 dedicated jobs. This is all while the supposed backbone of our economy and culture, old “King Coal,” continues to see dwindling jobs numbers and overall economic value amid a volatile international coal market.

Despite the writing being on the wall for most forward-thinking, commonsense folks, we see little policy coming out of Charleston that would suggest West Virginia is headed toward an economic renaissance anytime soon. And to be fair, why would we? In a state where there are presumably more janitors wandering the halls of the Capitol than elected Democrats and a super-duper Republican majority that has long looked at the prospects of the coal industry through rose colored glasses, it’s no surprise that West Virginia hasn’t seen the same success as our neighbors when it comes to the national clean energy boom.

Now more than ever, West Virginians should be angry. Angry that we aren’t a national trendsetter. Angry that our leaders didn’t grasp the enormous opportunity that is now in the rearview mirror. Angry that we are being left in the dust by very comparable states. If economic mediocrity and complacency from leadership is what you want, look no further. As for me, I find inspiration in our neighbors’ successes. I wish those in Charleston did, too.

Republicans and Democrats alike are less likely to support renewable energy than they were five years ago, according to a survey released June 5 by the Pew Research Center. Floodlight examines the survey results, which mirror growing pockets of opposition to solar farms, reignited political support for coal plants and moves by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to kill federally funded clean energy projects.

This shift in opinion dates back to when Democratic President Joe Biden took office, said Brian Kennedy, Pew senior researcher and one of the study's authors. ""This isn't a new trend,"" he said.

Still, Kenneth Gillingham, professor of environmental and energy economics at the Yale School of the Environment, was surprised.

""I see this shift … as a successful effort to link climate change and renewable energy to broader culture war issues,"" Gillingham said. He added that in the past, ""prominent"" Republicans supported renewables and sought solutions to climate change, but those stances could now be seen as ""disloyal"" to Trump.

The survey of 5,085 U.S. adults taken April 28 to May 4 revealed that while 79% of Americans favored expanding wind and solar production in 2020, that number has dropped to 60%. And 39% of Americans today support expansion of oil, coal and natural gas - almost double the 20% that supported it in 2020.

Combustion of fossil fuels - in transportation, energy generation and industrial production - is the No. 1 cause of climate change.

Much of the change in opinion is driven by Republicans, whose support of oil and gas grew from 35% in 2020 to 67% today. But Democrats also indicated less support for renewable energy and more for fossil fuels than five years ago.

While many results reflect Trump's policies opposing most renewables and boosting fossil fuels, Pew found a few notable exceptions: 69% of all respondents favor offshore wind - a technology Trump has specifically targeted.

Both Democrats and Republicans indicated stronger support for nuclear power, with Republicans' favorable opinions increasing from 53% in 2020 to 69% in 2025. Democrats' support rose from 37% to 52%. The Trump administration has signaled support for a nuclear renaissance, despite its high cost.

There were wide partisan splits on several topics. In March, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it would scale back environmental regulations. Pew asked whether it was possible to do that and still protect air and water quality: 77% of Republicans said yes and 67% of Democrats said no.

Pew didn't ask the respondents why their attitudes have shifted. But Kennedy said in Pew's past surveys, Republicans have expressed concern about the economic impacts of climate change policies and transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.

Mike Murphy, a Republican consultant and electric vehicle backer, said when the environmental benefits of clean technologies are touted, it polarizes Republicans. Instead, Murphy said messages should be about pocketbook issues - like lower fuel costs - and jobs.

""It's hard for pro-climate people to understand,"" said Murphy, who has advised dozens of state and national GOP campaigns including John McCain's 2008 presidential bid. ""(They think) we just need to shout louder and hit people over the head about climate, climate, climate. The key is you want to talk about jobs and national security and other events that naturally resonate a lot more with right-of-center people.""

That's what Murphy's groups, the EV Politics Project and the American EV Jobs Alliance, are trying to do to depoliticize electric vehicles. ""Whenever electric cars are seen through a climate lens,"" Murphy said, ""their appeal narrows.""

It's a strategy also being used by the Electrification Coalition, a left-of-center pro-EV group. Ben Prochazka, the coalition's executive director, echoed Murphy's strategy, adding that EVs have ""become overly politicized and caught in the culture wars, impacting markets and ultimately hurting our ability to realize their many benefits for all Americans.""

Prochazka noted that once introduced to EVs, consumers support them: ""EV drivers love their vehicles, with more than eight out of ten reporting that their next car will also be electric.""

Perhaps those practical messages are getting through. In the Pew survey, electric vehicles were the one item that saw an uptick in support - 4 percentage points in the past year.

But popular support might not be enough to stop Congress from killing a $7,500 electric vehicle credit, which Murphy said would be ""policy disaster.""

Republicans, he said, are in a ""real squeeze,"" because ""they don't have enough money for the tax cuts the president has promised.""

Murphy said: ""It's easier for Republicans to cut Biden electric cars … than it is for them to cut more Medicaid.""

Gillingham is still optimistic that solar, wind and other greenhouse gas-reducing technologies will move forward - because they are the cheapest.

""The continued decline in the price of renewable energy and battery technologies, as well as other new technologies, is a reason to continue to have hope that the worst impacts of climate change can be addressed,"" he said.

More SALT

The caps on state and local tax deductions, known in Washington as the SALT cap, now stand at $10,000.

The House bill, in a bid to win over Republicans from New York, California and New Jersey, lifts the cap to $40,000 per household with incomes of less than $500,000. The credit phases down for households earning more than $500,000.

The Senate bill keeps the cap at $10,000. That's a non-starter in the House, but Republicans in the two chambers will look to negotiate a final number over the coming weeks that both sides can accept.

Medicaid providers

The House bill prohibits states from establishing new provider taxes or increasing existing taxes. These are taxes that Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, pay to help states finance their share of Medicaid costs. In turn, the taxes allow states to receive increased federal matching funds while generally holding providers harmless through higher reimbursements that offset the taxes paid.

Such taxes now are effectively capped at 6%. The Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold for states that have expanded their Medicaid populations under the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.

Industry groups have warned that limiting the ability of states to tax providers may lead to some states making significant cuts to their Medicaid programs as they make up for the lost revenue in other ways. The Medicaid provision could be a flashpoint in the coming House and Senate negotiations. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was highly critical of the proposed Senate changes.

“This needs a lot of work. It’s really concerning and I’m really surprised by it,” he said. “Rural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.”

Tax breaks for business

The House bill would allow companies for five years to fully deduct equipment purchases and domestic research and development expenses. The Senate bill includes no sunset, making the tax breaks permanent, which was a key priority of powerful trade groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Clean energy tax credits

Republicans in both chambers are looking to scale back the clean energy tax credits enacted through then-President Joe Biden's climate law. It aimed to boost the nation’s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

Under the Senate bill, the tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, but less quickly than under the House bill. Still, advocacy groups fear that the final measure will threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs and drive up household energy costs.

Odds and ends

The House bill would allow millions of Americans to use their health savings accounts to pay for gym memberships, with a cap of $500 for single taxpayers and $1,000 for joint filers. The Senate bill doesn't include such a provision.

The House reinstates a charitable deduction for non-itemizers of $150 per taxpayer. The Senate bill increases that deduction for donations to $1,000 per taxpayer.

Republicans in the House bill included a new annual fee of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid owners that would be collected by state motor vehicle departments. The Senate bill excludes the proposed fees.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in 2024 reported 5-19 million metric tons of lithium reserves in Southwest Arkansas’ portion of Smackover, based on a study led by the government-run agency.

“Future development will aim to utilize the direct lithium extraction process, a set of advanced technologies employed to extract lithium from brines produced from the subsurface”, Chevron said in a press release. “Chevron seeks to deploy this emerging technology, which allows for faster and more efficient production and is expected to have a smaller environmental footprint compared to traditional extraction methods”.

“Lithium is a key component supporting the trend toward electrification and can contribute to building a resilient, lower carbon energy system that meets growing energy demand, while balancing reliability and affordability”, the oil and gas giant added.

Jeff Gustavson, president of Chevron New Energies, said, “This acquisition represents a strategic investment to support energy manufacturing and expand U.S.-based critical mineral supplies. Establishing domestic and resilient lithium supply chains is essential not only to maintaining U.S. energy leadership but also to meeting the growing demand from customers”.

“This opportunity builds on many of Chevron’s strengths including subsurface resource development and value chain integration”, Gustavson added.

“As demand for digital conveniences and EVs continues to increase, lithium has become one of the world’s most sought-after natural resources”, said Rania Yacoub, corporate business development manager at Chevron New Energies.

Just a few years ago, homeowners were installing rooftop panels in record numbers, fueled by generous tax incentives and low-interest financing. But today, things look very different.

The industry is now in the midst of a dramatic slowdown. In 2024 alone, residential solar installations dropped by 31%, marking one of the steepest declines in its history. Household names like SunPower, Sunnova, and Mosaic Solar—once leaders in the space—have filed for bankruptcy, highlighting just how serious the downturn has become.

Now, a newly proposed piece of legislation is threatening to make things even worse. Dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the draft law proposes rolling back federal tax credits that have long underpinned the economics of home solar. Without these benefits, many fear that solar will become too expensive or too complicated for the average homeowner to consider.

A Blow to Federal Support

The residential solar market has relied heavily on two federal incentives: the 25D tax credit, which reimburses homeowners for 30% of their solar system’s cost, and the 48E investment tax credit, aimed at developers and companies financing solar installations. Both have been crucial in making solar energy affordable and accessible.

But the new bill would cut the 25D credit entirely within six months of being signed into law. That means homeowners who were considering solar would lose a significant rebate—up to thousands of dollars—if they don’t act fast. The 48E credit would also be phased out. By 2026, its value would drop to 60%, then shrink to 20% by 2027, before being eliminated altogether for projects starting in 2028.

Even more surprising, the bill excludes leased solar systems from any tax incentives, a move that stunned industry insiders. Many solar companies have long depended on lease agreements to help consumers go solar without the high upfront cost. Removing this option could shrink the market even further.

Investor Panic and Market Shock

The impact of the bill’s release was immediate. Sunrun, the largest residential solar installer in the country, saw its stock plummet more than 40% in a single day. Investors were rattled by the sudden and sweeping nature of the proposed changes. Analysts warn that if the bill passes, other companies could follow the same path as SunPower and Mosaic—straight into bankruptcy.

The legislation is now awaiting a vote in the Senate, where only a simple majority is needed to move it forward. If approved, it will head to the House of Representatives for final revisions and potential passage. The outcome could determine whether the solar industry has a future in the U.S. residential market—or if it will fade into a cautionary tale.

Tougher Economics for Homeowners

Outside of federal policy changes, other challenges are making solar less attractive to homeowners. Rising interest rates have made financing harder, driving up the cost of monthly payments for those using loans. Previously, many homeowners opted for solar to save money on energy bills. But with fewer favorable loan options, the cost savings are shrinking.

In states like California, new rules have cut payments to homeowners for the excess power their panels send back to the grid—by more than 75% in some cases. This means the return on investment for installing solar has taken a major hit.

On top of that, the cost of equipment is going up. Tariffs on imported aluminum (used in frames and mounting systems) and solar cells are adding to installation prices. All of these changes are happening at once, squeezing both homeowners and solar companies.

The Long History of Solar Ups and Downs

Industry veterans often refer to the “solar coaster”—a nickname earned from the frequent policy changes and market instability that have defined the sector for years. Back in 2022, the Biden administration tried to bring stability through the Inflation Reduction Act, which extended the 30% tax credit through the mid-2030s. That move was celebrated as a turning point.

But now, with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act potentially undoing that progress, the industry is once again bracing for uncertainty.

Can the Industry Reinvent Itself?

Despite the setbacks, experts say there’s still hope—if the industry can significantly reduce what are known as “soft costs.” These are non-hardware expenses like sales commissions, permitting, grid connection fees, and paperwork, which make up more than 65% of the cost of going solar in the U.S.",https://techstory.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/images-46.jpeg,N,,2025-06-21 14:06:11.623159

That’s it below, the zenith of automotive design in 1769 (or the nadir; as the first car-thing, it was by default the best and worst of all time, of the time). One can just imagine Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot astride his machine on its first hot, noisy, slow, possibly explode-y voyage, wondering what the futures of 1896 and 1996 would bring to his feat of innovation. “Perchance it shall have two boilers! And drive itself!” He might have thought that, you never know.

What I do know is we automobile people are now more obsessed with the future of cars than ever, as the end of gasoline and diesel as the predominant sources of automotive power is nigh, and advances in artificial intelligence – the worst kind of itelligence, I say – communication networks, and automotive technology intersect to make meatbags in charge command decisions potentially just as obsolete as igniting dinosaur remains to get from A to B.

So what will tomorrow bring for the automobile? What do you want it to bring? Speaking solely for myself, I hope the near future of cars will include ever more electrification, but not necessarily more pure electric vehicles. For certain, I want everyone for whom a BEV makes sense to get one. But I would also like there to be much greater understanding and acceptance that PHEVs and range-extended electric cars are tremendously beneficial to the environment versus traditional ICE cars, and are an excellent option for many drivers who cannot yet accommodate a BEV life.

I would also be thrilled if the future saw consumers waking up to the notion that they may not need 400 or even 300 miles of range, and maybe 200 miles is fine for nearly all of their trips. Or 100 miles! Less battery capacity means less weight to accelerate and decelerate (and less wear on tires, suspension, and brakes), smaller pack dimensions that free up space for other things, and a reduced sticker price. Further, lower-capacity batteries will allow the Earth’s supply of battery-making elements to go into many more cars than it would in a world where every car must carry a 400-mile battery.

The global market for Carbon-Neutral Fuels was estimated at US$88.4 Billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$126.5 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.2% from 2024 to 2030.

This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions. The report includes the most recent global tariff developments and how they impact the Carbon-Neutral Fuels market.

Why Are Carbon-Neutral Fuels Emerging as a Critical Solution in the Global Energy Transition?

As the global community intensifies efforts to combat climate change, carbon-neutral fuels are gaining prominence as a vital pathway toward decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors. These fuels produced using renewable energy sources and designed to release no net carbon emissions during their lifecycle are increasingly seen as a bridge between existing fossil fuel infrastructure and a fully electrified future. Unlike conventional fossil fuels, carbon-neutral fuels such as green hydrogen, synthetic e-fuels, and biofuels derived from waste biomass can provide a drop-in alternative with minimal modifications to engines, distribution systems, or fueling stations. This compatibility is crucial for sectors like aviation, shipping, and long-haul trucking, where direct electrification remains technically or economically challenging.

Governments and climate pacts like the Paris Agreement are applying pressure through carbon pricing, emissions targets, and clean fuel mandates, incentivizing rapid adoption and innovation in carbon-neutral technologies. With rising global energy demand and growing skepticism over the pace of electrification, carbon-neutral fuels offer a pragmatic, scalable alternative that aligns environmental goals with industrial reality. Furthermore, these fuels can be synthesized using carbon captured from the atmosphere or industrial processes, enabling a closed-loop carbon cycle that supports global net-zero ambitions. As the urgency to act on emissions intensifies, carbon-neutral fuels are moving from concept to commercial deployment, becoming a linchpin in the strategy to decouple energy consumption from carbon output.

What Policy Measures and Market Trends Are Accelerating Adoption?

The policy landscape is evolving rapidly to support the growth of carbon-neutral fuels, with governments, international agencies, and private-sector coalitions all playing pivotal roles. In Europe, the Renewable Energy Directive II and Fit for 55 package mandate a rising share of renewable and low-carbon fuels in transportation, including aviation and maritime sectors. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law offer tax credits and funding for clean hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) projects, while Canada, Japan, and South Korea have unveiled national hydrogen strategies with strong incentives for carbon-neutral fuel development. Carbon pricing mechanisms such as the EU Emissions Trading System are making fossil fuels more expensive to use, indirectly boosting demand for cleaner alternatives.

Meanwhile, corporate commitments to net-zero targets are prompting major logistics, airline, and energy firms to invest in long-term supply agreements for carbon-neutral fuels. International aviation bodies like ICAO are setting SAF adoption targets, while maritime regulators push for low-carbon fuel usage across shipping lanes. Financial markets are also playing a role, with green bonds and climate-aligned investment funds directing capital toward fuel innovation projects.

On the consumer side, increased awareness of carbon footprints is driving demand for sustainable travel and low-emission delivery options, indirectly influencing fuel sourcing. These policy and market shifts are creating a favorable ecosystem for carbon-neutral fuels to scale moving the conversation from niche pilot projects to global industrial deployment, and establishing the regulatory certainty needed for long-term infrastructure investments.

What's Powering the Growth of the Global Carbon-Neutral Fuels Market?

The growth in the carbon-neutral fuels market is driven by several intertwined factors spanning environmental targets, industrial demand, technological viability, and strategic policy support. At the core is the global push toward net-zero emissions, with more than 140 countries and thousands of corporations committing to carbon neutrality by mid-century. This sweeping commitment is translating into direct demand for low-emission alternatives in sectors that cannot easily electrify aviation, marine shipping, heavy manufacturing, and long-haul freight. On the technology side, the rapid maturation of green hydrogen electrolysis, CO2-to-fuel conversion, and biomass gasification is enabling large-scale, commercially viable production pathways.

From an end-use perspective, industries are eager to decarbonize without overhauling existing infrastructure, making drop-in carbon-neutral fuels an attractive proposition. Consumer and corporate behavior is evolving, with rising scrutiny of Scope 3 emissions, greater interest in sustainable sourcing, and ESG frameworks pushing companies to adopt low-carbon fuel solutions. Policy support is equally vital, with tax incentives, fuel blending mandates, infrastructure funding, and clean energy subsidies helping bridge the economic gap between conventional and carbon-neutral fuels.

Additionally, geopolitical concerns over energy security and fuel independence are prompting many nations to invest in local, renewables-based fuel production, reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels. International cooperation through climate accords and technology-sharing partnerships is further accelerating knowledge transfer and deployment. Together, these drivers are not only propelling the carbon-neutral fuels market forward but are also positioning it as a foundational pillar of the emerging global green energy economy.

… The American people deserve to be able to make informed decisions with unbiased, vetted information.” Shooting for the Stars The Energy Star program has been a guiding light for many American households and businesses.","The Energy Star program has become one of the most successful volunteer efforts to reduce electricity consumption in the U.S. What started as a partnership between the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) became a symbol of efficiency and climate progress for American consumers. The current presidential administration is attempting to dismantle it.

The Energy Star Program and Its Impact

Energy Star was an effort to certify household appliances following energy-efficient standards. The blue sticker on a refrigerator signaled easy-to-understand information about a product — people knew that if they bought something with Energy Star’s approval, they would save money and power. The organization has cataloged the benefits since its inception. Since 1992, the iconic program has:

Saved 5 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity.

Reduced costs by more than $500 billion.

Prevented 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases from entering the atmosphere.

President Donald Trump and his administration have issued orders to dissolve the program. An EPA statement clarified that the change will result in “organizational improvements” and allow it to fulfill “statutory obligations.” The decision follows other contentious changes to the EPA, including the dissolution of its Environmental Justice and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion departments.

Many question the validity of these claims, as Energy Star has been a well-supported, bipartisan program for decades with proven economic and environmental benefits. President Trump tried to get rid of it during his first term and failed. Despite questions of legality, the second attempt may prove fatal to the program.

The Ways to Obtain Efficiency Without Energy Star

Even if the program ends, there are many ways for households and businesses to cut consumption to save money and prevent emissions. The Trump administration has already rolled back over 100 environmental and climate-related rulings, so households need to compensate for the long-term ecological damage this will cause.

First, households can embrace the future by installing smart home devices. Something as quick as replacing incandescent bulbs with advanced LEDs can lead to 90% energy savings, plus data-driven decision-making functions. Smart ceiling fans, window shades, HVAC systems and more are available to learn about the climate and occupancy levels to adjust to the most optimized settings without manual intervention.

Additionally, homeowners should prevent as much heat and air from escaping as possible. Around 25%-30% of energy flies out of windows, making low-emissivity glass and glazes an easy installation to save tons of power. Residents can also invest in weather stripping, caulking and other crack-sealing measures to prevent unwanted air exchanges.

Families can also invest in more comprehensive improvements. Renewable power, like geothermal heat pumps, is efficient and still has tax incentives available to save people money. Other renovations, like passive solar heating designs and hydronic heating systems, distribute energy more gradually throughout homes to provide long-term comfort.

The Impact on American Homeowners

Americans recognize the Energy Star logo, which carries enormous weight for a cleaner energy transition. A sticker made it simpler for shoppers to make expensive purchasing decisions. In 2022, 45% of households consciously bought an Energy Star-labeled product because of its reputation and impact.

Many citizens are navigating climate anxiety in the most accessible ways, like knowing what a certification represents. Studies show that people are still confused by most green terminology, with 78% not understanding greenwashing and 86% unsure of what ESG stands for — environmental, social and governance principles..

Governments must provide people with identifiable, reputable signposts for eco-friendly initiatives. This would make households feel more confident and hopeful about the future. Without Energy Star, American consumers may experience increased stress when finding the best products to fit their sustainability goals.

The Effects on America’s Energy Emergency

At the beginning of his second term, President Trump declared a nationwide energy emergency, citing demand was at an all-time high and desperate measures were necessary to meet it.

Without the program as a guide, retrofitting projects and new builds alike could suffer energy-efficiency problems. Dismissing standards could increase the number of gas stoves and highly consumptive dryers, making them mainstays again.

The trend could jeopardize the energy transition, climate progress and Americans’ wallets. Utility prices will rise as people depend more on chaotically priced fossil fuels, and carbon emissions from the building sector will reach new heights.

Instead of corporations, homeowners will endure the financial burdens of inefficient technologies because companies will not waste time abiding by energy-efficient compliance frameworks.

The Deputy Legislative Director for Clean Energy and Electrification for the Sierra Club, Xavier Boatright, commented on the shift, suggesting, “For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an ‘energy emergency,’ Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency. … The American people deserve to be able to make informed decisions with unbiased, vetted information.”

Shooting for the Stars

The Energy Star program has been a guiding light for many American households and businesses. It simplified decision-making while producing some of the most irrefutable benefits for the planet. Its elimination will disrupt the U.S.’s trajectory toward a modernized grid and energy-efficient future, but citizens can still make moves to reduce their consumption.

Those in support of Energy Star’s impact should vocalize concerns with local representatives and commit to greater electricity awareness in the future to save as much as possible.",https://greenerideal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gi-fb2-150x150.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 10:02:54.096060

The report demonstrates that it is possible to achieve nearly constant solar electricity every hour of every day of the year, highlighting the real-world potential of “24/365 solar generation” across diverse geographies.

Real-world projects, from the world’s first gigawatt-scale 24-hour solar facility in the United Arab Emirates to solar-powered data centres in Arizona, demonstrate that round-the-clock solar generation is already a reality.
As battery costs continue to fall and technology evolves, with the right policy support and investments, solar-plus-storage can become the backbone of clean, reliable and affordable electricity systems in the world’s sunniest regions and unleash the true potential of solar power.","London, 21 June – Batteries are now cheap enough to unlock solar power’s full potential. A new report from global energy think tank Ember reveals that, thanks to rapidly falling battery prices, solar can now deliver cost-competitive electricity almost every hour of the year in the world’s sunniest regions.

Using hourly solar data from 12 cities around the world, the report finds that in very sunny cities like Las Vegas, a combination of 6 GW of solar panels and 17 GWh of battery storage can reliably deliver 1 GW of electricity almost every hour of the year. This “24/365 solar generation” now costs just $104/MWh based on global average capital costs of solar and battery in 2024 — a 22% fall in price in just 12 months – making it cheaper than new coal in many regions ($118/MWh) or nuclear ($182/MWh).

The report demonstrates that it is possible to achieve nearly constant solar electricity every hour of every day of the year, highlighting the real-world potential of “24/365 solar generation” across diverse geographies. Las Vegas was a top performer (97% of hours annually), alongside Muscat (99%). Cities like Hyderabad, Madrid and Buenos Aires also showed strong results, achieving 80–95% of the way to 24/365 solar generation using the same 6 GW solar and 17 GWh battery configuration, even though they have some days of cloud cover. Even cloudier cities like Birmingham in the UK can cover 62% of hours annually.

For many emerging economies in sunny regions like Africa and Latin America, this presents a transformative opportunity. With solar-plus-storage, large electricity users like manufacturers and data centres can be powered directly where sunlight is strongest, without having to wait in queues for costly grid expansion or connection.

While it won’t solve all challenges at the grid level, this approach lets solar become the backbone of clean energy in sunny areas – and play a larger role elsewhere – than without a battery. It can also cut grid expansion costs by enabling up to five times more solar on existing connections, deferring expensive upgrades.

The sharp drop in battery prices has brought 24-hour solar closer to reality. In 2024 alone, global battery costs fell by 40%, helping cut the cost of solar-plus-storage by 22%. With record-low tenders coming in from places like Saudi Arabia, even cheaper clean electricity could be on the horizon.

Real-world projects, from the world’s first gigawatt-scale 24-hour solar facility in the United Arab Emirates to solar-powered data centres in Arizona, demonstrate that round-the-clock solar generation is already a reality. As battery costs continue to fall and technology evolves, with the right policy support and investments, solar-plus-storage can become the backbone of clean, reliable and affordable electricity systems in the world’s sunniest regions and unleash the true potential of solar power.",https://ember-energy.org/app/uploads/2024/10/Ember_global_energy_think_tank_logo.png,N,,2025-06-21 02:59:41.995181

Beyond jobs and innovation, solar energy also strengthens Europe’s energy independence.","Solar energy is one of the world’s most abundant and easily accessible sources of renewable power. But how well do you know it?

Several distinct technologies harness the sun’s power in different ways. Photovoltaic (PV) panels convert sunlight into electricity. Solar thermal panels use the sun’s energy to produce heat. Concentrated solar power uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight and produce heat and steam to generate electricity.

In 2008, solar photovoltaic accounted for just 1% of Europe’s electricity. Today it represents 10% in the EU and even 23% in Greece, 19% in Spain or 16% in Germany, making it one the EU’s fastest-growing energy sources. Nearly 150GW of new capacity, which could power around 42 million households,[1] was added between 2022 and 2024 and a further 70 GW is expected in 2025. This rapid expansion reflects the strong momentum for rolling out renewable energy in the EU. With the EU’s commitment to reaching climate neutrality by 2050, solar energy is expected to deliver a major share of the Union’s renewable power. We have set ambitious targets. By 2030, the EU aims to reach at least 700 GW of new solar generation capacity, four times more than in 2020. This shift is already well underway: in 2023 renewables overtook fossil fuels in electricity generation (1,200 TWh vs 788 TWh) and by 2024, it reached a record 47% of overall electricity generation. Driving this surge are wind and solar — with solar alone jumping by 15% in just one year.

Despite its rapid growth and clear climate benefits, solar energy, and especially photovoltaics, are still surrounded by a few persistent myths and misunderstandings.

Let’s shed some light on the facts. Here are 5 key things you should know about solar.

1. Photovoltaic systems are safe

Solar panels are a great addition to your home as they generate renewable electricity - even on cloudy days. And when it comes to safety, they’re among the most reliable technologies available. While any electrical device carries a potential fire risk, incidents involving solar installations are exceedingly rare. SolarPower Europe’s data from Germany (between 1993 and 2013) and the Netherlands (between 2015 and 2018) shows that fires caused by solar panels occur in just 0.006% to 0.014% of cases, a rate significantly lower than that of many common household appliances. When issues do arise, they are typically linked to poor installation or faulty components, not the solar technology itself.

Across Europe, strong safeguards are in place to keep solar installations safe. All solar panels, whether imported or manufactured in the EU, must meet strict technical requirements under EU product safety legislation and standards. To ensure systems are installed properly, EU countries must have certification schemes (or equivalents) for solar photovoltaic installers and designers, as required by the Renewables Directive. These schemes include training programmes and public lists of certified installers. On top of that, EU rules also cover how photovoltaic systems connect to the electricity grid, while allowing some flexibility for national requirements.

2. Solar panels take up very little space

Solar energy comes in many shapes and sizes. Solar photovoltaic and solar thermal panels can be installed in compact spaces such as rooftops and balconies, and even integrated into buildings as solar roof tiles or facades. In some EU countries, homeowners and tenants can install plug-in solar panels on balcony railings, walls or terraces. These systems connect directly to the household grid, providing clean electricity for self-consumption, and helping to cut energy bills.

Not every building is ideal for installing solar panels – but that doesn’t mean you’re left out. Energy communities and energy sharing can provide a smart solution. Through energy communities, citizens, local authorities and businesses can team up to invest in clean energy projects, including solar energy, at local level. This allows them to produce, sell and use renewable energy collectively – even if the panels aren’t on their own roofs. Energy sharing allows you to share the electricity you generate with neighbours, friends or relatives. In short, we don’t need solar panels on our own rooftop to benefit from solar power in our home.

Large-scale solar farms may take up more land, but their efficiency is rapidly improving. For instance, the Cestas Solar Park in France spans 265 hectares (equivalent to roughly 8% of the size of the Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris). With an installed capacity of 300 megawatt-peak, it can produce enough power for more than 70,000 households per year.

To make the most of available space, innovative and integrated approaches like agrisolar show great potential. These systems combine solar power production with agricultural use, allowing land to remain primarily dedicated to farming. Meanwhile floating solar installations on bodies of water, sometimes paired with hydropower, offer another innovative solution to expand solar generation without competing for land.

3. Solar plants and wildlife co-exist on friendly terms

Like all human activity, using solar technologies has an environmental impact. But it’s climate change that poses the single greatest threat to biodiversity, affecting countless species and ecosystems across Europe and the globe. With an average temperature increase of 1.5°C, 6% of insect species, 8% of plant species and 4% of vertebrates would lose more than half of their habitat. Currently we are heading/tracking towards an increase of 2°C and more. Without urgent action, far more species will be pushed to the brink.

Renewables like solar energy are crucial for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by replacing electricity generated from fossil fuels. In doing so, they play a key role in tackling global warming and its growing threat to wildlife.

As highlighted by research from the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) – the expansion of renewables, including solar, must be carefully managed to safeguard biodiversity. Climate action and nature protection can and must go hand in hand.

With good planning, the deployment of renewables can benefit ecosystems. Solar farms can support habitat restoration on degraded land, while other innovative approaches include repurposing former industrial or mining land, installing floating solar on artificial lakes and other bodies of water, and designing sites to enhance biodiversity and enable wildlife mobility.

Most solar power systems in the EU are installed on rooftops – already built-up spaces that exert no additional pressure on land or nature. Rooftop solar is quick to install, helps protect consumers from energy price volatility, and avoids land and biodiversity conflicts. According to scientific studies, rooftops could provide almost 25% of the EU’s electricity needs - a huge potential to tap into.

4. Solar energy is affordable

In 2024, renewables produced nearly half of all electricity in Europe, up from 38% in 2021 and 30% in 2015. This steady rise is driven by the EU’s target of reaching at least 42.5% of renewables in the overall energy mix by 2030. Yet, despite this growth, households and businesses have faced higher energy bills due to the energy crisis. Price spikes have been particularly noticeable since the end of 2021 due to Russia’s weaponisation of its energy exports and the EU’s reliance on imported fossil fuels. As of 2024, fossil fuels still account for around 28% of the EU’s electricity generation.

Solar energy, like wind, is a far more affordable alternative. According to the International Energy Agency, solar is now among the cheapest options for new electricity generation. The price of building new solar capacity has dropped sharply over the last decade, both for photovoltaic and concentrated solar power. Solar photovoltaic now costs less than half as much of coal - another important reason it’s become a major contributor to the EU’s power supply.

As well as the lower costs and emissions, expanding our solar capacity helps wean the EU off imported energy sources like gas, and strengthen our energy independence.

5. Solar energy can strengthen our energy system’s resilience

A resilient energy system is essential for ensuring Europe’s energy security, economic competitiveness and public safety. Solar energy has a key role to play.

One of the major advantages of solar generation is its often decentralized nature: much of it is produced close to where it is used, helping to reduce losses and improve the energy system's resilience. While large utility-scale solar plants contribute significantly, rooftop photovoltaic on homes, businesses and industrial sites made up 58% of the EU’s solar photovoltaic installations in 2024, compared to 42% utility-scale solar.

When combined with energy storage, the contribution of solar energy to the resilience of the energy system becomes even more powerful. Batteries allow solar systems to supply electricity even at night or during grid disruptions. During the April 2025 blackout in the Iberian Peninsula, for example, the University of Almería remained open thanks to on-site solar and battery storage. The impact of the blackout lasted 10 seconds, which is the time it took to activate the emergency power supply.

While solar is a variable energy resource, grid operators – those responsible for managing and operating the electricity grids – have a toolkit to ensure the reliability and flexibility of the electricity system. A diverse mix of variable renewables, such as solar and wind, can be effectively balanced across the grid with adequate transmission capacity and flexibility, such as that provided by energy storage and demand response – that is, when consumers shift electricity use to other periods, such as when supply is more abundant (and cheaper). In addition, firm low-carbon energy resources such as geothermal energy, sustainably sourced biomass and biogas and nuclear power, can help fill the gaps, providing power regardless of the weather. Together, these resources can deliver a secure, low-carbon electricity system that meets demand around the clock.

And there’s more: solar photovoltaic systems can also contribute to grid stability by providing essential grid services that make the whole system not only greener, but more resilient.

Conclusion

Solar energy has come a long way since 1839, when French physicist Edmond Becquerel first discovered that sunlight could generate electricity. Today it’s far more than just a clean and abundant energy source, it’s a driver of economic innovation, jobs and sustainable industry in Europe.

The solar workforce is growing fast: the EU photovoltaic sector employed 826,000 people by the end of 2023, a 27% increase from 2022. If this trend continues, Europe could see more than 1 million solar workers by 2027, according to SolarPower Europe.

Beyond jobs and innovation, solar energy also strengthens Europe’s energy independence. By generating clean electricity at home, we reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels, improve energy security and help households and businesses cut their energy bills.",https://energy.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/styles/ewcms_metatag_image/public/2025-06/Solar_Copyright_AdobeStock_AndreNery.jpg?h=10d202d3&itok=fxgHD3P0,N,,2025-06-21 09:05:55.913192

Key differences include varying approaches to state and local tax deductions, child tax credits, and Medicaid reforms.

Overview Of The 2025 Tax Reform Process

Following the expiration of many Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions at the end of 2025, both chambers of Congress have advanced comprehensive tax reform legislation through the budget reconciliation process. The House passed its version, officially titled the Tax Reform and Extension Act of 2025 (H.R. 1), on May 22, 2025, by a narrow 215-214 vote. The Senate Finance Committee released its legislative text on June 16, 2025, with significant modifications to the House approach.

House-Passed ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill’ Key Provisions

Individual Tax Provisions

The House bill makes permanent the lower individual income tax rates from the TCJA and provides additional inflation adjustments to all tax brackets except the top 37% bracket. The legislation permanently extends the doubled standard deduction while temporarily boosting it by $2,000 for married couples filing jointly and $1,000 for single filers from 2025-2028.

Family And Child Benefits

The child tax credit is made permanent, and the maximum child tax credit is temporarily increased to $2,500 (from $2,000) from 2025 to 2028 (subsequent years will be $2,000). The bill also establishes Qualified Children's Savings Accounts for children under 18, providing one-time $1,000 federal credit per eligible child born between 2025 and 2028.

State And Local Tax Deduction (SALT)

The new cap is $40,000, effective January 1, 2025, and phases down at a rate of 30% for individual taxpayers with adjusted gross income exceeding $500,000, as defined in Section 164 of the Internal Revenue Code. This represents a significant increase from the current $10,000 cap established under the TCJA.

Business Tax Provisions

The House bill restores full expensing for domestic research and development expenses and allows full expensing for new capital investments in machinery and equipment. It also restores interest deductibility to pre-2022 levels based on EBITDA rather than EBIT.

Revenue Raisers

Raises $570 billion from FY2025-2034 primarily through eliminating green energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, including immediate termination of electric vehicle tax credits.

Senate Finance Committee Bill Key Provisions

Individual Tax Framework

The Senate Finance Committee's portion of the reconciliation bill prevents a more-than $4 trillion tax hike on American families and workers and makes the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent. Like the House, it permanently extends lower tax rates and the doubled standard deduction.

Modified Family Benefits

The Child Tax Credit would increase to just $2,200 — less than the $2,500 in the House version. The Senate version also establishes savings accounts for newborns but with different parameters than the House MAGA accounts.

SALT Deduction Approach

The committee has the SALT cap set to $10,000 in the new text — far below the $40,000 limit the House landed on. This is intentionally included as a placeholder pending final negotiations between chambers.

Additional Tax Relief

Provides a $6,000 bonus exemption to millions of low- and middle-income seniors, slashing their tax burden, which exceeds the House version's $4,000 senior deduction.

Business Provisions

It would make permanent various business and other tax incentives, including expensing of investments in equipment and R&D. The Senate version permanently extends these provisions rather than the temporary approach in some House provisions.

Medicaid Reforms

Republican senators are proposing deeper cuts to Medicaid spending by lowering the provider tax that certain states are allowed to assess. The Senate version includes more extensive Medicaid work requirements and eligibility restrictions than the House bill.

Major Differences Between House And Senate Versions

Fiscal Impact And Scope

The most significant difference lies in the overall fiscal approach. Our preliminary analysis finds the tax provisions increase long-run GDP by 0.8 percent and reduce federal tax revenue by $4.0 trillion from 2025 through 2034 on a conventional basis before added interest costs for the House bill. The Senate version operates under different budget constraints and uses a ""current policy baseline"" that effectively assumes continuation of TCJA provisions.

Family Tax Benefits

While both bills enhance the child tax credit, the House provides a larger temporary increase ($2,500 vs. $2,200 per child). However, the Senate offers more generous senior tax relief ($6,000 vs. $4,000 deduction).

State And Local Tax Treatment

The SALT deduction represents perhaps the most contentious difference. The House's $40,000 cap reflects negotiations with blue-state Republicans, while the Senate's placeholder $10,000 cap signals resistance to generous SALT relief among senators who don't represent high-tax states.

Medicaid And Spending Reforms

""The Senate Finance Committee's proposed Medicaid reforms represent a more significant reduction in spending compared to the House version,"" according to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. The Senate version includes more aggressive Medicaid reforms, including stricter work requirements and provider tax limitations.

Detailed Comparison Table

Economic Impact And Analysis

Growth Projections

Our analysis finds the tax provisions included in the House-passed bill would increase long-run GDP by 0.8 percent. The economic impact differs between versions due to varying approaches to business tax provisions and the permanence of certain measures.

Deficit Impact

According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office for the House version. The Senate's use of current policy baseline accounting significantly changes the apparent fiscal impact.

Distributional Effects

Both bills primarily benefit middle and upper-middle-income taxpayers through TCJA extension, though the House's higher SALT cap provides more benefits to high-income households in high-tax states.

Key Challenges In Conference Committee

Regional Tensions

The SALT deduction difference reflects fundamental regional tensions, with House Republicans from high-tax states pushing for relief while Senate Republicans from low-tax states resist subsidizing state spending.

Fiscal Constraints

Senator Johnson has indicated he does not currently support the legislation, citing concerns about its fiscal impact. Reconciling the different fiscal approaches will require significant compromise.

Timeline Pressures

Republican leadership aims to complete the legislation by July 4, 2025, but Johnson also insisted the bill would not get to Trump's desk by Republicans' July Fourth deadline. ""No, not by July. No way. We haven't had the discussions we need,"" he said.

What's Next: Conference Process

The two chambers must now reconcile their differences through the conference committee process. Key areas requiring resolution include:

1. SALT deduction levels - Finding a compromise between $10,000 and $40,000.

2. Child tax credit amounts - Determining final per-child credit levels.

3. Medicaid reform scope - Balancing fiscal savings with program access.

4. Business provision permanence - Deciding which temporary measures become permanent.

5. Overall fiscal impact - Managing debt ceiling and deficit concerns.

Implications For Taxpayers And Businesses

Individual Taxpayers

Both versions ensure continuation of lower TCJA tax rates, preventing significant tax increases for most Americans. The final SALT deduction level will particularly impact taxpayers in high-tax states like California, New York, and New Jersey.

Families

All families will benefit from permanent child tax credit extensions, with the final amount depending on conference negotiations. The new savings accounts for children represent a novel approach to encouraging long-term savings.

Businesses

Both versions restore critical business tax provisions like R&D expensing and equipment expensing, with the Senate's permanent approach providing greater certainty for long-term planning.

Seniors

The Senate's more generous senior tax relief could significantly benefit older Americans, particularly those on fixed incomes.

Estate Planning Strategies: Next Steps

For estate planners and their clients, the prospect of a higher, permanent exemption is reassuring but not a reason for complacency. Here’s what you should consider:

1. Review and update your plan: Even with a higher exemption, lifetime gifts and trust strategies can still remove future appreciation from your estate, locking in today’s benefits.

2. Monitor the legislative process: The final bill may differ from either current version. Flexibility is key.

3. Consider state-specific impacts: The House’s higher SALT cap could make a meaningful difference for residents of Massachusetts and other high-tax states.

4. Work with your advisors: Coordinate with your estate planning attorney and tax professionals to tailor your strategy to both current law and future possibilities.

Overall, the proposed tax reforms present both opportunities and challenges for estate planning. Advisors must stay informed of legislative developments and remain agile in adapting strategies to optimize tax efficiency and meet the evolving needs of their clients.

Conclusion

The 2025 tax reform debate represents a critical juncture for American fiscal policy. While both chambers agree on extending TCJA provisions to prevent massive tax increases, significant differences remain on key details. The conference committee process will determine whether Republicans can deliver on their promise of comprehensive tax relief while managing fiscal constraints and regional tensions.

Key Takeaway: Success will require compromise on contentious issues like SALT deductions and Medicaid reforms while maintaining the core goal of making tax relief permanent for American families and businesses.

“We strongly support this bill because it incentivizes investments in startups and stimulates innovation in fast-growing industries,” Emigholz said.
But l’m hopeful all three of these bills can get to the finish line to boost our innovation economy.","They say good things come in threes.

And so goes three of the more pro-innovation and pro-manufacturing recommendations in Gov. Phil Murphy’s proposed FY26 budget, with just 10 days to go before the state’s spending plan needs to be finalized.

On Thursday, three bills strongly supported by NJBIA and part of the governor’s budget, all advanced in the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

“This is a great sign,” said NJBIA Chief Government Affairs Officer Christopher Emigholz. “Certainly, there has been criticism of certain tax increases or pro-business funding reductions in the initial budget proposals, but we must be fair and mindful about the positives in the governor’s plan.

“We were happy to testify in support of these bills this week and to see such overwhelming support for them from our lawmakers. We will continue to urge their passage to the governor’s desk.”

The three key bills advancing include:

A-2365 (Tully, D-38; Murphy D-7; DePhillips, R-40): Increases amount of tax credits for investments made in certain technology business ventures under the New Jersey Angel Investor Tax Credit Act.

A-4455 (Freiman, D-16; Schaer, D-36, Karabinchak, D-18): Allows for a deduction from New Jersey gross income of certain capital gains from sale or exchange of New Jersey qualified small business stock (QSBS) held for more than five years.

A-5687 (Greenwald, D-6; McLelland, R-1; Reynolds-Jackson, D-15): Establishes “Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program” to incentivize in-state manufacturing investments and job creation.

The latter of the three is perhaps the most compelling in that it uses $500 million from the existing Aspire and Emerge tax credit programs, under the direction of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.

It requires no new additional funding and enjoys bipartisan support from the Legislature’s Manufacturing Caucus. And the bill appears just as the previous and successful Manufacturing Voucher Program has been zeroed out in the FY26 budget.

“Manufacturing is important, and we need to get back to making more things in New Jersey and in our country because that’s what makes the economy go,” Emigholz told the Assembly Labor Committee earlier this week in another vote.

“Manufacturing is under attack to some extent,” he said. “There’s great federal uncertainty with some of the manufacturing programs that companies rely upon around the country that are looking to be cut. The tariff uncertainty and the supply chain uncertainty are things manufacturers are struggling with ... so this bill is necessary for an important industry.”

While one lawmaker was critical of a provision in the bill that requires $100 million of the program to have a clean energy dedication – he labeled it a ‘wind bill”. Emigholz said that criticism was both inaccurate and short-sighted.

“It isn’t a perfect bill, but let’s be clear – it’s only 20% of the program and the definition of clean energy includes nuclear, which by all accounts will be increasing in New Jersey,” Emigholz said.

“And even if you don’t support wind power, if a New Jersey manufacturer is creating parts or mechanisms for wind projects anywhere else in the world, our state is the beneficiary of the jobs and revenue created.”

A-2365 is also on the positive path, as it would increase tax credits provided under the New Jersey Angel Investor law for qualified investments made in New Jersey’s emerging technology business ventures.

The bill, and its Senate counterpart (S-3189), increases the value of tax credits from 20% to 35% of a taxpayer’s qualified investment in an emerging technology startup or venture fund.

The additional 5% bonus under current law means that investments made in emerging technology businesses located in low-income communities, or state certified as a minority- or women- owned enterprises, could be eligible for a tax credit of up to 40%.

“We strongly support this bill because it incentivizes investments in startups and stimulates innovation in fast-growing industries,” Emigholz said.

“Investments in emerging technology businesses lead to more than just patents; they spur economic activity and produce well-paying jobs.”

While bill A-4455 is a bit more technical in nature, the benefits are clear:

New Jersey is currently one of only five states that does not conform to federal QSBS tax standards, meaning investors in the Garden State are taxed on QSBS gains at the full state income tax rate. The federal tax code allows for a partial exclusion.

This legislation allows for a deduction from New Jersey gross income of certain capital gains from sale or exchange of New Jersey (QSBS) held for more than five years.

“Ending our uncompetitive and outlier tax treatment of investments in innovative start-ups is one of the best ways to attract capital to grow jobs, our economy and our tax revenues,” Emigholz said.

“It’s a big win if we can get this done. But l’m hopeful all three of these bills can get to the finish line to boost our innovation economy. We thank the governor and the Legislature for putting it on the path.,” Emigholz said.",https://njbia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Untitled-2025-06-19T215141.633.png,N,,2025-06-21 02:59:47.074061

OREGON ENACTS LAW ADDRESSING RISING ENERGY COSTS, PROTECTING CONSUMERS FROM EXTREME ENERGY USE OF BIG TECH : Oregon Governor Tina Kotek signed the “Protecting Oregonians With Energy Responsibility” (POWER) Act into law this week, creating a new electric rate pricing system for data centers, cryptocurrency operations, and other large energy users. Oregon is currently home to 131 data centers, each of which can consume as much electricity as 50,000 residential homes. Currently in Oregon, industrial customers pay around eight cents per kilowatt hour, compared to over 19 cents per kilowatt hour paid by residential customers. This law will ensure that Oregonians do not continue to pay higher rates for electricity driven by energy-intensive industries.

NCLCV AND BLUEGREEN ALLIANCE URGE SENATOR TILLIS TO PRESERVE CLEAN ENERGY TAX CREDITS: North Carolina LCV and BlueGreen Alliance held a press conference at Senator Thom Tillis’ office highlighting the economic benefits of clean energy tax credits and urging the senator to vote against congressional Republicans’ Big Ugly Bill. Representatives from the BlueGreen Alliance warned that the House version of the reconciliation bill will eliminate union jobs and slow down investments in the state, which has become a leader in energy and manufacturing.

NCLCV TAKE: North Carolina LCV Government Relations Director Dan Crawford said, “As it’s currently written, the Congressional reconciliation bill stops clean energy progress in its tracks. It could cost North Carolina tens of thousands of jobs by 2030, along with billions in clean energy investments spurred by clean energy and manufacturing tax credits. [Congress] should focus more on strengthening our economy and lowering costs, not on preserving tax breaks for the wealthiest and exploding the deficit. I call on Senator Tillis to demonstrate his leadership in making that happen.”

LCVVF LAUNCHES AD SUPPORTING ADELITA GRIJALVA: LCV Victory Fund launched a $60,000 television ad program supporting Adelita Grijalva in Arizona’s special election for the U.S. House of Representatives for Arizona’s seventh District. The ad outlines how Adelita Grijalva will protect social security, medicaid, and medicare, and stand up to Donald Trump.

LCVVF TAKE: LCV Victory Fund Regional Campaigns Director Nate Fowler said, “Adelita Grijalva has shown that she’ll fight back against the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress when they try to put Big Polluters before our communities. Having faced extreme heat waves in Arizona, Grijalva understands the importance of building a clean energy economy, supporting environmental justice, ensuring access to clean drinking water, and protecting our public lands while following the leadership of indigenous communities. Arizonans deserve a leader who will look out for their communities, families, and children and fight back against the attacks on climate progress.”

CLIMATE ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS

SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE RELEASES BILL TEXT: The Senate Finance Committee released its portion of the Big Ugly Bill that includes substantial cuts to clean energy tax credits, including incentives for wind and solar energy. Despite clear evidence that clean energy tax credits provide numerous benefits to their constituents, Republican senators chose to side with billionaires.

OUR TAKE: LCV Vice President of Government Affairs Sara Chieffo said, “Make no mistake, polluters and their allies in Congress are hellbent on banning clean energy just to pad their profits while we pay the price. Clean energy is the fastest, most affordable form of energy to bring online. At a time of rising energy demand and prices, blocking clean energy progress will drive up families’ energy costs while jeopardizing hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country and shuttering manufacturing facilities. Repealing clean energy tax credits will start raising energy bills next year by an average of $110 and will only keep going up.

“Pushing tax handouts for billionaires while raising energy and health costs on the rest of us is not what the American people want and we will fight this disastrous bill every step of the way. Now is the time for Senators who have said they support a more reasonable approach to clean energy incentives to deliver — we need actions, not empty promises.”

LCV released a deep dive on the Senate Finance Committee bill text and its massive cuts to clean energy tax credits.

TAKE 2: LCV Vice President of Federal Policy Matthew Davis said, “The Senate Finance Committee Republicans have released their title of the GOP’s reconciliation bill (a.k.a. Big Ugly Bill), and let’s be clear: while some of the words may have changed, the effect is the same – increased energy costs for people across the country ($110 more per year next year and rising to over $400 per year in the next five), attempting to ban clean energy like wind, solar, and batteries (93% of new U.S. electricity generation last year), and slashing hundreds of thousands of jobs and hundreds of billions of dollars of private investments. This bill remains an assault on U.S. manufacturing and American families struggling to keep up with rising energy bills—threatening hundreds of thousands of jobs, billions in private investment, and higher energy costs for consumers. The “tweaks” in this section of the Senate bill cannot disguise the basic fact: polluters benefit and people get screwed. This Senate scheme doubles down on the House’s agenda of gutting incentives for clean energy, pushing the U.S. clean energy industry off a cliff, further enriching fossil fuel executives, and handing Trump’s agencies broad power to rewrite vague provisions into full-blown roadblocks for clean energy deployment.”

Prior to the release of the Senate Finance Committee bill text, LCV released a memo recapping the first wave of provisions from the Energy and Natural Resources (ENR), Judiciary, and Homeland Security Committees in Senate Republicans’ big ugly budget reconciliation bill.

TAKE 3: LCV Vice President of Federal Policy Matthew Davis said, “The ENR Committee’s section of the Big Ugly Bill doesn’t just hand over more public land to Big Oil; it puts millions of acres of Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service lands up for sale. It’s all being done under the guise of the housing crisis, but there are no affordability requirements, no conservation safeguards, and no guardrails on what gets built. All told, there’s nothing stopping our public lands from being sold off for the next Trump Tower, or for luxury developers, fossil fuel companies, and profiteers to treat our shared natural heritage like private inventory.

“Over in the Judiciary Committee, Senate Republicans are trying to weaken the courts’ ability to hold polluters and the government accountable. One provision makes it harder to stop government abuses in court, while another bans the Justice Department from including payments for environmental restoration or community relief in legal settlements, even in cases of serious public harm.”

“And in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, infighting among Republicans led them to release two versions of the bill: one reduces the amount of funding for Trump’s racist and ineffective border wall relative to the House-passed bill but sells off the US Postal Service’s entire fleet of electric vehicles, while the other skips the vehicles sales but throws another $46.5 billion at the xenophobic border wall, which is an environmental disaster. And it gets worse: the bill maintains the Homeland Security Secretary’s sweeping authority to waive any law the agency wants, from the Clean Air Act to tribal consultation requirements, no matter the damage it causes.”

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES ROLLING BACK ASBESTOS BANS: Trump’s EPA plans to reconsider a ban on chrysotile asbestos, the last form of asbestos currently used in the United States. The substance is currently banned in over 50 countries, and is linked to mesothelioma, several other forms of cancer, and an estimated 40,000 deaths in the U.S. each year. This dangerous move from EPA, which brings us further from eliminating asbestos from our communities, would be a major setback for the health and safety of people across the country. Once again the Trump administration is moving us backwards and prioritizing the interests of big businesses and polluters above public health and safety.

Here's why, according to the document — see pages 2 and 4 (emphasis ours): EPA leadership has reviewed the Asbestos Rule and now intends to reconsider the Rule through notice-and-comment rulemaking.
In contrast, the EPA gave the chlorine industry five years to phase out use of chrysotile asbestos.","In late June 2025, a rumor spread online that the Environmental Protection Agency, under U.S. President Donald Trump, planned to reverse a ban on asbestos, a toxic, cancer-causing mineral once widely used as a building material.

Claims about the Trump administration's purported proposal spread on platforms like Facebook, Bluesky, Reddit and Threads.

As first reported by the The New York Times on June 16, 2025, it is true that the EPA plans to ""reconsider"" a ban on the last type of asbestos used in the United States, which was adopted by former President Joe Biden's administration. As of this writing, it remained unclear if the Trump administration definitively planned to reverse this ban.

The United States prohibited most forms of asbestos in 1989, but the courts overturned much of that ban; in 2019, the EPA issued a ""final rule to ensure that asbestos products that are no longer on the market cannot return to commerce without the Agency evaluating them and putting in place any necessary restrictions or prohibiting use.""

The EPA did not immediately respond to an email asking if the agency plans to reverse the Biden-era prohibition or other asbestos bans in the United States. As such, we cannot yet rate this claim — but here's what we know.

News revealed in EPA court filing

In a court filing dated June 16, 2025, the EPA told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that it planned to reconsider the Biden administration's decision to end ""ongoing uses"" of chrysotile asbestos, ""the only form known to be imported, processed, or distributed for use in the United States,"" per the EPA's 2024 news release announcing the prohibition.

At the time of the announcement, U.S. industries used chrysotile asbestos for automotive parts, like gaskets, clutches and brake pads, as well as roofing materials and in chlorine manufacturing. The EPA release said the toxic substance is linked to over 40,000 deaths in the United States per year.

The court case, filed by industries impacted by the EPA's decision and groups representing them on Oct. 7, 2024, challenged the ban over what the lawsuit called the EPA's ""overbroad approach"" to regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, which provides the EPA with authority to require restrictions relating to certain chemicals, with exceptions.

The EPA explained this on Page 2 of its filing:

These petitions challenge a final rule entitled ""Asbestos Part 1; Chrysotile Asbestos; Regulation of Certain Conditions of Use Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)."" See 89 Fed. Reg. 21970 (Mar. 28, 2024) (the ""Asbestos Rule"")

The ""Asbestos Rule"" is available on the government's Federal Register website here; as the court case noted, it is dated March 28, 2024, which means it happened during the Biden administration.

The summary of the rule noted it addressed ""the unreasonable risk of injury to health presented by chrysotile asbestos,"" including ""mesothelioma,"" a cancer that develops in the thin lining of internal organs, and ""lung, ovarian and laryngeal cancers resulting from chronic inhalation exposure."" (Researchers widely agree asbestos causes cancer; all forms of asbestos are prohibited in over 50 countries.)

On Page 1, the EPA's court filing asked the court to ""hold this case in abeyance"" — temporarily halt the proceedings — for six months, with possible further requests for a continued pause, as the EPA intends to ""reassess the challenged rule."" Here's why, according to the document — see pages 2 and 4 (emphasis ours):

EPA leadership has reviewed the Asbestos Rule and now intends to reconsider the Rule through notice-and-comment rulemaking. See Decl. of Lynn Dekleva ¶ 8. EPA expects that this process, including any regulatory changes, will take approximately 30 months.

[...]

It is possible that after its review, EPA could take action that may obviate the need for judicial resolution of some or all of the disputed issues.

In other words, the EPA is asking for a pause on the court case because it might reverse some or all of the provisions in dispute — and thus, it might reverse some or all of the Biden administration's ban on chrysotile asbestos.

The ban on 'ongoing use'

Rather than simply prohibit all forms of asbestos or all uses of chrysotile asbestos, the EPA specifically banned the manufacturing, processing and distribution of chrysotile asbestos among industries in the United States that, as at the time of the decision under Biden's EPA, used the toxic substance.

Here is the full list of prohibitions under the final rule — see section C., ""What action is the Agency taking?""

(i) Prohibit the manufacture (including import), processing, distribution in commerce and commercial use of chrysotile asbestos, including any chrysotile asbestos-containing products or articles, in the chlor-alkali industry and require interim workplace controls;

(ii) Prohibit the manufacture (including import), processing, use, distribution in commerce and commercial use of chrysotile asbestos, including any chrysotile asbestos-containing products or articles, for sheet gaskets in chemical production and require interim workplace controls for certain commercial uses;

(iii) Prohibit the manufacture (including import), processing, distribution in commerce and commercial use of chrysotile asbestos, including any chrysotile asbestos-containing products or articles, for oilfield brake blocks, aftermarket automotive brakes and linings, other vehicle friction products and other gaskets;

(iv) Prohibit the manufacture (including import), processing, and distribution in commerce of chrysotile asbestos, including any chrysotile asbestos-containing products or articles, for consumer use of aftermarket automotive brakes and linings and other gaskets; and

(v) Establish disposal and recordkeeping requirements.

As such, the Trump administration could decide to reverse some parts of the ban — for example, the EPA could continue to prohibit the use of chrysotile asbestos for automotive parts, but not for other uses — or it could decide to reverse the Biden administration's policy entirely.

The Biden administration's rule also set phaseout deadlines that differ based on use; the final regulation prohibited the use of chrysotile asbestos in automotive gaskets, for example, six months after the date the rule went into effect — May 28, 2024 — meaning the automotive industry should have already stopped using asbestos at the time of the Trump administration's filing. In contrast, the EPA gave the chlorine industry five years to phase out use of chrysotile asbestos. As such, the ""ban"" is technically not fully in effect yet.

To summarize: In a court filing, the EPA under Trump announced intent to reassess a Biden-era policy ending the remaining uses of asbestos in American industries. However, the Trump administration, as of this writing, has not announced any definitive intent to reverse that specific ban, nor is there any indication the EPA plans to reverse other asbestos bans in place.",https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/1200/https://media.snopes.com/2025/06/trump_asbestos.png,N,,2025-06-20 21:01:32.711637

Murkowski and Dan Sullivan can help make that possible by protecting the clean energy tax credits that are helping to make this kind of growth possible.","Alaskans understand how much energy matters. It’s not just about turning on the lights or plugging in a phone, it’s about staying warm through the long, dark winters. It’s about making sure a remote community hundreds of miles from the road system has access to affordable, reliable power. And it’s about keeping the cost of living from climbing even higher.

That’s why Alaskans can be thankful to our senators for standing up for something that may sound technical — federal clean energy tax credits — but in reality, makes a world of difference to real people, right here in our state. Both our senators should keep up the good work.

Clean energy tax credits like the ones passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act have enabled Alaskan households, businesses and communities to strengthen their energy efficiency while getting major clean energy projects off the ground in Alaska, creating and protecting good union jobs in the process. Without these energy tax credits, we risk seeing economy-growing projects stalled or canceled, jobs lost and energy costs pushed even higher for Alaskan families already feeling the pinch.

The Alaska AFL-CIO represents 50,000 workers in 50 local affiliates across the state. These are hardworking men and women who build and maintain the critical infrastructure that keeps Alaska running. These are the skilled electricians, laborers, teamsters and tradespeople who have powered our oil and gas industry, and who are now also ready and trained to build the next generation of energy, including wind, solar, hydropower and more. They take pride in what they do, and they deserve the chance to keep working, supporting their families and strengthening their communities.

Many Alaska workers have spent months out on remote job sites, away from their families, helping install wind turbines or repair transmission lines. They are not just doing a job, they’re building a future for their children and for Alaska. And they know, like I do, that the sooner we get more local, affordable energy online, the better it will be for everyone — whether you live in Anchorage or Aniak.

But these projects don’t just happen on their own. They take time. They take investment. And in Alaska, where the terrain is tough and the permitting process can stretch for years, they take strong policy support. The Inflation Reduction Act’s federal renewable energy tax credits have been critical for getting projects to the finish line. Take them away, and we’re back to square one with projects delayed, jobs lost and energy bills creeping up.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski said it well in her letter to Senate leadership earlier this year: Eliminating these credits would disrupt progress and hurt American workers. She’s absolutely right. Here in Alaska, it’s not just about policy, it’s about people. And our people are ready to work. Our unions have already trained workers to build these projects. They’re just waiting on the green light to get going.

We may not always agree with our elected leaders on every issue, but when it comes to energy, we share common ground: We all want a future that’s affordable, reliable and built right here at home. That’s what these tax credits help make possible.

The Alaska AFL-CIO is proud to support an “all of the above” energy approach that includes oil, gas and clean energy resources. We believe in building it all, as long as it creates good union jobs and keeps Alaskans warm, working and thriving.

Let’s keep moving forward. Let’s keep building. And let’s make sure the next generation of energy in Alaska is one we can all be proud of — union-built, Alaskan-made, and here to stay. Sens. Murkowski and Dan Sullivan can help make that possible by protecting the clean energy tax credits that are helping to make this kind of growth possible.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/20240813_140154-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 22:03:34.508958

Rapid advances in battery technology, especially in cost, have made near-continuous solar power, available every hour of every day of the year, an economic and technological reality in sunny regions.

Industries like data centres and factories need uninterrupted power to function. At the same time, the rising push for hourly-matched carbon-free energy goals — pursued largely through corporate Purchase Power Agreements (PPAs) — is increasing the demand for clean electricity every hour of the day. While solar is now extremely affordable and widely available, its real value will only be realised when it can deliver power consistently to meet the demands of a growing economy, even when the sun isn’t shining.

24-hour solar generation enables this by combining solar panels with sufficient storage to deliver a stable, clean power supply, even in areas without grid access or where the grid is congested or unreliable. While this may not solve every challenge at the grid level, since not all places are as sunny and the electricity demand varies hourly and seasonally, it provides a pathway for solar to become the backbone of a clean power system in sunny regions and to play a much bigger role in less sunny regions.

This report explores how close we are to achieving constant, 24-hour solar electricity across 365 days in different cities around the world, and what it would cost to get there.

It is possible to get 97% of the way to constant solar electricity every hour of every day of the year (24/365) in the sunniest cities.

Cloudy days mean that 24/365 solar generation – maintaining the same constant solar output every hour of every day of the year – would need so much solar and battery that it is likely uneconomical. However, in sunny cities it is possible to get more than 90% of the way. Las Vegas can reach 97% of the way to 1 GW constant supply and Muscat in Oman – 99%, using 6 GW solar panels and 17 GWh battery. Even cloudier cities like Birmingham can get 62% of the way to a constant supply every hour of every day across the year.

The emergence of 24-hour solar generation marks a fundamental shift in how solar fits into the broader power system. With the ability to deliver electricity around-the-clock, solar can now support 24/7 clean energy contracts (PPAs) for industries which require continuous power, not just daytime supply. This is extremely valuable for emerging economies, where solar-powered industrial and economic zones can emerge in sunny areas far from existing grid infrastructure. At the same time, it can also bring substantial potential savings on grid expansion costs – allowing up to five times as much solar capacity to be installed behind the same grid connection, maximizing existing assets and deferring costly upgrades.

As costs continue to fall and deployment accelerates, solar-plus-storage is emerging as the default model for clean power in the sunniest parts of the world — both on and off the grid. To fully realise its potential, energy policy must now catch up, by integrating 24-hour solar generation into planning frameworks, electricity market design and infrastructure development strategies.",https://ember-energy.org/app/uploads/2025/06/8-03-Summer-Solstice-Arctic-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 06:01:46.237249

In March, the court barred the EPA from imposing certain types of water quality fines on the city of San Francisco.","The US Supreme Court issued two rulings on Wednesday that establish where challenges to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) actions should be filed, remanding one lawsuit to regional circuits and directing the other suit to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In the 6-2 and 7-2 decisions, both authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court reinforced a framework for determining venue under the Clean Air Act (CAA).

The lawsuit Oklahoma v. EPA involved a dispute over State Implementation Plans (SIPs), which are state-developed plans that outline how each state will achieve and maintain federal air quality standards, subject to EPA approval. In 2023, the EPA denied the plans submitted by 21 states for violating the CAA’s Good Neighbor Provision, which requires states to prevent emissions that interfere with other states’ ability to meet air quality standards. The EPA bundled all 21 denials into one combined ruling and claimed that challenges belonged in the DC Circuit. Oklahoma, Utah and various fuel industry groups disagreed, filing suit to move their challenges to regional courts.

Wednesday’s ruling determined that the SIP disputes must be heard in regional circuits because the EPA “makes clear that its SIP disapprovals were based on ‘a number of intensely factual determinations’ particular to the State at issue.” The court found that the EPA evaluated each state’s plan “on its own merits” using a unique analysis for each state. The EPA had previously argued that the CAA’s “nationwide scope or effect” exception dictated that because the SIPs had broad, national implications, challenges must be brought in the D.C. Circuit. However, the Supreme Court held that this exception only applies when national implications are the “primary explanation for and driver of” EPA actions, whereas Oklahoma v. EPA involved mostly state-specific facts.

The lawsuit EPA v. Calumet Shreveport Refining addressed a dispute over small refinery exemption petitions, which are annual waivers given to small oil refineries that can demonstrate a “disproportionate economic hardship” from compliance with EPA fuel standards. In 2022, the EPA denied 105 exemption petitions, and refineries filed challenges in various regional circuits. Here, the Supreme Court held that the “nationwide exception” applied because determining disproportionate economic hardship requires comparing refineries across the country. Additionally, the EPA applied these determinations consistently when reviewing individual refineries.

The EPA has been under scrutiny by the Supreme Court in recent months.

Solar recycling interest growing in the US

Solarcycle continues to secure recycling agreements in the US with both upstream and downstream companies. Recently, the company signed a recycling agreement with German renewable energy company RWE Clean Energy to use its proprietary recycling system for the latter’s products.

At the upstream level, Solarcycle signed several PV recycling agreements with solar manufacturers in the US last year, including Silfab Solar, Canadian Solar, Heliene and Runergy.

On top of securing recycling partnerships with both solar manufacturers and developers, the company has been increasing its recycling manufacturing capacity with the construction of a 5GW solar panel recycling plant in the US state of Georgia.

At the time, the company said that the initial annual recycling capacity would start with two million panels per year, and would have the capacity to recycle up to ten million solar panels per year. The solar panel recycling plant will be located near its recycled solar glass manufacturing plant.

Aside from the recycling plant it is building in Georgia, Solarcycle also operates facilities in Odessa, Texas and Mesa, Arizona, where it is headquartered.

And for fuel producers, the courtroom door just swung wide open.","Fuel producers just scored a green light from the nation’s highest court to go after California’s aggressive emissions standards. In a 7-2 decision Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that energy companies like Valero’s Diamond Alternative Energy do, in fact, have standing to challenge the EPA’s 2022 decision that allowed California to impose tougher emissions and electric vehicle mandates than the federal baseline.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing for the majority, said plainly: “The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets… should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders.”

At the heart of the dispute is the EPA’s move under the Biden administration to reinstate California’s Clean Air Act waiver—a policy reversal from the Trump-era rollback. The waiver lets California, the largest car market in the country, set its own stricter tailpipe emissions limits and zero-emission vehicle mandates through 2025.

Fuel producers argued that these tougher rules kneecap liquid fuel demand and drive up compliance costs. The D.C. Circuit Court had tossed out the case last year, claiming the fuel producers failed to show their injury was traceable to the EPA’s waiver. The Supreme Court disagreed.

This ruling doesn’t decide the merits of the lawsuit—it merely revives it. But it adds to a growing body of Supreme Court skepticism over the regulatory reach of federal agencies. In recent years, the Court has curbed the EPA’s authority to regulate water pollution, power plant emissions, and cross-state ozone rules.

With a 6-3 conservative majority, the Court has increasingly questioned how much regulatory power Congress actually handed to agencies like the EPA. This latest decision signals that California’s long-standing autonomy under the Clean Air Act might not be as bulletproof as it once seemed. And for fuel producers, the courtroom door just swung wide open.

The big news was yesterday's Senate concurrence vote to accept massive changes to S266, the bill we call the Ratepayer Risks Act. Once the bill reaches Gov. Josh Stein, he has 10 days (including weekends) to veto it, which we've asked him to do (and you should, too – see our action alert below).

If the General Assembly adjourns as planned on Thursday – before that 10-day window ends – Stein will have another 30 days to act. We're not taking any chances.

We're one of six environmental organizations that signed a formal letter requesting a veto.

We spoke up to the media (and got some immediate coverage).

We're also planning a public event to encourage him.

Stay tuned for more news and ways you can help.

S266's many problematic provisions, which we outlined in this blog post, were piled into a gutted bill that was originally drafted to help Hurricane Helene victims rebuild. So now, instead of helping some North Carolinians, it will hurt far more. S266 goes beyond earlier attempts to make ratepayers shoulder ""construction work in progress"" (CWIP) costs and allow Duke Energy to renege on its pledge to lower carbon emissions by 2030. Now it also changes the way power companies recover fuel costs to a formula that favors industry over citizens.

We're also asking for a veto on another very bad bill that was enrolled and sent to Governor Stein yesterday.

H402, formerly known as the NC REINS Act and now called Limit Rules With Substantial Financial Costs, will make adopting administrative rules to protect the environment and public health nearly impossible. H402 requires each proposed or reviewed rule must have a fiscal impact analysis that ignores greater public benefits for each rule. Rules must be adopted with a supermajority or unanimous vote of administrative board members, depending on that analysis. This means the administrative branch would be hamstrung in its ability to keep experts in charge of regulations requiring specific, technical knowledge to develop. It may also be unconstitutional as a violation of the separation of powers. We are supporting a request for a veto.

We did get a few surprises this week:

There's movement on H8, Managing Environmental Waste Act, which passed the House but stalled in the Senate during the last two bienniums. A new committee substitute adds a section that allows for some materials that can be “up-cycled” to be set aside. The bill sponsor worked on this provision with the Department of Environmental Quality.

H442, Flounder/Red Snapper Seasons & Shrimp Trawl, got a rewrite before Senate approval this week to move shrimp trawling further out to sea, pitting commercial fishermen against recreational fishermen. The changes led to Senate floor fights and use of parliamentary procedure rarely seen, and likely damaged some relationships among Senate colleagues that will take some time to recover. The bill is supported by recreational fishermen. It's awaiting House concurrence.

Take action:

RIGHT NOW: Veto the Ratepayer Risks Act: Join us in urging Governor Stein to veto S266, the latest and worst attempt to let Duke Energy saddle ratepayers with higher bills to finance risky construction projects and backtrack on its pledge to lower carbon emissions.

“Solid employment growth continued in May as the state added 31,300 jobs. Texas job growth at 2.5 percent year to date is outpacing its long-term trend of 2.0 percent,” said Luis Torres, Dallas Fed senior business economist. “In May, gains in leisure and hospitality and oil and gas employment led overall job growth, followed by trade and transportation services and construction. The only sectors that lost jobs last month were information services and professional and business services. Employment growth in major Texas metro areas was led by Fort Worth, Austin and San Antonio. Meanwhile, Houston lost jobs last month,” he added.

The Texas Leading Index decreased over the three months through May. (Chart 2). Most of the components declined, led by the decrease in the U.S. leading index and the real oil price. Decreases in the help wanted index, the Texas Stock Index and well permits, and increases in the new unemployment claims, also dragged the index down.

Methodology

The Dallas Fed’s Texas Employment Forecast projects job growth for the calendar year and is estimated as the 12-month change in payroll employment from December to December.

The forecast is based on the average of four models. Three models are vector autoregressions for which Texas payroll employment is regressed on the lags of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices, the U.S. leading index and the Texas Leading Index. The fourth model is an autoregressive distributed lag model with regression of payroll employment on lags of payroll employment, current and lagged values of U.S. GDP growth and WTI oil prices, and Texas COVID-19 hospitalizations through March 2023. Forecasts of Texas payroll employment from this model also use forecasts of U.S. GDP growth from Blue Chip Economic Indicators and WTI oil price futures as inputs. All models include four COVID-19 dummy variables (March–June 2020).",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/Images/research/forecast/employee-walk-pri.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 21:02:18.021966

Chris Carnevale

Last week, President Trump’s EPA proposed to repeal all carbon pollution limits from power plants, the latest step in the administration’s Polluter First Agenda to decimate the EPA and rules protecting Americans from polluters.

This is obviously a reckless and careless move, but according to the Trump administration’s own analysis, it will cause thousands of Americans to die, and saddle us with billions of dollars worth of costs each year for healthcare and premature deaths caused by people’s exposure to more nasty pollution.

In proposing this move, the EPA provides an analysis of costs and benefits, known as a regulatory impact analysis (RIA). A review of the RIA for the proposal to repeal the rules limiting climate pollution from power plants reveals that Americans would be harmed far more than they would benefit.

Americans Will Die Prematurely

The repeal will kill hundreds of Americans per year due to increased exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone pollution from power plant smokestacks. EPA calculated how many people in 2028, 2030, 2035, 2040, and 2045 would die prematurely from this exposure due to the environmental protections being repealed, shown below in Table 4-1 of the RIA. The table presents results from multiple calculation methods, making it a bit difficult to follow. However, one notable finding is that from 2028 to 2045 (with the exception of 2040), hundreds of premature deaths would be caused annually by repealing the environmental protections.

Americans Will Be Saddled With Billions of Dollars Per Year In Health Costs

The proposal saddles Americans with billions of dollars worth of costs each year for health care and premature deaths caused by people’s exposure to the nasty pollution that will be caused by repealing the regulations. These annual costs are shown in Table 4-3 in the RIA, displayed below. Note that 2026 and 2027 don’t show any costs because calculations weren’t made for those years.

Altogether, these health costs imposed on American households amount to $76-130 billion over the 2026-2047 period, as shown in Table 4-4.

Repealing the Rules Is a Job Killer

The repeal proposal will kill hundreds of thousands — if not millions — of job-years for construction workers in the energy sector due to the cancellation of all the clean energy projects that won’t be built. This is shown in Table 5-4 by the negative numbers indicating fewer construction-related job-years.

The loss of construction job-years is only very slightly offset by a gain in non-construction job-years (i.e., recurring operating, maintenance, and fuel extraction jobs).

Electric Bills Increase Through 2031

The potential benefit touted by backers of repealing the power plant climate pollution rules is that there will be money savings when energy companies no longer have to comply with the rules. If you ignore the massive health and mortality costs caused by repeal, the EPA analysis technically does show those savings to be there, but the fine print is important. While over a period of two decades, from 2026-2047, the RIA finds there to be $10-19 billion in compliance cost savings, it also shows that electricity costs would actually increase for consumers until 2032, as shown in Table 3-7 (highlighting added).

The Costs Outweigh The Benefits By 7-8 Times

Comparing the increased health costs imposed on Americans as a whole against energy companies’ financial savings from not having to comply with the pollution limits reveals that the costs vastly outweigh the benefits. The RIA shows that over the 20-year period of 2026-2047, the repeal’s health costs of $76-$130 billion outweigh the compliance cost benefits of $9.6-$19 billion by $67-$110 billion. In other words, the costs that the Trump administration would impose on the public by repealing the pollution rules outweigh the benefits by 7-8 times, as shown below in Table 6-2 (highlighting added).

This lopsided cost-benefit ratio actually understates how bad a value the Trump EPA’s repeal proposal is for the American public because President Trump instructed federal agencies to stop considering the value of climate benefits in analyses like this. EPA says in this RIA that due to President Trump’s “Unleashing American Energy” executive order, “the EPA did not monetize benefits associated with CO2 emissions changes.” However, before the EPA was instructed to put its head in the sand, a previous EPA analysis released last year demonstrated that the power plant climate pollution limits would provide $160-470 billion in climate benefits globally over 20 years.

Attacks on clean energy have already threatened or canceled more than 90,000 jobs, and with this proposal, 400,000 more are at risk of being destroyed. Repealing clean energy tax credits would raise electricity prices for American households by more than $110 per year next year and nearly $400 in the next decade.

Climate Power Executive Director Lori Lodes issued the following statement:

“Republican Senators on the Finance Committee are creating an energy crisis to pay for tax breaks for billionaires. Their proposal will send utility bills through the roof, ship hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs to China, and create an American energy shortage when demand is higher than ever and growing.

“Senate Republicans have gone on the record touting clean energy projects and showed up at ribbon cuttings, but now they are on the verge of destroying the jobs and investments that are helping communities in their states thrive. Republican Senators still have a chance to choose economic growth and energy dominance over the interests of their billionaire donors. If not, there is no doubt their constituents will remember.”

Clean energy is the fastest and cheapest way to meet our growing energy demand; however, today, Republican Senators on the Finance Committee proposed budget language that tries to crush wind and solar energy production while giving even more tax loopholes to oil industry billionaires.

Solar, wind, and battery storage accounted for 93% of the new American energy supply in 2024 and are expected to account for a similar amount of new generating capacity in 2025.

Solar and wind energy are being deployed about five times faster than all other energy sources combined.

Solar farms generally take 8 to 18 months to complete, and wind farms can be built in 6 to 9 months.

Competition and high costs for gas turbines, construction labor shortages, and tariffs mean that new gas-fired power plants would need at least seven years to get online.

Clean power sources generated 51 percent of all U.S. electricity supplies in March 2025, the first time clean power sources have surpassed fossil fuels.

The cost of solar and wind power has dropped so much that it is now 50% cheaper than electricity from fossil fuels.",https://milwaukeecourieronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/table-by-the-numbers-republican-senate-finance-committee-states.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 19:07:04.911863

The arrested plaintiffs claimed they received permission from landowners to protest on the land, while the pipeline company said the landowners welcomed the pipeline construction.
In 2019, a group of plaintiffs including protesters, landowners, and advocacy organizations sued Louisiana’s attorney general, the sheriff of St. Martin Parish, and the district attorney.
The district court granted summary judgment for the Louisiana officials on all of the protesters’ remaining claims, which was then appealed.
The landowners’ claims were also appropriately dismissed because they failed to state an injury-in-fact, the panel said.","Landowners and pipeline protesters in Louisiana lost their bid Friday to get the Fifth Circuit to find that a state statute unlawfully impeded their First Amendment rights.

“The statute in question is neither impermissibly vague nor violative of the First Amendment,” the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said.

Individuals protested the construction of the now-complete 162-mile Bayou Bridge Pipeline that connects an oil-and-gas hub in Texas to oil refineries in Louisiana. The protests, where people attached themselves to equipment, happened after amendments were made to Louisiana’s infrastructure trespass statute.

The arrested plaintiffs claimed they received permission from landowners to protest on the land, while the pipeline company said the landowners welcomed the pipeline construction.

In 2019, a group of plaintiffs including protesters, landowners, and advocacy organizations sued Louisiana’s attorney general, the sheriff of St. Martin Parish, and the district attorney.

They alleged the infrastructure trespass statute was facially unconstitutional for vagueness, was discriminatory, and violated the First Amendment.

The district court granted summary judgment for the Louisiana officials on all of the protesters’ remaining claims, which was then appealed.

The Fifth Circuit upheld the district court’s dismissal of the advocacy plaintiffs’ claims because they were only traceable to the attorney general, who had been dismissed from the case.

The landowners’ claims were also appropriately dismissed because they failed to state an injury-in-fact, the panel said. The landowners weren’t the ones protesting. Also, even though they claimed they allowed the protests to happen, the landowners haven’t said they plan to continue allowing such demonstrations on their property, the court said.

In terms of the protesters’ vageness claims, the district court provided a “narrowing construction” of how the statute should be construed, which limited any “indeterminacy,” the Fifth Circuit said.

The plaintiffs failed to show the statute is a content-based restriction on speech because the legislature “had a valid interest in not only preventing damage to critical infrastructure, but also, limiting trespass on those facilities,” the court said.

Judge James E. Graves Jr. wrote the opinion and was joined by Judge Cory T. Wilson.

Judge Stephen A. Higginson dissented, saying the statute is “unconstitutionally vague” because it doesn’t “give notice of what conduct is actually prohibited.”

The plaintiffs are represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights and Loyola University College of Law professor William P.

Republicans and Democrats alike are less likely to support renewable energy than they were five years ago, according to a survey released June 5 by the Pew Research Center. Floodlight examines the survey results, which mirror growing pockets of opposition to solar farms, reignited political support for coal plants and moves by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to kill federally funded clean energy projects.

This shift in opinion dates back to when Democratic President Joe Biden took office, said Brian Kennedy, Pew senior researcher and one of the study's authors. ""This isn't a new trend,"" he said.

Still, Kenneth Gillingham, professor of environmental and energy economics at the Yale School of the Environment, was surprised.

""I see this shift … as a successful effort to link climate change and renewable energy to broader culture war issues,"" Gillingham said. He added that in the past, ""prominent"" Republicans supported renewables and sought solutions to climate change, but those stances could now be seen as ""disloyal"" to Trump.

The survey of 5,085 U.S. adults taken April 28 to May 4 revealed that while 79% of Americans favored expanding wind and solar production in 2020, that number has dropped to 60%. And 39% of Americans today support expansion of oil, coal and natural gas - almost double the 20% that supported it in 2020.

Combustion of fossil fuels - in transportation, energy generation and industrial production - is the No. 1 cause of climate change.

Much of the change in opinion is driven by Republicans, whose support of oil and gas grew from 35% in 2020 to 67% today. But Democrats also indicated less support for renewable energy and more for fossil fuels than five years ago.

While many results reflect Trump's policies opposing most renewables and boosting fossil fuels, Pew found a few notable exceptions: 69% of all respondents favor offshore wind - a technology Trump has specifically targeted.

Both Democrats and Republicans indicated stronger support for nuclear power, with Republicans' favorable opinions increasing from 53% in 2020 to 69% in 2025. Democrats' support rose from 37% to 52%. The Trump administration has signaled support for a nuclear renaissance, despite its high cost.

There were wide partisan splits on several topics. In March, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it would scale back environmental regulations. Pew asked whether it was possible to do that and still protect air and water quality: 77% of Republicans said yes and 67% of Democrats said no.

Pew didn't ask the respondents why their attitudes have shifted. But Kennedy said in Pew's past surveys, Republicans have expressed concern about the economic impacts of climate change policies and transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.

Mike Murphy, a Republican consultant and electric vehicle backer, said when the environmental benefits of clean technologies are touted, it polarizes Republicans. Instead, Murphy said messages should be about pocketbook issues - like lower fuel costs - and jobs.

""It's hard for pro-climate people to understand,"" said Murphy, who has advised dozens of state and national GOP campaigns including John McCain's 2008 presidential bid. ""(They think) we just need to shout louder and hit people over the head about climate, climate, climate. The key is you want to talk about jobs and national security and other events that naturally resonate a lot more with right-of-center people.""

That's what Murphy's groups, the EV Politics Project and the American EV Jobs Alliance, are trying to do to depoliticize electric vehicles. ""Whenever electric cars are seen through a climate lens,"" Murphy said, ""their appeal narrows.""

It's a strategy also being used by the Electrification Coalition, a left-of-center pro-EV group. Ben Prochazka, the coalition's executive director, echoed Murphy's strategy, adding that EVs have ""become overly politicized and caught in the culture wars, impacting markets and ultimately hurting our ability to realize their many benefits for all Americans.""

Prochazka noted that once introduced to EVs, consumers support them: ""EV drivers love their vehicles, with more than eight out of ten reporting that their next car will also be electric.""

Perhaps those practical messages are getting through. In the Pew survey, electric vehicles were the one item that saw an uptick in support - 4 percentage points in the past year.

But popular support might not be enough to stop Congress from killing a $7,500 electric vehicle credit, which Murphy said would be ""policy disaster.""

Republicans, he said, are in a ""real squeeze,"" because ""they don't have enough money for the tax cuts the president has promised.""

Murphy said: ""It's easier for Republicans to cut Biden electric cars … than it is for them to cut more Medicaid.""

Gillingham is still optimistic that solar, wind and other greenhouse gas-reducing technologies will move forward - because they are the cheapest.

""The continued decline in the price of renewable energy and battery technologies, as well as other new technologies, is a reason to continue to have hope that the worst impacts of climate change can be addressed,"" he said.

In one case, the justices said fuel producers can challenge the EPA’s approval of California’s electric vehicle mandate. In the other, the justices said retailers that sell tobacco products can challenge the FDA’s denial of a new tobacco product.

Opponents had argued that the businesses weren’t the targets of the government decisions and were too far down the chain of effects to qualify as injured parties, so they shouldn’t be allowed to challenge the agency’s actions.

The justices disagreed in two 7-2 rulings.

Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, writing the majority opinion in the EPA case, said those affected by agency action should have a day in court.

“The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,” he wrote.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing for the court in the FDA ruling, said retailers that sell tobacco products qualify as “adversely affected” for purposes of challenging action.

That case involved the FDA’s decision not to approve R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co.’s menthol and mixed-berry flavored e-cigarettes. The FDA argued the retailer couldn’t challenge that rejection.

The EPA ruling centered on California’s unique status under the Clean Air Act to adopt its own strict standards for certain vehicle emissions. Other states can then choose to follow that standard or stick with the federal standard.

California must first win approval from the EPA for each change.

It sought permission for stricter emissions for vehicles sold in the state.

President George W. Bush’s administration rejected it, the Obama administration approved it, the first Trump administration revoked it and the Biden administration restored it.

Mr. Trump has ordered another review.

Meanwhile, fuel manufacturers rushed in to sue, arguing the EPA lacked the power to approve the state’s plans because its goal was to try to affect global air quality, not just California’s air.

Lower courts ruled the fuel market was too complicated for the manufacturers to show they were particularly injured by California’s changes, but Justice Kavanaugh, writing for the court, said it was “predictable” that the state’s actions would affect the market and that was good enough.

In 2022, Congress passed a grant funding hydrogen hubs and tax credits to compensate companies that produce the fuel.
The new hydrogen hubs plan to produce two types of clean hydrogen: blue and green.
How do hydrogen tax credits work?
Even if the senators change their minds about hydrogen, the 45V tax credit faces a steep challenge in the House.","Seven regional partnerships that want to produce hydrogen fuel are urging the U.S. Senate to preserve hydrogen tax credits. In a letter sent Thursday, June 19, to Senate leadership, the hydrogen hubs asked lawmakers to keep incentives active for hydrogen projects beginning construction through 2029.

The hubs include research institutions and companies from oil and gas, renewable energy and electric utility industries. Spanning from California to New Jersey, the hubs are the largest effort thus far to advance hydrogen fuel.

The letter follows a proposal released by the Senate Finance Committee that could trigger sweeping changes to which energy technologies are favored by tax policy. To trim government spending to help pay for President Donald Trump’s priority of extending the 2017 tax cuts, the Senate committee wants to eliminate new tax credits for hydrogen at the end of 2025.

“Hydrogen is a powerful tool to secure our energy independence and strengthen America’s energy future,” the letter said. “Allowing (hydrogen tax credits) to lapse prematurely would put at risk these projects, the hundreds of thousands of jobs they will create, and approximately $140 billion in economic benefits they forecast.”

The letter went on to say that eliminating hydrogen tax credits could “risk ceding leadership in hydrogen technology and supply chains to foreign competitors at a time when the U.S. should be asserting global leadership.”

Hydrogen was a key part of the Biden administration’s push to lower carbon dioxide emissions in its fight against climate change. Experts often compare hydrogen to a Swiss Army knife because it offers a zero-emission fuel option for heavy-duty vehicles, airplanes, ships, and industrial processes. Hydrogen can also be stored for long periods of time and could be used to provide baseload power to the grid. However, scaling up clean hydrogen production is expensive. In 2022, Congress passed a grant funding hydrogen hubs and tax credits to compensate companies that produce the fuel.

How do producers make clean hydrogen?

Hydrogen production is not new. People have used hydrogen as a fuel for centuries, and today it remains a key ingredient in ammonia production, which supports the manufacturing of cleaning products and fertilizers. The new hydrogen hubs plan to produce two types of clean hydrogen: blue and green.

Producers derive blue hydrogen from natural gas. The gas goes through steam methane reforming, a chemical reaction under high heat that eventually produces hydrogen and carbon dioxide. To qualify as a clean fuel, blue hydrogen producers want to use carbon capture technology, such as pumping the carbon dioxide through pipelines into underground wells.

They generate green hydrogen through electrolysis, using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. To qualify as a clean fuel, the electrolysis process must use renewable energy sources.

How do hydrogen tax credits work?

The original tax credit, known as 45V, was part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The 45V credit allows companies producing clean hydrogen to receive 60 cents to $3 per kilogram of clean hydrogen produced, depending on how many carbon emissions the company cuts out of the production process.

“The government’s contribution is basically a success payment,” Frank Wolak, president and CEO of the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association, said in an interview with Straight Arrow News.

Companies take on the risk of building new production facilities, and they only receive government funding once they have created something of value.

As long as clean hydrogen projects begin construction ahead of the 45V expiration date, they are eligible to receive compensation from the U.S. Department of the Treasury for fuel produced in the following 10 years. In 2022, Congress set the 45V tax credit expiration in 2033, giving the industry almost a decade to get projects off the ground.

However, both the Senate proposal and the bill passed in the House of Representatives earlier this year would push up the 45V eligibility deadline to the end of 2025.

Wolak said the next six months are not enough time for hydrogen companies to complete the steps of engineering, permitting, financing and securing supply chains required to break ground on new projects. He added that the Treasury Department did not finalize the rules for 45V until the beginning of 2024, causing many projects that were underway to stall.

Who is for and against hydrogen?

Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo — Republicans named in the hydrogen hubs’ letter — did not respond to requests for comment as of press time.

Even if the senators change their minds about hydrogen, the 45V tax credit faces a steep challenge in the House. In May, 38 Republican members endorsed a full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act, which they said would save taxpayers $1 trillion over 10 years.

While hydrogen appears to be a lower priority than wind and solar, the statement signed by the 38 members said, “keeping even one of these subsidies opens the door to retaining all eight.”

Those Republicans are at odds with the oil and gas industry. Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell all participate in hydrogen hub projects, while the American Petroleum Institute and American Gas Institute have signed a separate letter urging the Senate to keep hydrogen tax credits. Some environmental groups, on the other hand, have criticized hydrogen hubs for relying on natural gas as feedstock and potential safety concerns for local communities.

Wolak emphasized that the hydrogen industry is subsidized in other countries that recognize its potential as a fuel, and said keeping 45V is “an absolutely essential part” of ensuring the U.S. remains competitive.

U.S. Supreme Court

US can't target fossil fuel producers through regulations, then argue they don't have standing, SCOTUS says

Fossil fuel companies have standing to sue the Environmental Protection Agency for approving California’s requirement for the production of more electric vehicles, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Friday in a 7-2 decision.

The Supreme Court said the fossil fuel companies have Article III standing because they will make less money as a result of California’s regulations, an issue that can be redressed if the regulations are invalidated.

“The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,” wrote Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the majority opinion.

The Clean Air Act sets nationwide emissions standards for new vehicles. But the law allows California, in limited circumstances, to set more stringent standards for in-state vehicle sales to fight local problems such as smog. Other states may adopt California’s standards, but they can’t set their own.

California regulations limit average greenhouse gas emissions for new vehicles sold in the state and require automakers to manufacture a certain percentage of electric vehicles as part of their fleets.

Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have implemented part of or all of California’s regulations.

California had intervened in the case. The EPA and the state argued that the fuel producers hadn’t established that their economic injury could be redressed by a court win because of strong consumer demand for electric vehicles.

The Supreme Court disagreed.

“Even ‘one dollar’ of additional revenue for the fuel producers would satisfy the redressability component of Article III standing,” Kavanaugh said. “In all events, record evidence confirms what common sense tells us: Invalidating the regulations likely (not certainly but likely) would make a difference for fuel producers because automakers would likely manufacture more vehicles that run on gasoline and other liquid fuels.”

The George W. Bush administration denied California’s first request for electric vehicle regulations, reasoning that the state was trying to fight global climate change, rather than local problems.

“Since then, as presidential administrations have come and gone,” Kavanaugh wrote, the “EPA has repeatedly altered its legal position on whether the Clean Air Act authorizes California regulations targeting greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles.”

President Donald Trump has directed the EPA to reconsider its approval of California’s regulations.

The Supreme Court returned the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to consider the merits of the producers’ claims.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.

The case is Diamond Alternative Energy v. Environmental Protection Agency.

Circuit judges Cornelia Pillard, Gregory Katsas and Michelle Childs — did not vacate the new standards, merely requiring the agencies to provide further explanation for their reasoning.
“EPA has failed to justify its climate conclusions regarding the [greenhouse gas] emission reductions attributable to the Set Rule,” the panel wrote.
“FWS simply ignored what were, in the EPA’s view, the ‘best estimates regarding the geographical effects of the RFS program.
“For decades, the EPA has incentivized growing corn and soybeans for fuel, ignoring or discounting this program’s harms to wildlife.","WASHINGTON (CN) — A D.C. Circuit panel ruled Friday that the Environmental Protection Agency must review its Renewable Fuel Standards for 2023-2025, siding with a coalition of conservation groups who argued the agency failed to consider potential impacts on the environment and endangered species.

In a per curiam decision, the three-judge panel ruled 2-1 that the EPA and the Fish and Wildlife Service’s conclusion that the new standards — which require an ever-increasing amount of renewable fuel to be introduced to the U.S. transportation fuel supply — would have “no effect” on endangered species was unlawful.

However, the panel — made up of U.S. Circuit judges Cornelia Pillard, Gregory Katsas and Michelle Childs — did not vacate the new standards, merely requiring the agencies to provide further explanation for their reasoning.

The 2023-2025 standards were the first in which the EPA could set biofuel targets at any level it deemed appropriate, mandating that 15 billion gallons of conventional corn ethanol for each year, plus 5.9 billion gallons of advanced biofuels in 2023, 6.5 billion gallons in 2024 and 7.3 billion gallons in 2025. The Center for Biological Diversity argued the standards were too high.

The court noted that, in its environmental analysis of potential greenhouse gas emissions from the new standards, known as the Set Rule, the EPA relied on certain scientific studies that significantly underestimated the pollution caused by crop-based renewable fuels while using higher estimates for every other fuel category.

In one example, a study the EPA used had determined corn-based ethanol would emit 38 grams of carbon dioxide per megajoule of energy generated, while similar studies set the figure between 84 and 98 grams. The panel found several such instances that, when the EPA reviewed corn ethanol and soybean oil-based biodiesel emissions, it turned to lower-end estimates from a 2010 study.

“EPA has failed to justify its climate conclusions regarding the [greenhouse gas] emission reductions attributable to the Set Rule,” the panel wrote. “EPA’s unexplained decision to generally rely on those published estimates for every other fuel category and to disregard them for crop-based renewable fuels in favor of ranges derived from its dated 2010 study was arbitrary and capricious.”

Further, the panel found that the Fish and Wildlife Service had wrongfully dismissed conservation concerns regarding an EPA list of locations that would likely be converted to cropland to grow corn and canola to meet the standards as inadequate to determine any environmental impact.

“FWS simply dismissed their results as uncertain. But certainty is not required,” the panel wrote. “FWS simply ignored what were, in the EPA’s view, the ‘best estimates regarding the geographical effects of the RFS program. Because FWS failed to engage with the results of those models or, ion the alternative, identify why they did not constitute the best available science and data, it ‘entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem.’”

In an emailed statement, Maggie Coulter of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law institute lauded the appellate court’s decision and slammed the Fish and Wildlife Service’s environmental analysis as “shoddy.”

“This is a big win for people and wildlife over the misguided, damaging renewable fuel standard,” Coulter said. “For decades, the EPA has incentivized growing corn and soybeans for fuel, ignoring or discounting this program’s harms to wildlife. Those harms include the loss of native wetland and grassland habitats, increased water pollution from pesticide runoff and a worsening of the hypoxic ‘dead zone’ conditions in the Gulf of Mexico.”

Katsas, a Donald Trump appointee, did not join his colleagues, a Barack Obama and Joe Biden appointee, respectively, noting in his partial dissent that he would vacate the standards because the EPA had failed to explain how the program’s costs are justified.

He compared the EPA’s actions to a law clerk planning on a restaurant for a hypothetical celebratory chambers dinner, where Katsas sets three considerations: quality of food, cost and proximity to the Washington courthouse. Based solely on food ratings, the clerk chooses the Inn at Little Washington, which would cost $300 per person and is 1.5 hours away.

“Without addressing whether this expansive and distant meal is worth it, and without assessing the quality, cost, or travel time for dinner at any other restaurant, the clerk announces that he has considered all the relevant factors and then books a reservation at the Inn,” Katsas wrote. “Would anyone think that the clerk has fairly understood my instructions and reasonably explained his choice? Obviously not.”

In 2024, state Sen. Celina Villanueva, D-Chicago, proposed a bill to ban natural gas in new buildings. A Chicago alderman, Maria Hadden, introduced similar legislation backed by Mayor Brandon Johnson around the same time.

Marc Brown, vice president of state affairs for the Consumer Energy Alliance, said forced electrification would cost $55,000 for the average single-family home.

“That includes when you’re redoing your panel, heat pumps, changing out a gas furnace, all your appliances,” Brown told The Center Square.

Citing data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the CEA said forced electrification could increase Illinois utility bills by $7.6 billion statewide or about $2,631 per household.

“When it comes to electric heating, it’s a little bit more expensive than gas, so that drives up energy bills,” Brown added.

Brown said the move to ban natural gas is ideological, but most people do not support it.

“They don’t want to be told what to do. I think it just comes from the fringe when it comes to these draconian mandates,” Brown said.

Brown said costs would rise even more if proposed bans were expanded to include the manufacturing and agricultural sectors.

According to the CEA, Illinois manufacturers consume over 25% of the state's natural gas. The state's agricultural community relies on natural gas for crop drying.

Brown said other issues include rising electricity demand and warnings about grid reliability.

“Adding this layer of increased electricity load on top of that, we’re seeing a little too much for the electricity grid,” Brown said.

According to regional grid operator PJM, energy is getting more expensive.

""The reason is very simple: Supply is decreasing on the system and demand is increasing. This is happening not just in PJM but all over the country,"" PJM told The Center Square in a statement last month.

PJM said the decreased supply is primarily due to state and federal decarbonization policies and some economics, including the proliferation of data centers and the advancement of artificial intelligence.

Brown said gas industry improvements have fueled decreasing energy-related carbon emissions in the U.S. while other countries experienced increases.

“Natural gas is very clean. Companies have drastically reduced methane leakage on the distribution pipeline system like 80-90% over the past 20-30 years,” Brown said.

The Environmental Defense Fund and Sierra Club Illinois chapter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The CEA said banning or restricting natural gas could deepen energy poverty and compromise grid reliability.

“Instead of eliminating energy choice, Illinois should embrace a diverse and balanced approach to powering Illinois’ families, farmers and businesses,” the report concluded.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/fwbusiness.com/content/tncms/custom/image/e47550d8-b866-11ed-a481-ffd95f72d957.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-06-20 18:11:28.216282

According to the CEA, Illinois manufacturers consume over 25% of the state's natural gas. The state's agricultural community relies on natural gas for crop drying.

Brown said other issues include rising electricity demand and warnings about grid reliability.

“Adding this layer of increased electricity load on top of that, we’re seeing a little too much for the electricity grid,” Brown said.

According to regional grid operator PJM, energy is getting more expensive.

""The reason is very simple: Supply is decreasing on the system and demand is increasing. This is happening not just in PJM but all over the country,"" PJM told The Center Square in a statement last month.

PJM said the decreased supply is primarily due to state and federal decarbonization policies and some economics, including the proliferation of data centers and the advancement of artificial intelligence.

Brown said gas industry improvements have fueled decreasing energy-related carbon emissions in the U.S. while other countries experienced increases.

“Natural gas is very clean. Companies have drastically reduced methane leakage on the distribution pipeline system like 80-90% over the past 20-30 years,” Brown said.

The Environmental Defense Fund and Sierra Club Illinois chapter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The CEA said banning or restricting natural gas could deepen energy poverty and compromise grid reliability.

Syllabus

DIAMOND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY, LLC, et al. v. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit

No. 24–7. Argued April 23, 2025—Decided June 20, 2025

Under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved California regulations that require automakers to manufacture more electric vehicles and fewer gasoline-powered vehicles with a goal of decreasing emissions from liquid fuels. The regulations require automakers to limit average greenhouse-gas emissions across their vehicle fleets and manufacture a certain percentage of electric vehicles. Several producers of fuels such as gasoline and ethanol sued EPA in the D. C. Circuit, arguing that EPA lacked authority to approve the California regulations because they target global climate change rather than local California air quality problems as required by the Clean Air Act. They submitted standing declarations explaining that California’s regulations depress demand for liquid fuel by requiring vehicles that use less or no liquid fuel, causing the fuel producers monetary injury. California’s own estimates indicated the regulations would cause substantial reductions in demand for gasoline exceeding $1 billion beginning in 2020 and increasing to over $10 billion in 2030.

EPA did not challenge the fuel producers’ standing in the D. C. Circuit. California, as well as other States adopting California’s regulations, intervened to defend EPA’s approval. California argued that the fuel producers lacked standing because automobile manufacturers would not change course if EPA’s decision were vacated given the “surging consumer demand” for electric vehicles. The D. C. Circuit held that the fuel producers lacked Article III standing, finding they failed to establish that automakers would likely respond to invalidation of the regulations by producing fewer electric vehicles and more gasoline-powered vehicles.

Held: The fuel producers have Article III standing to challenge EPA’s approval of the California regulations. Pp. 7–22.

(a) Article III limits federal court jurisdiction to “Cases” and “Controversies,” requiring plaintiffs to demonstrate standing by showing three elements: injury in fact, causation, and redressability. Injury in fact requires a “ ‘concrete,’ ” “particularized” injury that is “actual or imminent.” FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U. S. 367, 381. Causation requires showing “the injury was likely caused by the defendant.” TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U. S. 413, 423. Redressability requires demonstrating that judicial relief would likely redress the injury. Ibid. When a plaintiff is not the direct object of government regulation, causation and redressability often depend on how third parties not before the court will predictably respond to the regulation or judicial relief. Pp. 7–10.

(b) The fuel producers’ injury in fact and causation are straightforward and undisputed. The fuel producers make money by selling fuel, so decreased purchases of gasoline and other liquid fuels resulting from California’s regulations constitute monetary injury. EPA’s approval authorized California and 17 other States to enforce regulations requiring lower emissions and vehicle electrification, thereby reducing liquid fuel purchases. The regulations likely cause the fuel producers’ monetary injuries because reducing gasoline and diesel fuel consumption is the whole point of the regulations.

The fuel producers also satisfy redressability. Even minimal additional revenue would satisfy this requirement, and invalidating the regulations would likely result in more revenue from additional fuel sales based on commonsense economic principles and record evidence. Pp. 11–22.

(1) The fuel producers might be considered direct objects of the California regulations because the regulations explicitly seek to restrict gasoline and other liquid fuel use in automobiles. When the government prohibits or impedes one company from using another company’s product or service, both companies might be deemed objects of the regulation. See, e.g., Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510, 535–536; Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. United States, 316 U. S. 407, 422. The Court need not resolve this question because the record evidence in this case establishes the fuel producers’ standing in any event. Pp. 12–13.

(2) This case presents the “familiar” circumstance where government regulation of one business “may be likely” to cause injuries to other linked businesses. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U. S., at 384. California’s regulations force automakers to manufacture more electric vehicles and fewer gasoline-powered vehicles, likely causing downstream economic injuries to fuel producers. Invalidating these regulations would likely mean more gasoline-powered automobiles and more fuel sales.

EPA and California argue this case is unusual because the vehicle market has developed such that automakers would not manufacture more gasoline-powered cars even if regulations were invalidated. This argument is undermined by their own actions—if invalidating the regulations would change nothing, why are they enforcing and defending them? The whole point of the regulations is to increase electric vehicles beyond what consumers would otherwise demand and manufacturers would otherwise produce.

Record evidence confirms that invalidating the regulations would likely redress the fuel producers’ monetary injury. First, the fuel producers’ declarations quote California’s own estimates of substantial reductions in gasoline demand and note California’s recognition that fuel providers would be “most adversely affected.” App. 137. Second, California stated in 2021 that the regulations are “critical” for future emissions reductions and submitted expert declarations in 2022 stating that without the regulations, fewer electric vehicles would be sold and more gasoline-fueled vehicles would be sold. Id., at 66, 115. Third, EPA affirmed that California “needs” its standards and credited California’s estimates that the regulations would continue reducing emissions through at least 2037. 87 Fed. Reg. 14334; 89 Fed. Reg. 82558. Fourth, five automakers who invested heavily in electric vehicles intervened to defend the regulations and predicted that without California’s regulations, other automakers would seek a competitive advantage by selling fewer electric vehicles and more gasoline-powered vehicles. Pp. 13–18.

(3) EPA and California argue the fuel producers needed more evidence, such as affidavits from expert economists or directly regulated automakers. This Court has not demanded such evidence to show how third parties would likely respond to government regulations. Plaintiffs must simply “show a predictable chain of events” that would likely result from judicial relief. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U. S., at 385. Requiring affidavits from regulated third parties would make standing dependent on whether the plaintiff and third parties share litigation interests and whether third parties are willing to publicly oppose the government regulator. Such a heightened requirement would close the courthouse doors to many traditional challenges to agency action. Pp. 18–19.

(4) This case does not involve the rare instance where a market has likely permanently changed such that invalidating a challenged regulation would have no effect on that market. Such instances are rare for two reasons. First, governments do not usually continue enforcing and defending regulations that have no continuing effect. Second, the effect of regulations like these depend on interrelated economic forces that change over time, so courts should be wary of claims that invalidating important regulations would have zero impact on dynamic, heavily regulated markets. The evidence that some automakers are in compliance with California’s mandates suggests regulatory effect, not absence of effect, and does not demonstrate how all automakers would respond to invalidation. Pp. 19–22.

Biofuels

US Senate Bill Would Shrink Tax Credit for Biofuels Made from Foreign Feedstocks

U.S. Senate Republicans on June 16 proposed a tax bill that would extend a clean fuel tax credit through 2031, but trim 20% of the value of the credit for biofuels made from feedstocks produced outside of the U.S.

The tax credit, established by former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act but not finalized during his tenure, could prove lucrative for oil and biofuel producers who can demonstrate lower carbon intensity of their fuels.

The House tax and spending bill passed in May also extends the tax credit, known as 45Z, through 2031, but bans most foreign feedstocks from being eligible for credits.

Both the House and Senate bills would exclude emissions generated from the expansion of agricultural land due to the growth of feedstocks like corn and soy, called indirect land use change, from the calculation of a biofuel's credit value.

That change would make it easier for corn-based ethanol to qualify for the credits.

But the requirement to calculate those indirect emissions was a key environmental guard rail of the original tax credit, said Sarah Lutz, senior climate campaigner at environmental group Friends of the Earth.

“This reckless proposal means dirtier fuel and higher food prices,” Lutz said.

Both bills also make transportation fuels derived from farm animal manure eligible for the tax credit, a boost to biogas producers who argue that capturing methane from manure and other waste can help cut transportation emissions.

Ormat Closes $88MM Acquisition of Blue Mountain Geothermal Power Plant

Geothermal energy producer Ormat Technologies on June 18 said it has completed the previously announced acquisition of the Blue Mountain geothermal power plant in an $88 million deal with Cyrq Energy.

Located in Nevada, the 20-MW geothermal plant will increase Ormat’s electricity segment generating portfolio to nearly 1.3 gigawatts (GW).

“This acquisition not only immediately increases our generating capacity but also provides the potential for a significant upside in revenue generation through our planned upgrades and the potential addition of a solar facility,” Ormat Technologies Doron Blachar said in a news release.”

The company said it plans to increase capacity at Blue Mountain by approximately 3.5 MW and add a 13-MW solar facility to support the power plant's auxiliaries, if it secures a permit and approval of a renewed power purchase agreement (PPA). Currently, Blue Mountain delivers power to NV Energy as part of a PPA that is set to expire at the end of 2029, according to the release.

The transaction was funded through bank debt, the company said.

Hydrogen

Cadiz, Hoku Partner to Develop H2, Solar Project in California

Cadiz Inc., a California-based water solutions company, has partnered with U.K.-based Hoku Energy Ltd. to develop a clean energy campus at Cadiz Ranch in California’s Mojave Desert, according to a news release June 20.

As part of a memorandum of understanding, Hoku has a three-year exclusion option to develop a project that could include green hydrogen production facilities, renewable and low carbon power generation, battery storage facilities and integrated digital infrastructure such as data centers, the release states. The project would be on more than 10,000 acres at Cadiz Ranch.

“This agreement with Hoku Energy is the capstone of our long-term land use strategy,” said Susan Kennedy, chair of Cadiz Inc. “Hoku Energy’s vision aligns with our mission to support sustainable, scaled development of critical energy and water infrastructure in California and the Southwest.”

The company added that the agreement with Hoku does not restrict existing and planned commercial development at Cadiz. Additional developments at the site include agricultural operations, the Mojave Groundwater Bank and a green hydrogen production facility in partnership with RIC Energy.

About 400 acres have also been set aside for more commercial development that could include a data center. If a data center is developed, Hoku will have a right of first refusal to supply power to that facility, according to the news release.

“Together, the RIC and Hoku projects are expected to position Cadiz Ranch as one of the largest clean energy campuses and green hydrogen production hubs in North America.” Cadiz said.

Plan to Convert Frac Water into Hydrogen Could Bring $5MM/Year

A group of collaborators are working to convert frac wastewater into clean hydrogen in an initiative that could lead to hydrogen sales of up to $5 million annually, according to a June 18 press release.

HNO International has tapped Q3 Power and Enapter to join its efforts into creating a clean hydrogen product from produced water. An unnamed oil and gas operator will supply the contaminated frac water.

Q3 will vaporize and condense the wastewater using its proprietary thermal technology to create distilled water. Enapter will convert the distilled water into green hydrogen using electricity with its AEM modular electrolyzers. HNO will manage the hydrogen production process’ logistics and the delivery of the product.

Plans for the initial site include a production capacity of up to 1,500 kg of hydrogen per day.

The solution creates an opportunity to dispose of frac water in an environmentally friendly way.

Traditionally, produced water is disposed of through deep injection wells. But related seismicity and groundwater pollution issues are causing operators to look for other solutions.

""From pollution to power—that’s the story we're telling,"" said Don Owens, chairman and CEO of HNO International. ""We're taking water that traditionally can't be reused, recycled or safely disposed of, and turning it into hydrogen, a clean, zero-emission fuel. It's the kind of environmental turnaround the world needs more of.""

Nucera to Acquire Technology Assets from Green Hydrogen Systems

Electrolyzer manufacturer Thyssenkrupp Nucera plans to expand its technology portfolio with the acquisition of assets from Green Hydrogen Systems, which is filing for bankruptcy.

Denmark-based Green Hydrogen Systems on June 19 said it planned to file for bankruptcy in Probate Court in Kolding as soon as possible after failing to reach a solution within the framework of the restructuring process. The company agreed to a conditional partial business transfer agreement with Thyssenkrupp Nucera if approved by the court following the bankruptcy decree and secured creditors, according to a news release.

Green Hydrogen System’s high-pressure electrolysis technology reduces or eliminates the need for external compression, making it suitable for applications such as pipeline injection and mobility infrastructure, according to Thyssenkrupp Nucera. The company said the technology will accelerate its R&D into next-generation alkaline water electrolysis.

“With this acquisition, we are reinforcing our commitment to driving the green energy transition and deepening our technology leadership in hydrogen,” said Thyssenkrupp Nucera CEO Werner Ponikwar. “The high-pressure electrolysis technology developed by Green Hydrogen Systems operates with high efficiency at up to 35 bar—a key advantage for industrial applications where hydrogen is typically required in compressed form.”

The asset deal includes intellectual property as well as a test facility with a full-size prototype in Skive, Denmark, Thyssenkrupp Nucera said in a separate news release. “The purchase price will be settled entirely from available liquid funds; the specific amount has been kept confidential by mutual agreement,” the company said.

The transaction is expected to close in late summer 2025.

DNV Lands Gig for AMEA Power’s Solar, Storage Project in Egypt

DNV on June 20 said it was selected as owner’s engineer for the 1-GW Abydos for Renewable Energy solar and energy storage project being developed by AMEA Power in Egypt.

The assurance provider’s duties as owner’s engineer include supporting the Abydos 2 project from feasibility and design review through to construction supervision and commissioning oversight. Abydos is considered a flagship project for AMEA Power.

Located in Benban, Egypt, the project is expected to supply about 3,100 GW hours of clean energy to more than 500,000 Egyptian homes, DNV said in a news release. It includes a 600-megawatt hour battery energy storage system.

“Projects of this scale demand both technical rigor and regional insight,” said Santiago Blanco, executive vice president and regional director for the Middle East at DNV. “Our role is to safeguard performance and reliability from day one, helping AMEA Power deliver an asset that is robust, future-ready, and aligned with Egypt’s long-term energy goals.”

The project’s desert location is expected to present challenges such as addressing extreme temperatures and dust accumulation as well as complex grid integration requirements, according to the release.

TotalEnergies Wins Offshore Wind Concession in North Sea

TotalEnergies on June 17 said it was awarded the N-9.4 offshore concession by Germany’s Federal Network Agency.

Spanning approximately 141 sq km in the North Sea, the concession could enable development of 1 GW of offshore wind capacity, the company said in a news release. The TotalEnergies win, as a shareholder of North Sea OFW One GmbH, grants the company with offshore wind development rights for 25 years with an option to extend to 35 years.

“As part of this award, Offshore Wind One GmbH will pay €18 million [US$24.25 million] to the German federal government in 2026, which will be allocated to marine conservation and the promotion of environmentally friendly fishing practices,” TotalEnergies said. “In addition, an annual contribution of €8.1 million [US$10.9 million] will be paid for 20 years to the electricity transmission system operator responsible for connecting the project, starting from the commissioning of the site.”

Britain Awards Floating Offshore Wind Leases to Equinor, Gwynt Glas

Equinor and Gwynt Glas have won seabed leases to build floating wind farms in the Celtic Sea off the coast of Wales and Southwest England, the Crown Estate said June 19.

The Crown Estate, which acts as manager of the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said Equinor and Gwynt Glas had won leases giving them the rights each to build 1.5-GW projects. Gwynt Glas is a joint venture between EDF Renewables UK and Irish energy company ESB.

Britain, which is aiming to largely decarbonize its electricity sector by 2030 to cut its reliance on fossil fuels, is seeking to increase offshore wind capacity to 43 GW to 50 GW by the end of the decade, from around 16 GW.

“Floating offshore wind will be transformative for economic growth in Wales and the South West, unlocking thousands of jobs in places like Port Talbot and Bristol, bolstering our energy security and delivering industrial renewal,” Britain’s Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said.

The companies will pay 350 pounds (US$468.55) per megawatt per year for the leases for a ten-year option period, meaning both groups will pay 525,000 pounds (~US$707,185) per year for the sites, excluding VAT.

Audi is however trimming its model range and it has no plans to replace the A1 and Q2 models.
As for powertrain options, Audi claims that it wants to take a flexible approach moving forward — presumably meaning it’ll offer a mix of combustion vehicles, hybrids, plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles.
The European Union likewise has rules in place that will effectively ban the sale of gasoline-driven combustion vehicles in 2035.
That means Audi won’t be abandoning EV development, even as it continues with combustion cars for other markets.","Despite previous assurances that Audi would only develop electrified models after 2026, and pivot exclusively to selling all-electric vehicles by 2033, the company has abandoned those deadlines so it can continue building combustion models.

Considering how many manufacturers have already taken this approach after EV sales failed to manifest at the desired pace, Audi’s decision is hardly a bombshell. But it leaves a few lingering questions, most of which pertain to development. With automakers having spent the last decade vowing to focus entirely on electrified models, spending billions of dollars in the process, one wonders just how much attention has been paid to upcoming combustion models.

Audi CEO Gernot Döllne recently told Autocar that the electrification timeline was determined by the brand’s former management. But he has been heading the company since 2023, when the company was still publicly suggesting that the deadlines were feasible. That said, Audi did start dropping serious hints that it would keep building combustion engines in 2024 — likely indicating that the change in management came with a change in priorities.

That’s not to absolve Audi’s board or the top brass at Volkswagen Group, who went along with the electrification scheme. CEOs can — and often do — become convenient scape goats when plans go awry. However, Döllne does seem to have different priorities than his predecessors.

“Audi is launching from 2024-2026 a completely new line-up of internal combustion engine and plug-in hybrid vehicles, and that gives us complete flexibility for at least another seven, eight, maybe 10 years, and then we will see how our markets develop,” he explained to Autocar.

“We have already decided to extend the production beyond the communicated end dates of the past.”

From Autocar:

Döllner also confirmed Audi would lead development of all Volkswagen Group hardware and software architectures for larger models in the future (essentially anything from an A5-sized vehicle and up), including the next-generation SSP platform that would see the Group move to ‘software-defined vehicles’ for the first time. This project involves Rivian, whom the VW Group has invested in, and the first Audis on the SSP platform would hit the market in late 2027/2028.

Audi is however trimming its model range and it has no plans to replace the A1 and Q2 models. The Q3 and A3 models would represent the entry point of the range, with the A8 the range-topper on the “low car” side and the Q7 and Q8, and a mooted Q9, where the range would end on the SUVs and crossovers.

An all-electric A3-sized model was in development for 2026 as an additional model in the range, Döllner confirmed, but there were no plans for Audi to create its own version of the Volkswagen ID 2/Skoda Epiq/Cupra Raval entry-level electric car.

“Software-defined vehicles” may be the next item on the industry’s chopping block now that EV plans are being walked back. While automakers view the pivot to software as incredibly lucrative, Western consumers are signaling fatigue toward screen-reliant infotainment and touch controls.

Safety testing has likewise indicated that screens are distracting and less intuitive than traditional buttons. Meanwhile, there are growing concerns that software-defined vehicles are further complicating repairs and providing manufacturers with unprecedented access to what are supposed to be privately-owned automobiles.

That’s speculative, of course. It will also probably be several years before there is sufficient consumer pushback to make a meaningful difference. In the interim, companies like Audi will attempt to leverage even more over-the-air updates to digitally customize vehicles and connectivity to harvest user data.

As for powertrain options, Audi claims that it wants to take a flexible approach moving forward — presumably meaning it’ll offer a mix of combustion vehicles, hybrids, plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles. But the lineup will be undoubtedly vary between regions.

In Europe, Audi EVs have a much higher take rate than they do in North America. The European Union likewise has rules in place that will effectively ban the sale of gasoline-driven combustion vehicles in 2035. Whether or not that timeline is realistic is debatable. However, the pressure to push electrics in Europe remains strong and somewhat at odds with what’s been happening in the United States. That means Audi won’t be abandoning EV development, even as it continues with combustion cars for other markets.

“The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the majority opinion.

The Environmental Defense Fund did not see the ruling as a setback.

“The case did not address California’s longstanding Clean Air Act Authority or the merits of the state’s Advanced Clean Car I standards, which are unaltered by the Court’s decision and remain in full force and effect,” it said in a statement.

California’s bid to control emissions got a significant boost in recent years from the federal government. The Biden administration permitted the state tougher exceptions to national standards.

Some of those actions were overturned recently when Congress voted for, and President Donald Trump signed, legislation that invalidated the state’s bid to stop the sale of gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035. California is now challenging that law in court.

Fuel producers’ successful argument

This case that the Supreme Court decided Friday involved fuel interests, who maintained that by limiting gasoline-powered vehicles, their business would suffer.

A group of producers of gasoline and other liquid fuels sued, arguing California’s regulations reduce the manufacturing of gas-powered cars, which would cause a hit to the fuel producers’ sales.

Kavanaugh noted that the federal Environmental Protection Agency and California “suggest that the new vehicle market has developed in a way that even if the California regulations are invalidated, automakers would not likely manufacture or sell more gasoline-powered cars than they do now.”

But he said, “That is an odd argument for EPA and California to advance. After all, if invalidating the regulations would change nothing in the market, why are EPA and California enforcing and defending the regulations?”

Dissenting were Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Jackson wrote that the court’s willingness to side with the fuel interests were in sharp contrast to “the stern stance it has taken in cases concerning the rights of ordinary citizens.”

The Palisades Nuclear Power Plant is slated to be the country's first restart of a commercial nuclear reactor that ceased operations, pending U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approvals.

In a post on X, DOE in part wrote:

Today’s announcement highlights the Energy Department’s leading role in advancing President Trump’s , 'Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base,' through funding the restart of nuclear plants. DOE remains committed to fulfill this mission in order to maximize the speed and scale of nuclear capacity in the United States, ensuring American’s have access to reliable, abundant, and affordable energy.

The last disbursement was an installment of $46,709,358 made in April, which followed a made in March.

Talks of reopening the plant took place a month before the plant shut down on May 20, 2022.

On April 20, 2022, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer sent a letter to U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm expressing interest in restarting the plant and keeping it operational until 2031.

Previous coverage:

Once operational, Palisades is expected to bring in about 1,000 jobs during the facility's regularly scheduled refueling and maintenance periods every 18 months, according to DOE.

The plant is also anticipated to retain another 600 positions, many of which were filled by workers who have been at Palisades for more than two decades.

However, its reopening has caused some to voice concerns over the possible impacts it could have on the environment.

The NRC has held several meetings over the matter since the project's announcement.

Radioactive waste specialist with Beyond Nuclear, Kevin Kamps, called the plan a “catastrophic disaster"" at one of these .

Exclusive:

He believes reopening the plant will only cause cancer --among other diseases-- as well as ruin crops and taint clean drinking water.

""Farm crops are already being exposed to some level of radioactivity, the drinking water is already being exposed to some level of radioactivity,"" Kamp previously told News Channel 3. ""This is a drinking water supply for not only South Haven and other area communities here.""

Despite some environmental concerns, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has said that the reactivation of the Palisades plant is something that will help Michigan reach its ""net-zero"" goal of carbon-free electricity by 2050.

""Restarting Palisades is critical to that [the future of America’s clean energy], because not only is nuclear our single largest source of carbon-free electricity, it’s one of our single largest sources of electricity, period,"" Granholm said in March. ""By our estimates, to reach our net-zero goals by 2050, we need to triple at least our nuclear energy supply. So this, this is a big win for America, a big win for the nation.”

The State of Michigan directed $150 million in funding to support reopening the decades-old nuclear power plant within its record-breaking in June 2023.

On June 18, the Ohio EPA forwarded a Title V permit to the U.S. EPA for consideration. “If the U.S. EPA does not object to this proposed permit, the permit will be processed for issuance as a final action,” the OEPA advised in a cover letter.

Foxconn was informed May 28 that the OEPA had sent its permit for final review.

The permit calls for significant modification of a draft permit created two years ago calling for the installation of machinery related to a new painting process at the plant, including an e-coating line, an e-coating dip tank and bake oven, final repair, a primer surfacer and adhesives and sealers, according to documents filed with the OEPA.

According to OEPA documents, the new permit would incorporate “permit modifications of existing emissions units associated with the production of electric vehicles.” The Foxconn plant currently performs contract manufacturing, and the facility is described as an electric automobile stamping, assembly and finishing operation.

Should the U.S. EPA approve, the final permit would be issued 45 days after June 18, or Aug. 2.

Electric utilities, including Georgia Power, have passed all fuel costs directly to customers since the oil crisis of the 1970s.
Just as destructive but perhaps more insidious is electric utilities claiming to reduce emissions while building new methane gas power plants.
If you’re in a Hole, Stop Digging If fossil fuels and climate change are already leading to high bills, adding more fossil fuels is not a solution.","If the Georgia Public Service Commission really wanted to protect customers from high and volatile bills, in the near and long-term future, they could direct Georgia Power to reduce, not increase, its use of fossil fuels. Instead the PSC is poised to approve Georgia Power’s plan to increase its use of fossil fuels, and Georgia Power has at least three opportunities to increase bills over the next year.

Maggie Shober

Fossil fuels and climate change are increasing electric bills for Georgia Power customers. The Georgia Public Service Commission is currently considering approval of Georgia Power’s plan for the future, called an Integrated Resource Plan or IRP. That plan will not protect customers from further bill increases driven by fossil fuels and climate change; in fact, the Georgia Power plan doubles down on fossil fuels that risk high bills directly and further drive climate change, which drives high bills through extreme weather events and storms.

You may have heard recent announcements from Georgia Power and the Public Service Commission (PSC) that they have negotiated a “base rate freeze” in exchange for not having a rate case “this year.” “This year” happens to be the first time two Georgia PSC commissioners are coming before the voters in five years. Georgia Power and the PSC make this sound like customers should expect their electricity bills to stop increasing. But that’s not the full picture. Georgia Power can increase bills in three ways over the next year:

In a resource procurement docket later this year,

In a docket to cover costs to recover from storms and extreme weather, and

In a docket to recover fuel costs

Fuel Costs Drive Up Bills

Over the past few years, Georgia Power customer bills have increased significantly, with the largest single increase coming when Georgia Power had to adjust bills in reaction to high gas prices. Further increases will happen when Georgia Power adds storm costs and another fuel cost to bills.

Electric utilities, including Georgia Power, have passed all fuel costs directly to customers since the oil crisis of the 1970s. That means that if fuel prices go up, those additional costs do not impact the returns that Georgia Power shareholders receive; they only impact Georgia Power’s customer bills.

Georgia Power requests PSC approval for an update to the fuel cost portion of customer bills about every 3 years. If Georgia Power has under-recovered fuel costs to date, in other words, if Georgia Power paid more for fuel than it expected, it will ask the Commission to increase the fuel cost portion of customer bills.

Georgia Power has increased the share of its power that is generated by gas, which was its largest source of capacity in 2025. Georgia Power’s IRP proposed further increases in gas capacity, which will increase the risk of higher and higher customer bills as the price of gas fluctuates. “Natural” gas is a global commodity, and volatility in gas prices can be driven by any number of factors, as was seen when prices hit record volatility in the first quarter of 2022 and remained high that entire year in reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, among other issues.

It is basic common sense that if a system relies more on fuel-based resources, particularly resources with fuels that have volatile prices, the fuel costs that are passed on to customers will be higher and more volatile. Fuel cost is simple multiplication: the MWh generated by a fuel type multiplied by the price of fuel for that generator. Georgia Power can hedge and enter into various contracts for different fuels that can change the overall impact of the fuel cost on the margins, but the only way to reduce exposure to high and volatile bills is to reduce reliance on these fuels to supply electricity. Again, Georgia Power’s IRP proposes to do the opposite. It proposes to add 8,000-9,000 MW of new gas to meet load growth from data centers and manufacturing, while only adding 1,000 MW-4,000 of new renewable resources. This is despite the fact that renewables continue to be the least costly and are faster to deploy than gas.

“Renewable energy sources like wind and solar power are needed to meet rapidly growing energy demand in the United States amid near-term obstacles to increasing natural gas capacity,” NextEra CEO John Ketchum, June 10.

Climate Change Drives Up Bills

The second way that fossil fuels are driving up Georgians’ electricity bills is by further contributing to climate change.

The links between carbon dioxide emissions and a warming climate have been known for decades; yet, Georgia Power is proposing to continue to operate two large coal plants far into the future despite this knowledge and despite the other known pollution from coal power plants. Communities that live in the shadows of these coal plants deserve clean air and water.

Just as destructive but perhaps more insidious is electric utilities claiming to reduce emissions while building new methane gas power plants. It is true that the burning of methane, or “natural” gas, produces less carbon dioxide per MWh than coal. But it is also true that methane is leaked directly into the atmosphere throughout the process of drilling for, transporting, storing, and burning methane gas. And methane is a more potent greenhouse gas in the near term. In fact, the replacement of coal with gas to generate electricity is likely a major contributor to the fact that we are seeing worse and worse impacts of climate change every year.

I don’t need to remind anyone in the Southeast of the devastation we saw across the region, including in Georgia, from Hurricane Helene last year. That devastation led Georgia Power and other utilities to fix damage to their infrastructure to get the lights back on for their customers. This is an important role for the utility, but it can be expensive, particularly when storms are so destructive.

As part of its proposal to skip a rate case until 2028, Georgia Power proposes a separate process in the Spring of 2026 to get approval from the PSC to add a charge on customer bills for the costs associated with storms through the end of 2025. That includes a whopping $862 million as of March 31, 2025.

Going into 2025’s hurricane season with warmer-than-average ocean surface temperatures and cuts to NOAA and the weather service, that figure is expected to go up.

If you’re in a Hole, Stop Digging

If fossil fuels and climate change are already leading to high bills, adding more fossil fuels is not a solution. If you are in a hole and trying to get out, the first step is to stop digging yourself deeper into that hole.

In a new POLITICO analysis, Kelsey Tamborrino and Jessie Blaeser identified 794 imperiled wind farms, solar plants, battery storage facilities and other planned clean electricity generation projects located in overwhelmingly Republican districts.

The projects, which have not yet begun construction, could be at risk of losing two critical tax breaks if House lawmakers prevail in rolling back Democrats’ 2022 climate law. While the Senate’s competing version of President Donald Trump’s megabill would soften the tax credit assault, hundreds of those projects may still be affected if they don’t move fast enough to start construction — a tricky if not infeasible task.

How the battle unfurls could have major implications for the nation’s ability to tackle its share of climate pollution and meet an anticipated spike in power demand as more data centers and manufacturing facilities come online. Clean energy makes up the majority of new power capacity expected to be added to the nation’s electric grid during the next five years, according to a POLITICO analysis of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

“Now is not the time to be taking new generation off the grid, and especially new cheap generation off the grid,” Tom Taylor with research firm Atlas Public Policy said about clean energy.

The details are crucial

The House bill aims to fulfill Trump’s promise of rolling back what he calls former President Joe Biden’s “Green New Scam” by aggressively sunsetting the clean energy credits. It would require projects to begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage and start operating by 2028 to qualify — a tall order that could be easily thwarted by factors outside a project sponsor’s control, such as permitting or interconnection delays.

The House bill offers an exception for nuclear facilities. But EIA’s data shows only one project that could potentially be done in time to benefit — rendering the exemption largely inconsequential.

The Senate version would keep the credits intact for certain power sources, such as nuclear, geothermal, hydropower and energy storage. For wind and solar, however, it would require projects to begin construction by the end of 2025 to receive the full credit and before 2028 for a partial credit.

The slightly more relaxed approach to cutting clean energy credits could spare a minimum of 57 projects, POLITICO found, while still raising questions about the future of as many as 569 wind and solar initiatives.

Clean power advocates are warning about the consequences of both versions of the bill, including some Republican lawmakers and GOP-led lobbying groups. But House conservative hard-liners are threatening to tank the bill entirely unless the Senate version more closely mirrors the House draft. (Other sections of the Senate bill are facing additional obstacles from the chamber’s parliamentarian, but more on that below).

All in all, the megabill battle could make for a dramatic July 4 weekend on Capitol Hill if it doesn’t prove too heavy of a lift for Congress to meet Republican leaders’ aggressive deadline.

Thomas was one of several ground source heat pump manufacturers in Indiana, Oklahoma and South Dakota who wrote letters to Republican members of the Senate Finance Committee that represent their states.
Ground source heat pump manufacturing employs slightly more than 2,000 people in the U.S. as well as thousands of additional geothermal system designers, drillers and installers, said Ryan Dougherty, president of Geothermal Exchange Organization, a ground source heat pump industry group.
“We feel like the rug is getting pulled out,” Dwyer said of the proposed cut in tax credits.
However, if the tax credits aren’t maintained, Dwyer said he fears his industry will face massive layoffs, similar to when residential tax credits for ground source heat pumps expired at the end of 2016, before being reinstated in 2018.","Ground source heat pumps, a small but growing segment of the U.S. heating and cooling sector, could help slash energy demands, boost American manufacturing and stabilize the electric grid as AI-fueled power demands soar.

That is the argument that executives whose companies manufacture the devices are making to their senators after the Senate’s draft of President Donald Trump’s “One, Big Beautiful Bill,” released earlier this week, proposed canceling a key industry tax incentive.

Under existing federal policy, individuals who install geothermal heating and cooling systems—as well as solar, wind, batteries or fuel cells—earn tax credits that offset 30 percent of the project’s total costs. The incentives gradually phase out over time before ending entirely for installations that begin construction after 2034.

The draft budget reconciliation bill by the Senate Finance Committee would eliminate the residential clean energy credit far sooner, just 180 days after being enacted.

The change would be devastating for all clean energy technologies eligible for tax credits but would hit ground source heat pumps particularly hard, industry executives said.

The devices tap thermal energy from shallow wells or bores drilled several hundred feet underground, where temperatures remain constant, approximately 55 degrees, throughout the year. The earth’s steady temperature allows for highly efficient heating and cooling that pay off over time.

The systems are two to four times as efficient as air source heat pumps, the next most efficient heating and cooling technology, but because they require digging or drilling into the earth, geothermal systems cost approximately twice as much to install.

Ground source heat pumps are now used in just over 1 million U.S. homes, or about one percent of all residences, according to a recent report by the U.S. Department of Energy. If the technology were more widely deployed, it could play a significant role in reducing demands on the electric grid, especially during periods of extreme heat or extreme cold, when air source heat pumps are less efficient.

“Every 1,000 homes that install a geothermal heating and cooling system, on average, would eliminate 10 megawatts of winter peak heating load of an air source heat pump,” said John Thomas, the chief executive officer of WaterFurnace International, a ground source heat pump manufacturer that employs 350 people in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

Thomas was one of several ground source heat pump manufacturers in Indiana, Oklahoma and South Dakota who wrote letters to Republican members of the Senate Finance Committee that represent their states.

“The three things we talk about [are] domestic manufacturing, energy independence [or] energy stability and low cost for consumers who are using it,” said Derek Dwyer, chief executive officer of Enertech Global, a ground source heat pump manufacturer in South Dakota and Illinois. “This is an emerging technology that really can solve a lot of problems.”

Dwyer, whose company employs 150 people, said the existing tax credits were allowing the company to invest in and build its business.

Ground source heat pump manufacturing employs slightly more than 2,000 people in the U.S. as well as thousands of additional geothermal system designers, drillers and installers, said Ryan Dougherty, president of Geothermal Exchange Organization, a ground source heat pump industry group.

Tax incentives for larger, neighborhood-scale geothermal heating and cooling systems, the kind that utility companies have begun to build and that other community organizations are now considering, would be maintained through 2034 under the Senate Finance Committee’s draft legislation.

However, much of the industry is currently geared toward the residential market, Dougherty said.

“We feel like the rug is getting pulled out,” Dwyer said of the proposed cut in tax credits. “It’s another one of these stops and starts, which doesn’t allow industry to take hold, so that we can stand on our own in the long term.”

Dwyer and Thomas both said they’ve been in touch with their respective senators’ offices in recent days and are cautiously optimistic that the residential tax credits for geothermal will be preserved.

“Senator Young continues to have conversations with his colleagues and stakeholders about improving the House-passed bill and addressing our nation’s debt and deficit challenges,” Matt Lahr, a spokesperson for Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) said in a written response to Inside Climate News.

However, if the tax credits aren’t maintained, Dwyer said he fears his industry will face massive layoffs, similar to when residential tax credits for ground source heat pumps expired at the end of 2016, before being reinstated in 2018.

“We lost roughly half of our company due to the decline in business and lack of support,” Dwyer said, noting it took much of the past eight years to rebuild. “If it does go away, the fear is that we may see a similar impact.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1245402186-1024x681.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 18:09:42.806542

Now that it's come to ...",Allison Fisher,,,,,https://www.mediamatters.org/donald-trump/tv-news-barely-covered-trumps-big-oil-quid-pro-quo-last-year-now-its-come-fruition,"National TV networks should inform their audience about how Big Oil is benefitting under Trump.
Companies including ConocoPhillips, Ovintiv Inc. and Civitas Resources, Inc. lobbied in favor of it.
Officers stopped being able to issue notices of violation or send information requests to fossil fuel companies suspected of polluting, the sources told CNN.
A violation notice is a prerequisite for taking a company to court for alleged violations of environmental laws.
At the time, The Atlantic’s David A. Graham described the proposition as “undeniably scandalous.” Now that these gifts to Big Oil are being delivered, TV networks should inform their audience about the dirty “deal” between Trump and Big Oil playing out at the expense of the booming clean energy industry, our health, and our climate.","Last May, The Washington Post published an exclusive story on a dinner at Mar-a-Lago in which Donald Trump promised to reverse then-President Joe Biden's actions on climate change as he asked Big Oil executives to fundraise $1 billion for his presidential campaign, assuring that they would be getting a “deal” due to the “taxation and regulation they would avoid thanks to him.” Reportedly, oil and gas executives did make “significant contributions to the Trump campaign.”

Over a four-day period, MSNBC was the only major TV network to cover the story, which All In host Chris Hayes described as “a political quid pro quo.”

Now, two new stories emerged this week that give more context to the promised “deal” the oil and gas industry is getting under Trump’s second term. National TV networks should inform their audience about how Big Oil is benefitting under Trump.

Bloomberg reported on June 17 that the Senate version of Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” now includes a tax break for the oil and gas industry “estimated to be worth more than $1 billion.”

The provision would allow energy companies subject to a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax to deduct certain drilling costs when calculating their taxable income. Companies including ConocoPhillips, Ovintiv Inc. and Civitas Resources, Inc. lobbied in favor of it.

The change was included in the legislation released Monday by Republicans on the Senate tax writing committee, which would slash tax credits for wind, solar, electric vehicles and hydrogen.

…

Other supporters of the measure, which wasn’t included in the House version of the bill, include the Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, founded by oil billionaire and Trump donor Harold Hamm.

The same legislation would repeal tax credits for the clean power industry, which would threaten more than 800,000 jobs and raise energy prices for consumers.

In fact, clean energy technologies constituted 93% of new power generation capacity added to the grid last year alone, and the climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act which Trump wants repealed, “have spurred the highest levels of factory construction in American history, with more than 400,000 new jobs announced across the country.”

Meanwhile, CNN reported on June 16 that “the Environmental Protection Agency has told staff overseeing the country’s industrialized Midwest — a region plagued by a legacy of pollution — to stop enforcing violations against fossil fuel companies.”

Four sources with knowledge of the situation at the EPA’s Region 5 office, which oversees six Midwestern states, told CNN that enforcement officials were informed that “there is a pause on oil and gas enforcement” at staff meetings.

“That is how our regional management is interpreting signals from the president,” the EPA enforcement staffer said.

Officers stopped being able to issue notices of violation or send information requests to fossil fuel companies suspected of polluting, the sources told CNN. A violation notice is a prerequisite for taking a company to court for alleged violations of environmental laws.

These instructions are on top of other administration efforts to radically reduce safeguards that protect Americans from fossil fuel-related pollution and open up more land for oil and gas drilling.

Earlier this month, for example, the EPA announced plans to eliminate Biden-era regulations limiting the amount of carbon emissions and other pollution released into the atmosphere by fossil fuel-fired power plants. CBS reported the rule the EPA seeks to revoke “is projected to reduce 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere by 2047, as well as eliminate tens of thousands of tons of other harmful air pollutants that are dangerous to public health” — an amount of pollution “equivalent to driving more than 320 million gas-powered cars for a year, according to an EPA estimate.”

The new CNN report also notes:

Taken together, these reductions in taxes, regulations, and enforcement for the fossil fuel industry are essentially what Trump promised to deliver for Big Oil in exchange for backing his 2024 campaign.

In other words, workers being able to produce more from an hour of labor.” Economists believe productivity growth largely drives long run increases in economic growth and better living standards.
And we think that productivity growth is what drives all long-run increases in economic growth,” he said.
However, Fieldhouse’s analysis shows that an increase in government R&D spending induces more private sector R&D spending.
“Government R&D and private R&D are complements.","From telecommunication satellites to breakthrough medicines, government-funded research and development, or R&D, has tangible results that have improved lives around the world.

Not only does this research further scientific efforts in improving livelihoods, it brings long-term benefits to the economy, according to Dr. Andrew Fieldhouse, visiting assistant professor in the Mays Business School at Texas A&M University. His recent research with Karel Mertens at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas shows that government-funded non-defense R&D yields economic returns of 140% to 210%, which is well above estimated returns for private sector R&D of about 55%.

“Our recent empirical economic research has identified a significant causal link between government R&D spending and business-sector productivity growth,” Fieldhouse said. “Productivity growth refers to being able to produce more output without using more input during production. In other words, workers being able to produce more from an hour of labor.”

Economists believe productivity growth largely drives long run increases in economic growth and better living standards. If workers can produce more in an hour of labor, their wages should increase to reflect the increased productivity.

“Economists think of productivity growth as reflecting technological progress and know-how. And we think that productivity growth is what drives all long-run increases in economic growth,” he said.

Fieldhouse said his research looks at five major federal agencies and estimates the economic returns to their R&D investments since World War II. These agencies include the Department of Defense, National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Science Foundation (NSF), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department of Energy.

Based on their estimates, Fieldhouse and Mertens calculate that 20% to 25% of all U.S. productivity growth since WWII can be attributed to nondefense government R&D spending.

“That’s a similar contribution to public infrastructure, like highways and bridges, despite the government having spent an order of magnitude more on public infrastructure,” he said. “We just have invested way less in public R&D, but it has a much higher rate of return.”

Government R&D can also start a chain reaction of innovative activity, according to Fieldhouse. More federal funding toward research has historically led to an increase in the employment of scientific researchers, an increase in new technologies or products that become patented and an increase of newly minted STEM Ph.D. students.

“Now you’ve got a more educated, highly skilled STEM workforce in the United States, and you see all these measures of innovative activity increasing, but the productivity effects are pretty gradual. It takes about seven years for there to be a significant and sustained increase in productivity,” he said.

The administration’s preliminary budget request would make unprecedented cuts to organizations like NASA and NIH. NASA’s science budget would be cut by 53% and the overall agency’s budget would drop from $24.8 billion to $18.8 billion, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The Trump administration is also proposing an $18 billion (roughly 40%) cut for NIH and a $5 billion (over 50%) cut for the NSF.

“The research that I’ve been doing suggests to us that productivity will measurably slow if we blow up this engine of innovation,” he said. “This is a case where cutting government R&D is likely to crowd out private sector investment, which is bad for the economy, and cutting government R&D spending is likely to permanently lower the trajectory for productivity growth, which will be completely self-defeating for a fiscal consolidation.”

Fieldhouse said a common argument used against government investments in R&D is that the private sector is doing a more effective job at leading research efforts. However, Fieldhouse’s analysis shows that an increase in government R&D spending induces more private sector R&D spending.

“Government R&D and private R&D are complements. The private sector is running with R&D work funded by the government, and if the government is not funding as much, historically, our research shows that the private sector is just not going to bother investing as much,” he said. “You can’t imagine SpaceX where it is today without decades of NASA R&D preceding it. NIH-funded biomedical research leads to pharmaceutical companies developing better drugs that improve people’s lives.”

While it may take between seven to 15 years to see a significant and sustained increase in productivity, Fieldhouse said R&D investment is often permanent in expanding potential productive capacity in the U.S. economy.

“Even if you’re at a point of somewhat diminishing returns today, you would still expect the returns to be sufficiently high that the government should invest way more in R&D,” he said. “We conclude that Congress historically has under-invested substantially in R&D.”",https://stories.tamu.edu/wp-content/themes/aux-wordpress/images/tamu-icons/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-20 19:07:34.650551

In recent months, five issue experts from the U.S. Chamber have testified before Congressional Committees on topics ranging from AI to veteran hiring.

Creating Better Transitions to Civilian Life for Veterans

“Today’s transitioning service members need more than TAP as they search for postmilitary careers. They need programs that provide them with the tools and resources to help translate their skills, search for and find industries and opportunities, and connect with employers.” – Liz O’Brien, Director of Hiring Our Heroes' Military Spouse Program, before House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity on strengthening the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) to ensure a smoother transition to civilian life for tomorrow's veterans.

International Armaments Cooperation

“True FMS transformation is a task for the interagency, in partnership with the Congress, administration, and private sector.

Electricity prices have already risen 4.5 percent in the last year, according to recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor, and are estimated to surge this summer.
Lowering energy prices and “future-proofing” our energy systems is an economic and security imperative.
But President Trump and Congressional Republicans are doing the opposite: increasing people’s and businesses’ electricity bills all over the country and undercutting sustainable investments in America’s energy grid.
The Republican-induced surge in energy prices will burn working-class living standards and line the pockets of special interests,” said Senator Reed.","WASHINGTON, DC – On the campaign trail, Donald Trump pledged to cut energy costs in half. As president, his policies are causing home energy prices to increase, with consumer electricity prices set to climb by hundreds of dollars under Trump and Republicans’ supposedly ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ which is a big ugly betrayal of working families.

Electricity prices have already risen 4.5 percent in the last year, according to recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor, and are estimated to surge this summer. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) projects home electricity bills are expected to reach their highest average rate in 12 years, at $784 for the summer period.

In Rhode Island, researchers at Energy Innovation found that the House-passed big Trump bill, which repeals clean energy tax breaks and investments, “would increase annual energy bills by $55 million across Rhode Island households annually in 2030, swelling to more than $83 million in higher energy costs by 2035, for a total of $315 million during the budget window of 2025 to 2034.” It also found the bill “would cost Rhode Island’s workforce 2,000 jobs in 2030 and nearly 1,500 jobs in 2035 as new investment in domestic energy and manufacturing falters.”

“President Trump and Republicans’ outdated 20th century energy policies will raise families’ energy costs, kill jobs, and increase pollution. Lowering energy prices and “future-proofing” our energy systems is an economic and security imperative. But President Trump and Congressional Republicans are doing the opposite: increasing people’s and businesses’ electricity bills all over the country and undercutting sustainable investments in America’s energy grid. The Republican-induced surge in energy prices will burn working-class living standards and line the pockets of special interests,” said Senator Reed.

On average, Rhode Island residents spend about $285 per month on electricity, or $3,420 per year for the average household according to energysage.com. But if Trump’s ‘Big Ugly’ reconciliation bill becomes law, those costs would increase significantly due to repeal of the vast majority of tax credits for low-carbon sources of electricity like wind, solar, batteries and geothermal power included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The New York Times reports: “Repealing those credits could increase the average family’s energy bill by as much as $400 per year within a decade, according to several studies published this year.”

Senator Reed says Trump’s outmoded policies and dysfunctional administration are increasing energy prices; failing to invest in the energy infrastructure America needs now and in the future; making America less energy secure; and costing the country good-paying, union jobs.

With summer heat approaching, Senator Reed notes that those most impacted by higher utility bills are lower-income households, including seniors on fixed incomes, who often lack the resources to cover increased monthly payments.

“Not only are President Trump and Republicans doubling down on failed policies from the past, they are rescinding investments in forward looking renewable energy projects that are supporting good jobs and ready to come on line and lower prices. And let’s be clear, they are doing this at the behest of highly profitable fossil fuel companies and conglomerates that are polluting the environment and squeezing consumers,” said Senator Reed.",https://www.reed.senate.gov/assets/images/sharelogo.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 18:09:46.580144

“This decision opens the door to more oil industry lawsuits attacking states’ ability to protect their residents and wildlife from climate change.”","The Supreme Court on Friday joined President Trump and congressional Republicans in siding with the oil and gas industry in its challenge to California’s drive for electric vehicles.

In a 7-2 decision, the justices revived the industry’s lawsuit and ruled that fuel makers had standing to sue over California’s strict emissions standards.

The suit argued that California and the Environmental Protection Agency under President Biden were abusing their power by relying on the 1970s-era rule for fighting smog as a means of combating climate change in the 21st century.

California’s new emissions standards “did not target a local California air-quality problem — as they say is required by the Clean Air Act — but instead were designed to address global climate change,” Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote, using italics to described the industry’s position.

The court did not rule on the suit itself but he said the fuel makers had standing to sue because they would be injured by the state’s rule.

“The fuel producers make money by selling fuel. Therefore, the decrease in purchases of gasoline and other liquid fuels resulting from the California regulations hurts their bottom line,” Kavanaugh said.

Only Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson disagreed.

Jackson questioned why the court would “revive a fuel-industry lawsuit that all agree will soon be moot (and is largely moot already). ... This case gives fodder to the unfortunate perception that moneyed interests enjoy an easier road to relief in this Court than ordinary citizens.”

But the outcome was overshadowed by the recent actions of Trump and congressional Republicans.

With Trump’s backing, the House and Senate adopted measures disapproving regulations adopted by the Biden administration that would have allowed California to enforce broad new regulations to require “zero emissions” cars and trucks.

Trump said the new rules adopted by Congress were designed to displace California as the nation’s leader in fighting air pollution and greenhouse gases.

In a bill-signing ceremony at the White House, he said the disapproval measures “will prevent California’s attempt to impose a nationwide electric vehicle mandate and to regulate national fuel economy by regulating carbon emissions.”

“Our Constitution does not allow one state special status to create standards that limit consumer choice and impose an electric vehicle mandate upon the entire nation,” he said.

In response to Friday’s decision, California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said “the fight for fight for clean air is far from over. While we are disappointed by the Supreme Court’s decision to allow this case to go forward in the lower court, we will continue to vigorously defend California’s authority under the Clean Air Act.”

Some environmentalists said the decision greenlights future lawsuits from industry and polluters.

“This is a dangerous precedent from a court hellbent on protecting corporate interests,” said David Pettit, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute. “This decision opens the door to more oil industry lawsuits attacking states’ ability to protect their residents and wildlife from climate change.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0cfcd45/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5286x2775+0+390/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F37%2F6d%2F36ac3fb14e8faa1bc8b301d5addf%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2219823854,N,,2025-06-20 17:07:18.084940

Tax breaks for data centers nationwide are being questioned due to the lack of long-term jobs at the sites, the energy needs and the potential increase in consumer energy bills that accompany those data centers.

Sen. Jodi Habush-Sinykin, D-Whitefish Bay, claimed the project would lead to “hundreds or even thousands of good paying” while claiming the Vantage Data Centers project would “meaningfully expand the local tax base of Port Washington.”

The expansion of tax base, however, has not proven true as at least 10 states are currently losing $100 million or more in taxes from data centers, according to an April report from Good Jobs First.

DETROIT (AP) — Environmental groups and Michigan’s attorney general filed separate challenges Wednesday against a federal order that is keeping a coal-fired power plant open this summer.

The environmental coalition said there is no energy emergency that would justify keeping Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell plant alive in Ottawa County, near Lake Michigan.

The U.S. Energy Department “has no authority to compel Consumers to rehabilitate — and effectively reconstruct — the increasingly unreliable plant, nor to override the state’s and utility’s decision to replace the plant with less expensive and cleaner sources,” the 54-page petition says.

Consumers Energy had planned to close the power station by May 31 as part of a transition to cleaner energy. But the Energy Department intervened just days earlier, saying the plant must remain open, at least until late August, because of possible electricity shortfalls in the central U.S.

The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, known as MISO, manages the flow of electricity in 15 U.S. states and Manitoba in Canada. MISO has said there should be enough electricity this summer, though it cited the potential for “elevated risk” during extreme weather.

“This type of order is fairly unprecedented,” lawyer Shannon Fisk of Earthjustice said. “It’s a fabricated emergency.”

The Energy Department defended its position. “This administration is committed to ensuring Americans have access to reliable, affordable and secure energy that isn’t dependent on whether the sun shines or the wind blows,” spokesperson Ben Dietderich said.

Consumers Energy said it is complying with the order, noting that the first coal delivery arrived before the planned May 31 decommissioning.

It is unclear whether the challenges by Attorney General Dana Nessel and environmental groups would be settled by the end of August when the order expires. Fisk said the order could be extended.

The Republican-led State Board of Elections voted 3-2 on Thursday to continue recognizing the North Carolina Green Party, potentially affecting close contests for president, U.S. Senate and governor or other statewide and local offices.

Without Thursday's action, the party would have joined four other small parties who also failed to reach the vote thresholds necessary and are thus no longer recognized — the Constitution, Justice for All, No Labels and We the People parties. None of their candidates received at least 2% of the total vote for governor or president to remain an official party.

That means voters who are registered with those four parties are moved to unaffiliated status on voter rolls starting next week. Those groups also would have to collect about 14,000 signatures to regain official party status — an effort that takes time and money.

But the North Carolina Green Party petitioned the board this spring to apply another standard. State law also says a group of voters can become a political party if they ""had a candidate nominated by that group on the general election ballot"" in at least 35 states in the prior presidential election.

The group presented a Federal Election Commission document showing Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee, appeared on the November 2024 ballot in 38 states. In seven states, however, she was not the nominee of the party or of a Green Party affiliate, according to the commission document. For example, she was an independent candidate in three of the seven.

Democratic board member Jeff Carmon said he wasn't convinced the standard was met because Stein failed to be nominated in 35 states by the Green Party or an affiliate.

Republican members decided otherwise. Although Stein may have been listed as the nominee for a different party or as independent, she was the national Green Party candidate, board Chairman Francis De Luca said.

Indiana News Service

INDIANAPOLIS — Workers and families in Indiana could feel the impact of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” moving through the U.S. Senate. The legislation would roll back clean-energy tax credits and investments passed in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Jim Clarida, business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in northwest Indiana, said those investments have helped create jobs and attract nearly $8 billion in private energy development to the state.

“Since the IRA was passed,” he said, “$7.8 billion in private clean-energy investments have flown into my home state here in Indiana, fueling the construction and manufacturing of EV battery plants, expanding solar and wind developments.”

Clarida said Indiana has about two gigabytes of utility-scale solar projects under its belt and has another gigawatt in the pipeline.

Supporters of the big budget bill have argued that the changes are necessary to cut federal spending and reduce the national deficit by eliminating costly subsidies, although it also includes an extension of tax cuts that benefit mostly wealthy Americans.

U.S. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., warned that the bill could drive up household electricity costs by hundreds of dollars and eliminate clean-energy job growth across the Midwest.

“This could create a recession if we lose them all,” he said. “And so first, our union members — not just electricians, but everyone — should know that jobs are at stake in their union, either for themselves or their brothers and sisters who are in the union.”

Indiana ranks among the top 10 states for clean-energy job growth since the Inflation Reduction Act passed.

An increasing number of national ministers are calling for a review of the EU ETS2, with the Polish presidency of the Council of the EU notably assertive on the matter.
The European Commissionhas firmly restated its commitment to a 2027 launch of the EU ETS2, underlining that the “legislation is already adopted and in force” and that no revision of its provisions is foreseen before 2028.
Catherine Abreu from the International Climate Politics Hub stressed the importance of ""quality NDCs,"" not just quantity.
The EU’s submission is especially high-stakes, as it hinges on agreement over the 2040 emissions target.","To allow or not to allow international credits: The shape of the 2040 target is not merely a technical matter - it has become a litmus test for the EU’s climate credibility, especially in how it chooses to meet that target. At the heart of this debate is whether the EU should allow the use of international carbon credits under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement to count towards its 2040 goal. Under Article 6, countries can purchase credits representing emissions reductions or removals from abroad to help meet domestic targets. Although rules for this mechanism were only agreed in late 2024 and no new credits of this type have yet been issued, some EU countries (notably Germany) would like to use them to offer flexibility. The new coalition government in Berlin has backed a three percent margin for Article 6 credits within the 90 percent target.

But the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC) has firmly warned against this approach and insists that the EU’s 90-95 percent emissions cut by 2040 should be achieved entirely through domestic reductions and removals. Jette Bredahl Jacobsen, vice-chair of the advisory board, said that “relying on international carbon credits would risk missing vital opportunities to modernise the EU’s economy, create quality jobs and reinforce Europe’s position in clean tech leadership.” She also noted that the technologies required to meet the target domestically already exist: ""We need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, and the necessary technologies are largely available.""

ETS2 calling: Another urgent deadline is looming: the submission of Social Climate Plans (SCPs) by 30 June. These plans are essential to access the 86.7-billion-euro Social Climate Fund (SCF), designed to support vulnerable households through the impacts of the new Emissions Trading System (ETS2). Set to take effect in 2027, the ETS2 will impose a carbon price on fuels used for road transport and building heating. Since it would be applied upstream, at the point of fuel production, the system could increase petrol and diesel prices by up to 0.50 euro per litre, according to Veyt, a carbon market analytics firm. SCPs should then detail how each country intends to cushion this impact, using their share of the SCF to fund social support schemes and ensure a fair transition.

However, delays in drafting these plans have raised concerns about whether all member states will meet the deadline. Without timely submission, countries risk losing access to the first tranche of funding, due for disbursement in 2026. After submission, the Commission will review the SCPs, request clarifications where necessary, and issue a decision within five months.

An increasing number of national ministers are calling for a review of the EU ETS2, with the Polish presidency of the Council of the EU notably assertive on the matter. The European Commissionhas firmly restated its commitment to a 2027 launch of the EU ETS2, underlining that the “legislation is already adopted and in force” and that no revision of its provisions is foreseen before 2028.

On the way to Brazil: Looking ahead to the international stage, EU positions on emissions targets and Article 6 will feed into global negotiations at COP30 in Brazil this November. Although intersessional talks in Bonn (16-26 June) are ongoing, expectations for immediate breakthroughs are low, especially with many major economies (including China and India, alongside the EU) yet to submit updated NDCs. So far, only 22 countries have done so. Civil society groups, including CAN Europe, have warned that this is a “defining moment” for the EU to demonstrate its leadership and commitment to fair, effective decarbonisation. Catherine Abreu from the International Climate Politics Hub stressed the importance of ""quality NDCs,"" not just quantity. The EU’s submission is especially high-stakes, as it hinges on agreement over the 2040 emissions target.

In addition to mitigation, climate finance will be a central and contentious issue in Bonn. Developing countries were disappointed by last year’s New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), which pledged 300 billion dollars annually in public/private finance by 2035, and a broader goal of 1.3 trillion dollars per year. They’re now demanding concrete steps to clarify how and when that figure will be reached. Parties in Bonn will focus on adaptation and the just transition, especially via the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) and the so-called UAE Dialogue, which aims to track progress on key mitigation goals like renewables expansion and fossil fuel reduction. Negotiations are also complicated by the absence of the US delegation. Some observers say this could allow other nations to step up and much hope goes to Brazil, positioning itself as a diplomatic bridge-builder.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-06-20 18:09:51.232566

Unlike China, India’s EV sector is still at its infancy, with electric vehicles accounting for just 2.5% of all cars sold in the country in 2024.
To accomplish this, India’s EV sector is forging close ties with Chinese EV manufacturers at a time when Washington has been keeping Chinese EV giants at bay.
India is relying on Chinese EV tech to bridge the gap until the domestic sector is ready to compete on the global stage.
Yet this growing alignment between Indian and Chinese EV sectors is creating both opportunity and competition.","For decades, China has driven the lion’s share of oil demand growth thanks to its remarkable economic boom and large population. However, China is now losing its prominence in global oil markets due to a dramatic slowdown in its economy coupled with the country’s ongoing electric vehicle revolution. Last year, nearly half of all new cars sold in China were electric vehicles, including both battery-electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Indeed, China's rapid adoption of EVs, as well as rapid growth of high-speed rail and natural gas trucks, is displacing traditional fossil fuel demand, with the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicting that China's oil demand will peak as early as 2027. Ironically, the country that is taking over China’s mantle in world oil markets is also aspiring to follow in its EV footsteps: India. Unlike China, India’s EV sector is still at its infancy, with electric vehicles accounting for just 2.5% of all cars sold in the country in 2024. However, India has big EV ambitions, with the Indian government having set a target for EVs to make up 30% of total passenger vehicle sales by 2030. To accomplish this, India’s EV sector is forging close ties with Chinese EV manufacturers at a time when Washington has been keeping Chinese EV giants at bay. India is relying on Chinese EV tech to bridge the gap until the domestic sector is ready to compete on the global stage.

Industry analysts note that without access to Chinese technologies—including batteries, drivetrain components, and EV software—India would likely face slower product rollouts, limited model variety, and higher costs during its growth phase. This marks a clear pivot from just a few years ago, when India restricted the operations of firms like BYD and banned popular Chinese apps such as TikTok and Shein after deadly clashes at the border. Related: U.S. Battery Makers Declare National Emergency After China’s Antimony Ban

Now, New Delhi appears to be taking a more calculated stance. In March, the government reduced tariffs on over 35 EV components, many of which are imported from China, making it easier for automakers to source critical parts. A few weeks later, India’s Ministry of Heavy Industries unveiled a new EV policy slashing import duties on fully built EVs from 110% to 15%, provided manufacturers invest and set up local production. This dual-pronged approach aims to attract international players while building out domestic supply chains.

Experts view these shifts as pragmatic. Leading Indian EV makers—such as Tata Motors, Ola Electric, and Mahindra & Mahindra—continue to depend on Chinese vendors for components like battery cells, power control units, and electric motors, even though assembly is carried out in India.

“The aim is to build a resilient domestic ecosystem, not to isolate it, unlike the more aggressive decoupling seen in the U.S. with China,” said Shubham Munde, senior analyst at intelligence firm Market Research Future.

Yet this growing alignment between Indian and Chinese EV sectors is creating both opportunity and competition. MG Motor—a joint venture between India’s JSW Group and China’s state-owned automaker SAIC—has managed to double its market share over the past year, putting pressure on homegrown giants like Tata Motors. Its model, the MG Windsor, is now India’s top-selling electric car, highlighting how joint ventures are gaining traction.

At the same time, India’s EV landscape remains deeply fragmented. According to Bernstein Research, just four legacy automakers dominate 80% of the electric mobility market, leaving over 150 EV startups struggling to establish a foothold in an increasingly competitive space.

Government policy appears to be playing an outsized role in the EV trajectories of different countries. In its 2025 Electric Vehicles Outlook, Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) cut both its near-term and long-term passenger EV adoption outlook in the United States for the first time ever, citing key policy changes including rollback of national fuel-economy targets as well as the removal of supportive elements of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) by the Trump administration.

In contrast, S&P Global Mobility has forecast strong growth for India’s nascent EV sector, projecting that production of battery-electric passenger vehicles will increase by 140% year-over-year in 2025 to roughly 301,400 units. That would represent about 6% of the estimated 5.16 million passenger vehicles expected to be built in India that year.

Still, the road to India’s 2030 goal may be steep. According to S&P, India would need to boost EV adoption by approximately 380 basis points annually to reach 30% market share—nearly double the current growth rate of around 200 basis points per year since 2021. Compounding the challenge is the lack of a unified long-term roadmap and the pending expiration of several state-level EV incentive programs.

Russia and China do have operational SMR nuclear plants, and other nations are working with design firms on developing their own projects.","“Our proud history of innovation has succumbed to overregulated complacency,” reads the introductory passage in the president’s executive order, saying that Idaho National Laboratory, the nation’s primary research facility for testing new reactor designs, has not constructed one since the 1970s.

In response, the DOE is issuing a request for applications seeking qualified U.S. reactor companies wanting to build and operate test reactors outside of the national laboratory process. Companies which already are working to move forward with advanced and SMR designs include Aalo Atomics, X-energy, TerraPower, NuScale Power, Oklo and Natura Resources, among others.

Aalo Atomics, which develops its designs from Austin, Texas and in Idaho, is working directly with the DOE. The company is buoyed by the array of President Trump's executive orders attempting to fast-track SMR, advanced and microreactor development.

""The DOE's new pathway reflects a growing recognition that our regulatory framework must evolve to match the pace of innovation,"" Aalo Atomics CEO Matt Loszak said in reponse to an emailed question from EnergyTech. ""At Aalo, we're pursuing testing and demonstration through DOE authorization, distinct from the NRC route, because it allows for faster iteration, early feedback, and data generation critical for eventual NRC licensing.

""This dual-pathway approach is essential to unlocking the next era of advanced nuclear deployment in the United States,"" Loszak added.

SMR momentum growing under concern about future data center demand

Nuclear energy generates carbon-free electricity and currently provides about 18% of the nation’s utility-scale portfolio. SMR nuclear is seen as a path forward to deliver resilient, high capacity-factor power for the coming demand from artificial intelligence, growing digital infrastructure and expanded industrial electrification.

“The pilot program builds on current efforts to demonstrate advanced reactors on DOE sites through microreactor testbeds and other projects led by the Department of Defense and private industry, “ reads the DOE release about its new program. “It is specifically designed to foster research and development of nuclear reactors and not demonstrate reactors for commercial suitability. Seeking DOE authorization provided under the Atomic Energy Act will help unlock private funding and provide a fast-tracked approach to enable future commercial licensing activities for potential applicants.""

SMRs, like all nuclear power plant projects, attract opposition from those who are concerned about safety and cost issues. Many conventional nuclear plants were being retired in the U.S. due to lack of economic competitiveness, but the looming data center demand crisis is creating the potential for reopening of Three Mile Island and possibly other sites.

Push to create operational reactors is moving Yankee Doodle Dandy fast

DOE will consider advanced reactors having a chance to operate by the July 4, 2026 deadline. While applicants will be responsible for all costs associated with designing, manufacturing, constructing, operating, and decommissioning each test reactor, they will be selected based on a set of criteria, including technological readiness, site evaluations, financial viability, and a detailed plan to achieve criticality.

This program is on the fast track, indeed: Initial applications are due by July 21, with subsequent applications allowed on a rolling basis. DOE will sponsor an Industry Day event on June 25, next week, which will include virtual and in-person attendance.

President Trump’s executive order posted May 23 followed his previous EO on his first day in office, January 20, which declared a “national energy emergency” while also at least temporarily freezing some spending on renewable energy programs. The earlier order noted that the U.S. needs a “reliable, diversified and affordable supply of energy to drive development of advanced technologies, manufacturing, transportation, agriculture and defense industries, and to sustain modern life and national security.”

The federal government under previous administrations, according to President Trump, has “effectively throttled the domestic deployment of advanced reactors, ceding the initiative to foreign nations in building this critical technology.”

Indeed, no SMR has yet started construction much less been completed and put into operation in the U.S, despite more than a decade of private development and financing work. Russia and China do have operational SMR nuclear plants, and other nations are working with design firms on developing their own projects.

In recent SMR nuclear news, the NRC has agreed to review a construction permit for Long Mott Energy to build a power plant energizing Dow Chemical’s manufacturing facility in south Texas. At the heart of that proposed plant would be four X-energy Xe-100 SMR reactors generating about 80 MW each.

The NRC timeline for considering and then deciding on the X-energy SMR plant is 18 months. Long Mott is a subsidiary of Dow, and the Seadrift manufacturing plant produces packaging and consumer goods.

Another microreactor startup, NANO Nuclear , is working with the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign on a campus research project.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/06/685564c446ac6adeb8a4af7c-nuclear_dreamstime.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-06-20 20:05:56.287803

The market is known for its diverse lineup of shops, food, and other businesses. Leaders in Detroit also view the sprawling district as an opportunity for future mobility solutions as the city continues to find ways to help Detroit grow while also reducing pollution and the impact increased commerce has on residents.

Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan partnered up with the Toyota Mobility Foundation to announce four finalists who will receive funding and other resources to pilot their technology and solutions in the market with the broader goal of potentially using them in other parts of the city.

Four finalists bring four different ideas to Eastern Market

The finalists chosen are four startup companies that are each bringing their own ideas into various aspects of Eastern Market’s operations. The first company is Orange Sparkle Ball Inc. When we last met the company, it was at Ford’s NewLab building where we got introduced to their Penny Pickup service which sees the company send small robots to collect various types of waste products. This time around, the company brought a bigger version of their robot for city leaders to check out with Orange Sparkle using the occasion to highlight the micr0-logistics platform it is working on which will improve and streamline the first and last-mile freight delivery process for commercial consumers.

Meanwhile, Civilized Cycles is focusing on improving the delivery process itself with the company working on what it calls a “Semi-Trike.” These trikes are designed to replace gasoline-powered tractor-trailers in city environments with the trikes being used to haul loads to areas where these vehicles cannot reach. The setup itself is deceptively simple with the front trike serving as the proverbial tractor to pull the trailer behind it. The trailer also serves as a giant stabilizer which helps prevent the trike from falling over. While the company had a traditional box-style trailer hooked up to the prototype it had on display in Eastern Market, the firm has said in the past that two other types of trailers are being developed including a flatbed trailer and a stake side trailer.

Zach Schieffelin founder and CEO of Civilized Cycles says the company is confident in the Semi-Trike’s ability to operate in city environments with the exec revealing the firm has already entered talks to use the trikes to help improve package delivery in New York City which is currently hampered by the two bridges that trucks use for package delivery. The trikes aim to streamline this by utilizing maritime shipping to create a continuous loop of parcel deliveries which helps solve some of the logistics issues parcel shippers face when moving packages through the city.

The last two finalists are ElectricFish and Neology with these two firms focusing on improving the charging side of things with their projects attempting to reduce demand on local power grids while also lowering energy costs for commercial consumers and even backup power in the event of a power outage.

Mayor Duggan sees Detroit as a player in mobility services

While announcing the four finalists, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said he sees Detroit as a growing hotbed for mobility-focused technology stating “We are tremendously grateful to the Toyota Mobility Foundation for selecting Detroit and its culture of innovation as the only recipient in the United States to be a part of its Sustainable Cities Challenge,” said Mayor Mike Duggan. “Eastern Market moves the food Detroiters need every day. Thanks to the Foundation, Detroit can help to pioneer solutions to lessen the environmental impact of this important commerce.”

Katy Trudeau, President and CEO of Eastern Market said “Over the last 100 years, businesses in Eastern Market have innovated around food logistics, distribution, and production. Working with growers, businesses, and other stakeholders across southeast Michigan and beyond, we are shaping the next 100 years right here in Detroit.”

The four companies that were chosen as finalists had a long road they had to travel with the firms being part of a larger pool of 10 companies that were rewarded $50,000 to refine their concepts. The four remaining firms received an additional $130,000 to fund real-world operations of their concepts including testing them in Eastern Market. The remaining portion of the broader $3 million in funding will be rewarded to one or more finalists in early 2026. “These finalists bring an exciting mix of complementary innovations and practicality, with solutions that aim to show demonstrable impact in Detroit’s Eastern Market, said Ryan Klem, Program Director at the Toyota Mobility Foundation. “Their work provides an opportunity to show incremental steps towards sustainable, people-centered freight systems globally.”",https://www.car-revs-daily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250620_101358.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 17:07:25.985565

Another is Illuminate USA, a joint venture between U.S. renewables developer Invenergy and Chinese solar panel manufacturer LONGi; it began producing solar panels at a new factory in Ohio last year.
Hall told me he would expect to see Chinese companies try to divest from these projects.","In the House’s version of Trump’s One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act Republicans proposed denying tax credits to clean energy companies whose supply chains contained any ties — big or small — to China. The rules were so administratively and logistically difficult, industry leaders said, that they were effectively the same as killing the tax credits altogether.

Now the Senate is out with a different proposal that, at least on its face, seems to be more flexible and easier to comply with. But upon deeper inspection, it may prove just as unworkable.

“It has the veneer of giving more specificity and clarity,” Kristina Costa, a Biden White House official who worked on Inflation Reduction Act implementation, told me. “But a lot of the fundamental issues that were present in the House bill remain.”

The provisions in question are known as the “foreign entities of concern” or FEOC rules. They penalize companies for having financial or material relationships with businesses that are “owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of” any of four countries — Russia, Iran, North Korea, and, most importantly for clean energy technology, China.

The Inflation Reduction Act imposed FEOC restrictions on just one clean energy tax credit — the $7,500 consumer credit for electric vehicles. Starting in 2024, if automakers wanted their cars to qualify, they could not use battery components that were manufactured or assembled by a FEOC. The rules ratcheted up over time, later disallowing critical minerals extracted or processed by a FEOC.

The idea, Costa told me, was to “target the most economically important components and materials for our energy security and economic security.” But now, the GOP is attempting to impose FEOC restrictions liberally to every tax credit and every component, in a world where China is the biggest lithium producer and dominates roughly 80% of the solar supply chain.

Not only would sourcing outside China be challenging, it would also be an administrative nightmare. The way the House’s reconciliation bill was written, a single bolt or screw sourced from a Chinese company, or even a business partially owned by Chinese citizens, could disqualify an entire project. “How in the world are you going to trace five layers down to a subcontractor who’s buying a bolt and a screw?” John Ketchum, the CEO of the energy company NextEra, said at a recent Politico summit. Ketchum deemed the rules “unworkable.”

The Senate proposal would similarly attach FEOC rules to every tax credit, but it has a slightly different approach. Rather than a straight ban on Chinese sourcing, the bill would phase-in supply chain restrictions, requiring project developers and manufacturers to use fewer and fewer Chinese-sourced inputs over time. For example, starting next year, in order for a solar farm to qualify for tax credits, 40% of the value of the materials used to develop the project could not be tied to a FEOC. By 2030, the threshold would rise to 60%. The bill includes a schedule of benchmarks for each tax credit.

“That might be strict, but it’s clearer and more specific, and it’s potentially doable,” Derrick Flakoll, the senior policy associate for North America at BloombergNEF, told me. “It’s not an all or nothing test.”

But how companies should calculate this percentage is not self-evident. The Senate bill instructs the Treasury department to issue guidance for how companies should weigh the various sub-components that make up a project. It references guidance issued by the Biden administration for the purposes of qualifying for a domestic content bonus credit, and says companies can use this for the FEOC rules until new guidance is issued.

Mike Hall, the CEO of a company called Anza that provides supply chain data and analytics to solar developers, told me he felt that the schedule was achievable for solar farm developers. But the Biden-era guidance only contains instructions for wind, solar, and batteries. It’s unclear what a company building a geothermal project or seeking to claim the manufacturing tax credit would need to do.

Costa was skeptical that the Senate bill was, in fact, clearer or more specific than the House version. “They’re not providing the level of precision in their definitions that it would take to be confident that the effect of what they’re doing here will not still require going upstream to every nut, bolt, screw, and wire in a project,” she said.

It’s also hard to tell whether certain parts of the text are intentional or a drafting error. There’s a section that Flakoll had interpreted as a grandfathering clause to allow companies to exempt certain components from the calculation if they had pre-existing procurement contracts for those materials. But Costa said that even though that seems to have been the intent, the way that it’s written does not actually achieve that goal.

In addition to rules on sourcing, the Senate bill would introduce strict ownership rules that could potentially disqualify projects that are already under construction or factories that are already producing eligible components. The text contains a long list defining various relationships with Chinese entities that would disqualify a company from tax credits. Perhaps the simplest one is if a Chinese entity owns just 25% of the company.

BloombergNEF analyzed the pipeline of solar and battery factories that are operational, under construction, or have been announced in the U.S. as of March, and quite a few have links to China. The research firm identified 22 firms “headquartered in China with Chinese parent companies or majority-Chinese shareholders” that are behind more than 100 existing or planned solar or battery factories in the U.S.

One example is AESC, a Japanese battery manufacturer that sold a controlling stake in the business to a Chinese company in 2018. AESC has two gigafactories under construction in Kentucky and South Carolina, both of which are currently paused, and a third operating in Tennessee. Another is Illuminate USA, a joint venture between U.S. renewables developer Invenergy and Chinese solar panel manufacturer LONGi; it began producing solar panels at a new factory in Ohio last year. The sources I reached out to would not comment on whether they thought that Ford, which has a licensing deal with Chinese battery maker CATL, would be affected. Ford did not respond to a request for comment.

Hall told me he would expect to see Chinese companies try to divest from these projects. But even then, if the business is still using Chinese intellectual property, it may not qualify. “It’s just a lot of hurdles for some of these factories that are already in flight to clear,” he said.

In general, the FEOC language in the Senate bill was “still not good,” he said, but “a big improvement from what was in the House language, which just seemed like an insurmountable challenge.”

Albert Gore, the executive director of the Zero Emissions Transportation Association, had a similar assessment. “Of course, the House bill isn’t the only benchmark,” he told me. “Current law is, in my view, the current benchmark, and this is going to have a pretty negative impact on our industry.”

A statement from the League of Conservation Voters’ Vice President of Federal Policy Matthew Davis was more grave, warning that the Trump administration could use the ambiguity in the bill to block projects and revoke credits. “The FEOC language remains a convoluted, barely workable maze that invites regulatory chaos, giving the Trump administration wide-open authority to worsen and weaponize the rules through agency guidance,” he wrote.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTA4MTIzNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwNzI0NjYyM30.PpcqXwRRddN-QEa7U20wn4GE__OtbOBE41LFz0_ZEP0/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-06-20 16:12:07.160917

“EPA and California may or may not prevail on the merits in defending EPA’s approval of the California regulations.
The Clean Air Act generally preempts state laws that regulate motor vehicle emissions, but it allows the EPA to issue a waiver for California — and only California.
But the EPA and California argue the producers have no legal standing, which requires showing that a favorable court ruling would redress a plaintiff’s injury.
Because the Court had ample opportunity to avoid that result, I respectfully dissent,” Jackson wrote.","The Supreme Court revived an industry effort to axe California’s stricter vehicle emissions standards Friday.

In a 7-2 decision authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court ruled fuel producers have legal standing to sue over California’s clean car standards approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), allowing the challenge to continue.

“This case concerns only standing, not the merits,” Kavanaugh wrote. “EPA and California may or may not prevail on the merits in defending EPA’s approval of the California regulations. But the justiciability of the fuel producers’ challenge to EPA’s approval of the California regulations is evident.”

Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, two of the court’s three Democratic-appointed justices, dissented.

The Clean Air Act generally preempts state laws that regulate motor vehicle emissions, but it allows the EPA to issue a waiver for California — and only California.

The EPA granted such a waiver in 2013, but during President Trump’s first term his administration partially withdraw it. Once former President Biden arrived at the White House, his EPA reinstated the waiver, putting the stricter emissions standards back in play.

A group of producers of gasoline and other liquid fuels sued, arguing California’s regulations reduce the manufacturing of gas-powered cars, which would cause a hit to the fuel producers’ sales.

But the EPA and California argue the producers have no legal standing, which requires showing that a favorable court ruling would redress a plaintiff’s injury. The EPA contended that consumer demand for electric cars would exceed California’s mandate, anyway, so the regulations no longer have impact.

The Supreme Court’s decision rejects that notion, reversing a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit that tossed the lawsuit.

“If invalidating the regulations would change nothing in the market, why are EPA and California enforcing and defending the regulations?” Kavanaugh wrote for the majority.

“The whole point of the regulations is to increase the number of electric vehicles in the new automobile market beyond what consumers would otherwise demand and what automakers would otherwise manufacture and sell,” he added.

In separate dissents, Sotomayor and Jackson said they would’ve sided with the EPA and California and noted the case may become moot.

“I see no need to expound on the law of standing in a case where the sole dispute is a factual one not addressed below,” Sotomayor wrote, saying she would’ve sent the case back to the lower court for another look.

In her separate dissent, Jackson was more forceful, saying her colleagues weren’t applying the courts’ standing doctrine evenhandedly, warning it may contribute to an erosion of public trust in judges.

“This case gives fodder to the unfortunate perception that moneyed interests enjoy an easier road to relief in this Court than ordinary citizens. Because the Court had ample opportunity to avoid that result, I respectfully dissent,” Jackson wrote.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/06/cars_california_ap_0824-e1661375582392.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-21 13:09:59.714377

Big Oil will be rewarded handsomely for its efforts.
In addition to this tax loophole, the Senate GOP's bill includes billions of dollars in upfront subsidies to Big Oil and cuts royalties paid by oil and gas companies for drilling on public lands.
""You have got to be kidding me,"" tweeted the account for Americans for Tax Fairness in response to the Senate GOP's draft.
Now it gives Big Oil MORE money while they price-gouge us.""","Senate Republicans have added a provision to their draft of the budget reconciliation package that would exempt domestic oil and gas companies from paying corporate taxes, saving them more than $1 billion over the next decade.

On Wednesday, David Dayen reported in The American Prospect that the Senate Finance Committee's version of the bill, released Monday, ""shields domestic onshore oil and gas drillers from the Inflation Reduction Act's corporate alternative minimum tax,"" or CAMT.

That provision was secured by Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), and the benefits would largely flow to companies based in his home state.

As Dayen wrote, the CAMT is ""a fairly clean tax provision as these things go."" It currently requires companies that bring in more than $1 billion to pay 15% of the profits they report to shareholders.

However, the Senate Republican draft would modify that calculation to account for ""intangible drilling and development costs,"" which would allow companies to declare lower profits and put many of them below the threshold required to pay the 15% tax.

According to Bloomberg, companies including ConocoPhillips, Ovintiv, and Civitas Resources lobbied in favor of the bill. Lankford, meanwhile, received more than $546,000 in campaign contributions from the oil and gas industry—his top source of industry donations—between 2019 and 2024 according to OpenSecrets.

Big Oil will be rewarded handsomely for its efforts. The provision in the Senate GOP bill is virtually identical to another bill proposed by Lankford, which the nonpartisan Tax Foundation found would hand $1.1 billion in government revenue to the fossil fuel industry over the next 10 years.

""This disastrous piece of legislation includes giveaway after giveaway for the fossil fuel industry, while cutting crucial clean energy programs that help consumers save money on their electric bills,"" said Alan Zibel, an oil and gas researcher with the consumer rights group Public Citizen.

In addition to this tax loophole, the Senate GOP's bill includes billions of dollars in upfront subsidies to Big Oil and cuts royalties paid by oil and gas companies for drilling on public lands. At the same time, the bill guts subsidies for wind and solar energy, including a tax credit that saved money for consumers who made their homes more energy efficient.

Through its combination of tax breaks and cuts to safety net programs like Medicaid and food stamps, the so-called ""Big Beautiful Bill"" constitutes a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich. According to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office last week, it would result in the richest 10% of households bringing in an extra $12,000 a year while the poorest 10% would lose nearly $1,600.

""You have got to be kidding me,"" tweeted the account for Americans for Tax Fairness in response to the Senate GOP's draft. ""Not only does the bill gut Medicaid and SNAP to fund tax breaks for billionaires. Now it gives Big Oil MORE money while they price-gouge us.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61083002&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C86,N,,2025-06-20 19:07:26.823266

The Big Question: How long should the U.S. continue with EV tax credits?","Every legislative decision around EV tax credits is like pulling teeth, from the battle to overhaul them to this new movement to repeal them. The House has already made its proposal, but that’s just one arm of the federal government. As it turns out, the Senate wants to end the current system even sooner — Like, possibly as soon as July 4 in certain cases. This means if you’re shopping for an EV, you might want to hurry up, as if the Senate gets its way, certain lease deals could be hit particularly hard.

We’re getting the most controversial news out of the way first, because everything else here is a bit less heavy. A new report suggests McKinsey put out the option of Stellantis selling Maserati, Ontario Premier Doug Ford recently had a close brush with alleged car thieves, and Jerry Bruckheimer and Tom Cruise want to get out there and hit the pace car again.

It’s a little grab bag of everything on today’s edition of The Morning Dump, proposed car laws and industry news and unusual car crime and film. I’ll be in the seat for the next few days taking over from Matt, so pull yourself a shot of espresso and get ready to read. Happy Friday, everyone.

The Senate Wants An Abrupt End To EV Tax Credits

We all kinda saw this coming, right? After making combustion engines a platform point, the current administration is working to roll back EV tax credits. After all, when you have a majority in the House and Senate aligned with the President, it’s easier to get stuff through before midterms have a chance of realigning the legislative branch. It’s not new information that EV tax credits are on the chopping block, but some of these credits could be axed sooner than expected. While the House proposes sunsetting credits for automakers who’ve built more than 200,000 EVs starting in 2026, the Senate is proposing a far more aggressive approach, as Automotive News reports.

The Senate version, released from the Finance Committee on June 16, treats all automakers the same by ending the EV tax credit within 180 days of the bill’s passage. That proposal would also cut the EV leasing credit immediately for vehicles that don’t meet local content rules and in 180 days for those that do.

“I think the Senate version is worse, totally cold turkey, and the lease thing is so important,” said Mike Murphy, a Republican political consultant and CEO of the American EV Jobs Alliance, a pro-EV lobbying group. “Bottom line is the Senate is really trying to put a stake in the heart of EV subsidies.”

The proposed immediate tax credit discontinuation for certain leases is especially important, because many cars that don’t quality for the full $7,500 tax credit if bought due to battery sourcing and/or place of assembly do qualify for the credit if they’re leased. Not only does this make driving a new EV more affordable, it also ensures a steady supply of gently used EVs once they come off lease in order to claw back some of the leasing super-cliff we’re now facing due to a downturn in new vehicle leasing starting in 2020.

While it’s true that EV tax credits for buyers probably can’t last forever, to me it seems soon to be phasing them out. We certainly haven’t reached natural price parity with combustion-powered equivalent models across the board, and many buyers are leaning on heavily discounted EV leases for reliable, reasonably inexpensive transportation now that the EPA’ footprint rule has basically killed subcompact cars. Going cold turkey on leasing credits for vehicles that don’t meet local content rules as soon as the bill passes would be a serious blow to consumers, not to mention the 180-day phase-out for qualifying vehicles. It’s no secret that credits play a huge role in consumer appeal and affordability, and J.D. Power has some surveys to back that up.

“For customers of Honda and Volkswagen, on average, the tax credit was the No. 1 purchase reason. For brands like Tesla, Cadillac and Chevrolet, among others, tax credits were amid the top three most influential purchase reasons,” [J.D. Power EV practice executive director Brent] Gruber said.

The self-imposed deadline for deciding when and how EV tax credits will be phased out is July 4, which means if you want to lock in a deal with absolute certainty regardless of whether the Senate’s proposal prevails, you have less than two weeks. Obviously, don’t go out and panic buy a car that you don’t need, but if you’re already shopping deals or have serious plans to lease an EV within the next three months, you might want to pick up the pace a touch.

The Trouble With Maserati

Oh, Maserati. What will we ever do with you? With total global sales more than halving last year to just 11,300 units, several canceled projects including the MC20 Folgore, and seemingly no easy way forward, it shouldn’t be surprising to hear Reuters report that Stellantis is mulling a sale of the Italian brand. This latest potential avenue seems to have started after the brand contracted McKinsey, a move that is rarely considered a good sign because no matter the industry, consulting is expensive and is generally an avenue to turn to when you’ve either exhausted all resources on hand or are trying something you’ve never done before. Considering Stellantis has extensive experience making cars and running car brands, seeking the help of big consultants for Maserati doesn’t paint a rosy picture of the present.

Stellantis hired consultant McKinsey early in April to advise it on the effects of the U.S. tariffs on Maserati and Alfa Romeo as the two brands prepare future plans. Stellantis affirmed then that it was fully committed to both brands.

However, a possible divestment of Maserati, its only luxury brand, is among the options McKinsey is exploring for Stellantis, the two sources told Reuters, adding the adviser’s assessment was still in the early stages. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly.

Aside from the fact that DS is also a Stellantis-owned luxury brand, it’s not surprising to hear that selling Maserati has been suggested. Part of the dark side of consulting is having a scapegoat to blame if you already want to sell an entity or strip it of its assets, and while a decision hasn’t been made yet, it doesn’t sound like a sale is entirely off the table. It’s a divisive issue that reportedly comes with internal friction.

The hard part here is that both sides have compelling arguments. On the one hand, it’s hard to justify several six-figure cars with reworked Alfa Romeo bones (looking at you, Grecale and GranTurismo), but Stellantis doesn’t have a whole lot of parts bin options. What’s it gonna do, use the STLA Large platform seen underneath the Dodge Charger Daytona, or launch a Hemi-powered Maserati just to have a V8? The former still seems to need some ironing out, while the latter just wouldn’t fly. On the other, if Stellantis were to reposition Maserati, the brand could be more successful.

Looking at actual market values of products, the GranTurismo needs at least a $20,000 haircut to move it in line with the Mercedes-AMG GT, and the Grecale probably needs a price point $8,000 to $10,000 lower than where it’s at right now so it can cosy up to combustion-loyal Porsche Macan owners who’ll soon be left without a really close replacement. Right now, Stellantis’ official statement to Reuters is “Respectfully, Maserati is not for sale,” but it’ll take some serious product and strategy to rebuild the storied marque. If Stellantis isn’t able to put in the work, maybe exploring a potential sale is the best option. Maserati was doing great when Ferrari owned it, maybe it’s time to see if Maranello wants it back.

Alleged Car Thieves Reportedly Tried To Steal A Car From A Sitting Politician’s House

If you’re American and watch cable news, you’re probably now aware of Ontario Premier Doug Ford, brother of the late Rob Ford. He’s been an unexpected voice in the tariff war, and while we aren’t going to get into Canadian politics here, one thing everyone can say is that he’s certainly a visible public figure in North America. It’s not surprising that the leader of a province would have a security detail in case anything happened, and while no threats to safety have been posed, something really dumb almost happened—Global News reports that four people have been arrested on charges of possessing an electronic device for motor vehicle theft after they were reportedly caught casing Ford’s residence on Tuesday.

Around 12:30 a.m., police said officers saw people in a vehicle wearing masks and slowing down as it approached a driveway in the area of Lawrence Avenue West and Royal York Road, the area where Ford lives.

A spokesperson for Toronto police confirmed that the incident was believed to be targeting Ford’s home address.

Police said they initiated a vehicle stop and one of the suspects got out of the car to run. Inside the car, they said they found a key reprogramming device and a programmable master key.

If I were to hazard a guess, the “master key” was probably just a blank fob, but with the right fob and programming device, that can be enough to steal whichever make of car is named on the fob. Still, this is what we call instant karma, but it also points to a problem that still needs tamping down. As we’ve previously detailed, organized car theft is a big problem in parts of Canada, with stolen vehicles exported to countries with relaxed rules on what vehicles make it in. There’s no easy solution here, so it’s understandable that more and more Canadian car owners are installing bollards on their driveways.

Hit The Pace Car Again

If we’re talking about the greatest car films of all time, “Days of Thunder” with Tom Cruise has to be up there on the list. From the rental car race to the cinematography of the cars on the ovals, it works well if you don’t take it too seriously, and despite basically being “Top Gun” with cars, it’s drawn admiration from some big names including Quentin Tarantino. If you still love it, you’re going to like this tidbit of news coming down the wire.

In an interview with ET from the red carpet of “F1: The Movie”, Jerry Bruckheimer has said that he and Tom Cruise are collaborating on a sequel to the iconic NASCAR film. We don’t know much right now, as it sounds like the project is in early development, but Bruckheimer said “We’ll have something really exciting for an audience once we pull it together.”

If this ends up happening, it’s going to rule. Has everything from the original “Days of Thunder” aged perfectly? No, but give it the leeway usually needed for a 35-year-old film and it still holds up pretty well if you take merely a semi-serious approach. Plus, if “Top Gun 2” was a smash hit, who says the “Days of Thunder” concept won’t be more successful when rebooted than it was at the original box office? It feels about time we had another NASCAR film, and I’m rooting for Bruckheimer and Cruise to pull this off.

What I’m Listening To While Writing TMD

Fair warning: The song I’m about to show you isn’t exactly outstanding or critically acclaimed, but it is interesting. There’s always something fascinating about insane collaborations between people you’d never think would be on the same track. In this case, it’s Ludacris, Zakk Wilde, Chad Kroeger from Nickelback, and the second singer of Three Days Grace, Matt Walst.

See, before Walst joined Three Days Grace, he had a band called My Darkest Days, and that effort managed to pull all these artist together for a debut single called, um, “Porn Star Dancing.” I mean, Chad Kroeger makes sense considering My Darkest Days was signed to 604 Records, but Zakk Wilde is a bit left-field for this flavor of music and Ludacris was only originally supposed to be on the Canadian version, but come on. Of course Luda rapping about strip clubs would have appeal everywhere, it was only a matter of time before his feature made it to the U.S. release.

I’m struggling to find an organic reason why “Porn Star Dancing” should’ve taken off, but it was big in Canada thanks to CanCon laws and the last dredges of post-grunge popularity, and it went to number one on the Billboard Modern Rock chart in America. The zeitgeist of 2010’s early stage of recession recovery probably helped because this is the sort of trashy, lecherous guilty pleasure that could get the people going in an era of trash TV and general leering. Truly one of the more bizarre modern rock tracks, but hey, if you haven’t heard of it before, now you have an unhinged musical fact to pull out at parties. Actually, given the subject matter, maybe “pull out” is the wrong way to phrase it.

Serena Golden

Epworth United Methodist Church (UMC) in Durham, North Carolina, has long been a congregation committed to living its faith through action. In July 2023, driven by the values of environmental stewardship, economic justice, and fiscal responsibility, the congregation took a bold step to align its operations with its mission: caring for God’s creation, and installed 219 solar panels across six rooftops.

This system is expected to generate around 75% of their energy needs, making Epworth a model for clean energy in Durham. With the church expected to recoup its out-of-pocket investment in six years thanks to energy bill savings, Epworth is inspiring its congregation and community to consider solar.

For churches interested in solar, Epworth’s message is clear: the time is now.

“Act quickly before the current federal administration can reduce incentives.” – Epworth UMC’s Creation Care Committee

Solar Made Possible by Federal and Utility Support

The $63,000 project was made feasible by leveraging key incentives. Epworth received rebates from Duke Energy as well as a direct federal payment. Tax credits are a new incentive for many congregations, since prior to 2022, tax-exempt organizations like churches and other nonprofits were ineligible for the clean energy tax credits that for-profit businesses could benefit from. That changed in 2022 with the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which established a program allowing tax-exempt organizations to receive a direct payment from the IRS equal to the value of the tax credit. The IRA includes provisions for several clean energy tax credits to be obtained through direct pay. Together, these supports significantly reduced the system’s up-front cost.

The church remains connected to the grid and benefits from net metering, receiving credits for any excess power generated and contributing to the community’s overall energy supply.

Stewardship of Creation Starts at Home

For Epworth UMC, solar isn’t just about saving money—it is a spiritual decision.

The United Methodist Church’s Social Principle states that “All creation is the Lord’s, and we are responsible for how we use and abuse it.” That theological grounding led the congregation to take responsibility for their carbon footprint and model climate action for their community.

In 2022, the church established a Creation Care Committee, a group responsible for ensuring that Epworth was doing its part to protect the Earth. Committee members began with simple steps—starting a composting program and conducting an energy audit—and then set their sights on a bigger goal: solar energy.

Several Creation Care Committee members already had solar on their homes, which gave the church confidence to explore options for their facility. What followed was a collaborative process across multiple church committees—Trustees, Finance, Endowment, and others—with plenty of prayer and discernment along the way.

After receiving quotes from three local solar installers, the committee selected a proposal and brought it to the Trustees Committee, which approved it unanimously. The Finance Committee weighed in on funding options, and the Endowment Committee ultimately voted to support the full cost as a capital improvement to the church.

The result: a solar array designed to generate approximately 126,000 kilowatt hours of clean energy each year.

Nearly two years in, the results are already clear. The system has produced more than 216 megawatt hours of electricity and prevented an estimated 168 tons of CO₂ emissions. Real-time tracking enables the congregation to monitor performance and environmental impact.

The installation also offers a huge financial benefit: the church expects to recoup its out-of-pocket investment within six years thanks to lower electricity bills.

Lifting the Whole Community

Epworth’s solar success hasn’t stayed within its sanctuary walls. Updates from the pulpit, displays in church halls, and information shared through the congregation’s weekly bulletin board, Etchings, keep members informed and inspired.

Churchgoers have responded enthusiastically, with many now considering solar for their own homes. The congregation is one of many communities across the Southeast benefiting from lower power bills thanks to clean energy. These communities are emblematic of the Clean Energy Generation, a diverse movement of Southeasterners working for a healthier and more sustainable future.

The Creation Care Committee hopes their experience will serve as a blueprint for other churches and community organizations considering renewable energy.

They recommend starting with a simple solar viability check using tools like Google’s Project Sunroof, reaching out to local installers for quotes, and exploring partnerships with energy providers.

A Witness to What’s Possible

Epworth United Methodist Church shows that when a faith community aligns its mission with its operations, the impact can be financially, environmentally, and spiritually powerful. Their solar journey reflects a deep commitment to creation care and offers a shining example to congregations across the Southeast.

As more houses of worship seek to lead by example in the climate movement, Epworth’s story reminds us that clean energy is more than a technical fix—it’s an act of faith.

Click here to read the full text of the June 20 decision in Diamond Alternative Energy v. Environmental Protection Agency.

BULLET POINTS: “To deny standing based on a theory that invalidating an important regulation would actually have zero impact on a dynamic and heavily regulated market requires a degree of economic and political clairvoyance that is difficult for a court to maintain. That is particularly so when the government regulation itself may be skewing the market at issue. So courts should exercise caution before denying standing because of a claimed lack of redressability rooted in questionable economic speculation. …

“In sum, this case does not present the unusual scenario where invalidating a challenged government restriction on businesses in a competitive market is not likely to have any effect. Here, it may not be certain, but it is at least ‘predictable’ that invalidating the California regulations would likely result in the fuel producers ultimately selling more gasoline and other liquid fuels.”

— Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, opinion of the court

“Having granted certiorari, the Court relegates to a footnote the actual basis for the D.C. Circuit’s decision [which was based on an apparent misunderstanding about when the California fleet-wide emissions standards expire]. A version of that footnote should have been the Court’s entire opinion in this case. For reasons unknown, the majority instead conjures up a ‘heightened “proof of redressability” requirement’ that the D. C. Circuit did not adopt and that no party advanced, and then laboriously ‘decline[s] to adopt’ that requirement. I see no need to expound on the law of standing in a case where the sole dispute is a factual one not addressed below. Indeed, as JUSTICE JACKSON explains, this case is unlikely to present a live controversy for much longer regardless of petitioners’ standing, as the administration is likely to withdraw the challenged rules. I would simply have vacated the case and remanded it to the D.C. Circuit to reconsider its redressability analysis, keeping in mind the now corrected timeline for the challenged vehicle-emissions programs.”

— Justice Sonia Sotomayor, dissenting

“In my view, we should have either denied certiorari outright or held this matter in abeyance pending EPA‘s reconsideration of its waiver grant. Barring that, we should have simply vacated and remanded for the D. C. Circuit to reconsider its ruling on a clarified factual record.…

“The Court’s remarkably lenient approach to standing in this case contrasts starkly with the stern stance it has taken in cases concerning the rights of ordinary citizens. Here, the Court’s ‘commonsense’ inferences readily align with the fuel industry’s assertions of

The AI and data center buildout is being called a new industrial revolution and an enormous economic opportunity.","Driven by the explosive growth of artificial intelligence and data centers, U.S. electricity demand and electricity prices are rising rapidly. Dozens of new data centers, each with the electricity needs of a small city, are gobbling up the nation’s power supply.

Forecasters see U.S. electricity demand growing 25% by 2030, and nearly 80% by 2050. In some regions of the country, it will be far more and even faster. The nation’s largest regional electricity grid, PJM Interconnection, which stretches from Virginia to Illinois, expects that, by 2030, new data center power demand will equal the electricity needs of 20 million homes.

This onslaught of new demand is coming far faster than utilities can add new generating capacity and energy infrastructure. It’s also putting immense pressure on electricity prices, the prices paid not just by tech companies but by the average household as well.

Electricity prices could jump 15% to 40% in just the next five years, according to a recent forecast. By 2050, prices might even double. And these spikes are coming on top of an existing jump in prices. According to an analysis from the Department of Energy, retail electricity prices have increased faster than the rate of inflation since 2022, rising 13%.

Amazon, Google, Meta, and other tech giants are talking a good game about next-generation nuclear power plants and new natural gas generation to meet their enormous, around-the-clock power needs. But it will be years before those plans are realized. In the near term, they’re buying up the very electricity that supplies U.S. households.

Grid operators and utilities are trying to add new power capacity to meet surging demand, but the cost of doing so is being socialized across the entire ratepayer base. Effectively, grandma is being asked to pay more to accommodate the needs of some of the world’s wealthiest companies.

Several states are trying to advance legislation to ensure that ratepayers aren’t stuck with these costs. But the genie is largely out of the bottle. To shield consumers, we’re going to need smart policy. We’re also going to need these tech giants to step up to the plate.

We need pragmatism to meet this urgent need for more electricity. The place to start is by ensuring that today’s existing baseload power plants stay online, and aren’t forced into early retirement by misguided policy.

While data center developers have signed deals to keep nuclear power plants running, and to even bring mothballed reactors back online, they should take the same exact approach with America’s coal fleet.

Dozens of operating coal plants are being pushed offline to comply with state renewable energy mandates. The Trump administration is beginning to step in, to keep key plants operating in markets already desperately short of power. But tech companies need to get into the mix.

Data center developers should match their promises of building new power generation with immediate efforts to keep existing power plants running. If tech companies are determined to shape our future, they should ensure we have the energy affordability bridge to get there.

The AI and data center buildout is being called a new industrial revolution and an enormous economic opportunity. That may be true, and there’s good reason to want that revolution to happen here rather than in China. But we must ensure that winning the AI race doesn’t mean swamping the average American household with ever-rising energy costs and power shortages.

With Independence Day approaching fast, this beloved U.S. state is preparing for a record-breaking travel surge that promises to fill roads, skies, and city streets with movement, excitement, and celebration.

But this isn’t just a trend. It’s a transformation.

From mountain towns to coastal escapes, North Carolina joins powerhouses like Florida and California in drawing millions of domestic travelers. The numbers are rising. The pressure is building. And the entire country is watching.

This new update for all Americans reveals what to expect as Texas, New York, Nevada, and Arizona also brace for historic levels of movement. Something big is coming this July Fourth—and North Carolina is right at the center of it. Are you ready?

North Carolina Readies for Historic Independence Day Travel Surge: 2.3 Million on the Move

A massive wave of holiday travel is set to hit North Carolina. According to the latest projections by AAA, 2.3 million residents are expected to travel domestically between Saturday, June 28, and Sunday, July 6. That’s an increase of 79,000 travelers, or 1% more than 2024, in a year already marked by surging movement and renewed national wanderlust.

As Independence Day approaches, excitement is building—but so is urgency. Congested highways, full flights, and busy terminals are already shaping up to be defining features of this year’s holiday week.

Travel by Car Still Dominates

Out of the projected 2.3 million travelers, more than two million North Carolinians will be hitting the road in personal vehicles. This continues a growing trend across the U.S. of favoring domestic, road-based getaways over complex international plans.

Gas prices remain relatively stable, fueling confidence in long-distance car trips across the Carolinas, the Southeast, and along the Eastern Seaboard. Whether travelers head toward the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Outer Banks, or urban hubs like Charlotte and Raleigh, traffic will be consistent—and in many places, relentless.

Air Travel Climbs, Airports Brace for Pressure

Over 160,000 residents will fly domestically during the holiday period. While the numbers reflect steady growth in aviation demand, they also foreshadow crowded concourses and tightened security checkpoints.

At the center of this storm is Asheville Regional Airport, which recently unveiled a new concourse opening in June—just in time for the summer rush. The expansion adds much-needed gates and waiting areas, aimed at easing peak-hour pressure.

However, travelers should remain cautious. TSA lines at Asheville have already shown signs of strain, with early morning delays becoming common. Officials urge passengers to arrive at least two hours early and pack with patience in mind.

Trains, Buses, and Cruises Make a Comeback

Though smaller in comparison, around 100,000 North Carolina residents will choose buses, trains, and cruises for their July 4 getaways. This marks a subtle resurgence of multi-modal travel, where comfort, cost savings, and environmental concerns influence decision-making.

Increased Amtrak bookings and cruise departures from nearby ports in Charleston and Norfolk point to a growing appetite for slower, scenic journeys. Travel habits are diversifying—and planners are noticing.

A National Perspective: U.S. Travel Booms

North Carolina’s surge reflects a broader national trend. Across the United States, 72.2 million Americans are expected to travel for the Independence Day holiday. That’s a 2.4% increase from last year and a stunning seven million more than the pre-pandemic benchmark in 2019.

Of those, 61.6 million will drive, creating potential logjams on major interstates and regional roads from coast to coast. The Southeast, including I-40, I-95, and I-85 corridors, is expected to see particularly heavy congestion.

Peak Traffic Times Demand Smart Planning

According to traffic analytics firm INRIX, July 2 to July 6 will be the most congested stretch of the holiday period. Travelers are advised to hit the roads early in the morning to avoid afternoon gridlocks and bottlenecks in urban areas.

Afternoons and early evenings—especially July 3 and July 5—are expected to bring the longest delays. Real-time traffic apps and rerouting tools will be essential for avoiding frustration.

Travelers should also prepare for longer travel times to recreational zones, including mountain towns, lakeside cabins, and beach destinations. Routes to Asheville, Wilmington, and Boone may require patience—and backup plans.

Tourism Economy Ready for Lift-Off

The upcoming holiday isn’t just a challenge—it’s a windfall. The spike in travel will funnel millions of dollars into North Carolina’s tourism economy.

Hotels in Asheville, Charlotte, and coastal areas are reporting near-capacity bookings. Restaurants are staffing up. Outdoor attractions are seeing reservation surges, and regional airports are extending operating hours to accommodate volume.

For small businesses, this isn’t just a holiday—it’s a chance to rebound, rebuild, and reach new customers.

Infrastructure Expansions Show Promise

The new concourse at Asheville Regional Airport is more than just a facility upgrade. It’s a response to long-term passenger growth. The terminal expansion is part of a statewide push to modernize infrastructure ahead of peak travel seasons.

Wider lanes, improved baggage handling, and more spacious waiting areas are helping to reset traveler expectations. If successful, Asheville could become a model for other regional airports navigating similar demand surges.

Moreover, investments in public transportation and traffic management are slowly being realized, though more coordination is needed at state and municipal levels to support the evolving needs of tourism and local commuters.

The Emotional Core: Reconnecting Through Travel

Behind the numbers is something deeply human. North Carolinians aren’t just traveling—they’re reconnecting. After years of disruptions, these summer holidays have regained their full emotional weight.

Families are reuniting. Couples are rediscovering the romance of road trips. Friends are exploring their state with fresh eyes. Independence Day has become more than fireworks and cookouts—it’s a symbol of reclaiming freedom, movement, and joy.

That energy is fueling record travel—and creating unforgettable moments in every corner of the state.

Destination Guide: North Carolina – Where Southern Charm Meets Wild Adventure

Welcome to North Carolina, a state where rolling mountains meet sandy shores, and small-town charm collides with booming city life. Nestled in the heart of the American South, North Carolina is a diverse destination that offers something for every traveler—whether you crave outdoor adventure, historic discovery, coastal relaxation, or culinary exploration.

Getting There & Getting Around

Flying into Charlotte Douglas International Airport or Raleigh-Durham International Airport will place you within reach of most major destinations. For mountain escapes, Asheville Regional Airport is your gateway. North Carolina is also well-connected by Amtrak and several interstate highways, making it a perfect stop for road trippers.

Once here, renting a car is the best way to explore at your own pace. The state’s geography spans everything from high-altitude mountain roads to scenic coastal byways.

The Mountains: Serenity in the Blue Ridge

Start your adventure in Western North Carolina, where the Blue Ridge Mountains stretch across the skyline like a watercolor painting. The artsy town of Asheville is a cultural magnet, home to vibrant street murals, music festivals, craft breweries, and the iconic Biltmore Estate.

Drive the Blue Ridge Parkway, one of America’s most scenic routes. Hike the trails of Great Smoky Mountains National Park or take in panoramic views from Grandfather Mountain. In the fall, this region bursts into a spectacle of autumn colors that draw leaf-peepers from across the country.

The Piedmont: Urban Pulse and Historic Roots

Central North Carolina, known as the Piedmont, blends innovation and heritage. Charlotte, the state’s largest city, buzzes with sports, nightlife, and a booming financial sector. Visit Uptown Charlotte for museums, rooftop bars, and NASCAR experiences.

In Raleigh, part of the dynamic Research Triangle, culture and academia come alive. Explore the North Carolina Museum of Art, the Museum of Natural Sciences, and the city’s diverse food scene. Don’t miss Durham and Chapel Hill for their rich African-American history, college-town energy, and award-winning restaurants.

The Coast: Where the Ocean Meets History

To the east, North Carolina’s coastline stretches for 300 miles, dotted with charming islands, lighthouses, and fishing villages. The Outer Banks offer wild, windswept beaches perfect for kite surfing, horseback riding, or simply soaking up the sun.

Visit Cape Hatteras National Seashore to climb historic lighthouses or take a ferry to Ocracoke Island for a true escape from the modern world. Wilmington, with its riverfront boardwalk and nearby Wrightsville Beach, blends Southern charm with coastal chic.

Further south, Emerald Isle and Topsail Beach are beloved for their family-friendly atmosphere, sea turtle sanctuaries, and relaxed vibes.

Eat & Drink: Flavors of the South, with a Twist

North Carolina is a foodie’s paradise, especially if you like barbecue. The eternal debate between Eastern-style (vinegar-based) and Lexington-style (tomato-based) rages on in smokehouses across the state.

But there’s more than ‘cue. In Asheville and Raleigh, you’ll find farm-to-table gems, global cuisine, and craft cocktail bars. The state’s wine regions near the Yadkin Valley and burgeoning craft beer scene—especially in Asheville, dubbed “Beer City USA”—make North Carolina a drink destination, too.

Outdoor Adventures: Nature for Every Mood

Whether you’re a thrill-seeker or a nature-lover, North Carolina delivers. Go white-water rafting in the Nantahala River, zipline through forest canopies near Boone, or paddleboard in the calm waters of coastal inlets.

The Uwharrie National Forest is a hidden gem for hikers and bikers, while anglers and kayakers can explore the state’s countless lakes and rivers.

In the winter, head to Beech Mountain or Sugar Mountain for family-friendly skiing and snowboarding.

Where to Stay

Accommodations in North Carolina are as varied as its landscapes. Opt for luxury at the Inn on Biltmore Estate, or go boutique at a downtown Asheville art hotel. Cozy mountain cabins, historic inns in Wilmington, and oceanfront resorts along the Outer Banks all offer different flavors of Southern hospitality.

For budget-conscious travelers, chain hotels and charming B&Bs are widely available, and vacation rentals abound throughout the state.

Tips for Travelers

Best Time to Visit: Spring and fall offer mild weather and stunning natural beauty. Summer is perfect for beach lovers, while winter is quiet and cozy in the mountains.

Events to Catch: The North Carolina State Fair (October), Moogfest in Durham (spring), and Wilmington Wine & Food Festival (May) are annual favorites.

Local Etiquette: Southern hospitality is real—expect smiles, slower paces, and friendly greetings.

Final Word: Why You Should Go

North Carolina is a place of contrasts and connections—mountains and coastlines, old traditions and new ideas. It invites you to slow down, soak it in, and stay a while.

Come for the landscapes. Stay for the culture. Leave with a story you didn’t expect to write.

What Travelers Need to Know Now

Leave early: Beat the rush by traveling before 10 a.m.

Stay informed: Monitor traffic apps, airport alerts, and weather forecasts.

Pack patience: Congestion and delays are inevitable, but planning helps.

Book in advance: Hotels, rental cars, and dining spots are filling fast.

Support local: Spend at small businesses—your dollars go further.

“EPA and California may or may not prevail on the merits in defending EPA’s approval of the California regulations.
The Clean Air Act generally preempts state laws that regulate motor vehicle emissions, but it allows the EPA to issue a waiver for California — and only California.
But the EPA and California argue the producers have no legal standing, which requires showing that a favorable court ruling would redress a plaintiff’s injury.
Because the Court had ample opportunity to avoid that result, I respectfully dissent,” Jackson wrote.","The Supreme Court revived an industry effort to axe California’s stricter vehicle emissions standards Friday.

In a 7-2 decision authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court ruled fuel producers have legal standing to sue over California’s clean car standards approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), allowing the challenge to continue.

“This case concerns only standing, not the merits,” Kavanaugh wrote. “EPA and California may or may not prevail on the merits in defending EPA’s approval of the California regulations. But the justiciability of the fuel producers’ challenge to EPA’s approval of the California regulations is evident.”

Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, two of the court’s three Democratic-appointed justices, dissented.

The Clean Air Act generally preempts state laws that regulate motor vehicle emissions, but it allows the EPA to issue a waiver for California — and only California.

The EPA granted such a waiver in 2013, but during President Trump’s first term his administration partially withdraw it. Once former President Biden arrived at the White House, his EPA reinstated the waiver, putting the stricter emissions standards back in play.

A group of producers of gasoline and other liquid fuels sued, arguing California’s regulations reduce the manufacturing of gas-powered cars, which would cause a hit to the fuel producers’ sales.

But the EPA and California argue the producers have no legal standing, which requires showing that a favorable court ruling would redress a plaintiff’s injury. The EPA contended that consumer demand for electric cars would exceed California’s mandate, anyway, so the regulations no longer have impact.

The Supreme Court’s decision rejects that notion, reversing a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit that tossed the lawsuit.

“If invalidating the regulations would change nothing in the market, why are EPA and California enforcing and defending the regulations?” Kavanaugh wrote for the majority.

“The whole point of the regulations is to increase the number of electric vehicles in the new automobile market beyond what consumers would otherwise demand and what automakers would otherwise manufacture and sell,” he added.

In separate dissents, Sotomayor and Jackson said they would’ve sided with the EPA and California and noted the case may become moot.

“I see no need to expound on the law of standing in a case where the sole dispute is a factual one not addressed below,” Sotomayor wrote, saying she would’ve sent the case back to the lower court for another look.

In her separate dissent, Jackson was more forceful, saying her colleagues weren’t applying the courts’ standing doctrine evenhandedly, warning it may contribute to an erosion of public trust in judges.

“This case gives fodder to the unfortunate perception that moneyed interests enjoy an easier road to relief in this Court than ordinary citizens. Because the Court had ample opportunity to avoid that result, I respectfully dissent,” Jackson wrote.",https://cbs4indy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2025/06/cars_california_ap_0824-e1661375582392.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-20 22:04:33.613563

The state Utilities Commission, which regulates rates and services for public utilities, already has pushed back the 2030 deadline — as the 2021 law allows — by at least four years.
The panel acknowledged last year it was ""no longer reasonable or executable"" for Duke Energy to meet the reduction standard by 2030.
They say the interim goal still holds an aspirational purpose and was something that Duke Energy had agreed in 2021 to meet.
Bill support came from the North Carolina Chamber and a manufacturers' group, in addition to Duke Energy.","North Carolina legislators finalized a bill Thursday that would eliminate an interim greenhouse gas reduction mandate set in a landmark 2021 law, while still directing regulators to aim to cancel out power plant carbon emissions in the state within the next 25 years.

With some bipartisan support, the state Senate voted to accept the House version that would repeal the 2021 law's requirement that electric regulators take ""all reasonable steps to achieve"" reducing carbon dioxide output 70% from 2005 levels by 2030. The law's directive to take similar steps to meet a carbon neutrality standard by 2050 would remain in place.

The bill's Republican supporters pushing the new measure say getting rid of the interim goal benefits ratepayers asked to pay for future electric-production construction and is more efficient for Duke Energy, the state's dominant electric utility.

The bill now goes to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, who can veto the measure, sign it or let it become law without his signature. Stein previously expressed concerns about the Senate version of the measure, worried that it could hurt electricity users and threaten the state's clean-energy economy. His office didn't immediately provide comment after Thursday's vote.

With over a dozen House and Senate Democrats voting for the final version, the chances that any Stein veto could be overridden are higher. Republicans in charge of the General Assembly are only one House seat shy of a veto-proof majority.

The bill also contains language that would help Duke Energy seek higher electric rates to cover financing costs to build nuclear or gas-powered plants incrementally, rather than wait until the project's end.

The 2021 greenhouse gas law marked a rare agreement on environmental issues by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Republican lawmakers.

At least 17 other states — most controlled by Democrats — have laws setting similar net-zero power plant emissions or 100% renewable energy targets, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. North Carolina and Virginia are the only ones from the Southeast.

The legislation came about as President Donald Trump's administration has proposed rolling back federal environmental and climate change policies, which critics say could boost pollution and threaten human health. Republicans are promoting them as ways to reduce the cost of living and boost the economy.

The state Utilities Commission, which regulates rates and services for public utilities, already has pushed back the 2030 deadline — as the 2021 law allows — by at least four years. The panel acknowledged last year it was ""no longer reasonable or executable"" for Duke Energy to meet the reduction standard by 2030.

Bill supporters say to meet the goal would require expensive types of alternate energy immediately. If the interim standard can be bypassed, GOP bill authors say, Duke Energy can assemble less expensive power sources now and moderate electricity rate increases necessary to reach the 2050 standard.

""Our residents shouldn't be saddled with higher power bills to satisfy arbitrary targets,"" Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said in a news release after the vote.

Citing an analysis performed by a state agency that represents consumers before the commission, GOP lawmakers say removing the interim goal would reduce by at least $13 billion what Duke Energy would have to spend — and pass on to customers — in the next 25 years.

Bill opponents question the savings figure given uncertainty in plant fuel prices, energy demand and construction costs. They say the interim goal still holds an aspirational purpose and was something that Duke Energy had agreed in 2021 to meet.

Provisions in the measure related to recouping plant construction expenses over time would reduce accumulated borrowing interest.

Environmental groups argue the financing option would benefit Duke Energy's bottom line on expensive projects even if they're never completed, and the bill broadly would prevent cleaner energy sources from coming online sooner. They also contend another bill section would shift costs to residential customers.

""This bill is bad for all North Carolinians, whether they're Duke Energy customers or simply people who want to breathe clean air,"" North Carolina Sierra Club director Chris Herndon said after the vote while urging Stein to veto the measure.

Bill support came from the North Carolina Chamber and a manufacturers' group, in addition to Duke Energy.

""We appreciate bipartisan efforts by policymakers to keep costs as low as possible for customers and enable the always-on energy resources our communities need,"" the company said this week.",https://wfdd-live.s3.amazonaws.com/styles/featured_card/s3/2025-06/AP25170680520513.jpg?h=cfd4cd81&itok=0-HbDp2H,N,,2025-06-20 18:11:11.291381

Republicans’ reconciliation bill sunsets critical tax incentives and programs for the energy sector that have helped create hundreds of thousands of jobs and lowered energy costs for hardworking families.

“Clean energy investments were creating hundreds of thousands of high-quality careers that people could build their families around, lowering energy costs, and generating an American manufacturing renaissance. Rather than build on our progress, Republicans are working to kill the very programs that are helping Americans get ahead. Their attacks are creating chaos for businesses, threatening jobs, and slowing the progress Americans are seeing in their communities,” said Ranking Member Heinrich.

Heinrich continued, “Let’s be clear: Republicans are willing to throw their own constituents under the bus just to pad the pockets of billionaire friends and donors. We cannot afford to let them succeed. If you care about lower energy bills, good jobs, and a better future, now is the time to speak up. Make your voice heard. Call your elected officials. Let them know what’s at stake for you if President Trump and Congressional Republicans get their way.”

Volvo said, ""The software remedy is available now via retailer workshops and has been rolled out via over-the-air update.

Volvo has received a ""small number"" of complaints from customers, and there has thankfully only been one accident related to the malfunction, with no injuries being reported. As our friends at InsideEVs reported, ""The problematic software version that caused this recall, 3.5.14, was released in April but could only be installed at dealerships, and not as an over-the-air update.

The latest software update for Volvos with an Android Automotive OS (AAOS version 3.6.4) was released on June 16, so many affected models may already have the new software uploaded if they're connected to wifi. Owners can take their vehicles into a Volvo dealer for the software update as well. Though it's rare to see such a potentially dangerous malfunction coming from safety-conscious Volvo, but the brand did recall over 2.1 million cars for potentially faulty seatbelts in 2020, and most recently it recalled nearly 7,500 of its plug-in hybrid vehicles in March due to a potential fire risk when owners were charging their PHEVs up.

The House version allows people who do not itemize their taxes to deduct $150 for individuals and $300 for joint filers like married couples. But the Senate version would allow $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for joint filers.

Typically, people need to choose to itemize their taxes to receive the charitable contribution deduction. The rare exception came during the Covid-19 pandemic.

But 9 out of 10 Americans use the standard deduction, meaning the $2,000 tax break could come to most Americans.

“This could provide some tax savings for folks,” Erica York of the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank, told CNBC. “That could be something unexpected if you’re not currently deducting charitable giving.”

The Senate is currently debating its version of the “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” as Trump requested Republicans to name it. In addition to the charitable deduction, Republicans hope to extend the 2017 tax cuts that Trump signed during his first tenure in the White House, boost up money for the military, military spending and oil production in the United States.

But Republicans remain split on a number of aspects of the bill, including its changes to Medicaid. Fiscal conservatives also say that the bill does not do enough to slash federal spending.

Earlier this week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released its dynamic estimate and it found that it would increase the deficit by $3.4 trillion.

Other Republicans want to keep the renewable energy tax credits that then-President Joe Biden put into place in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act because many Republican states benefited from the law.

Republicans have only 53 seats in the Senate. To sidestep a filibuster, they plan to use a process called budget reconciliation, which allows them to pass legislation with a simple majority as long as it relates to federal spending and taxes.

Currently, the legislation is undergoing the “Byrd Bath,” wherein Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough, a career Senate employee, evaluates whether the legislation follows the rules of budget reconciliation and none of the parts of the bill are “merely incidental” to the budget.

QS Energy, Inc. (OTCQB:QSEP), a leader in crude oil transport technology, has received a major order to deploy its Applied Oil Technology (AOT) across Southeast Asia and Africa. This marks a breakthrough moment for QS Energy and supports global efforts to modernize and decarbonize crude infrastructure.

DELIVERING ON A PROMISE OF INNOVATION AND SUCCESS

This initial order of five (5) AOT units launches a broader multi-phase deployment under a government-backed program with VIPS Petroleum. Valued at $25 million with the estimated expected full payment in this quarter, this order kicks off up to a $2 Billion 400-unit framework for South East Asia and Africa. The remaining 395 units will be delivered in milestone-based phases with a 50/25/25 payment structure, ensuring strong cash flow for QS Energy, commencing in Q3 and Q4 2025. AOT’s proven results helped open doors with energy ministries and national oil companies. This deal is made possible by VIPS Petroleum, QS Energy’s exclusive regional distributor contracted in 2024.

Cecil Bond Kyte, CEO of QS Energy, stated: “This order proves our technology’s readiness to transform crude transport. With VIPS and the support of ministries and operators, we’re setting a new global standard for efficiency and sustainability.”

THE TECHNOLOGY TRANSFORMING CRUDE TRANSPORT

Independently validated through peer-reviewed studies, field trials, and Temple University testing, AOT tackles one of the industry’s oldest problems-how to move oil more efficiently. Since the days of Rockefeller’s Standard Oil, the sector has battled viscosity, drag, and energy loss. AOT reduces viscosity by 10% or more using electric fields, lowering pump pressure and energy costs. Built for tough, continuous operation, each unit undergoes strict testing to ensure long-term performance.

MADE IN AMERICA, BUILT FOR THE WORLD

QS Energy proudly designs and manufactures AOT systems in the U.S., powered by American workers. Our partners include:

Industrial Screen and Maintenance, a manufacturer with 56+ years of experience

Precision Urethane, a family business – urethane leader for 55+ years

ReadyFlo, a turnkey ASME pressure vessel specialist

Forward-MFG, experts in custom electronics and sensors

Their dedication helped make this historic deal possible.

EXPANDING GLOBAL PARTNERSHIPS AND FINANCING

This agreement positions Southeast Asia and Africa as leaders in modern crude transport and job creation. The success of this model is driving expansion talks with Australia, the Middle East, and other regions. QS Energy and VIPS Petroleum are finalizing additional deals to replicate this structure and broaden AOT deployment globally.

SECURE IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPLIANCE

QS Energy is committed to full transparency through regular updates and strict compliance with U.S., Southeast Asian, and African standards. The program is backed by milestone payments and top-tier financial guarantees, minimizing risk. Lessons from past deployments guide a robust execution plan to ensure every phase meets deadlines and quality benchmarks.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

QS Energy will earn a share of incremental barrels gained through AOT-enabled flow increases, creating long-term performance-based revenue.

LOOKING AHEAD

With deployment underway, QS Energy is focused on accelerating its role in the energy transition. AOT’s cost savings and environmental benefits position it for major global impact.

It's worth noting that this does not save the federal tax credits, as those are categorized as budgetary.
The parliamentarian's recommendation only pertains to the EPA's emissions rules.
If you keep the emissions rules (the “sticks”) but remove the tax credits (the “carrots”), it would create somewhat of an imbalance.
The rules were far from what the Trump administration labeled as an ""EV mandate.""","The Trump administration's efforts to repeal the Biden-era electric-vehicle rules just ran into a wall in the Senate.

The Senate Parliamentarian—which is the Senate's top rules expert—said on Friday that removing the emissions rules don't count as a tax or spending issue and hence they can't be included in the budget reconciliation bill. The news was first reported by the Detroit Free Press.

“Tonight, the Senate Parliamentarian advised that certain provisions in the Republicans’ One Big, Beautiful Betrayal will be subject to the Byrd Rule—ultimately meaning they will need to be stripped from the bill to ensure it complies with the rules of reconciliation,"" Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley said in a press release. The ""Byrd Rule"" requires reconciliation bills in the Senate to remain focused on budgetary issues, not policy-related ones.

In simple terms, if the Senate wants to repeal the emissions rules, it will need a 60-vote majority, which Republicans currently don't have. The emissions rules require automakers to gradually increase the share of electric and hybrid vehicles as a part of their overall new vehicle sales model year 2027 onwards. The Senate can reject the parliamentarian's recommendation, but some members have already ruled out doing so.

That means getting rid of the ""EV mandate,"" something Trump heavily campaigned on during his presidential run last year, is turning out to be far more complicated than once thought. Republicans currently have a 53-47 majority in the Senate, far short of the 60-vote majority required to repeal the emissions rules.

It's worth noting that this does not save the federal tax credits, as those are categorized as budgetary. The parliamentarian's recommendation only pertains to the EPA's emissions rules.

But this could turn out to be counterintuitive. If you keep the emissions rules (the “sticks”) but remove the tax credits (the “carrots”), it would create somewhat of an imbalance. Without incentives to help consumers afford EVs, the strict emissions regulations on automakers could become harder to achieve.

That said, the EPA under the Biden administration passed in March 2024 its multi-pollutant emissions standards. It recommended automakers to sell a higher percentage of electric and hybrid vehicles from model year 2027 onwards.

The rules were far from what the Trump administration labeled as an ""EV mandate."" There EPA recommended automakers to sell 30-56% EVs and the overall mix could also include hybrids and plug-in hybrids. The standards, if they remain in place, will save billions of metric tons of carbon dioxide and other harmful gases from entering the atmosphere, the EPA has said.

Although the EPA is now reconsidering the rules to potentially repeal and replace them with looser emissions requirements. But that process could take months if not years.

The Trump administration wants to rescind the current EPA rules, amid its other anti-EV policies like ending the federal consumer and manufacturing tax credits for EVs and other clean energy programs. We'll keep an eye on what happens to the tax credits, but the emissions rules are certainly turning out harder to repeal that once thought.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/y23vzK/s1/ev-mandate.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 15:08:50.272180

ArcelorMittal also canceled a decarbonisation project in the city of Eisenhüttenstatt in the state of Brandenburg.
“Germany’s and Europe’s standing as an industry location must not be put at risk,” he warned.
“Meanwhile, the European steel market is under unprecedented pressure due to weak demand and high imports,” said ArcelorMittal.","Steelmaker ArcelorMittal's withdrawal from the planned climate-friendly conversion of two plants in Germany puts the future of its steelworks in the country at risk, unions warned in a report by news magazine Der Spiegel. The metalworker's Union (IG Metall) said the decision was a ""serious threat"" to the future of ArcelorMittal's plant in Bremen.

""The rejection of the direct reduction plant was already apparent, but the announcement that no electric arc furnace will be built in Bremen for the time being has shaken the company's credibility"" among its workforce, policymakers, and citizens, the union said. Ines Schwerdtner, who heads the leftwing party Die Linke, called the decision ""an alarm signal"" for Germany as an industry location, given that ""without transformation, there is no future viability.""

ArcelorMittal also canceled a decarbonisation project in the city of Eisenhüttenstatt in the state of Brandenburg. The state’s economy minister Daniel Keller from the Social Democrats (SPD) said “it’s necessary for the EU to better protect the European steel market from cheap imports with much lower environmental standards and to find an adequate response to tariff policies of the US.” State premier Dietmar Woidke, also a Social Democrat, said his government would do “everything” to protect jobs, given that the steelworks are the ""heart and backbone"" of the region's economy. “Germany’s and Europe’s standing as an industry location must not be put at risk,” he warned.

The Luxembourg-based steelmaker on Thursday announced it would drop plans for converting two plants in the country, in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt, to carbon-neutral production, arguing that energy costs in Germany were too high to allow for profitable operations. “Meanwhile, the European steel market is under unprecedented pressure due to weak demand and high imports,” said ArcelorMittal. The projects were supposed to receive state funding of roughly 1.3 billion euros, but the company said that the conditions and deadlines tied to the funding were too tight for it to be viable.

The German economy ministry told Der Spiegel that no money had been paid out yet and the company therefore would not have to pay anything back. It added that the implementation of other projects for decarbonising steel production by the companies Salzgitter, Thyssenkrupp and SHS with a total volume of about 5.6 billion euros had already started.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-06-20 15:08:14.500578

Ultimately, Birtwell said he expects thousands of people will take up Electrify Expo on the offer.","Electrify Expo, which has spent the last five years putting on festivals across the U.S. to educate people about electric vehicles, is launching a demo experience where people can take an EV home for a weekend. The first company to partner up is Tesla, and Electrify Expo CEO BJ Birtwell says more brands will come on board in the near future.

“It’s an opportunity for our attendees at Electrify Expo to have a no-pressure, non-sales-y experience with an electric vehicle on their terms, running errands and fitting this vehicle into their lives to see if it actually makes sense for them or not,” Birtwell told TechCrunch in an interview.

Driving an electric vehicle for the first time can often convince people to make the jump from internal combustion engines. There’s also strong demand for these kinds of experiences. Late last year, Consumer Reports found that half of all consumers in the U.S. are interested in test-driving an EV.

The new “Electrify Weekender” experience will be available to Electrify Expo attendees (who also need a driver’s license and auto insurance) starting with the Los Angeles festival, which begins on June 21. Birtwell said he hopes to use the Los Angeles launch as an opportunity to iron out any problems ahead of the other festivals this year in Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and Dallas.

For Tesla, the Electrify Weekender program could be a way to reach potential customers who may still be unfamiliar with or even wary of the brand — perhaps offering a boost at a time when the company’s sales are flagging due to an aging lineup, increased competition, and the damage CEO Elon Musk has done to his company’s image. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about the program.

Birtwell said the Electrify Weekender program is a natural extension of the kinds of EV demos his festival has been offering for years. While those demos are brief — often lasting around 8 to 10 minutes — he said they have played an important role in converting attendees into EV buyers.

“People who are buying a ticket to come to our festival are often cross-shopping a bunch of different electric cars and trucks, like they’re literally coming to our event as if we are the 2.0 version of an auto mall,” he said. “Then they’re getting into all these cars and figuring out what they want to buy. So that experience alone helps people who are really loaded low in the purchase funnel to experience to convert.”

Car companies have long offered similar extended test drive programs, but Birtwell said those often leave interested buyers feeling pressure from their local dealership to make a purchase. He expects Electrify Expo to act as an intermediary of sorts that can blunt that pressure, while also attracting consumers who may not have ever signed up for such a test drive to begin with. Ultimately, Birtwell said he expects thousands of people will take up Electrify Expo on the offer.

“If we’re going to drive broader EV adoption beyond half the population, that means we need to appeal to everybody,” he said. That means especially targeting consumers who are “curious and skeptical about EVs.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/electrify-expo-weekender-1.jpg?resize=1200,800",N,,2025-06-20 15:08:52.789329

The Senate parliamentarian ruled the provision doesn't qualify for a simple majority vote under reconciliation rules.

Republicans lack the 60 Senate votes needed to overcome a filibuster and pass the provision separately.

President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" that focuses largely on tax cuts and spending may not include a provision to get rid of what he has derided as former President Joe Biden's electric vehicle mandate, after all.

The Senate parliamentarian's office advised the Budget Committee on June 19 that the provision to get rid of the Biden era standards does not meet the chamber's rules qualifying it for an up-or-down simple majority vote in the 100-member Senate if and when it comes up for a vote.

Senate rules require that measures included in so-called reconciliation bills such as this one generally deal with government revenues and outlays in order to qualify for a simple majority vote. Otherwise, a 60-vote threshold must be crossed in order to close debate on a measure ahead of a final vote.

Senators could vote to reject the parliamentarian's recommendation but Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, has already ruled out doing so. Such a move could appear to violate a precedent some more moderate Republicans don't want to breach and give Democrats an issue to campaign on.

As such, the measure getting rid of the ""EV mandate,"" that Trump campaigned against will likely need to be stripped out of the wide-ranging tax cut and spending reduction bill, or require a separate vote. Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the chamber, well short of the 60 they would need to approve legislation reversing the emissions rule.

The Senate parliamentarian heads a nonpartisan staff that gives advice to the chamber on adherence to its own rules and is appointed by the Senate majority leader. The current parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, has served in the role since 2012 under both Democratic and Republican majority leaders.

In March 2024, the Biden administration adopted greenhouse gas emission standards so tough they could have, if followed through on, effectively required two-thirds of all new cars and light-duty trucks sold by 2032 to be electric vehicles, or EVs, or automakers would face hefty fines. It's a separate policy from another set of emission standards approved by the Biden administration for California and some other states that follow its lead under Clean Air Act regulations that want to ban the sale of new gas-powered vehicles altogether in those states by 2035.

Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress have also moved to reverse that waiver granted to California and other states to block the sale of new gasoline-powered cars, trucks and sport-utility vehicles, though that appears destined to be settled by a court.

The U.S. House already passed its version of the reconciliation bill, which included a repeal of the more wide-ranging federal EV rules. Trump and congressional Republicans want the reconciliation bill, which increases the nation's debt limit, extends and expands tax cuts, and includes reductions to spending on programs including Medicaid and what were previously known as food stamps by billions, as soon as possible.

MacDonough and her staff continue to review the bill to determine which parts of it don't meet requirements for a simple majority vote.

Even though Trump and Republicans have called the Biden rules a ""mandate,"" as if they were certain to go into effect and require that two-thirds of all new cars sold be EVs, as a practical matter, presidential administrations have regularly reversed emission standards upon taking office and automakers had made it clear that the 2032 target would be difficult if not impossible to reach.

Trump, upon taking office, issued an executive order he said ended the EV mandate but his administration cannot do so unilaterally without either getting legislation passed by Congress, as was proposed in what the president refers to as his ""big beautiful bill,"" or through a more lengthy rule-making process,

In March of this year, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin kicked off that process by announcing that the Biden era standards would be reconsidered.

Trump and Republicans have repeatedly claimed that the EV mandate forces Americans to buy vehicles that are more expensive and less convenient than those powered by internal combustion engines, although it does not, though the rules clearly were intended to push automakers to sell more EVs or develop other technology to cut greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.

Legislation that Republicans are trying to pass by the Fourth of July would end a slew of popular consumer tax breaks tied to clean energy, leading some experts to call on households to act now to collect the savings.

Many tax breaks on the chopping block were created, extended or enhanced by the Inflation Reduction Act, a 2022 law signed by former President Joe Biden that provided a historic U.S. investment to fight climate change.

Senate version of 'big beautiful' bill calls for $6,000 senior 'bonus'

The Senate may vote on its measure, part of a broader package of domestic policy initiatives, as soon as next week. The House passed its version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in May.

Both bills would eliminate tax credits for households that buy or lease electric vehicles, or that make their homes more energy efficient.

""The intention of Republicans writing the bill is to root out all of the incentives from moving away from fossil fuels that the Biden administration puts in place, and it's just a question of timeline,"" said Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.

GOP set to end many clean energy tax breaks in 2026

Republicans would use money from the clean energy tax breaks — as well as cuts to food assistance and healthcare programs like Medicaid — to help pay for a broader multitrillion-dollar package of tax cuts for households and businesses, among other policy priorities.

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" which House Republicans passed in May, would end a tax credit of up to $7,500 for qualifying households that buy a new electric vehicle and a $4,000 credit for those who buy a used EV.

It would also end a separate tax incentive that allowed car dealers to pass along a $7,500 credit to consumers who lease an electric vehicle.

Additionally, the House bill would end the energy efficient home improvement credit (also known as the 25C credit) and residential clean energy credit (the 25D credit), which help consumers defray the cost of projects like installing insulation, solar panels, heat pumps, and installing energy-efficient windows and doors.

With few exceptions, these tax breaks would disappear in 2026, about seven years earlier than under current law, which makes them available through 2032.

Senate Republicans, who haven't yet passed their version of the legislation, would end these tax breaks under a similar timeline.

For example, the tax credit for used EVs would end 90 days after the law's enactment. The credits for new and leased EVs, as well as the ones tied to energy efficiency, would disappear after 180 days.

Advocates for preserving the tax credits argue that getting rid of the tax breaks would raise monthly bills for U.S. households and businesses.

A group of 21 House GOP lawmakers in March expressed support for preserving clean energy tax credits, in a letter to Rep. Jason Smith, R-MO, chairman of the House Ways and Means tax-writing committee.

""As our conference works to make energy prices more affordable, tax reforms that would raise energy costs for hard working Americans would be contrary to this goal,"" they wrote.

Consumers who want to ensure they get a federal tax break for buying an EV or undergoing an energy-efficiency home project should act soon, according to experts.

""Based on the existing proposed language, if you've been considering an EV or planning to get one, now is the time to do it,"" Alexia Melendez Martineau, senior policy manager at Plug In America, told CNBC recently.

The House version allows people who do not itemize their taxes to deduct $150 for individuals and $300 for joint filers like married couples. But the Senate version would allow $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for joint filers.

Typically, people need to choose to itemize their taxes to receive the charitable contribution deduction. The rare exception came during the Covid-19 pandemic.

But 9 out of 10 Americans use the standard deduction, meaning the $2,000 tax break could come to most Americans.

“This could provide some tax savings for folks,” Erica York of the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank, told CNBC. “That could be something unexpected if you’re not currently deducting charitable giving.”

The Senate is currently debating its version of the “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” as Trump requested Republicans to name it. In addition to the charitable deduction, Republicans hope to extend the 2017 tax cuts that Trump signed during his first tenure in the White House, boost up money for the military, military spending and oil production in the United States.

But Republicans remain split on a number of aspects of the bill, including its changes to Medicaid. Fiscal conservatives also say that the bill does not do enough to slash federal spending.

Earlier this week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released its dynamic estimate and it found that it would increase the deficit by $3.4 trillion.

Other Republicans want to keep the renewable energy tax credits that then-President Joe Biden put into place in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act because many Republican states benefited from the law.

Republicans have only 53 seats in the Senate. To sidestep a filibuster, they plan to use a process called budget reconciliation, which allows them to pass legislation with a simple majority as long as it relates to federal spending and taxes.

The BMW i3 and Chevy Volt were both relatively slow sellers, but we really shouldn’t draw any conclusions from that.
But PHEVs are not the same, and as I’ve written, their limited EV range has held them back.","The U.S. market has seen Extended Range Electric Vehicles (EREVs) before. The BMW i3 was technically the first, though many consider the Chevy Volt the pioneer of the general concept. That concept being: You drive in electric mode until the battery dies, then a gas engine-generator charges the battery so you can go farther. But despite these two having existed in the U.S. market, we still have no idea how America is going to react to EREVs, which is wild to think about given that yet another automaker is looking to head that route according to a new report.

I was recently on a call with Bank of America’s senior analyst John Murphy, who was explaining to a group of journalists the contents of the company’s latest annual “Car Wars” market report. At the end of the call, I asked Murphy what his thoughts are on EREVs. Here’s what he replied:

“I think it’s an odd setup for a powertrain. I certainly think in some use cases — pickups and large SUVs, but in general I don’t think it’s going to become that pervasive.”

I’m not saying I think Murphy is wrong, but it seems to me that, at this point, it’s hard to know what’s going to happen. To be completely fair, I wrote “The Future Of The Auto Industry Is Electric, With A Gasoline Backup,” so I, too, am making guesses about how well the technology will do, but I have to admit that I just don’t know for sure.

What I do know is that the technology is awesome to live with day-to-day; I’ve been driving a BMW i3 Range Extender for years now, and it’s simply amazing. The reality is that America’s EV infrastructure isn’t good enough, and that people don’t want low-range EVs. As Murphy said on the all “[EV Range anxiety] is very real.” A Range Extender is a way to solve both problems without jamming a heavy, expensive battery under the floor.

I’m not the only one saying this; lots of automakers are heading down the EREV path. And I mean lots. Ford, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Jeep, Lotus, Scout, Ram and now BMW have indicated interest in bringing EREV technology to the marketplace.

I say “now” BMW, because there’s a new report from Automobilewoche that states that BMW — once the authority when it came to EREVs – has changed its mind on EREVs. From Automotive News:

BMW plans to revive its range extender technology, starting with a variant of the iX5 SUV, which is already in testing and could arrive in 2026, according to a report in Automotive News Europe sibling publication Automobilwoche.

The news signals a shift for BMW. In 2019 a leading executive was quoted as saying that there was “no future” for range extenders.

The comment came as BMW was looking to shift beyond its i3, which was offered as either a full-electric model or with a range extender in the early days of the transition to vehicles powered only by electricity. The aim of offering the system was to ease range anxiety.

The world watches as the Ram Ramcharger is expected to become the first EREV to enter the U.S. market since the BMW i3 bowed out in 2021. But the question is: How will it fare?

The BMW i3 and Chevy Volt were both relatively slow sellers, but we really shouldn’t draw any conclusions from that. Not only were these two vehicles part of a market segment that America just doesn’t care about anymore (small cars), but because they’re small cars they don’t really stand to benefit as much from EREV technology. Let’s be honest: The Volt and i3 would have probably been 40 MPG cars had they been powered solely by gas.

But as Murphy mentioned: Trucks and SUVs are a different ballgame. Getting an 18 MPG pickup truck to drive on electric power while offering significantly improved acceleration, plus plenty of range for towing — that’s a massive improvement for the buyer.

But at what cost?

That’s really the big question here. If I can buy a gasoline SUV for $40 grand, and — especially if EV tax credits go away as it seems they might — I have to spend $60 grand for an equivalent EREV, what’s the value to me as a consumer? Gasoline is fairly cheap, so it could take over a decade to make up $20 grand in fuel costs. Maintenance costs will help fill the gap, but it’ll take time, and I’m not sure any consumers think that far out. They want the car to bring them value now.

EREVs do promise to offer a cost advantage over full BEVs with similar capabilities (particularly in truck/SUV applications), so I can absolutely see them appealing to those who are already on the fence about buying a BEV. But will automakers actually price them below BEVs? I spoke with a Ram representative who said it’s possible they will price their EREV higher because technically it offers more performance than the BEV (basically, an EREV truck offers EV acceleration with gasoline truck-range: The best of all worlds — with maintenance being significantly less than a regular gas truck). I think not leveraging EV’s potential cost-savings over a BEV would be a mistake.

Then there’s the whole marketing element. EV diehards think EREVs are bad simply because they involve some amount of reliance on gasoline, and gasoline diehards basically just see EREVs as EVs (so many folks in the comments of Scout’s EREV social media posts say “This is cool, but too bad it’s electric!”). It will be challenging to solve that. Add to that the fact that “EREV” is just not sexy at all, and you’ve got a product with an uphill marketing battle. I’ve written about this before:

The term “EREV” needs to be out of the equation. It’s a jargon-y term, and it will not resonate with the public. I won’t pretend to know what the answer is exactly, but I’ve come up with a few fun terms. “Long-range plug-in hybrid” is one option. “Gasoline-Assisted EV” is another. The common thread between these two is: I don’t think shying away from the fact that gasoline is involved is the move. I think many people find comfort in gasoline propulsion, and using a name that implies there’s gasoline is a good thing.

We can look at the success of EREVs in China, but I don’t think we really have a great analog right now that helps us understand how EREVs are going to do stateside. Maybe we can look at plug-in hybrids? But PHEVs are not the same, and as I’ve written, their limited EV range has held them back. Toyota is still heading down the PHEV path, but it’s planning to crank up the range, per CNBC:

“We are going to grow our PHEV volume through the lineup over the next few years,” David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, told CNBC during a visit to the company’s North American headquarters. “We love the PHEV powertrain. We’re working to increase, perpetually increase, the amount of miles you can drive on EV-only range.”

Company sources said Toyota plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume last year to roughly 20% by 2030. However, they said that could change based on regulations, customer acceptance of electrified technologies and affordability, among other factors.

Toyota has been right about a lot of things, so I could see higher-range PHEVs catching on, and if so, I could see EREVs doing the same. But there are just so many factors in play — fuel prices, EV incentives, marketing, product execution, infrastructure developments, MSRPs and on and on.

With so many factors in play, it just makes it that much more important for automakers to make a great product. Build an excellent vehicle that meets customers’ needs and exceeds their expectations, at a price that they feel is competitive with vehicles that offer similar performance, and I believe it will sell. All this potential confusion about how EREVs work and infrastructure implications and EV incentives and cost savings over gas cars and on and on can largely be thrown out the window if you can get the world to think your vehicle is extremely badass and a good value.

I’m rooting for EREVs solely because I want others to experience the unmatched combination of EV performance and gasoline convenience that I get to enjoy everyday while driving my BMW i3. But in truth, I don’t know how it’s going to shake out; I don’t think anyone really knows at this point.

In a 7-2 decision authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court ruled fuel producers have legal standing to sue over California’s clean car standards approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), allowing the challenge to continue.

“This case concerns only standing, not the merits,” Kavanaugh wrote. “EPA and California may or may not prevail on the merits in defending EPA’s approval of the California regulations. But the justiciability of the fuel producers’ challenge to EPA’s approval of the California regulations is evident.”

Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, two of the court’s three Democratic-appointed justices, dissented.

The Clean Air Act generally preempts state laws that regulate motor vehicle emissions, but it allows the EPA to issue a waiver for California — and only California.

The EPA granted such a waiver in 2013, but during President Trump’s first term his administration partially withdraw it. Once former President Biden arrived at the White House, his EPA reinstated the waiver, putting the stricter emissions standards back in play.

A group of producers of gasoline and other liquid fuels sued, arguing California’s regulations reduce the manufacturing of gas-powered cars, which would cause a hit to the fuel producers’ sales.

But the EPA and California argue the producers have no legal standing, which requires showing that a favorable court ruling would redress a plaintiff’s injury. The EPA contended that consumer demand for electric cars would exceed California’s mandate, anyway, so the regulations no longer have impact.

The Supreme Court’s decision rejects that notion, reversing a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit that tossed the lawsuit.

“If invalidating the regulations would change nothing in the market, why are EPA and California enforcing and defending the regulations?” Kavanaugh wrote for the majority.

“The whole point of the regulations is to increase the number of electric vehicles in the new automobile market beyond what consumers would otherwise demand and what automakers would otherwise manufacture and sell,” he added.

In separate dissents, Sotomayor and Jackson said they would’ve sided with the EPA and California and noted the case may become moot.

“I see no need to expound on the law of standing in a case where the sole dispute is a factual one not addressed below,” Sotomayor wrote, saying she would’ve sent the case back to the lower court for another look.

In her separate dissent, Jackson was more forceful, saying her colleagues weren’t applying the courts’ standing doctrine evenhandedly, warning it may contribute to an erosion of public trust in judges.

Most significantly, EPA has proposed the repeal of a standard for emissions of filterable particulate matter from coal-fired EGUs.
Filterable particulate matter is a surrogate measure for all metallic hazardous air pollutants (excluding mercury) emitted by coal-fired EGUs.

The cost for facilities to comply with the filterable particulate matter emission limit.","Earlier this year we blogged about how the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provided exemptions from several National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) that became effective in 2024.

We even predicted that the exemptions were a prelude to those NESHAPs being repealed.

Unfortunately, sometimes our predictions come true.

The EPA on June 17 published a proposed rule that would repeal amendments that were made in 2024 to strengthen NESHAPs for coal-fired electric generating units.

Most significantly, EPA has proposed the repeal of a standard for emissions of filterable particulate matter from coal-fired EGUs. Filterable particulate matter is a surrogate measure for all metallic hazardous air pollutants (excluding mercury) emitted by coal-fired EGUs.

The 2024 NESHAPs reduced the emission limit for filterable particulate matter from coal-fired electric generating units from 0.03 pounds per million BTUs down to 0.01 lbs.

And there will be impacts here in our corner of the Keystone State - there are still five coal-fired EGUs operating in western Pennsylvania.

Each of these facilities would have had to reduce its emissions of filterable particulate matter from 0.03 lbs/MMBtu to 0.01 lbs/MMBtu to meet the emission standard that EPA proposes to repeal.

The basis for the proposed repeal? The cost for facilities to comply with the filterable particulate matter emission limit. EPA can take cost-effectiveness into account when it reviews new control technologies for hazardous air pollutants, as it must every eight years under the Clean Air Act.

In its proposed rule, EPA estimates that the cost of measures required for some plants to comply with the to-be repealed standard is $10.5 million per ton of non-mercury HAPs, which exceeds the EPA’s threshold for cost-effectiveness.

That exceeds the EPA’s threshold for cost-effectiveness, based on proposed emission standards that were rejected in 2015 and 2020: In 2015, EPA determined that emission controls for petroleum refineries that would have removed fPM at the cost of $10 million per ton were not cost effective, and in 2020 EPA determined that emission controls for iron and steel manufacturing facilities that would have removed fPM at the cost of $7 million per ton were not cost effective.

“EPA’s discretion to make determinations like this is pretty much unlimited under the Clean Air Act, and underscores just how important who controls the administrative branch in Washington is to how much pollution is in the air we breathe,” said GASP’s Senior Attorney John Baillie.

As part of its proposed rule EPA is also asking to repeal a requirement that coal-fired electric generating units demonstrate compliance with the filterable particulate matter emission standard by using a continuous emission monitoring system and a standard for mercury emissions from those that burn lignite (almost all of which are located in the western United States).

EPA is accepting comments on the proposed rule through August 11.

State discounts for purchasing heat pumps, e-bikes and electric cars and trucks will be cut in half next year, Colorado economists announced Wednesday.

The tax credits, some made available just last year, will be slashed in 2026 because of a dismal state revenue forecast, said Emily Dohrman, senior economist for nonpartisan Legislative Council Staff, at the Joint Budget Committee’s quarterly meeting.

Lawmakers enacted the green tax credits in 2023 to make electric transportation and heating and cooling more appealing to Coloradans. But the availability of the credits hinges on state economic forecasts showing at least 4% projected revenue growth in the next fiscal year, or else they are cut by 50%.

Up until recently, it looked like the state’s forecast revenue growth requirement would be reached. Just a few months ago in March, state economists projected the green tax credits would remain fully intact. But since then, “lower collections and a reduction in expectations for the economy” soured the June forecast, Dohrman said. She said revenue is expected to increase only by 2% next year.

The halving of the state incentives paired with Congressional Republicans’ proposal to eliminate federal incentives for electric vehicles as part of their big budget bill would result in far less money available to help Coloradans electrify their homes and transportation.

Transportation and buildings are two of the top greenhouse-gas emitting sectors in Colorado. Proponents of electric vehicles credited the combination of federal and state incentives for a boom in EV sales in Colorado last year.

The state tax credits for electric cars and trucks were scheduled to range between $1,500 and $8,000 for next year, depending on the kind of vehicle. Tax credits for e-bikes were supposed to be $500 ($50 for retailers and $450 for purchasers), and tax credits for heat pumps were scheduled to range between $250 and $2,000, depending on the kind of system. All will be halved.

A $2,500 bonus credit for vehicles with a retail price less than $35,000 will remain intact, as will other incentive programs, like Vehicle Exchange Colorado, which helps income-qualified Coloradans replace their gas cars with electric ones.

Ari Rosenblum, spokesperson for the Colorado Energy Office, which administers the tax credits, said in a statement the office is committed to cost-saving incentives.

“At a moment of increased uncertainty, including with Republicans in Congress attempting to remove long-standing tax credits and initiatives to incentivize clean energy and clean vehicles, we look forward to working with the Colorado General Assembly to continue to lead on the transition to more affordable and cleaner technologies,” Rosenblum said.

GreenLatinos Colorado, a nonprofit Latino environmental advocacy group, pushed for the tax credits and has been working to connect people of color and low-income Coloradans to them.

Ean Thomas Tafoya, state director for GreenLatinos Colorado and vice president of state programs for the group’s national organization, said the planned cut to the tax credits is “incredibly disappointing.”

Halving the credits will leave heat pumps, e-bikes and electric vehicles out of reach for many who are most affected by polluted air, he said, especially from trucking in their neighborhoods.

“These are the communities who are bearing the load every day of logistics,” Tafoya said. “These credits make a difference to their health.”

Other tax credits could be on the chopping block if the economy doesn’t improve this year. A tax credit for employers offering programs aimed at alleviating workforce shortages hinges on a positive September forecast and a tax credit for parents of minor children hinges on a December one.

The dim outlook shows the legislature is likely to have to make at least $700 million in spending cuts to the budget next year relative to its current plans. And that’s without factoring in major cuts to anti-poverty programs being proposed by Republican lawmakers in Washington, D.C., that could upend the state’s current budget.

Members of the JBC said they could adjust the tax credits before next year if the legislature is called into a special session to sort out its current budget. Otherwise, the legislature won’t reconvene until January.

The intent of this legislation is to be proactive with respect to how the supply chain issues are affecting utilities and to identify measures to address those issues as quickly and early as possible.
To the extent issues related to “foreign entities of concern” are raised, the DOE can address those head on.
One supply chain issue impacting grid security that was identified by the energy and transportation security nonprofit organization Securing America’s Future Energy (SAFE) and its Center for Critical Mineral Strategy was the supply of minerals needed for the manufacture of certain component parts.
We will follow the progress the Act makes in its journey to become law and report back.","“The Electric Supply Chain Act would direct the Department of Energy to assess the power generation and transmission supply chains and report to Congress within one year.”

Why this is important: Just as many electric utilities are facing unprecedented load growth in their service territories as a result of data center construction, increased use of electricity by customers’ homes, businesses and vehicles, and population increases – as reflected in recent Integrated Resource Plan and Rate Case filings by utilities in Florida, Georgia, and North and South Carolina – the supply of certain critical component parts needed for grid enhancements has been “grid-locked” or delayed. As a result, the U.S. House Energy Subcommittee passed legislation, supported by Representative Bob Latta of Ohio, that has been passed on to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. If ultimately passed by the U.S. Congress, the Electric Supply Chain Act (Act) would direct the Secretary of the Department of Energy (DOE) to evaluate “any trends, risks, and vulnerabilities in the supply, demand, and availability of components that are necessary for the construction or deployment of facilities that generate or transmit electricity.” The Energy Secretary would then have to submit periodic assessments of the DOE’s evaluations, as well as a report to Congress on its findings within one year of the legislation’s enactment.

The intent of this legislation is to be proactive with respect to how the supply chain issues are affecting utilities and to identify measures to address those issues as quickly and early as possible. This, in turn, is intended to enhance domestic grid reliability. To achieve these goals, the Act allows manufacturers of grid components and supply chain vendors to provide information to the DOE and energy sector as a whole in relation to their own capacities, growth, and shortfalls. To the extent issues related to “foreign entities of concern” are raised, the DOE can address those head on.

One supply chain issue impacting grid security that was identified by the energy and transportation security nonprofit organization Securing America’s Future Energy (SAFE) and its Center for Critical Mineral Strategy was the supply of minerals needed for the manufacture of certain component parts. Some of the critical minerals needed include aluminum, cobalt, copper, electrical steel, fluorine, gallium, graphite, lithium, magnesium, nickel, platinum, silicon, silicon carbide and certain rare earth elements. The Center’s Executive Director Abigail Hunter noted that the Act, if passed, “will unearth supply chain vulnerabilities affecting [the U.S.’s] bulk power system and midstream challenges to process those minerals at home.”

It is likely that, if passed, the Act will generate more domestic production of certain key components, which will support construction of new generation facilities and upgrades to existing facilities. We will follow the progress the Act makes in its journey to become law and report back. --- Stephanie U.

In the proposal, EPA said it was still evaluating how it will address these and future petitions.
This ranges from zero gallons, assuming EPA denies all SRE petitions, to 18 billion gallons if all are granted.","Biofuel, farm and oil groups have been anxiously awaiting the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed Renewable Volume Obligations for fuels, fearing they might once again fall below industry requests.

The Biden administration had missed the Nov. 1 statutory deadline for announcing those targets, leading to a great deal of uncertainty and some biofuel plants to idle.

But in a somewhat surprising turn of events, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s proposal exceeded what many industry leaders had expected.

Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, the agency sets renewable volume obligations for different fuel types like biomass-based diesel, advanced and cellulosic biofuels.

Ahead of the announcement, a coalition of oil, biofuel and farm groups had teamed up to present a unified request that called for a 5.25-billion-gallon volume for biomass-based diesel, a 15-billion-gallon differential for ethanol and 10 billion Renewable Identification Number gallons for overall advanced biofuels.

That coalition included the American Petroleum Institute, National Oilseed Processors Association, Clean Fuels Alliance, Renewable Fuels Association, American Soybean Association, and Growth Energy.

Under the recently announced proposal, the total RVO for 2026 would be 24.02 billion gallons. This includes 15 billion gallons for ethanol, 5.61 billion gallons for biomass-based diesel, 9.02 billion gallons for advanced biofuels and 1.3 billion gallons for cellulosic biofuels.

In 2027, this would increase to a total RVO of 24.46 billion gallons. Ethanol volumes would remain the same, but biomass-based diesel volumes would increase to 5.86 billion gallons.

EPA’s proposal is a major jump from Set 1 RVOs, which put targets for biomass-based diesel at 2.82 billion in 2023, 3.04 billion in 2024 and 3.35 billion in 2025.

“As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Renewable Fuel Standard, the American Soybean Association applauds the work of President Trump, Administrator Zeldin and Secretary Rollins in promoting American energy dominance and strengthening a key domestic market for U.S. soybean farmers,” said Caleb Ragland, ASA president and soybean farmer from Magnolia, Kentucky,in a statement. “The significant increase in proposed volumes for biomass-based diesel will support soybean farmers, soybean processors, and biofuel producers in rural America, and serves as a much-needed win for our communities. We thank the Trump administration for recognizing and supporting this vital value chain for U.S. agriculture.”

Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor was equally enthusiastic, noting the proposed RVOs “secure an economic lifeline for the nation’s farmers and ethanol producers.

“EPA’s proposal will unlock investments, create jobs, and support growth in rural America, expanding renewable fuel production and creating the kind of certainty that spurs innovation and truly unleashes American energy dominance,” Skor said. “Although EPA has yet to project future SREs, we expect that it will ensure that any lost gallons from exemptions will be reallocated to ensure that blending obligations are met. President Trump first proposed a way to account for lost gallons in 2019 and maintaining that approach will protect biofuel producers and their farm partners from demand destruction.

Focus on domestic feedstocks

In addition to the RVO proposal, EPA proposed cutting in half the RINs generated for imported fuels and fuels produced from foreign feedstocks. This could boost competitiveness for domestically produced fuels, or those made with domestic feedstocks like oilseeds and corn.

EPA wrote in the proposal that the new requirement responds to the influx in imported biofuels and feedstocks like used cooking oil. Groups involved in the domestic biofuel supply chain have raised alarm over the increase in UCO and tallow imported from China. They also argue current fuel standards incentivize these imported feedstocks over domestic ones through lower carbon intensity scores.

Both expanding the RVOs and boosting domestic production will send a strong signal to markets, bring stalled capacity back online and encourage additional investment in the oilseed industry, said the National Oilseed Processors Association.

The group also celebrated the raised RVO, and said it reflects the full domestic capabilities of U.S. crushers and biofuel producers.

“These strong volumes and prioritization of U.S. farmers aligns policy with actual domestic production capacity and ensures that American-grown feedstocks remain at the heart of a secure and affordable energy future,” said Devin Mogler, president and CEO of NOPA.

Small refinery exemptions still in question

The first Trump administration granted dozens of small refinery exemptions, which go to facilities where the RFS would cause them undue economic harm. Granting these SREs effectively allowed the administration to trim the volume obligations.

Zeldin previously told lawmakers that he hoped to quickly work through the backlog of SRE petitions. There are currently 161 outstanding petitions, according to EPA.

In the proposal, EPA said it was still evaluating how it will address these and future petitions. In the meantime, EPA provided an estimated range of exempt volumes from SREs for 2026 and 2027. This ranges from zero gallons, assuming EPA denies all SRE petitions, to 18 billion gallons if all are granted.

In response to this provision of the proposal, Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, said RFA understands the agency’s legal obligation to reallocated exempted blending volumes. But the top priority should be maintaining a high standard for evaluating SRE petitions.

“The entire supply chain is seeking certainty regarding EPA’s plans on SREs, and today’s proposal helps to clarify the agency’s approach moving forward,” Cooper said in a statement. “The marketplace needs to be reassured that the RVOs published by EPA are real and will not be watered down or eroded by SREs.”",https://hpj.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SaraWyant.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 14:09:30.372706

On May 23, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued an emergency order demanding that the J.H. Campbell plant “remain available for operation” — just eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down, a plan that has been in place since 2021.

On Wednesday, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a request for rehearing with the DOE, challenging what she described as an “arbitrary and illegal order.”

Energy experts say the cost to keep the plant open beyond its planned closure date could pass along millions in costs to taxpayers.

LANSING — Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has challenged the U.S. Department of Energy’s forcing the Consumers Energy-owned J.H. Campbell plant in Port Sheldon to remain open for 90 days, arguing that the move will force customers to absorb exorbitant costs.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued the emergency order demanding that the plant “remain available for operation” on Friday, May 23 — just eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down, a plan that has been in place since 2021.

The U.S. Department of Energy said the move is intended “to minimize the risk of blackouts and address critical grid security issues in the Midwestern region of the United States ahead of the high electricity demand expected this summer.”

On Wednesday, Nessel filed a request for rehearing with the DOE, challenging what she described as an “arbitrary and illegal order seeking to stop the planned retirement of Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Michigan, under the pretense of a fabricated energy emergency.”

She said the order “will burden Michigan utility customers with unnecessary costs and needless additional pollution from the 60-year-old Ottawa County coal plant that was scheduled to close May 31.”

A request for rehearing is a legal process where a party asks a court to reconsider a decision it has already made. It’s typically used when a party believes the court made a mistake in its initial ruling, whether by overlooking a crucial fact, misinterpreting the law, or making some other error.

The Campbell Plant is Consumers’ last — and largest — coal-fired plant in the state.

The plant, operating since 1962, was originally scheduled to close partially in 2030 and wholly in 2040. But the utility announced in 2021 it was moving the plan up by 15 years for an operations end date of May 31, 2025.

The utility was seeking to end coal use altogether by 2025 as part of its goal to achieve carbon neutrality.

Since the announcement, Consumers has been actively preparing the plant for “full retirement,” a spokesperson said last year.

“The complex will officially go into retirement with an aim to go cold and dark after 2025,” said former Consumers spokesperson Kristen Van Kley. “In 2026 and on, the complex will be demolished with a plan to restore the site over time.”

The plant, when operating at full capacity, can generate 1,450 megawatts of electricity. Michigan consumed about 113,740 gigawatt hours of electricity in 2019, according to a 2020 report from the U.S. Department of Energy.

At the time, Van Kley said new technologies would ensure Consumers would be able to continue supporting the statewide grid.

“Energy efficiency, demand response and emerging technologies such as grid modernization and battery storage will help us lower peak customer demand for electricity and deliver exactly what Michigan needs,” she said. “Our plan is designed to respond to emerging needs, adapt to changing conditions and embrace emerging innovative technologies as we work to achieve net-zero carbon emissions.”

The emergency order came after a yearlong effort from a local grassroots organization petitioned Ottawa County officials to intervene in some way to prevent the closure of the Campbell plant.

Organizers of the “Save the Campbell” effort coalesced at the beginning of 2024 — mainly members of far-right fundamentalist groups such as Ottawa Impact, The Gideon 300 and the Ottawa County GOP — said a government-owned electric co-op was possible if voters approved a “home rule charter” at the ballot box.

The issue was never put up for a vote, so a change in government structure is not forthcoming; however, local officials asked Consumers for reassurance earlier this year that local energy supplies will be uninterrupted as the Campbell plant headed for closure at the end of May.

In February, the Ottawa County Board of Commissioners approved a resolution urging delay in the plant’s closure, however, officials stopped short April 22 of opting to bring litigation to prevent the closure altogether.

Commissioners pointed to two separate reports — from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, as well as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC — that gave them concerns over the energy grid’s reliability once the Campbell is taken offline.

MISO published the results of its annual survey in June 2024, which indicated at the time that there was “a growing capacity deficit beginning in the 2025-26 planning year.”

“Next summer, MISO could see resource sufficiency ranging from a 2.7 GW capacity shortfall to a 1.1 GW surplus, underscoring the need to accelerate resource additions, monitor large load additions, and delay resource retirements to reliably manage the anticipated growth in electricity demand,” according to the survey.

NERC is a nonprofit international regulatory authority that more broadly looks at reliability standards as well as seasonal and long‐term outlooks for the entire U.S. grid. The group published a long-term reliability assessment in December 2024 that labeled MISO’s section of the grid as “high risk,” meaning the grid subsection that includes the state of Michigan “falls below established resource adequacy criteria in the next five years.”

“High-risk areas are likely to experience a shortfall in electricity supplies at the peak of an average summer or winter season. Extreme weather, producing wide-area heat waves or deep-freeze events, poses an even greater threat to reliability,” the report said.

Commissioner Jacob Bonnema questioned why Consumers opted to sunset the plant five years ahead than previously planned.Dena Isabell, stakeholder engagement manager at Consumers, told commissioners in February that Consumers adopted in 2021 that helped the company identify about $600 million in savings for its customers over 20 years with the retirement of the plant.“That includes renewables that get brought onto the grid, which are cheaper than what we have,” she said, “so that is a savings to our customers, which is part of the clean and affordable and reliable energy — so it’s an economic decision.”One component of the cost savings was coal.

Rich Houtteman, community affairs manager for Consumers, explained to commissioners in February that the cost of shipping coal is a huge financial consideration for the energy company.

“It’s about $50 a ton to ship excess coal off-site,” he said. “We had 30,000 tons. That’s a lot for our customers. So we’re trying to burn up all the coal as we kind of bring in 130 train carloads a day.”

Last-minute intervention

On May 23, Secretary Wright directed MISO, in coordination with Consumers, to ensure that the 1,560 megawatt plant “[remain] available for operation, minimizing any potential capacity shortfall that could lead to unnecessary power outages.”

“Today’s emergency order ensures that Michiganders and the greater Midwest region do not lose critical power generation capability as summer begins and electricity demand regularly reach high levels,” Wright said in a prepared news release.

The Energy Department said the emergency order, which is issued by the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, is authorized by Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act and is in accordance with President Trump’s Executive Order: Declaring a National Energy Emergency to ensure that power generation availability in the region does not “dip below 2024 capacity levels.”

“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families. With President Trump’s leadership, the Energy Department is hard at work securing the American people access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy that powers their lives regardless of whether the wind is blowing, or the sun is shining.”

The topic became a political talking point this year with Ottawa Impact commissioners. When the far-right group held a controlling majority on the board in 2023 and 2024, they largely avoided the subject, but since transitioning to a four-seat minority on the 11-member board in January, the topic has come up frequently.

OI Commissioner Allison Miedema strongly backed the county suing Consumers to prevent the Campbell closure; however, the measure lost in a 7-4 vote at the board’s April 22 meeting.

OI Commissioner Sylvia Rhodea said at the board’s May 27 meeting that Wright’s order provided a “90-day reprieve” of the delayed closure of the Campbell plant.

“Man, we dodged a bullet with that one,” she said.

What’s the cost to keep Campbell open?

Nessel said Wright’s order would lead to Michiganders “feeling a pinch in their pockets.”“The costs of maintaining production at the plant, long since prepared for closure, could be an enormous burden on the rate-paying customers of Consumers Energy,” she said. “And that’s before taking into account the environmental and public health costs of continuing to fuel a coal-powered plant.”In a June 3 statement, a Consumers spokesperson said the company is currently complying with the order.

“We are currently in compliance with the order, have arranged for new shipments of coal, some of which arrived last week, and will continuously operate the Campbell Plant,” Trisha Bloembergen, West Michigan media relations specialist, said in a June 3 email. “We are still determining the overall cost, but want to ensure those costs are shared across MISO and not all on Consumers Energy customers.”

Generating power at the Campbell plant is likely to be costly for ratepayers, experts from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis wrote June 5.

Campbell Units 1 and 2, which are 63 and 58 years old, respectively, were already increasingly uncompetitive in the MISO market, meaning it cost more to generate electricity than what it could be sold for, said energy data analysts Seth Feaster and Dennis Wamsted.According to data filed by Consumers at FERC, the operation and maintenance costs for the two units totaled $45.80 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in 2023 (the most recent data available). That puts both units in the red almost all the time in MISO: S&P data shows that the monthly around-the-clock price at the Michigan hub has been above $40/MWh just twice in the past two years, and never during the summer.”In other words, the plant would lose money on virtually every MWh generated if past prices hold this summer, costs that could add up to many more millions of dollars if the units at Campbell are run for any substantial amount of time,” Feaster and Wamsted said.Beyond operational costs, there are fuel and staffing costs as well.

“Coal itself has gotten more expensive,” said Frank Rambo, executive director at Horizon Climate Initiative, a nonprofit organization that works to use cost-saving energy market reforms to address the causes and impacts of climate change.

“That fleet has gotten more expensive to run. It’s coal, which used to be synonymous with cheap power. It’s now among the most expensive power … and then the excess costs that are incurred because they’re running more expensive resources.

Ultimately, it will be residents who foot the bill, Rambo said.

“They run those coal plants, and then they turn around, go to their commissions and recover those excess costs from their customers,” he said.

Rambo said the price could be even higher than normal because Consumers would need to buy coal on the open market rather than enter into a new contract with a mine.

“We don’t need to sign a new long-term coal supply contract because we’re shutting the plant down,” he said. “Now they may have to buy coal on the spot market.”

The price of coal has hovered around $110 per ton on the U.S. commodities exchange. As of June 19, the price of coal was $103.85 per ton.

In 2024, Campbell burned more than 3.7 million tons of coal, Feaster and Wamsted said. That is an average of 12,700 tons of coal a day, which would amount to $1,318,895 per day using today’s prices.

All of the Campbell plant’s coal previously was delivered by rail from the Powder River Basin in northern Wyoming, according to the IEFF.

Two of the PRB’s biggest mines provided that coal: Arch Resources’ Black Thunder Mine, which delivered 2.25 million tons, and Peabody Energy’s North Antelope Rochelle Mine, which delivered 1.47 million tons.

Rambo also noted the plant staffing issue, explaining that Consumers likely already had phased out several employees who were then called back.

“We were laying these people off. Now we’re going to have to hire them as contractors,” likely at a higher pay rate because the work would be temporary, Rambo explained.

“There are all sorts of excess costs that would not be incurred, but for the fact that there’s now this executive order,” he said.

What happens next?

Feaster and Wamsted said Consumers has brought online 502MW of wind generation since 2020, bought the 1,055MW Covert combined cycle gas plant in 2023, and is in the process of adding 515MW of solar generation to its system by 2027.

They said this indicates that the DOE intervention wasn’t necessary.

“These capacity-replacement moves were clearly enough for MISO. The system operator’s endorsement is critical, since it has the authority to require plants to continue operating if it believes grid stability or shortages could occur,” the analysts wrote.

They pointed to MISO requiring Missouri-based Ameren to keep its 1,195MW Rush Island coal plant open in 2022 for reliability reasons. The decision was upheld by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the plant remained open until 2024.

“MISO found no similar problems with Consumers’ plan to close the Campbell plant, saying as recently as May 8 that the region has sufficient resources to meet projected demand this summer,” Feaster and Wamsted said. “Despite this, the Department of Energy said in its May 24 emergency order that it was directing MISO and Consumers to keep the plant open due to an expected ‘insufficiency of dispatchable capacity’ during the summer.”

Rambo said he’s concerned that this could indicate more federal intervention in the energy sector, which could drive up costs for all.

“This very well could be a bellwether of more things to come. And that’s why I’m concerned about this as an example. Because if this does turn out to be the first of many, we should all be prepared for higher energy bills,” he said.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/citypulse/original/20250523-131120-699-city_pulse_generic_og_image.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 17:07:35.089733

Senate Budget Committee Democrats said late Thursday that the parliamentarian, the referee of the upper chamber’s reconciliation rules, has advised that eight sections — including three under the Environment and Public Works Committee’s jurisdiction — would not meet the strict budget-related requirements.

The decision clarifies that those provisions would be subject to a 60-vote threshold rather than the simple-majority vote that makes the reconciliation process so appealing for the majority party.

Among the sections in limbo are ones that would target Inflation Reduction Act programs, repeal EPA vehicle emissions rules and amend the National Environmental Policy Act to streamline certain permitting processes.

“As much as Senate Republicans would prefer to throw out the rule book and advance their families lose and billionaires win agenda, there are rules that must be followed and Democrats are making sure those rules are enforced,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee, in a statement.

“We will continue examining every provision in this Great Betrayal of a bill and will scrutinize it to the furthest extent,” Merkley said.

Reconciliation rules require clear and direct impacts on the budget and that the effect on revenues or spending not be “merely incidental.”

Senate Republicans must now decide what to do with the sections in question. They could drop the language from their bill entirely or rework them to comply with the Byrd rule, named after former Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.).

Republican leaders are hustling to iron out wrinkles and pass their megabill before their self-imposed deadline of Independence Day, all while Democrats look to poke holes in the legislation ahead of a marathon series of amendment votes that could take place as soon as next week.

IRA, emissions rules, permitting

Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruled that Republicans’ proposal to repeal statutory authorizations for Inflation Reduction Act programs would violate the rules. However, the effort to repeal unobligated funds from certain sections of the 2022 climate law would still be allowed.

POLITICO’s E&E News previously reported that the move to use reconciliation to repeal underlying authorizing language is unheard of among budget experts. Such a move would make it much more difficult for future Congresses to restore the programs.

The Republican plan to repeal EPA’s tailpipe emissions standards for passenger vehicle model years 2027 or later would not be allowed, likely due to the lack of a direct budget impact.

Republicans have said this regulation is part of the Biden administration’s electric vehicle “mandate,” but there have been questions about how the repeal would generate savings.

Also on the chopping block is a provision that would amend the National Environmental Policy Act to allow project sponsors to pay a one-time fee — 125 percent of the cost to prepare an environmental document — to fast-track environmental reviews and prevent judicial reviews for certain findings.

It was not immediately clear why MacDonough did not rule out similar permitting provisions throughout the megabill, including those proposed by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. More rulings are forthcoming.

A spokesperson for Environment and Public Works Chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) did not comment Friday morning.

More provisions under scrutiny

Democrats said the Senate parliamentarian advised that several provisions proposed by the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee would be subject to the higher 60-vote threshold. They include proposals to cut funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Financial Research Fund.

The parliamentarian also highlighted a provision under the Armed Services Committee’s jurisdiction that would reduce appropriations for the Department of Defense if spending plans are not submitted to Congress on time.

The provisions in question represent a tiny fraction of those that Senate committees have proposed in their respective sections. Leaders have already been trying to get ahead of parliamentary rulings on certain provisions by tweaking language that they know would not be allowed.

GOP-backed language that would overhaul the federal rulemaking process and give Congress more say over certain regulations has been rewritten numerous times already.

Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chair Mike Lee (R-Utah) has been working for months with other conservatives in the House and Senate to rewrite the “REINS Act” — short for “Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act” — to make it eligible for inclusion in the party-line bill.

Republicans have been circulating new language in recent days that they hope will conform with the Byrd rule. It could theoretically be added to the package via an amendment or another procedure.

Meanwhile, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) took to social media repeatedly over the weekend to pressure Democrats not to question an extension of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act in the Judiciary Committee’s portion of the bill. The expansion of RECA is one of his biggest legislative priorities.

The proposal would reauthorize and expand a program that compensates people sickened by nuclear radiation as a result of the government’s nuclear weapons development.

The project, GlassPoint said, will provide superior unit economics to existing coal-based operations while paving the way forward for replacing two coal-fired power plants.

Under the first phase of the arrangement, GlassPoint will install 750 MWth of solar thermal technologies to reduce carbon emissions by up to half a million metric tons of CO2 per year at SVM’s manufacturing facility in Trona, California.

Sodium carbonate and boron are widely used critical minerals. Boron, the fifth-lightest element, in its many forms has a wider range of advanced applications than both rare earths and lithium. In the next decade, SVM’s plant will be the last US-based production facility for boron, ensuring supply of domestic production, the company said.

SVM’s operations involve processing brine to produce boric acid, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfate, and other specialty products for a range of industries. Searles Lake, the company said, with brine 10 times saltier than seawater, is unique because it contains one of the richest deposits of multiple minerals including borax, potassium, sodium and lithium.

“As coal prices continue to rise, GlassPoint’s solution will enable us to lower costs from day one while protecting American jobs,” Searles Valley Minerals CEO Dennis Cruise said in a news release.

GlassPoint’s solar steam system will begin replacing steam currently generated via two coal and natural gas boilers used for both heat and electricity. The company’s Enclosed Trough technology will use reflective mirrors inside greenhouses to focus sunlight onto a pipe carrying liquid salt, capturing energy from the sun for use in boiler operations as well as onsite power.

GlassPoint will also deploy its Unify storage system, which uses ternary liquid salts to store heat at night and enable a continuous base load of heat and power night and day.

All rights reserved.Natural Gas Market Indicators – June 6, 2025","Natural Gas Market Summary

Summer has officially arrived, bringing with it the potential for above-normal temperatures across large areas of the country through the end of June. Domestic natural gas consumption remains steady while both production and LNG feedgas deliveries lag recent record high levels. However, these trends may prove temporary. The Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) June 2025 Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) projects that June electric power consumption could be 25.7 percent higher than May, with production expected to rise 0.4 percent month over month.

For the month to date as of June 16, Henry Hub spot prices have averaged $2.84 per MMBtu, nearly 9 percent lower than the May 2025 average spot price, according to EIA data. The EIA lowered its 2025 spot price estimate by 2.4 percent to $4.02 per MMBtu in its June STEO. In contrast, Henry Hub futures prices averaged $3.64 per MMBtu over the same period, 5.3 percent higher than the May 2025 average. New capacity developments continue to bolster the outlook for gas-driven generation amid growing electricity demand. S&P Global Commodity Insights (S&P Global) reports that Duke Energy has proposed a 1.4 GW natural gas power plant in South Carolina. If approved, the project is expected to begin commercial operations in 2031. In Ohio, regulators have approved a 200 MW natural gas power plant intended to provide dedicated power to a Meta data center. Commercial operations are expected to begin in late 2026.

Futures Prices Rise on Weather, Geopolitical Influences

According to CME, the Henry Hub prompt month settled at $3.99 per MMBtu on June 18, up 13.7 percent week-over-week and 13.3 percent above July prompt-month contract rollover date. This marks the highest prompt-month futures price for Henry Hub since early April, with prices floating above $4 per MMBtu during early trading on Friday as temperature forecasts turn notably warmer and the conflict between Iran and Israel escalates, according to NGI. The 12-month strip gained $0.31 per MMBtu week-over-week as of June 18, up 5.6 percent since the first trading day of June.

Henry Hub spot prices reached a month-to-date high of $3.13 per MMBtu on June 9, according to the EIA, up approximately 20 percent year-over-year but in line with the May 2025 average spot price. For the quarter-to-date, the average Henry Hub spot price is $3.18 per MMBtu.

Argus reports the following regional natural gas spot prices as of June 18:

The Rockies and Northwest had the lowest regional price of $2.51 per MMBtu.

The highest regional price occurred in Louisiana and the Southeast at$3.60 per MMBtu.

Reported prices in other regions ranged from $2.76 per MMBtu in the Southwest to $3.43 per MMBtu in the Northeast.

Warmer Temperatures and Tropical Storm Erick on the Horizon

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) temperature forecast suggests most of the U.S. could experience above-normal temperatures into early July. Coastal areas of the Carolinas and Virginia have the highest likelihood (between 70 and 80 percent) of above normal temperatures during this time. In contrast, the Pacific Coast and a portion of the Southwest may experience below- or near-normal temperatures into late June.

For the week ending June 14, there were 49 cooling degree days (CDDs), compared to the 30-year normal of 45. Weather for the week was 8.9 percent warmer than last year and 8.9 percent warmer than the 30-year normal. Regionally, all areas were warmer than the 30-year normal with the exception of New England, Middle Atlantic, East North Central, and West North Central, and all regions except the West South Central, West North Central, and Mountain regions were warmer than last year.

In the Eastern Pacific, Hurricane Erick made landfall on the southern coast of Mexico on Thursday as a Category 3 storm, causing heavy rain and at least one death. Reuters reports this is the earliest major hurricane to make landfall in the Eastern Pacific.

Annual Domestic Gas Consumption Up Slightly

Total U.S. natural gas demand, including exports, rose 0.6 percent week-over-week and 1.7 percent year-over-year for the week ending June 20, according to preliminary data from S&P Global. Domestic consumption rose 1.1 percent week-over-week, driven by a 4.9 percent increase in the electric power sector. By comparison, residential and commercial sector consumption fell 10.5 percent week-over-week and industrial sector consumption softened 0.7 percent . Year-over-year, domestic consumption rose 0.5 percent.

Regional consumption trends for the week are mixed:

All regions except the Midwest, Rockies, and Texas experienced week-over-week increases ranging from 0.9 percent to 6.3 percent.

Year-over-year, four regions experienced consumption declines, with the largest decrease of 8.5 percent occurring in the Midcontinent.

The Midwest, Northwest, Southwest, and Texas posted year-over-year increases within a range of 2.5 percent to 11 percent.

Steady U.S. Dry Gas Production Trends Amid Strong Northeast Output

Preliminary data from S&P Global suggests U.S. dry gas production increased 0.1 percent week-over-week and 3.2 percent year-over-year for the week ending June 20. Despite softening production since a new record high was set on May 16, 2025, year-to-date natural gas production through June 20 remains 2.7 percent higher than over the comparable period in 2024.

Regionally for the week ending June 20:

Production in the Northeast, Midcontinent, Rockies, and Texas rose between 0.1 percent and 1.4 percent week-over-week while production in the Southeast, Southwest, and Midwest fell between 0.4 percent and 2.1 percent.

The Midwest and Southwest posted year-over-year production declines of 7.1 percent and 6.1 percent, respectively.

All other regions posted year-over-year production gains, with the largest increase of 7.5 percent occurring in the Northeast.

Exports to Mexico Fall Week-over-Week

Natural gas imports from Canada rose 1.3 percent week-over-week as of June 20, according to preliminary data from S&P Global. Compared to the same period last year, Canadian imports are down 0.8 percent. By comparison, exports to Mexico fell 3.4 percent week-over-week and 1.2 percent year-over-year.

Weekly Feedgas Deliveries Down Slightly

Between June 5 and June 11, 28 LNG vessels departed the U.S. with a combined carrying capacity of 105 Bcf, according to Bloomberg Finance L.P. data cited by the EIA. This represents a week-over-week increase of three vessels and 11 Bcf of LNG exports.

U.S. LNG feedgas deliveries fell slightly for the week ending June 20, with average daily volumes down 0.2 percent week-over-week, according to preliminary data from S&P Global. On an annual basis, feedgas deliveries are more than 11 percent higher year-over-year. The daily volume as of June 20 is approximately 17 percent below the daily record set in April, due in large part to routine maintenance at key facilities.

Regionally for the week:

Southeast feedgas volumes are 0.2 percent higher week-over-week and 15.7 percent higher year-over-year, driven by increasing throughput at key terminals including Elba Island and Plaquemines.

Week-over-week deliveries in Texas are down 0.5 percent but remain 3.1 percent higher than over the same period last year.

In the Northeast, feedgas deliveries for the week are down 1.7 percent compared to the week prior but are 9.4 percent higher than in the same period last year.

Rig Count Continues to Decline

According to Baker Hughes, the number of U.S. gas rigs decreased by one to 113 rigs between June 6 and June 13. Compared to the same week last year, the number of gas rigs is up by more than 15 percent. Total U.S. oil and gas rigs decreased by four to 555 rigs for the week and are 35 rigs or 5.9 percent lower than year-ago levels. According to Reuters, the current total U.S. rig count is the lowest since November 2021.

Inventories Rising but Remain Below 2024 Levels

For the week ending June 13, U.S. underground storage inventories stood at 2,802 Bcf, following a 95 Bcf net injection for the week. Inventories are 7.7 percent below last year’s levels, but 6.1 percent above the five-year average. Underground natural gas storage inventories have increased 58 percent since the week ending March 28, when levels were 4.3 percent below the five-year average, highlighting healthy refill activity despite tighter year-over-year comparisons.

Regionally, storage levels lag last year in all regions, with the Midwest showing the largest year-over-year deficit at 13 percent. The Pacific region posted the narrowest deficit, down just 1.8 percent year-over-year. Conversely, storage inventories in all regions are above the respective regional five-year averages, with the Mountain region holding the largest surplus at 30.1 percent.

What to Watch:

Demand: Temperatures are expected to be above normal in much of the U.S. into early July. With weather in many regions already warmer than last year, could the U.S. experience a material increase in natural gas consumption this summer?

Prices: As heat-driven demand rises and global supply risks emerge, what will be the impact on natural gas futures in the near term?

LNG Exports: If the conflict in the Middle East reduces LNG supply to Europe and Asia, could U.S. LNG exports fill the gap?

That is particularly so when the government regulation itself may be skewing the market at issue.

Circuit.

Click here to read the full text of the June 20 decision in Diamond Alternative Energy v. Environmental Protection Agency.

BULLET POINTS: “To deny standing based on a theory that invalidating an important regulation would actually have zero impact on a dynamic and heavily regulated market requires a degree of economic and political clairvoyance that is difficult for a court to maintain. That is particularly so when the government regulation itself may be skewing the market at issue. So courts should exercise caution before denying standing because of a claimed lack of redressability rooted in questionable economic speculation. …

“In sum, this case does not present the unusual scenario where invalidating a challenged government restriction on businesses in a competitive market is not likely to have any effect. Here, it may not be certain, but it is at least ‘predictable’ that invalidating the California regulations would likely result in the fuel producers ultimately selling more gasoline and other liquid fuels.”

— Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, opinion of the court

“Having granted certiorari, the Court relegates to a footnote the actual basis for the D.C. Circuit’s decision [which was based on an apparent misunderstanding about when the California fleet-wide emissions standards expire]. A version of that footnote should have been the Court’s entire opinion in this case. For reasons unknown, the majority instead conjures up a ‘heightened “proof of redressability” requirement’ that the D. C. Circuit did not adopt and that no party advanced, and then laboriously ‘decline[s] to adopt’ that requirement. I see no need to expound on the law of standing in a case where the sole dispute is a factual one not addressed below. Indeed, as JUSTICE JACKSON explains, this case is unlikely to present a live controversy for much longer regardless of petitioners’ standing, as the administration is likely to withdraw the challenged rules. I would simply have vacated the case and remanded it to the D.C. Circuit to reconsider its redressability analysis, keeping in mind the now corrected timeline for the challenged vehicle-emissions programs.”

— Justice Sonia Sotomayor, dissenting

“In my view, we should have either denied certiorari outright or held this matter in abeyance pending EPA‘s reconsideration of its waiver grant. Barring that, we should have simply vacated and remanded for the D. C. Circuit to reconsider its ruling on a clarified factual record.…",https://masslawyersweekly.com/files/2021/10/MALW-Digital-Product-Mockups_Tessa.png,N,,2025-06-20 14:10:54.655311

Resistance to renewable energy is not purely ideological.
Most clean energy jobs created since the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act have been in Republican districts.
Instead of locking in a clean, affordable and jobs-rich energy future, it ties Kansas’ renewable energy economy up in red tape and uncertainty.","Kansas is a national leader in renewable energy. Over 40% of our electricity is generated by wind. This has created thousands of jobs, over $11 billion in capital investment, and tens of millions of dollars in revenue to Kansas communities. A new federal tax and spending measure in Congress, though, threatens to stifle this success.

The bill, supported by the Trump administration and referred to by some as the “Big Beautiful Bill,” proposes severe cuts to clean energy tax credits that have propelled Kansas to a leadership position in wind energy. Presented as a way to cut expenses and encourage conventional energies, the legislation risks undermining the very industry that has brought economic development and energy independence to our state.

The House bill includes unrealistic timelines. Developers would have just 60 days after enactment to start construction, and projects must be completed by the end of 2028 to qualify for tax credits. For large wind farms that take years to plan and finance, this is simply unworkable. These provisions would effectively exclude nearly all future solar and wind projects from federal assistance.

The bill also imposes strict supply chain rules. Beginning in 2026, projects using major components made in China or Russia would be ineligible for tax credits. While meant to reduce dependence on foreign adversaries, the rules ignore reality. Most critical materials are no longer made in the U.S., and substitute supply chains are not yet available. This could stall or stop Kansas wind projects entirely.

It also threatens Kansas’ clean energy supply chain. Tax credits for wind factories would expire in 2028, endangering thousands of local jobs. The bill would also end leasing incentives for small-scale solar, making it harder for families and small businesses to access clean energy.

The Senate version tempers some of the House’s provisions but still poses major risks. It keeps restrictions on foreign materials but adds flexibility for publicly traded firms using Chinese-sourced materials. Notably, it allows projects to qualify for credits based on when construction begins, not when it finishes. Still, it phases out wind and solar tax credits through 2028 while ramping up support for nuclear, hydropower and geothermal.

Resistance to renewable energy is not purely ideological. Concerns about land use, aesthetics and community effects draw skepticism across the partisan divide. In Kansas, where windmills sweep the prairie, opponents have raised objections about visual impact, noise and land use.

But Kansas is not a left outlier on clean energy. Most clean energy jobs created since the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act have been in Republican districts. Kansas has benefitted from this boom. These are jobs that can’t be outsourced. They can energize our economy and communities.

This bill threatens to roll back that progress. Instead of locking in a clean, affordable and jobs-rich energy future, it ties Kansas’ renewable energy economy up in red tape and uncertainty.

The Chinese-owned battery manufacturer Automotive Energy Supply Corp. (AESC) had big battery manufacturing plans in the United States.
The company has one U.S. battery plant online, in Tennessee.
But instead of producing EV battery packs, it was repurposed to make industrial energy solutions instead.
The Washington Post says that in the first three months of 2025, some $6 billion in battery manufacturing plans were scrapped across the country.","AESC has stopped construction on two U.S. battery manufacturing facilities.

The company was in the process of investing $3.6 billion in the two new factories.

This is seen as a direct result of import tariffs and the cooling of EV demand in the United States.

The Chinese-owned battery manufacturer Automotive Energy Supply Corp. (AESC) had big battery manufacturing plans in the United States. It was building several plants to supply EV batteries, but after last year, it stopped work on one facility, and it has now put construction on hold at a second location.

AESC was in the process of investing $3.6 billion to build the two plants in Kentucky and South Carolina. But after import tariffs were introduced last year, importing the machinery necessary for its factories became much more expensive—machinery imported from China is subject to a 145% tariff. AESC also reportedly rushed construction and then had to implement expensive changes, which was a further setback.

The company has one U.S. battery plant online, in Tennessee. But instead of producing EV battery packs, it was repurposed to make industrial energy solutions instead. This likely came as a direct response to cooling EV demand in the U.S. and policy changes that specifically targeted EVs. The proposed rollback of some emissions standards and goals will further disincentivize the creation of new manufacturing for the EV supply chain.

Despite securing over $150 million in public funding and landing contracts to supply EV battery cells to Mercedes-Benz and BMW, AESC has considerably scaled back its plant-building plans in America. However, the company says it’s still committed to completing these factories and giving manufacturing jobs to thousands of people.

Pivoting to produce industrial energy storage, like it is doing in Tennessee, is a way to bring in some additional funds, which AESC needs in order to finish construction. According to the Wall Street Journal, AESC is also looking to get a loan to finish its South Carolina factory, which is supposed to supply BMW’s Smyrna plant, where it will begin EV manufacturing next year.

The Washington Post says that in the first three months of 2025, some $6 billion in battery manufacturing plans were scrapped across the country. This is at odds with the Republican narrative that the measures being enforced are meant to bring back manufacturing jobs, as it seems to be having the opposite effect.

Oregon Senator Ron Wyden commented on the matter at a news conference, telling the Post: “Hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. are now in danger. My own view is that projects all over the country are being canceled as we speak.”

The EV federal tax credit that the Trump administration is looking to abolish, along with other measures that encourage EVs, gave incentive for carmakers to build EVs in the U.S., source their components locally and create a supply chain to sustain the segment, which seemed burgeoning around 2022 when so many of these big battery investments were emphatically announced.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/YAqeQy/s1/aesc-bowling-green-factory.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 17:07:03.563260

Current GHG emission standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants have a goal of controlling 90 percent of carbon emissions by 2032; facilities that will shut down by 2032 are exempt from the existing regulation.

The EPA’s proposal would roll back regulations that were promulgated during both the Biden and Obama administrations. According to the Trump administration, the proposed rule would save the industry approximately $19 billion in regulatory compliance costs over the next two decades.

Simultaneously, the EPA proposed amendments to the National Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Coal- and Oil-fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units, a rule commonly referred to as the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), which were most recently updated in 2024. Under the proposed rule, the standards would revert back to those of 2012.

Both proposals include alternatives to the aggressive rollback of current regulations, allowing regulators to rescind portions of the rules rather than the rules entirely.

These proposed changes bring uncertainty for operators of fossil fuel-fired power plants who may have already begun compliance activities or who planned to change to renewable generation, such as wind or solar. Power plant operators should monitor this rulemaking and consider providing input. Early preparation for potential stakeholder engagement and collaboration with industry associations can help mitigate the impact of potential changes during this transition period.

In relation to the repeal of GHG emissions standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants, the EPA announced that it will hold a virtual public hearing on July 8, 2025 and invited the public to comment on the proposed rule and alternatives by Aug. 7, 2025. The EPA also announced that it will host a virtual public hearing on the proposed amendments to MATS on July 10, 2025 and requested public comment by Aug. 11, 2025.",,N,,2025-06-20 15:08:28.814345

Visitors are still coming, but they’re spending more cautiously; they’re booking shorter stays; they’re dining out less and being more selective with their purchases.","LANSING, Mich. (June 20, 2025) — Earlier this week, on Wednesday, June 18, the Senate Oversight Committee, chaired by Sen. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing), heard from economic experts and local businesses on how plummeting consumer confidence fueled by sweeping tariffs has impacted Michiganders’ spending behavior in recent months. As the Trump administration continues to threaten additional tariffs on specific industries, from pharmaceuticals to lumber and copper, testifiers shared how Trump’s trade war has affected and continues to threaten Michigan businesses, consumers, and local economies.

“The impacts of Trump’s reckless and blanket tariffs are sparking fear and uncertainty for Michigan consumers, harming local businesses, and posing a real and significant threat to the health of our state’s economy and future,” said Sen. Singh. “The recent shifts in consumer sentiment and spending behavior, as highlighted by our testifiers, are particularly alarming for our small mom and pop shops who don’t always have access to the safety net that other larger companies do. My Senate colleagues and I remain committed to doing all that we can to mitigate the negative effects of these short-sighted trade policies on Michiganders — consumers, workers, and business owners alike.”

Since taking office for his second term, Trump has implemented numerous tariffs on specific countries, industries, and products, including raising prices on Michigan’s auto allies in Canada, and at one point, increasing tariffs on Chinese imports to a skyrocketing total of 145%. Many of these tariffs have been paused, reduced, or legally challenged by several states and other entities, causing a widespread tariff whiplash that has sparked concern and uncertainty among consumers and businesses here in Michigan and across the country.

Dr. Joanne Hsu, Research Associate Professor and Director of the Surveys of Consumers with the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, testified how these new trade policies are impacting consumers nationwide. She shared the latest insights from their Survey of Consumers, which has been measuring consumer attitudes towards the economy for over 80 years.

As Hsu explained, their research shows how consumer sentiment had been on a general upward trend from June 2022 to December 2024 before plunging over the next four months in 2025 from uncertainty over the new tariffs — declining to the second-lowest level since the early 1950s. And the concerns are shared across the political spectrum, as the data demonstrates, with even Republicans who broadly support Trump’s agenda agreeing that the economic outlook has deteriorated over the course of the year. Hsu noted that while the latest findings show that concerns have softened slightly this month, widespread worry about the economy remains, with nearly two-thirds of consumers expecting unemployment to worsen soon and a weakening sentiment even among higher income groups, who generate the majority of consumer spending.

Karen Roofe, a Traverse City-based gift shop owner and board member of the Downtown Traverse City Association, provided firsthand insight into how these shifts in buying behavior have impacted her business, neighboring storefronts, and the local tourism economy. Over the course of this year, her business has witnessed a decline in customer traffic along with smaller transactions and lower sales. The economic uncertainty and slowdown have limited her ability to hire new staff, placing increased financial pressure on shop owners who are having to work around the clock to keep the doors open.

Roofe explained how the recent changes in tourist behavior inextricably affect the local community as well, saying, “In a tourist town like Traverse City, even a small dip in consumer confidence has an outsized impact. Visitors are still coming, but they’re spending more cautiously; they’re booking shorter stays; they’re dining out less and being more selective with their purchases. That slowdown affects our locals also. Our economy is deeply interconnected, so when our visitors spend less, the ripple effect hits our community members, who rely on tourism and the driven income from that. Everyone feels the squeeze.”

A recent study from the Michigan State University Center for Canadian Studies showcases the impact of the Trump administration’s new tariffs on the state’s manufacturing sector, which caused a 19-fold increase in import duties from Canada between January and April of 2025. As the research explains, this number is expected to rise with the 50% steel and aluminum tariffs that went into effect earlier this month, threatening tens of thousands of jobs in Michigan’s manufacturing plants.

Speaking on Michigan’s robust clean energy manufacturing sector and electric vehicle production, Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy, also cautioned a potential threat to tens of thousands of jobs and the future of the auto industry here in the state.",https://senatedems.com/singh/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2025/06/oversight-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 14:08:55.134873

“Businesses value policy certainty and a stable investment environment as they plan for the future.
North Carolina businesses have made commitments and directed investment in alignment with the energy policy set forth in HB951 in 2021.
This bill is a new abrupt change in energy policy, making the state a less attractive place for forward-looking companies to invest in the future,” said Mel Mackin, director of state policy, Ceres.
Those efforts include a statement signed by 12 businesses in support of expanded transmission and grid modernization recommendations, submitted to the North Carolina Utilities Commission as it considered Duke’s carbon plan.","Ceres issued the following statement today, after the North Carolina legislature passed energy legislation that included a repeal of the state’s 2030 goal to reduce carbon pollution from the power sector by 70%.

“Businesses value policy certainty and a stable investment environment as they plan for the future. The legislation passed today unfortunately upends that stability. North Carolina businesses have made commitments and directed investment in alignment with the energy policy set forth in HB951 in 2021. This bill is a new abrupt change in energy policy, making the state a less attractive place for forward-looking companies to invest in the future,” said Mel Mackin, director of state policy, Ceres. “Businesses have supported the goals laid out by HB951 because they recognize the vast economic benefits of investing in clean energy and reducing the risks of fuel cost volatility. These businesses also support efforts to ensure the delivery of reliable and affordable power, but that job is not done. For lawmakers to further commit to reliable and affordable power, we urge them to prioritize legislation that will upgrade and modernize the grid to ensure North Carolina can efficiently, affordably, and reliably power its growing economy.”

Major companies in North Carolina have long supported clean power policy at the state level, including the carbon reduction goals of HB951, which passed the legislature with bipartisan support in 2021 requiring utilities to achieve an interim target of 70% reductions by 2030 and the still-standing goal to effectively eliminate carbon pollution from the power sector by 2050. Leading businesses have also worked with Ceres to support policy that modernizes the electric grid to deliver affordable, reliable power to the state’s businesses and residents across the Southeast, including in North Carolina. Those efforts include a statement signed by 12 businesses in support of expanded transmission and grid modernization recommendations, submitted to the North Carolina Utilities Commission as it considered Duke’s carbon plan. That's why several NC companies penned a letter in March urging lawmakers to reject an earlier version of S 266.

Many companies operating in North Carolina and across the country also released a statement in April urging policymakers to upgrade transmission infrastructure, writing that it is “vital to bringing our electric grid into the 21st century and ensuring reliable, affordable electricity to power our business and the economy.” The Power Infrastructure Resiliency & Efficiency (PIRE) Act, introduced by House Energy and Public Utilities Chairman Kyle Hall this session, would require utilities to regularly assess opportunities to upgrade transmission lines by applying various cost-effective technology solutions, ultimately increasing the capacity of North Carolina's grid and avoiding unnecessary investments in new energy infrastructure. Virginia, South Carolina, New Mexico, and Indiana adopted similar commonsense policies in the last year, and several other states across the country are considering adopting similar legislation.

Meanwhile, the administration proposed a rule change to the Endangered Species Act that would remove habitat modification or degradation from the definition of harm to an animal.
“If we take away that definition of harm ... then that means that the Endangered Species Act doesn’t have the power to protect areas.
Carrizo Plain Conservancy board president Neil Havlik said the Carrizo Plain is more protected than most national monuments.
Meanwhile, there isn’t any oil and gas under the Carrizo Plain, which protects the land from oil and gas exploration, Havlik said.","On a warm, Wednesday afternoon, scientists, community members and local leaders gathered at the Grange Hall in San Luis Obispo to discuss the Trump administration’s attempts to weaken laws protecting public land and waters — and how those policies could impact the Central Coast.

The Santa Lucia chapter of the Sierra Club hosted a panel of local environmental leaders to answer the community’s questions on Wednesday from 5 to 7 p.m.

The panelists included Congressman Salud Carbajal, ocean policy expert Erin Eastwood, Carrizo Plain Conservancy board president Neil Havlik, wildlife biologist Ben Vizzachero and Coastal Band of Chumash Nation representative Michael Khus-Zarate.

From an attempt to reduce the scope of the Endangered Species Act to an effort to allow the president to eliminate national monuments, here are three issues to keep an eye on for the Central Coast.

Trump tires to weaken federal protection of public lands, endangered species

Vizzachero returned to work at the Los Padres National Forest in late March, after being fired in February alongside thousands of other U.S. Department of Agriculture employees at the direction of the Trump administration and the Department of Governmental Efficiency.

The fight against these terminations led Vizzachero to the floor of Congress, where he confronted Elon Musk over the budget cuts that catalyzed his job loss.

A court determined that Vizzachero’s job termination was unlawful, and he was invited back to work, he said.

The biologist attended the panel as a private citizen, and he did not speak on behalf of the Los Padres National Forest, he said.

While he’s glad he won the battle over his termination, Vizzachero worries about the Trump administration’s continued assault on public lands — and its interest in cutting the federal workforce that manages those lands.

“They have successfully convinced a decent chunk of the public that scientists such as myself are bureaucrats standing in the way of, well, they would say progress — but really what we’re standing in the way of is industry and corporations that are stealing something that belongs to all of us, and that is our public lands,” Vizzachero said.

He said it’s imperative that wildlife biologists continue to be employed by the U.S. Forest Service to ensure that federal regulations designed to protect the environment are followed, he said.

“Our nation’s public lands provide tangible goods that we all depend on — things like water, safety from wildfire, timber, grazing for cattle,” Vizzachero said. “We need to support those things, and as a biologist, I’m making sure that our forest can provide those without sacrificing wildlife habitat.”

As a wildlife biologist, his primary job is to ensure that U.S. Forest Service projects comply with federal laws like the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.

When a project is proposed in the national forest — from trail maintenance to vegetation management — Vizzachero evaluates its environmental impacts, reports his findings and monitors the project as needed.

“Fortunately, we have found that those laws have not lost their teeth,” he said, but the Trump administration still seeks to weaken those federal laws.

President Trump issued an executive order in January that directed the removal of certain rules under the National Environmental Policy Act, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Meanwhile, the administration proposed a rule change to the Endangered Species Act that would remove habitat modification or degradation from the definition of harm to an animal. If the rule change is made official, only direct harm to an animal would be prohibited by the law.

Vizzachero said it’s not clear how the proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act would affect his work as a wildlife biologist — but he’s concerned about potential impacts to protected species.

At the panel, he said reducing the definition of harm to exclude habitat degradation would have “terrifying implications.”

Harassing a condor would still be prohibited, but someone could legally take its habitat away — which would effectively kill the bird, he said.

“If we take away that definition of harm ... then that means that the Endangered Species Act doesn’t have the power to protect areas. It just protects individual animals, and that’s not the intent of the act,” he said.

Is the Carrizo Plain at risk?

The U.S. Justice Department released an opinion on Tuesday, saying that the president can alter or eliminate national monuments established by previous presidents under the Antiquities Act. Previously, Congress held this power.

The Carrizo Plain National Monument, a grassland known for beautiful spring wildflower blooms, was established in 2001 under the Antiquities Act, according to the Los Padres Forest Watch.

At the forum, an audience member asked if the Carrizo Plain was at risk — especially since the Trump administration seems interested in dismantling the Antiquities Act.

Carrizo Plain Conservancy board president Neil Havlik said the Carrizo Plain is more protected than most national monuments.

If its designation as a national monument was rescinded, the Carrizo Plain would return to its previous condition — which was as a cooperative management area overseen by the Bureau of Land Management, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Nature Conservancy. According to Havlik, this is still a fair amount of protection.

Meanwhile, there isn’t any oil and gas under the Carrizo Plain, which protects the land from oil and gas exploration, Havlik said.

“The oil companies who have been poking holes in that area for over 120 years know the boundary right to the last inch of where the oil and gas is,” Havlik said. “So I don’t worry that much about the Carrizo.”

If the president rescinds the status of a national monument, Rep. Salud Carbajal said he would expect that decision to be challenged in court.

“We’re going to continue to see a lot of these issues challenged by state attorneys general, by institutions, by nonprofits, by aggrieved parties,” he said. “We’re — I think more often than not — going to see victories.”

These proposed rules on power plant emissions of GHGs and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) are the most significant public step EPA has taken in its sweeping deregulatory agenda. The proposed rules offer valuable insight into the administration's broader strategy and approach as it begins to grapple with notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements.

Proposed Regulation of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Emissions Under Section 111

The regulation of power plant GHG emissions under CAA Section 111 has been contentious and subject to dramatic swings since their introduction. The EPA's 2015 Clean Power Plan (CPP) under the Obama Administration took a broad approach, seeking Chevron deference for an interpretation of the ""best system of emission reduction"" (BSER) that could include generation-shifting measures that took advantage of the uniquely interconnected nature of the electric grid and power sector. The U.S. Supreme Court later stayed the CPP, and the rule never went into effect.

The EPA's 2019 Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule under the Trump Administration limited the BSER to measures that could be applied directly ""at and to the source"" and concluded that only heat-rate improvements sufficed as the BSER. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the ACE rule and repeal of the CPP as a ""fundamental misconstruction"" of CAA Section 111(d), but the Supreme Court reversed. In West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022), the Court invoked the ""major questions doctrine"" to reject the CPP's generation-shifting approach as a ""transformative"" measure requiring clearer congressional authorization.

Following this decision, the EPA under the Biden Administration issued new power plant GHG rules in 2024 with BSERs that varied depending on the type of plant. Most significantly, the Biden EPA rule relied on carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology for certain existing coal plants and new gas-fired power plants, and on natural gas co-firing for other existing coal plants. Although the Supreme Court declined to stay the Biden rules, following the change in administration, the D.C. Circuit agreed to hold the case in abeyance while the Trump Administration evaluated a change of course. EPA now proposes a new approach.

EPA's Primary Proposal for CO2 Emissions

The Trump Administration's proposal would eliminate all GHG limits for coal- and gas-fired power plants based on the premise that these sources do not ""contribute significantly"" to the endangerment of public health. CAA Section 111(b)(1)(A), 42 U.S.C. 7411(b)(1)(A), states that the EPA administrator must list a source category for regulation under Section 111 ""if in his judgment it causes, or contributes significantly to"" dangerous air pollution. EPA concludes that this language confers discretion on the administrator to determine when emissions reach the threshold of significant contribution; specifically, the agency states that GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly because they represent only 3 percent of global emissions, and no cost-effective control measures are reasonably available.

In the proposal, EPA further concludes that the term ""contributes significantly to,"" in conjunction with an explicit reference to the administrator's ""judgment,"" confers discretion to consider policy issues central to other parts of Section 111. Those policy issues include the effectiveness of emissions reduction controls, cost reasonableness of those controls, impacts on industry and impacts on public health and welfare. This approach would be a significant shift from previous approaches to Section 111 rules, which more clearly separated the threshold inquiry of which source categories are subject to regulation under Section 111 versus the actual emission reduction requirements.

EPA's Fallback Proposal for CO2 Emissions

Alternatively, EPA's proposal offers a narrower approach focusing on the Biden EPA's use of CCS and natural gas co-firing as the BSER for certain coal-fired power plants. The core aspects include:

for long-term coal-fired power plants and for plants undertaking major modifications, a repeal of the Biden EPA's 90 percent CCS as the BSER because the technology is not ""adequately demonstrated"" and is unreasonably costly

for medium-term coal-fired power plants, a repeal of the Biden EPA's 40 percent natural gas co-firing as the BSER because co-firing is ""an inefficient use of natural gas""

a repeal of the requirements for existing natural gas and oil-fired power plants because – having proposed to repeal the requirements for coal-fired power plants – it would be ""an inefficient use of State resources"" to require state governments to develop and submit plans for natural gas and oil-fired plants given how few GHGs they emit in comparison

This alternative is more technical than the primary proposal and would likely take longer to finalize due to the distinct issues arising for each of the various standards and the need to build an adequate technical record to support any final rule.

Proposed Repeal of 2024 Revisions to MATS Rule

In a separate action, EPA proposed to repeal amendments to the MATS for coal- and oil-fired power plants promulgated by the EPA under the Biden Administration in May 2024.

The MATS rule has also been the focus of intense scrutiny since its 2012 promulgation. The EPA under the Obama Administration promulgated the original MATS rule for coal- and oil-fired power plants under CAA Section 112, including a key predicate determination that regulation under Section 112 was ""appropriate and necessary."" In Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743 (2015), the Supreme Court held that EPA had improperly ignored cost in its ""appropriate and necessary"" determination, but the regulation nevertheless remained in effect through the Obama and first Trump Administrations. The EPA under the Biden Administration strengthened the standards in May 2024.

EPA now proposes to repeal three key provisions of the EPA amendments under the Biden Administration:

Filterable particulate matter (fPM) emission standards tightened from 0.030 to 0.010 pounds per million British thermal units (lb/MMBtu) for coal-fired electric-generating units. EPA proposes that the costs to achieve the standard are too high – flagging that cost effectiveness was worse than similar standards rejected for other sectors – and also that the standard is not ""necessary"" under CAA Section 112(d)(6).

Requirement to use particulate matter (PM) continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) for compliance demonstrations, because the transparency and pollution abatement advantages of CEMS do not sufficiently outweigh the costs to industry compared to other compliance options from the original 2012 MATS rule.

Tightened mercury emission standards for lignite-fired power plants, which had been lowered from 4.0 to 1.2 pounds per trillion British thermal units (lb/TBtu). EPA now proposes that this tighter standard was ""based on insufficient available data,"" including inappropriate extrapolations between units at different lignite-fired plants.

Administrative Law Backdrop

These proposals represent the first major EPA regulations of the second Trump Administration and the first power plant GHG rules developed entirely after the Supreme Court eliminated Chevron deference in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024).1 Particularly for the power plant CO2 rules, EPA spends many pages of the proposal elaborating on statutory interpretations that have not been tested in court. Without the benefit of Chevron deference, courts will assess whether these untested interpretations are the ""single best"" readings of the statute rather than merely one of several ""reasonable"" interpretations. If successful, this position would seemingly foreclose any stationary source GHG regulation under CAA Section 111, given that power plants are by far the greatest emitters; if power plants do not ""contribute significantly"" to climate change under CAA Section 111, it is not clear that any other source category would meet the test either.

The ""significant contribution"" argument for GHGs could also potentially be applied to other source categories and pollutants, establishing a higher threshold for when EPA can regulate emissions under various CAA provisions.

Another major issue will be the economic analysis of the proposals. The MATS repeal is premised in large part on cost considerations. The current proposal puts a heightened emphasis on the cost-focused approach to the technology review provisions of Section 112(d)(6), potentially establishing precedent for how costs are evaluated in other CAA contexts.

The CO2 proposal has a more complicated cost framework. EPA proposes that the cost of controls can be relevant to whether a source category's GHG emissions should be regulated at all under Section 111. However, the agency's proposed economic analysis shows costs (lost health benefits) that vastly outweigh the avoided compliance costs. Depending on the discount rate, the EPA estimates compliance cost savings between $9.6 billion and $19 billion, as compared to lost health benefits between $76 billion and $130 billion due to increased fine particulate matter and ozone emissions. The proposal did not monetize any benefits associated with CO2 emissions, stating that was an explicit choice to ignore those emissions due to direction in Executive Order 14154: Unleashing American Energy.

Conclusion

These proposals are the first in EPA's deregulatory agenda and the first in a legal landscape that has fundamentally shifted post-Loper Bright. As these proposals move through the CAA's unique rulemaking process, EPA's decisions are likely to test not only the substantive boundaries of CAA authority but also the procedural constraints on administrative agencies in the post-Chevron era.

Both proposals will undergo 45-day public comment periods following Federal Register publication. EPA has indicated that it intends to move quickly to finalize rules. Stakeholders should prepare detailed technical and legal comments if they are affected.

Nine in 10 (91%) current EV drivers (both battery EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs) indicate they would consider another EV as their next vehicle. However, the report found that internal combustion engine (ICE) drivers had a different attitude—a declined interest in confidence and satisfaction in EVs. That's according to Shell’s 2025 Recharge Driver Survey, which looks at the view of more than 15,000 drivers across the U.S., Europe and China.

The number of EV drivers owning just one vehicle has risen notably compared to 2024, according to the report. The percentage of EV drivers that only own an EV rose from 34% to 41% in the U.S., from 49% to 54% in Europe and from 72% to 89% in China.

Sixty-one percent of EV drivers globally agree that they worry less than a year ago about running out of charge, and nearly three-quarters (72%) say that the options and availability of public charging points has improved.

In the U.S., the interest is marginally lower (31% in 2025 versus 34% in 2024), while in Europe, it has decreased more substantially (41% in 2025 versus 48% in 2024).

When it comes to policies encouraging the phase-out of ICE vehicles, 46% of drivers of petrol and diesel cars in the U.S. say they agree with such policies.

That backing also appears conditional on changes in prices of EVs: only 56% of the supporters of ICE phase-out would continue their support if EVs stay more expensive than petrol and diesel vehicles. Similarly, half would still support ICE phase-out if charging infrastructure does not improve.

Recently, President Donald Trump signed three Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions into law, rejecting California’s vehicle emission waivers. The disapproved regulations include the Advanced Clean Cars II Rule, which would have required 100% of new vehicles sold in California by 2035 be electric or plug-in hybrids; the Advanced Clean Trucks Rule, which mandated that a growing percentage of new heavy-duty trucks sold in California be zero-emission vehicles; and the Omnibus Low NOx [nitrogen oxides] Rule, which sought to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions from both passenger and heavy-duty vehicles.

“Shell has established strong public charging networks in key markets worldwide, and this research reinforces what we hear from our customers: there’s a growing disparity in the transition to electric vehicles,” said David Bunch, group executive vice president of Shell Mobility and Convenience. “While current EV drivers are feeling more confident, the relatively high cost of owning an electric vehicle, combined with broader economic pressures, are making it a difficult decision for new consumers.”

Bunch called for a comprehensive, systems-wide approach to decarbonization, combining electrification with low-carbon fuels.

“With the right policies and industry collaboration, we can make the transition affordable for consumers and attractive for investors,” he said. “But more must be done to stimulate demand and ensure no one is left behind in the shift to cleaner transport.”

In the U.S., 80% of drivers say the reliability of public chargers has improved in the last 12 months, a higher percentage than that of both Europe and China.

The purchase of fuel or electricity often translates to more sales inside the store. A significant majority (75% of EV drivers and 80% of non-EV drivers) purchase at least one non-fuel retail item monthly. Coffee emerged as the most popular choice among all drivers with 4 in 10 (41%) drivers enjoying at least a cup each month; however, 6 in 10 (60%) stated they would only buy coffee from a service station if it was deemed good quality.

""There's a clear demand for good quality coffee among drivers, and we are committed to meeting this need whether that’s through our convenience partners or Shell Café, to ensure drivers have access to high-quality fresh coffee and other amenities,” Bunch said.",https://cdn.informaconnect.com/platform/files/public/2025-06/background/EV-car.jpg?VersionId=.wZibpbJOKKujE7vzpl_z58m5.rl1h7u,N,,2025-06-20 14:11:04.924223

Effective Jan. 1, 2026, Senate Bill 2206 consolidates Texas's dual-incentive structure into a single, performance-based franchise tax credit while repealing the current sales and use tax exemption for R&D equipment. The change introduces a new credit framework, increasing the base credit to 8.722% from 5%. An enhanced 10.903% rate is also available to research conducted through Texas-based higher education institutions. The amount of credit is based on the relevant rate multiplied by the difference between the qualified research expenses made during the period and 50% of the average of qualified research expenses incurred during the three tax periods preceding the period. For businesses without a prior three-year R&D history, a standard rate of 4.361% or an enhanced rate of 5.451% would apply.

Additionally, ‘qualified research expenses’ is now defined as the portion of the amount reported by a taxpayer as the total qualified research expenses on line 48 of IRS Form 6765. The legislation allows taxpayers to recognize amounts accepted by the IRS, including adjustments through audit or amended returns. Statistical sampling and Accounting Standards Codification 730-based substantiation are also permitted under specified conditions.

The credit is generally nontransferable and capped at 50% of the franchise tax due. Unused credits may be carried forward for up to 20 years, but ordering rules are established for credits earned under prior R&D tax credits. Certain taxpayers that are not required to pay the franchise tax may be eligible for a refund instead of carrying the credit forward. However, the legislation prohibits taxpayers from claiming the new credit for any period in which they utilized the repealed sales tax exemption. Finally, a credit incurred by a member of a combined group must be claimed on the combined report, establishing the combined group as the taxable entity.

The Texas Legislative Budget Board projects a net revenue reduction of $248 million for fiscal year (FY) 2026–27, rising to over $1 billion by FY 2028–29. General revenue will be used to maintain contributions to the Property Tax Relief Fund, as necessary, due to implementation of the new regime.

Takeaways

Senate Bill 2206 streamlines the state’s R&D incentives by repealing the sales tax exemption and implementing an enhanced, permanent tax credit related to qualified R&D expenses. With increased credit rates, refundability and federal alignment, the new structure positions Texas as a competitive state for future research investments. Noteworthy, Iowa recently replaced its R&D tax credit program, and Michigan enacted a new R&D tax credit program earlier this year.

Texas businesses conducting R&D activities should consider accelerating equipment purchases in 2025 to benefit from the expiring R&D sales tax exemption and evaluate whether the expanded credit opportunity is viable for their business for 2026 moving forward. State and federal R&D tax credit calculations and modeling can be complex and should be undertaken before investment commences. Businesses with questions about the new Texas R&D tax credit or other state R&D tax credits should consult with their state tax advisers to assess the implications of those opportunities as soon as possible.",https://rsmus.com/content/dam/rsm/1_abstract/shapes/social/colorful_blocks_abs_social.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 18:10:42.893729

Though yet another Pennsylvania legislator wants to try.

With the power grid shifting toward inverter based resources, versus thermal power plants, BESS systems are now being called on to become the base of stability for the grid.
New research is suggesting that BESS units with grid forming capabilities can enable more solar to run on local power grids.","The North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s (NERC) 2025 State of Reliability report, which reviews bulk-power system performance in 2024, finds early evidence that battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are strengthening primary frequency response in regions with high storage penetration.

NERC documented several events in which BESSs supplied 100% of frequency-regulation capacity, and they routinely covered more than 70% of needs during system disturbances.

The graph from the report highlights the chief advantage of BESSs, which is speed. During a frequency dip, the dotted line — representing BESS response — reacts faster than conventional generation. This leads to the frequency nadir— the low point of frequency — being shallower and shorter.

Fast action is critical. If frequency drifts for too long, generating units disconnect to protect themselves, as happened recently in Spain. BESSs have long proved their worth in the fast acting frequency space: Australia’s Hornsdale system — the first big BESS on the power grid in the world — kept the grid stable after a large coal plant tripped offline.

Older solar plants with legacy inverter settings can struggle when frequency strays outside normal limits, a stability concern the report also flags.

From 2021 to 2024, Texas retired some gas and coal units yet increased available frequency support, mainly through new BESSs. In Texas, BESSs are required by rule to provide frequency support, NERC notes.

In early May, the California Energy Commission released a report also suggesting that the state’s power grid had become more stable in recent years as BESS deployments increased.

The report noted that in 2024, the CAISO region hit 100% “clean energy” every “three out of five days”, and that despite periods of extreme heat, the grid didn’t issue a single Flex Alert for the whole year.

With the power grid shifting toward inverter based resources, versus thermal power plants, BESS systems are now being called on to become the base of stability for the grid. Grid forming inverters have been deploying in leading solar market Australia since 2021. New research is suggesting that BESS units with grid forming capabilities can enable more solar to run on local power grids.

But that boom now appears to be stalling as the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers try to restrict China’s access to the American market.

From South Carolina to Washington state, companies are slowing construction or reconsidering big investments in factories for producing rechargeable batteries and the ingredients needed to make them.

A big reason is that higher trade barriers between the U.S. and China are fracturing relationships between suppliers and customers in the two countries. At the same time, Republicans are seeking to block battery makers with ties to China, as well as those that rely on any Chinese technology or materials, from taking advantage of federal tax credits. The industry is also dealing with a softening market for electric vehicles, which Republicans and President Donald Trump have targeted.

The China-related restrictions — included in the version of Trump’s domestic policy bill passed by the House — would be very difficult for many companies to operate under. China is the world’s top battery manufacturer and makes nearly all of certain components.

The Trump policy bill highlights a difficult dilemma. The United States wants to create a homegrown battery industry and greatly reduce its dependence on China — and many Republican lawmakers want to end it altogether. But China is already so dominant in this industry that it will be incredibly hard for the United States to become a meaningful player without working with Chinese companies.

To cultivate a domestic industry, experts say, the United States needs to rely on foreign components and know-how as it builds its supply chains and expertise, much as China did in the auto industry.

Among the plants at risk is a $3 billion battery factory Ford Motor is building in Marshall, Mich., which is set to start making battery cells next year for the company’s electric cars. Ford is licensing technology from the Chinese battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology, which would quickly make it ineligible for federal subsidies under the House bill.

A loss of tax credits “will imperil what we do in Marshall,” William Clay Ford Jr., the company’s executive chair, said last month. “We made a certain investment based upon a policy that was in place,” he added. “It’s not fair to change policies after all the expenditure has been made.”

Some companies are already pulling back. This month, the battery maker AESC paused construction of a $1.6 billion electric-vehicle battery plant in South Carolina, citing “policy and market uncertainty.”

Batteries made there, which are meant to power BMW’s electric vehicles, also would become ineligible for federal subsidies, at least in part because a Chinese company owns a large portion of AESC. Those tax credits amount to roughly $3,375 for the average electric vehicle battery, according to UBS.

Across the country, a startup, Group14 Technologies, slowed construction of a battery materials factory in Moses Lake, Wash., after its customers in China balked at paying higher tariffs. Instead, the company is focusing on ramping up production in South Korea, said Rick Luebbe, Group14’s CEO.

“What caught the attention of our customers, particularly in China, was the really aggressive back-and-forth where the tariffs went up over 100%,” Luebbe said. “At that point, folks said, ‘You know what, maybe we’ll just hold off.’ ”

Trump and his aides have said they want companies to manufacture more in the U.S. They also want more U.S. mining of critical minerals, many of which form the building blocks of batteries. But they have criticized EVs and wind and solar energy, which drive demand for batteries.

Ben Dietderich, an Energy Department spokesperson, said the administration was investing in projects that would deliver a return on investment for Americans but did not directly address batteries.

The administration “is working to develop more secure supply chains for critical energy infrastructure,” Dietderich said.

A White House spokesperson, Kush Desai, said the administration would “shore up America’s supply of critical minerals” by investigating imports of such materials on national security grounds, mining for them offshore and repealing regulations.

Domestic battery makers have other problems besides the U.S. posture toward China. Chief among them is that EVs have not become as popular in the U.S. as many companies had expected.

As a result, many companies delayed, canceled or scaled back projects, even before Trump increased tariffs and Republican lawmakers sought to eliminate tax credits. Companies canceled over $6 billion in planned U.S. battery factories in the first quarter, according to Rhodium Group, a research firm that tracks investments with Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.

The Republican policy bill would further erode demand for electric cars — and, by extension, the batteries that power them — by scrapping a $7,500 tax credit available to many people who buy or lease them.

If that tax credit goes away, all planned U.S. battery plants will become unnecessary and more than two-thirds of existing capacity could shut down, according to an analysis by the Princeton University-led REPEAT Project.

Jennifer Granholm, the energy secretary under President Joe Biden, said scrapping clean-energy incentives would cost jobs and undermine U.S. energy security by making the country more dependent on China.

“For there to be an effective industrial strategy, you have to make America irresistible for investment,” said Granholm, a former governor of Michigan. “You can’t play a game with no offense.”

She said lawmakers should differentiate between Chinese equipment that could pose a threat to national security, such as devices that connect to the internet, and more basic materials like screws.

Others say the U.S. should welcome foreign investment, including from China, and learn from it.

“Restricting our market is just a first-order bad idea,” said Ann E. Harrison, an economist and former dean of the business school at the University of California, Berkeley. Competition drives innovation and efficiency, without which companies often struggle to survive in the long term, she said.

“The Chinese are already so far ahead,” Harrison said. “At this point, I don’t see us making the leap without fewer constraints.”

Group14, the startup, now expects to start production at its Washington state plant early next year, instead of this summer. The company makes a material that is designed to be a substitute for graphite, a key battery component that is almost entirely produced or processed in China.

“We can pull that back forward if there’s resolution on tariff uncertainty and we see that wave of demand pick back up again,” Luebbe said.

A spokesperson for AESC said the company planned to restart construction in South Carolina once the market stabilized. The company has already spent more than $1 billion developing the site. It also makes batteries for energy storage systems in Tennessee.

BMW expects to start making electric vehicles nearby in late 2026, as planned, a spokesperson, Phil Dilanni, said. He declined to say where the batteries would come from.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/06172025_tzr_tzr_134350.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-06-20 15:08:06.589058

During his first term, Mr. Trump revoked an Obama-era version of the California waiver, but in 2022, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. reinstated it.
The California waiver can be used to rein in toxic, smog-causing pollutants like soot, nitrogen dioxide and ozone that lead to asthma and lung disease.
Vickie Patton, the general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund, emphasized the limits of the Supreme Court’s ruling.","The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that fuel producers may challenge an unusual federal program that lets California set its own limits on vehicle tailpipe emissions to combat climate change.

The question for the justices was whether the challengers had suffered the sort of injuries that gave them standing to sue. When the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in December, it said it would not address whether the Environmental Protection Agency program granting California a waiver to set its own standards for greenhouse gas emissions was lawful.

A federal law authorizes the E.P.A. to grant California a waiver even though other states and localities are not free to set their own limits. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in an unsigned opinion last year, rejected the fuel producers’ lawsuit, ruling that the challengers lacked standing. The appeals court reasoned that the challengers would not be directly harmed by the waiver, since its immediate impacts were only on vehicle manufacturers.

Writing for a seven-member majority on Friday, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said the fuel producers would suffer harm from the waiver and so had standing to sue.

“Without California’s regulations in effect,” he wrote, “manufacturers would likely make more cars powered by gasoline and other liquid fuels, thereby increasing purchases of those fuels.”

Justice Kavanaugh stressed the limits of the ruling. “This case concerns only standing, not the merits,” he wrote. “E.P.A. and California may or may not prevail on the merits in defending E.P.A.’s approval of the California regulations.”

Created under the 1970 Clean Air Act, the California waiver has for decades served as a tool to allow the state, which has historically had the most polluted air in the nation, to enact tougher state-level clean air standards than those set by the federal government.

During his first term, Mr. Trump revoked an Obama-era version of the California waiver, but in 2022, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. reinstated it. During his presidential campaign last year, Mr. Trump promised to “rip up” the California waiver as part of his broader battle to destroy policies intended to combat climate change.

Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson each filed dissents. In hers, Justice Jackson wrote that the court should not have decided the issue, given that Mr. Trump was likely to once again rescind the waiver and make the issue moot.

The California waiver can be used to rein in toxic, smog-causing pollutants like soot, nitrogen dioxide and ozone that lead to asthma and lung disease. But in the 21st century, California rule makers have used the waiver to curb emissions like carbon dioxide, the invisible greenhouse gas emitted by burning coal and oil that is the chief cause of global warming.

Because the tailpipes of gasoline-powered cars are the nation’s largest source of carbon dioxide pollution, California’s use of the waiver to address that pollution soon grew into one of the nation’s, and then the world’s, most transformative and ambitious programs to fight climate change by transitioning to electric vehicles.

Vickie Patton, the general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund, emphasized the limits of the Supreme Court’s ruling.

“While the Supreme Court has now clarified who has grounds to bring a challenge to court,” she said in a statement, “the decision does not affect California’s bedrock legal authority to adopt pollution safeguards, nor does alter the lifesaving, affordable, clean cars program itself.”

Rob Bonta, California’s attorney general, said in a statement that the ruling was a disappointment. “The fight for clean air,” he said, “is far from over.”

This pollution harms endangered species such as the pallid sturgeon in the Mississippi River.","WASHINGTON— The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled today that the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service unlawfully discounted the harms to threatened and endangered wildlife of the EPA’s 2023-2025 renewable fuel standards.

The court held that the Fish and Wildlife Service’s conclusion that the renewable fuel standards had “no effect” on endangered species was arbitrary. The EPA had predicted significant land conversion resulting from the rule and had predicted potential harms to numerous threatened and endangered species.

The court sent the 2023-2025 rule back to the federal agencies for further analysis to ensure that it fully accounts for potential harms to imperiled species.

“This is a big win for people and wildlife over the misguided, damaging renewable fuel standard,” said Maggie Coulter, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute. “The court agreed that the government’s shoddy analysis cannot stand. The EPA and Fish and Wildlife Service need to fully assess the renewable fuels program’s harms to protected species and the places they live.”

The 2023-2025 renewable fuel standards were the first years the EPA could set biofuel targets at any level it deemed appropriate. Despite this flexibility, the EPA ignored the serious environmental harm from ever-growing biofuel requirements. It mandated 15 billion gallons of conventional corn ethanol for each of the next three years, plus 5.9 billion gallons of advanced biofuels in 2023, 6.5 billion gallons of advanced biofuels in 2024, and 7.3 billion gallons in 2025.

When corn is grown for fuel, there are fewer restrictions on the use of pesticides and fertilizers, which run off into nearby streams and rivers. This pollution harms endangered species such as the pallid sturgeon in the Mississippi River. It also worsens ocean dead zones, harming endangered sea turtles and other species.

“For decades, the EPA has incentivized growing corn and soybeans for fuel, ignoring or discounting this program’s harms to wildlife,” said Coulter. “The EPA and federal agencies finally have to consider serious harms, including the loss of native wetland and grassland habitats, increased water pollution from pesticide runoff, and worsening dead zone conditions in the Gulf of Mexico.”",https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/images/center-frog-logo-300.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 13:15:28.431809

It enables CDCs to grow local solar projects that create jobs, reduce energy costs, and build economic self-reliance.
These changes will empower our nonprofit and public-sector members to maintain their strong momentum in solar development—critical to achieving the Commonwealth’s decarbonization goals.","Boston — The Healey-Driscoll Administration is advancing a bold series of solar programs to lower costs and bring more energy into Massachusetts. This effort includes new regulations to accelerate solar development while also removing or significantly reducing solar-related charges on customer electricity bills.

“Solar is one of the fastest and cheapest forms of energy we can bring into Massachusetts right now,” said Governor Maura Healey. “ I want us moving as fast as states like Florida and Texas on this because it will increase reliability and bring down the cost of electricity. Our administration is moving quickly to reduce costs – that's why we released our Energy Affordability Agenda and filed legislation to get charges off bills and support the growth of new energy.”

“Massachusetts energy jobs are on the line as we work to get more solar into Massachusetts,” said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll. “Thousands of Massachusetts workers support our energy infrastructure and help us keep the lights on. Getting more solar into the state will help us strengthen our local workforce and keep our investments circulating in our state, rather than elsewhere.”

“Solar plays a critical role in the reliability of our energy grid, and we need to double down on solar programs that are working,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper. “On the hottest days of the year, it’s solar that helps keep the lights on and costs down. That’s because Massachusetts has prioritized getting solar on roofs and lowering customer bills. As the federal government stalls more energy projects than it advances, our administration is looking for ways to get more energy into our state and protect our grid from reckless energy policies.”

“While Massachusetts historically led in solar growth, we’re starting to fall behind other states,” said Energy Resources Commissioner Elizabeth Mahony. “As Texas and Florida take leadership positions in deploying new solar capacity, Massachusetts is moving quickly to modernize the SMART program and get solar built here.”

New SMART Regulations

The SMART regulations will create a sustainable incentive program that advances solar energy in Massachusetts while being able to quickly respond to changing market conditions. The regulations simplify the solar incentive program by providing a flat incentive rate for residential customers and enhanced incentive offerings for low-income households. The regulations implement strong consumer protection provisions to ensure best practices by solar installers resulting in customers receiving fair contracts and meaningful savings.

The program also takes an innovative approach to land use policy by establishing a mitigation fund that will collect dollars from large solar installations and use those funds to invest in conservation, biodiversity, and other programs targeted at protecting Massachusetts’ natural landscapes to offset the impacts of solar infrastructure. Additionally, the program provides added incentives for canopy projects and those installed on landfills and brownfields prioritizing projects in the built environment.

This SMART program deploys a mechanism to respond to market change annually through robust economic analysis. This will allow DOER to adjust certain program components in response to project development, economic drivers, and overall program costs.

Getting Charges Off Bills

The Healey-Driscoll Administration is boosting solar growth while lowering overall costs. Governor Healey’s Energy Affordability Agenda will help reduce charges on customer bills, which will be further lowered by the phase out of the Solar Carve Out I and Solar Carve Out II Programs. Ratepayers may see as much as $15-20 of costs eliminated from their bills each month by 2027 as a result of these programs coming to a close, which amounts to nearly $1.5 billion in total savings over the next 5 years. Her Energy Affordability, Independence, and Innovation Act will also reduce the value of net metering credits for new large net metering facilities will lead to a lower net metering surcharge, saving customers an estimated $380 million over 10 years. Currently, Massachusetts has the highest net metering compensation rates for large, standalone facilities in the country.

At the same time, the legislation will require solar projects participating in net metering to utilize the SMART program, which implements cost controls to ensure projects receive a tailored incentive to be economic, but nothing further. This will help drive down overall ratepayer costs under the Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard.

Massachusetts Needs More Power from Solar

Solar deployment to date has transformed the way that the New England electric grid operates, helping to keep the lights on and lowering prices. With solar, we do not need to build as much transmission and distribution infrastructure, saving hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars that ratepayers would otherwise pay to maintain reliability. During the summer, solar helps reduce peak demand and lower energy costs and grid investment needs. During the winter, solar production helps avoid the use of scarce fossil fuel resources by other electric generators, improving reliability and lowering energy prices for all customers. And during the spring and fall, solar can provide a significant portion of the region’s energy needs and reduce the wholesale costs of energy for everyone. For example, during the afternoon of April 20, 2025, over 55% of the electricity demand on the New England electric grid was met by distributed solar facilities. Demand on the electric grid that afternoon reached an all-time low.

Massachusetts has fallen behind other states – like Florida and Louisiana – in solar deployment and 374 MW of pending projects are stuck. For years, Massachusetts ranked in the top 5 states for solar installations but fell to 26th in the number of megawatts of solar installed in 2024. Interconnection and permitting challenges have played a large role in this decline, however, inadequate compensation frameworks and uncertainty around revenue streams have also contributed to the slowdowns. To address these challenges, the Healey-Driscoll Administration brokered a historic compromise to speed up siting and permitting timelines and proposed reforms to the interconnection process in the Energy Affordability, Independence, and Innovation Act. Further reforms to the SMART program will unlock languishing projects and create more solar jobs. While Massachusetts has seen increases in solar jobs each of the last three years, there are still 10% less solar jobs than there were in 2018. The reforms to the SMART Program will help create new jobs and restore employment levels to pre-pandemic levels.

Statements of Support

Valessa Souter-Kline, Northeast Regional Director at Solar Energy Industries Association:

“With the future of federal clean energy policy up in the air, Massachusetts must lead on establishing energy policies to lower costs for customers and meet fast-rising energy demand — and the release of SMART 3.0 is an important step in that process. Solar and storage are the fastest and most cost-effective ways to add energy to the grid. Now is the moment to leverage federal policies under threat to bring affordable solar and storage online. We look forward to working with the Commonwealth's leaders to ensure that SMART 3.0 maximizes the benefits that solar and storage provide: good jobs, a reliable grid, and lower bills.""

Nick d’Arbeloff, President of the Solar Energy Business Association of New England (SEBANE):

“On behalf of our members, SEBANE is thrilled to see SMART 3.0 announced and filed as emergency regulations. With solar losing ground in Washington and neighboring states, we are very grateful for Governor Healey’s leadership in acknowledging the role that solar plays in keeping rates stable, enhancing grid resilience, and reducing emissions—and for her willingness to take bold action. We expect this new program to greatly accelerate solar development and deployment across the Commonwealth.”

Kate Daniel, Northeast Regional Director at the Coalition for Community Solar Access:

""We are pleased to see the release of long-awaited updates to the SMART program, especially as the urgency to deploy solar is higher than ever. With cuts to federal tax credits looming, the industry appreciates the Healey Administration's recognition that these improvements are needed now to advance cost-effective community solar. We look forward to continuing our work with the Administration as we strive to achieve greater energy bill savings for the Massachusetts households who need them most.""

Emily Jones, Deputy Director of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) Massachusetts:

“Increasing access to solar for affordable housing is one of LISC Massachusetts’s top priorities because when owners have lower operating costs, they can invest those savings in better buildings and richer services. We applaud the Healey-Driscoll Administration for revitalizing the SMART incentives, which will spark many megawatts of new solar systems across the Commonwealth, driving both economic opportunity and energy affordability.”

Emily Haber, President & CEO, Massachusetts Association of Community Development Corporations:

""The SMART 3 Program is a win for community development in Massachusetts. It enables CDCs to grow local solar projects that create jobs, reduce energy costs, and build economic self-reliance. MACDC supports this effort as a vital step toward cleaner, more affordable energy for all neighborhoods across the Commonwealth.”

Ben Underwood, Co-CEO and Cofounder of Resonant Energy:

""In light of the federal government's targeted attack on the solar industry, which is putting enormous pressure on solar companies in Massachusetts and the 10,000 people we employ, it's deeply encouraging to see the DOER / Governor stepping up to defend our work and support the critical energy cost savings that solar projects create for affordable housing providers.""

Steve Long, Director of Policy and Partnerships at the Nature Conservancy in Massachusetts:

“The Nature Conservancy is pleased to express our support for the tangible enhancements to the MA Department of Energy Resources’ SMART Program. The program revisions, which included a through public engagement process, apply a science-based approach to efficiently, rapidly, and equitably accelerate solar energy development, while prioritizing solar capacity in the built environment and safeguarding the values and benefits our natural world provides. These benefits include biodiversity, clean air and water, our health and well-being, and the ability of our forests to absorb carbon emissions.”

Nick Paleologos, Executive Director of the Berkshire Theatre Group:

“The SMART program is a game changer. We couldn’t have managed to get solar panels for our mission driven nonprofit without help from the state energy conservation initiatives like this one. For Berkshire Theatre Group, we’ve lowered both our monthly utility costs as well as our carbon footprint. A win-win at a time when the long term sustainability of regional theatres like ours is a continuing challenge.”

Tina Bennett, Chief Strategy Office, PowerOptions

On behalf of our more than 500 members, PowerOptions applauds the Department of Energy Resources for advancing a thoughtful and responsive update to the SMART program. These changes will empower our nonprofit and public-sector members to maintain their strong momentum in solar development—critical to achieving the Commonwealth’s decarbonization goals. As mission-driven organizations, our members are eager to lead on climate action, but they need the financials to align. Based on our initial review, SMART 3.0 represents a meaningful step forward in supporting solar deployment and addressing energy affordability across Massachusetts.

The Big Question: How long should the U.S. continue with EV tax credits?","Every legislative decision around EV tax credits is like pulling teeth, from the battle to overhaul them to this new movement to repeal them. The House has already made its proposal, but that’s just one arm of the federal government. As it turns out, the Senate wants to end the current system even sooner — Like, possibly as soon as July 4 in certain cases. This means if you’re shopping for an EV, you might want to hurry up, as if the Senate gets its way, certain lease deals could be hit particularly hard.

We’re getting the most controversial news out of the way first, because everything else here is a bit less heavy. A new report suggests McKinsey put out the option of Stellantis selling Maserati, Ontario Premier Doug Ford recently had a close brush with alleged car thieves, and Jerry Bruckheimer and Tom Cruise want to get out there and hit the pace car again.

It’s a little grab bag of everything on today’s edition of The Morning Dump, proposed car laws and industry news and unusual car crime and film. I’ll be in the seat for the next few days taking over from Matt, so pull yourself a shot of espresso and get ready to read. Happy Friday, everyone.

The Senate Wants An Abrupt End To EV Tax Credits

We all kinda saw this coming, right? After making combustion engines a platform point, the current administration is working to roll back EV tax credits. After all, when you have a majority in the House and Senate aligned with the President, it’s easier to get stuff through before midterms have a chance of realigning the legislative branch. It’s not new information that EV tax credits are on the chopping block, but some of these credits could be axed sooner than expected. While the House proposes sunsetting credits for automakers who’ve built more than 200,000 EVs starting in 2026, the Senate is proposing a far more aggressive approach, as Automotive News reports.

The Senate version, released from the Finance Committee on June 16, treats all automakers the same by ending the EV tax credit within 180 days of the bill’s passage. That proposal would also cut the EV leasing credit immediately for vehicles that don’t meet local content rules and in 180 days for those that do.

“I think the Senate version is worse, totally cold turkey, and the lease thing is so important,” said Mike Murphy, a Republican political consultant and CEO of the American EV Jobs Alliance, a pro-EV lobbying group. “Bottom line is the Senate is really trying to put a stake in the heart of EV subsidies.”

The proposed immediate tax credit discontinuation for certain leases is especially important, because many cars that don’t quality for the full $7,500 tax credit if bought due to battery sourcing and/or place of assembly do qualify for the credit if they’re leased. Not only does this make driving a new EV more affordable, it also ensures a steady supply of gently used EVs once they come off lease in order to claw back some of the leasing super-cliff we’re now facing due to a downturn in new vehicle leasing starting in 2020.

While it’s true that EV tax credits for buyers probably can’t last forever, to me it seems soon to be phasing them out. We certainly haven’t reached natural price parity with combustion-powered equivalent models across the board, and many buyers are leaning on heavily discounted EV leases for reliable, reasonably inexpensive transportation now that the EPA’ footprint rule has basically killed subcompact cars. Going cold turkey on leasing credits for vehicles that don’t meet local content rules as soon as the bill passes would be a serious blow to consumers, not to mention the 180-day phase-out for qualifying vehicles. It’s no secret that credits play a huge role in consumer appeal and affordability, and J.D. Power has some surveys to back that up.

“For customers of Honda and Volkswagen, on average, the tax credit was the No. 1 purchase reason. For brands like Tesla, Cadillac and Chevrolet, among others, tax credits were amid the top three most influential purchase reasons,” [J.D. Power EV practice executive director Brent] Gruber said.

The self-imposed deadline for deciding when and how EV tax credits will be phased out is July 4, which means if you want to lock in a deal with absolute certainty regardless of whether the Senate’s proposal prevails, you have less than two weeks. Obviously, don’t go out and panic buy a car that you don’t need, but if you’re already shopping deals or have serious plans to lease an EV within the next three months, you might want to pick up the pace a touch.

The Trouble With Maserati

Oh, Maserati. What will we ever do with you? With total global sales more than halving last year to just 11,300 units, several canceled projects including the MC20 Folgore, and seemingly no easy way forward, it shouldn’t be surprising to hear Reuters report that Stellantis is mulling a sale of the Italian brand. This latest potential avenue seems to have started after the brand contracted McKinsey, a move that is rarely considered a good sign because no matter the industry, consulting is expensive and is generally an avenue to turn to when you’ve either exhausted all resources on hand or are trying something you’ve never done before. Considering Stellantis has extensive experience making cars and running car brands, seeking the help of big consultants for Maserati doesn’t paint a rosy picture of the present.

Stellantis hired consultant McKinsey early in April to advise it on the effects of the U.S. tariffs on Maserati and Alfa Romeo as the two brands prepare future plans. Stellantis affirmed then that it was fully committed to both brands.

However, a possible divestment of Maserati, its only luxury brand, is among the options McKinsey is exploring for Stellantis, the two sources told Reuters, adding the adviser’s assessment was still in the early stages. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly.

Aside from the fact that DS is also a Stellantis-owned luxury brand, it’s not surprising to hear that selling Maserati has been suggested. Part of the dark side of consulting is having a scapegoat to blame if you already want to sell an entity or strip it of its assets, and while a decision hasn’t been made yet, it doesn’t sound like a sale is entirely off the table. It’s a divisive issue that reportedly comes with internal friction.

Some board members think Stellantis is not in a position to sustainably re-launch Maserati and suggest selling it is the best option. Others think Maserati still has value and that selling its only luxury brand would be a huge reputational setback for Stellantis.

The hard part here is that both sides have compelling arguments. On the one hand, it’s hard to justify several six-figure cars with reworked Alfa Romeo bones (looking at you, Grecale and GranTurismo), but Stellantis doesn’t have a whole lot of parts bin options. What’s it gonna do, use the STLA Large platform seen underneath the Dodge Charger Daytona, or launch a Hemi-powered Maserati just to have a V8? The former still seems to need some ironing out, while the latter just wouldn’t fly. On the other, if Stellantis were to reposition Maserati, the brand could be more successful.

Looking at actual market values of products, the GranTurismo needs at least a $20,000 haircut to move it in line with the Mercedes-AMG GT, and the Grecale probably needs a price point $8,000 to $10,000 lower than where it’s at right now so it can cosy up to combustion-loyal Porsche Macan owners who’ll soon be left without a really close replacement. Right now, Stellantis’ official statement to Reuters is “Respectfully, Maserati is not for sale,” but it’ll take some serious product and strategy to rebuild the storied marque. If Stellantis isn’t able to put in the work, maybe exploring a potential sale is the best option. Maserati was doing great when Ferrari owned it, maybe it’s time to see if Maranello wants it back.

Alleged Car Thieves Reportedly Tried To Steal A Car From A Sitting Politician’s House

If you’re American and watch cable news, you’re probably now aware of Ontario Premier Doug Ford, brother of the late Rob Ford. He’s been an unexpected voice in the tariff war, and while we aren’t going to get into Canadian politics here, one thing everyone can say is that he’s certainly a visible public figure in North America. It’s not surprising that the leader of a province would have a security detail in case anything happened, and while no threats to safety have been posed, something really dumb almost happened—Global News reports that four people have been arrested on charges of possessing an electronic device for motor vehicle theft after they were reportedly caught casing Ford’s residence on Tuesday.

Around 12:30 a.m., police said officers saw people in a vehicle wearing masks and slowing down as it approached a driveway in the area of Lawrence Avenue West and Royal York Road, the area where Ford lives.

A spokesperson for Toronto police confirmed that the incident was believed to be targeting Ford’s home address.

Police said they initiated a vehicle stop and one of the suspects got out of the car to run. Inside the car, they said they found a key reprogramming device and a programmable master key.

If I were to hazard a guess, the “master key” was probably just a blank fob, but with the right fob and programming device, that can be enough to steal whichever make of car is named on the fob. Still, this is what we call instant karma, but it also points to a problem that still needs tamping down. As we’ve previously detailed, organized car theft is a big problem in parts of Canada, with stolen vehicles exported to countries with relaxed rules on what vehicles make it in. There’s no easy solution here, so it’s understandable that more and more Canadian car owners are installing bollards on their driveways.

Hit The Pace Car Again

If we’re talking about the greatest car films of all time, “Days of Thunder” with Tom Cruise has to be up there on the list. From the rental car race to the cinematography of the cars on the ovals, it works well if you don’t take it too seriously, and despite basically being “Top Gun” with cars, it’s drawn admiration from some big names including Quentin Tarantino. If you still love it, you’re going to like this tidbit of news coming down the wire.

In an interview with ET from the red carpet of “F1: The Movie”, Jerry Bruckheimer has said that he and Tom Cruise are collaborating on a sequel to the iconic NASCAR film. We don’t know much right now, as it sounds like the project is in early development, but Bruckheimer said “We’ll have something really exciting for an audience once we pull it together.”

If this ends up happening, it’s going to rule. Has everything from the original “Days of Thunder” aged perfectly? No, but give it the leeway usually needed for a 35-year-old film and it still holds up pretty well if you take merely a semi-serious approach. Plus, if “Top Gun 2” was a smash hit, who says the “Days of Thunder” concept won’t be more successful when rebooted than it was at the original box office? It feels about time we had another NASCAR film, and I’m rooting for Bruckheimer and Cruise to pull this off.

What I’m Listening To While Writing TMD

Fair warning: The song I’m about to show you isn’t exactly outstanding or critically acclaimed, but it is interesting. There’s always something fascinating about insane collaborations between people you’d never think would be on the same track. In this case, it’s Ludacris, Zakk Wilde, Chad Kroeger from Nickelback, and the second singer of Three Days Grace, Matt Walst.

See, before Walst joined Three Days Grace, he had a band called My Darkest Days, and that effort managed to pull all these artist together for a debut single called, um, “Porn Star Dancing.” I mean, Chad Kroeger makes sense considering My Darkest Days was signed to 604 Records, but Zakk Wilde is a bit left-field for this flavor of music and Ludacris was only originally supposed to be on the Canadian version, but come on. Of course Luda rapping about strip clubs would have appeal everywhere, it was only a matter of time before his feature made it to the U.S. release.

I’m struggling to find an organic reason why “Porn Star Dancing” should’ve taken off, but it was big in Canada thanks to CanCon laws and the last dredges of post-grunge popularity, and it went to number one on the Billboard Modern Rock chart in America. The zeitgeist of 2010’s early stage of recession recovery probably helped because this is the sort of trashy, lecherous guilty pleasure that could get the people going in an era of trash TV and general leering. Truly one of the more bizarre modern rock tracks, but hey, if you haven’t heard of it before, now you have an unhinged musical fact to pull out at parties. Actually, given the subject matter, maybe “pull out” is the wrong way to phrase it.

The layoffs will reduce the staff at the agency to fewer than 200, around one-seventh of its total at the start of 2025. The notices put journalists and support staff on paid leave until they are officially let go on 1 September.

In March, Donald Trump accused Voice of America of spreading “anti-American” and partisan “propaganda” and called it “the voice of radical America”. He later signed an executive order that effectively called for the dismantling of the agency and put nearly all Voice of America reporters on paid leave.

Judge orders Mahmoud Khalil be freed from detention

A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to release Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil from immigration detention, a ruling that would end his three-month detention.

Judge Michael Farbiarz made the ruling from the bench in federal court in New Jersey today. Lawyers for the Columbia graduate had asked a federal judge to immediately release him on bail from a Louisiana jail, or else transfer him to New Jersey, where he can be closer to his wife and newborn son.

The same judge had ruled earlier that the government can continue to detain the legal US resident based on allegations that he lied on his green card application. Khalil disputes the accusations that he wasn’t forthcoming on the application.

Joseph Gedeon

A fresh wave of violent threats and incidents targeting elected officials broke out in the US this week, prompting more urgent calls for increased security measures just days after the killing of a Minnesota state legislator and the shooting of another.

Amid a series of attacks involving federal and local officials, the latest incidents included death threats against Zohran Mamdani, a New York mayoral candidate; a purported road rage attack on Max Miller, the Ohio congressman; and an alleged kidnapping attempt targeting Paul Young, the mayor of Memphis.

The New York police department (NYPD) hate crimes taskforce is investigating multiple death threats against Mamdani, a Muslim democratic socialist candidate in the final stretch of his campaign who is endorsed by national figures such as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The intimidation included threats to blow up his car and Islamophobic voicemails left at Mamdani’s office in the city’s Queens borough.

“The violent and specific language of what appears to be a repeat caller is alarming and we are taking every precaution,” his campaign said on Thursday, blaming the threats on “dehumanizing, Islamophobic rhetoric designed to stoke division and hate”.

Donald Trump has once again brought up his baseless claim that the 2020 election was fraudulent, this time saying in a Truth Social post that he wants a “special prosecutor” to investigate the election.

Writing on his social media platform on Friday, Trump lashed out at his predecessor, saying:

“Biden was grossly incompetent, and the 2020 election was a total FRAUD! The evidence is MASSIVE and OVERWHELMING. A Special Prosecutor must be appointed. This cannot be allowed to happen again in the United States of America! Let the work begin!”

Trump’s latest attempts at reviving his longstanding grievance against Biden comes as his administration faces the critical decision of whether to involve the US in the Iran-Israel conflict, a question that many foreign policy experts have likened to the US decision to invade Iraq in 2003.

Elizabeth Warren has confronted the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, over reports that the state department is considering redirecting $500m from USAID to the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).

In a letter addressed to Rubio and USAID’s acting administrator, Kenneth Jackson, the Massachusetts senator argued that the GHF, a self-proclaimed aid organisation that is backed by the Israeli and US governments, “marks an alarming departure from the professional humanitarian organizations that have worked on the ground, in Gaza and elsewhere, for decades”.

“The questions surrounding GHF – its funding sources and connection to the Trump Administration, its use of private contractors, its ability to serve and be seen as a neutral entity, its abandonment by its founders, and its basic competence in providing aid – must be answered before the State Department commits any funding to the organization,” Warren wrote in the letter, a copy of which was provided exclusively to the Guardian.

The vice-president is expected to tour a multiagency Federal Joint Operations Center and a Federal Mobile Command Center. Vance’s office did not release a topic of discussion for his visit, but it is speculated to be related to the protests against the Trump administration’s mass deportation operations.

Trump deployed national guard troops to downtown LA earlier this month in response to the protests. The state sued for a temporary injunction to stop the deployment, but a federal appeals court ruled in the president’s favor on Thursday night while that legal challenge continues.

A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding billions of dollars in transportation funds from states that don’t agree to participate in some immigration enforcement actions.

Twenty states sued after they said the US transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, threatened to cut off funding to states that refused to comply with President Trump’s immigration agenda. US district judge John McConnell Jr has barred federal transportation officials from carrying out that threat before the lawsuit is fully resolved.

An attorney for the Department of Transportation had argued that the department had the legal discretion to set conditions on states receiving the congressionally appropriated funds.

“The Court finds that the States have demonstrated they will face irreparable and continuing harm if forced to agree to Defendants’ unlawful and unconstitutional immigration conditions imposed in order to receive federal transportation grant funds,” wrote McConnell, adding that the states are “being put in a position of relinquishing their sovereign right to decide how to use their own police officers” and are “at risk of losing the trust built between local law enforcement and immigrant communities”.

US supreme court rules fuel firms can challenge California’s emission limits

Oliver Milman

Fossil fuel companies are able to challenge California’s ability to set stricter standards reducing the amount of polluting coming from cars, the US supreme court has ruled in a case that is set to unravel one of the key tools used to curb planet-heating emissions in recent years.

The conservative-dominated supreme court voted by seven to two to back a challenge by oil and gas companies, along with 17 Republican-led states, to a waiver that California has received periodically from the federal government since 1967 that allows the state to set tougher standards than national rules limiting pollution from cars. The state has separately stipulated that only zero-emission cars will be able to be sold there by 2035.

Although states are typically not allowed to set their own standards aside from the federal Clean Air Act, California has been given unique authority to do so via a waiver that has seen it become a pioneer in pushing for cleaner cars. Other states are allowed to copy California’s stricter standard, too.

But oil and gas companies, as well as Republican politicians, have complained about the waiver, arguing that it caused financial harm.

State discounts for purchasing heat pumps, e-bikes, and electric cars and trucks will be cut in half next year, Colorado economists announced Wednesday.

The tax credits, some made available just last year, will be slashed in 2026 because of a dismal state revenue forecast, said Emily Dohrman, senior economist for nonpartisan Legislative Council Staff, at the Joint Budget Committee’s quarterly meeting.

Lawmakers enacted the green tax credits in 2023 to make electric transportation and heating and cooling more appealing to Coloradans. But the availability of the credits hinges on state economic forecasts showing at least 4% projected revenue growth in the next fiscal year, or else they are cut by 50%.

Up until recently, it looked like the state’s forecast revenue growth requirement would be reached. Just a few months ago in March, state economists projected the green tax credits would remain fully intact. But since then, “lower collections and a reduction in expectations for the economy” soured the June forecast, Dohrman said. She said revenue is expected to increase only by 2% next year.

The halving of the state incentives paired with Congressional Republicans’ proposal to eliminate federal incentives for electric vehicles as part of their big budget bill would result in far less money available to help Coloradans electrify their homes and transportation.

Transportation and buildings are two of the top greenhouse-gas emitting sectors in Colorado. Proponents of electric vehicles credited the combination of federal and state incentives for a boom in EV sales in Colorado last year.

The state tax credits for electric cars and trucks were scheduled to range between $1,500 and $8,000 for next year, depending on the kind of vehicle. Tax credits for e-bikes were supposed to be $500 ($50 for retailers and $450 for purchasers), and tax credits for heat pumps were scheduled to range between $250 and $2,000, depending on the kind of system. All will be halved.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court sided on Friday with fuel producers that had opposed California's standards for vehicle emissions and electric cars under a federal air pollution law, agreeing that their legal challenge to the mandates should not have been dismissed.

The justices in a 7-2 ruling overturned a lower court's decision to dismiss the lawsuit by a Valero Energy subsidiary and fuel industry groups. The lower court had concluded that the plaintiffs lacked the required legal standing to challenge a 2022 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency decision to let California set its own regulations.

""The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,"" conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the majority.

The dispute centered on an exception granted to California during Democratic former President Joe Biden's administration to national vehicle emission standards set by the agency under the landmark Clean Air Act anti-pollution law.

Though states and municipalities are generally preempted from enacting their own limits, Congress let the EPA waive the preemption rule to let California set certain regulations that are stricter than federal standards.

The EPA's 2022 action reinstated a waiver for California to set its own tailpipe emissions limits and zero-emission vehicle mandate through 2025, reversing a 2019 decision made during Republican President Donald Trump's first administration rescinding the waiver.

Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the decision.

Noting the powerful corporate interests involved, Jackson said, ""The court's remarkably lenient approach to standing in this case contrasts starkly with the stern stance it has taken in cases concerning the rights of ordinary citizens.""

Biden's EPA had also approved a waiver for a new set of California standards aiming to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035. Trump, however, signed a congressional resolution barring that landmark plan on June 12. California and 10 other states have sued to challenge the repeal.

Valero's Diamond Alternative Energy and related groups challenged the reinstatement of California's waiver, arguing that the decision exceeded the EPA's power under the Clean Air Act and inflicted harm on their bottom line by lowering demand for liquid fuels.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit threw out the lawsuit in 2024, finding that the challengers lacked the necessary standing to bring their claims because there was no evidence that a ruling in their favor might affect the decisions of auto manufacturers in a way that would result in fewer electric and more combustion vehicles to be sold.

California, the most-populous U.S. state, has received more than 100 waivers under the Clean Air Act.

The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has taken a skeptical view toward broad authority for federal regulatory agencies and has restricted the powers of the EPA in some important rulings in recent years.

In 2024, the court blocked the EPA's ""Good Neighbor"" rule aimed at reducing ozone emissions that may worsen air pollution in neighboring states. In 2023, the court hobbled the EPA's power to protect wetlands and fight water pollution. In 2022, it imposed limits on the agency's authority under the Clean Air Act to reduce coal- and gas-fired power plant carbon emissions.

The data from the survey reflects a growing public consensus that the industries driving the climate crisis should be held financially accountable for the destruction they caused.

A remarkable 86% of people support government spending on climate disaster relief–provided it is funded by tax on coal, oil, and gas polluters. Notably, 89% of BJP supporters and 82% of Congress (INC) supporters agree on the need to increase taxes on oil and gas corporations to support those hit hardest by extreme weather events, highlighting rare cross-party unity on climate accountability.

The study, jointly commissioned by Greenpeace International and Oxfam International, was launched today at the UN Climate Meetings in Bonn (SB62), where government representatives are discussing climate policies, including ways to mobilise at least US$ 1.3 trillion annually in climate finance for Global South countries by 2035. The survey was conducted across 13 countries, including most G7 countries.

Selomi Garnaik, Climate and Energy Campaigner at Greenpeace India said: “Communities in developing countries are paying the price for a crisis they did not cause, while fossil fuel companies continue to profit. The science is clear—over a century of burning coal, oil, and gas has fueled the climate damage we face today. This new survey reveals strong public support for making polluters pay. As we head into COP30, governments have a clear public mandate to act- stand with the people, not the polluters, and make fossil fuel companies pay for the harm they have caused.”

The study, run by Dynata, was unveiled alongside the Polluters Pay Pact, a global alliance of communities on the frontlines of climate disasters. The Pact demands that governments make oil, gas and coal corporations – not the people – pay their fair share for the damages they cause, through the introduction of new taxes and fines.

The Pact is backed by firefighters and other first responders, trade unions and worker groups, and mayors from countries including Australia, Brazil, Bangladesh, India, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, and South Africa, the US, and plaintiffs in landmark climate cases from Pacific island states to Switzerland.

The Pact is also supported by over 60 NGOs, including Oxfam International, 350.org, Avaaz, Islamic Relief UK, Asociación Interamericana para la Defensa del Ambiente (AIDA), Indian Hawkers Alliance, Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, Jubilee Australia and the Greenpeace network.

The survey’s findings published today reveal broad public support for the core demands of the Polluters Pay Pact, as climate impacts worsen worldwide and global inequality grows.

Key findings of the survey include:

81% of people surveyed globally would support taxes on the oil, gas, and coal industry to pay for damages caused by fossil-fuel driven climate disasters like storms, floods, droughts and wildfires.

87% of people surveyed in India support channeling revenues from higher taxes on oil and gas corporations towards communities most impacted by the climate crisis. Climate change is disproportionately hitting people in Global South countries, who are historically least responsible for greenhouse gas emissions.

68% of people surveyed globally felt that the fossil fuel industry and the super-rich had a negative influence on politics in their country. 77% say they would be more willing to support a political candidate who prioritises taxing the super-rich and the fossil fuel industry.

Amitabh Behar, Executive Director of Oxfam International, said: “Fossil fuel companies have known for decades about the damage their polluting products wreak on humanity. Corporations continue to cash in on climate devastation, and their profiteering destroys the lives and livelihoods of millions of women, men and children, predominantly those in the Global South who have done the least to cause the climate crisis. Governments must listen to their people and hold polluters responsible for their damages. A new tax on polluting industries could provide immediate and significant support to climate-vulnerable countries, and finally incentivise investment in renewables and a just transition.”

The Polluters Pay Pact demonstrates popular support for the campaign to make polluters pay. The campaign is being waged throughout 2025 in countries worldwide and in critical international forums, including the 4th International Conference on Financing for Development (FFD4), the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30), and negotiations for a UN tax convention that could include new rules to make multinational oil and gas companies pay their fair share for their pollution.

Well, okay, Aristotle didn’t put it that way, but we are betting that a lot of utility investors are hoping so. Here’s what happened on the same day. Two news stories. USA Network, the Gannet news service, reported that the N.Y. State legislature is not just looking at rising electricity rates, but they are legislating. Eight bills passed by the Senate and on their way to the Assembly, calling for the designation of an additional Public Service Commission member as consumer advocate (weren’t all the members supposed to protect consumers?), requiring the utilities to give refunds if they exceed allowed returns (any reimbursement for utilities when they don’t earn the allowed return?), allowing the PSC to consider stress suffered by consumers when the power fails due to utility misconduct (make work for psychologists?) and lengthening the time the PSC can take to make a decision to 14 months (justice delayed is justice denied?).

While the proposed legislation seems aimed more at symptoms than underlying causes, there is a serious problem. New York’s electricity rates are the eighth highest in the nation (they have been high for decades—nothing new), 1.2 million gas and electric customers are at least two months behind in their bills, and the utilities are looking for double-digit percentage increases. Maybe the legislators should have acted sooner.

The second story (NY Times) says that Georgians have become angry about high electric bills (Georgia rates are in the middle of the pack) and this anger might just affect the voting for public service commissioner this year. The story says that the PSC has approved six rate hikes for Georgia Power in two years and bills have risen 33% as a result. The head of the state senate finance committee tried to introduce legislation to set up an advocate to represent consumers in court actions and to get data centers to pay more for electricity, but got nowhere. Georgia’s governor signed a three rate year freeze agreement with Georgia Power, which seems like a case of locking the barn door after the horse is stolen. Georgia Power’s cost escalation can be traced to its enormously expensive Vogtle nuclear project (completed at three times its original cost estimate), which had the wholesale support of the PSC through thick and thin. The big question in Georgia is whether consumers are angry enough to elect Democrats to the PSC, which has not had one since 2007.

As we have argued before, electricity rates in the US will rise at an above-inflation rate for years to come to pay for rehab of a neglected system and to pay for facilities to serve growing demand. Prices will rise not because greener plant is more expensive, but because all new plant is more expensive. Furthermore, the expected demand from data centers will require a stronger networ,k and somebody will have to pay for those extra upgrades. Who, the well-connected and enormously rich internet companies, or the consumer? Given the current state of politics, we’d sooner bet that the consumer will get stuck with an inordinate percentage of the bill than the party actually responsible for the cost increase. If we are right, expect a lot more news stories about rising electricity bills and the political consequences thereof.

In other words, what are federal agencies doing to enable innovation without stifling the growth of our energy future?","The future of energy is rapidly evolving. The explosion of artificial intelligence (AI) and the enormous energy infrastructure it demands will continue to drive unprecedented electricity needs.

Goldman Sachs projects that U.S. power demand could grow by as much as 20% by the decade’s end, in large part due to the construction of data centers. These AI facilities are expected to account for nearly 8% of all U.S. electricity use by 2030, a 3% rise since 2022.

As technologies like artificial intelligence continue to expand, these data centers need reliable, round-the-clock power. Our legislative policies and regulations must rise to meet the moment.

How Litigation Tactics Are Undermining Project Development

In the last decade, the energy industry has seen a surge in litigation designed to delay projects’ construction and block permits, creating regulatory uncertainty and, ultimately, making energy infrastructure projects financially untenable. A prime example is the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP), where state permits were repeatedly challenged under the Clean Water Act. Virginia granted the MVP its water quality certification in 2021, which was upheld by the Fourth Circuit Court in 2023 after opponents sued. In West Virginia, similar legal tactics from environmental groups resulted in the state’s certification being vacated by the Fourth Circuit in April of 2023. Though West Virginia reissued its certification in June of that year, these types of legal tactics resulted in years of court hearings and construction delays that increased the project’s costs.

While at the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, I saw firsthand how important it is to implement smart and innovative regulations. Rules matter. Safety matters. Environmental protection matters. But rules and regulations have been inappropriately weaponized to stop critical infrastructure projects, and policymakers must recognize this growing pattern. Allowing these laws to be misused, not to ensure clean outcomes, but rather, to increase costs and the barrier to entry for energy projects, is not responsible policy; it’s sabotage.

The Race to Connect Data Centers with Reliable Energy

Data centers can’t run on good intentions. Many companies, whether Meta, Amazon, or Google, are co-locating their AI centers directly with power generation. Meta has finalized a 20-year agreement to harness nuclear energy to power its latest AI data center, while Google has committed to utilizing solar power to support its data centers’ operations.

Pressure on our energy infrastructure is quickly mounting, with pipeline companies receiving multiple requests to connect to more than 40 prospective data centers across 10 states. Earlier this year, Energy Transfer announced a deal to supply natural gas to a CloudBurst Data Centers facility in Central Texas, which highlights how traditional energy companies are stepping up to help power emerging technologies.

Though data centers will utilize different energy sources, the construction and connection will be a greater question than what powers the facility. In other words, what are federal agencies doing to enable innovation without stifling the growth of our energy future?

There’s no more straightforward answer than a true “all-of-the-above” strategy—one that embraces renewable development and recognizes the essential role of natural gas. Natural gas pipelines are stepping up quickly, adapting to support AI’s energy-hungry appetite. From Texas to Pennsylvania, these pipelines effectively bridge the gap between intermittent renewable energy sources and the constant energy needs of data centers and industries.

How Federal Leadership Can Enable Energy Innovation

The federal government is responding. Under President Donald Trump’s declaration of a national energy emergency, the Army Corps of Engineers is expediting pipeline permits under the Clean Water Act. This kind of stability and efficiency is not just beneficial; it is essential.

Federal agencies must stop dragging their feet and do their part to issue timely permits, provide clear guidance, and, crucially, conduct regular, forward-looking analyses on how energy demand is evolving in real time. The rise of AI is fueling the most significant power demand surge of our generation, and midstream companies like Energy Transfer are responding accordingly, engaging directly with data centers to build infrastructure that delivers onsite, gas-powered reliability. The private sector is moving fast to meet the moment. The federal government can’t afford to fall behind.

American energy policy must reject the false narrative between environmental progress and economic growth—both can and must advance together. The real threat lies in bureaucratic inertia that stifles innovation. A cleaner, more prosperous future requires investment, public-private coordination, and regulatory clarity. Natural gas is well-positioned to lead this transition. By guaranteeing that federal agencies act quickly, transparently, and in partnership with industry leaders, the next generation of energy innovation will be ready to power it.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/litigation-court-legal-business-lawyers-businessman-envato.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 12:26:00.653280

Portents of a new Industrial Revolution Despite all the political (and climate change) pyrotechnics of Trump’s tumultuous first months in office this year, those deeper processes of technological change have continued their ceaseless, mechanistic march toward transformation.","He lived over 1,000 years ago, but King Canute’s life still has some important lessons for our own time. After conquering England, Denmark, Norway, and part of Sweden, he forged a vast North Sea empire that made him, by the year 1030, the greatest of all the Viking kings. At that peak of power, he ordered his courtiers to place a throne on the seashore. There, according to a contemporaneous account, he shouted at the rising tide: “Thou, too, are subject to my command, as the land on which I am seated is mine and no one has ever resisted my commands with impunity. I command you then not to flow over my land, nor presume to wet the feet and the robe of your Lord.”

But the tide, of course, kept rising and waves soon washed over the legs of his royal person. Stunned and chastened, Canute leapt backwards, saying, “Let all men know how empty and worthless is the power of kings.”

In our time, specifically on January 20, 2025, Donald Trump, who had vanquished his rivals, took office with full control of Congress, making him an exceptionally powerful president. On that day, he ordered his courtiers to set up an executive desk at the Capital One Arena in downtown Washington, D.C. There, before waves of cheers from MAGA-capped supporters, he commanded that the U.S. quit the Paris climate accord, announcing: “We are going to save over a trillion dollars by withdrawing from that treaty.”

Retiring to the Oval Office, he then signed another executive order eliminating “the electric vehicle (EV) mandate” by ending “unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies.” More broadly, that decree also removed any barrier to the development of “domestic energy resources—with particular attention to oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower…and nuclear energy resources.”

Like King Canute before him, President Trump was attempting to do nothing less than command the tides to recede. Not the ocean tides, of course, but the no less powerful tides of economic and technological change. For the United States, and indeed the world, is at the cusp of a new industrial revolution in the way we live and work that will, within the coming decades, do nothing less than save humanity from the rising threat of global warming.

America’s energy transitions

To grasp the full import and unstoppable power of this impending change, let’s take a moment to place our current era in its historical energy context. Over the past 500 years, as I argued in my book To Govern the Globe, human life has been transformed by three great revolutions in the basic energy infrastructure that drove the global economy and shaped all human life on this planet.

Starting in the sixteenth century, European nations forged the world’s first maritime empires through technologies that maximized the power of nature’s raw energy. In the era’s first technological advance, Portugal’s agile sailing ship, the caravel, used multiple sails to master the winds and thereby conquer sea lanes from the South Atlantic to the South China Sea. Somewhat later, the Dutch district at Zaan (near Amsterdam) became the world’s first dedicated industrial zone, where 150 powerful windmills cut logs into low-cost lumber for shipyards that would build the world’s largest merchant fleet with 4,000 ships on the high seas. Starting in the fifteenth century, Portugal combined water mills with massed teams of enslaved laborers on the island of São Tomé off the coast of Africa to create a new form of agribusiness, the fazenda or sugar plantation, whose phenomenal profitability—achieved by using cruel coercion to push the energy output of the human body beyond its natural limits—soon led to the spread of slavery to Brazil, the Caribbean, and the American colonies.

During the nineteenth century, Britain’s coal-fired industrial revolution brought an energy transition that would move the world quickly beyond the wind and muscle power of the previous four centuries. Steam engines started powering factories in 1786, riverboats in 1810, railways in 1829, trans-Atlantic steamships by the 1830s, and the British Royal Navy’s warships by the 1840s. Meanwhile, Britain’s coal production soared from just nine million tons in 1800 to a peak of 292 million tons in 1913. By the 1850s, an armada of steam engines was transforming the nature of work worldwide—powering factories, driving sawmills, threshing grains, husking rice, pulling gang plows, and crushing sugarcane. Coal-powered construction equipment sculpted the Earth’s surface, as steam shovels (patented in 1839) moved mountains, steam dredges (1844) cut canals, and steamrollers (1867) flattened roadways. Between 1880 and 1900, the number of steam engines in the United States tripled from 56,000 to 156,000, accounting for 77 percent of all the power that drove this country’s first industrial revolution.

That era of coal-fired energy, for both steam engines and electrical generation, lasted for nearly a century until it, too, began to fade during the 1950s before the power of petroleum. Even on the eve of World War II, when the United States produced two-thirds of the world’s petroleum, oil accounted for only one-third of its energy supply and just 10 percent of that of other industrial societies like Europe and Japan. However, as American automobile ownership climbed from 40 million units in 1950 to 213 million in 2000, oil consumption surged from 6.5 million barrels daily to a peak of 20 million barrels. By the time the 1973 Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) oil embargo roiled American life, with gas lines of angry motorists wrapping round the block in cities across the country, oil accounted for 46 percent of total energy needs in the U.S., 60 percent in Western Europe, and an overwhelming 73 percent in Japan.

The seeds of change

After those three energy transitions over the span of 500 years, the world is now at the cusp of a fourth great transformation that will indeed prove critical for humanity’s survival. Energy from coal and oil may have freed the world from the curse of slavery and brought unprecedented prosperity to millions, but burning all that carbon also carried the threat of climate change. As early as 1896, Swedish physicist Svante Arrhenius published the world’s first report on global warming, predicting with uncanny prescience that a continued increase in carbon (CO2) emissions would raise “the temperature in the Arctic regions… about 8 degrees to 9 degrees C.” Between the Rio Earth Summit that finally recognized the problem in 1992 and the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015, where 195 nations signed an agreement to limit CO2 emissions, the world started a fitful and initially unsuccessful transition to alternative energy.

At the outset, it seemed as if governments were trying to force a shift to alternative energy that carried high costs for questionable results. Solar panels were expensive then and their energy output was low. The few electric-powered cars cost a relative fortune and couldn’t go very far. By 2016, the climate issue had also become bitterly partisan, with the first Trump administration banning the federal government from any mention of climate change while trying desperately to save coal-fired electrical plants and introducing 74 executive actions to weaken environmental protections.

But as had happened during the world’s earlier energy transitions over the past 500 years, technological innovation was already fusing with economic rationality to catalyze a phenomenally powerful transformation in the world’s energy infrastructure. After solar and wind power began spreading across the globe around 2000, engineering innovation and economies of scale began making alternative energy not only ever more affordable but also ever more efficient. Between 2010 and 2019, the cost of solar power fell by 82 percent from $0.37 per kilowatt hour to just $0.05. By 2020, the International Energy Agency, known for its rigorous analysis, reported that the world’s best solar schemes already had the “cheapest… electricity in history.”

By the time Joseph Biden took office in 2021, the tides of technological change were just starting to turn. In a bid to ride that tide, the Biden administration invested a massive $1 trillion in “clean energy” — including semiconductor manufacturing ($446 billion), clean power ($188 billion), and electric vehicles ($182 billion).

Despite all the Biden-Harris election hype about factories built and jobs created, the gains for the country’s energy infrastructure were still… well, distinctly incremental. By the end of Biden’s term in December 2024, wind and solar had inched up to just 17 percent of U.S. electrical generation, though they had finally passed coal, that dirty fuel left over from the horse-and-buggy era, which fell to a historic low of 15 percent. Simultaneously, however, natural gas surged to a record 43 percent of the U.S. energy supply, meaning that carbon was still king. Compared to Norway where a proliferation of 400 chargers for every 100,000 Norwegians has allowed EVs to hit 90 percent of new car sales, even leading American states like California still only have a pathetic 46 chargers per 100,000 population—a key reason EVs still account for just 8% of this country’s new auto sales.

But beneath such dismal statistics, by the end of Biden’s term there were also some significant signs of deep, underlying change. In September 2024, an industry group reported that solar energy, which had been four times more expensive than fossil fuels in 2010, was now less than half the cost (56 percent lower) than them.

Portents of a new Industrial Revolution

Despite all the political (and climate change) pyrotechnics of Trump’s tumultuous first months in office this year, those deeper processes of technological change have continued their ceaseless, mechanistic march toward transformation. Indeed, in recent months there have been some telling signs—veritable portents—that we are indeed at the cusp of a transition to alternative energy of sufficient power to drive a new American industrial revolution. Let’s read the tea leaves.

In April, the first driverless 18-wheeler “robotruck” appeared on a U.S. highway, delivering refrigerated goods along Interstate 45 in Texas. In May, Elon Musk announced the debut of Tesla’s “cyber cab” service in Austin, Texas, with 10 driverless trial cars that are expected to lead to the deployment of “hundreds of thousands of robotaxis across the U.S.” Lending substance to that claim, Alphabet’s competing Waymo taxi service announced in May that its paid driverless rides had doubled to 10 million in the previous five months, launching the company on “a path to profitability.” Within days, China’s top EV car maker BYD had dropped a “price bombshell” by slashing the sticker price on its top-selling Seagull subcompact to an amazingly low $7,700—and that, mind you, is for a brand-new sedan loaded with self-driving features and able to travel a 200-mile range on a single charge. These days in America, it would be hard to beat that price with any sort of gas-powered car, even, say, a 2012 Honda Civic with 150,000 miles on the clock.

But perhaps most important, in March, despite Donald Trump’s many prohibitions, wind and solar surged to 25 percent of the U.S. electrical supply, and when combined with other forms of “clean energy” like hydropower, already generated 51 percent of the country’s total electricity output, surpassing fossil fuels for the first time. “This is a first signal,” explained energy analyst Nicolas Fulghum, “that the U.S. is approaching a tipping point where clean power takes the lead over fossil generation, and where the importance of coal and gas inevitably starts to fade.” Indeed, just this month, the authoritative International Energy Agency announced that the “global energy investment scene is changing fast,” with two-thirds of this year’s $3.3 trillion investment in energy production slated for “renewables” (such as wind and solar), double the amount for fossil fuels.

The shape of the future

If that impending transformation follows the pattern of history’s past transitions, technology and the global economy are about to achieve a sudden, silent synergy that will unleash not just a tide but a veritable tsunami of socio-economic change. To cite some past examples, within the 15 years after George Stephenson launched The Rocket, a steam locomotive with an average speed of just 13 miles per hour in 1829, Britain covered the country with 2,200 miles of rail lines, transforming English life and work. And in the 10 years after 1907-1908, when Henry Ford upgraded the mass production of his Model-T motorcar, the price for it dropped steadily from $850 to just $260 while the number of automobiles registered nationwide soared from 140,300 in 1907 to nearly 5,000,000 in 1917, putting America on the road to becoming a petroleum-powered nation on wheels.

Now that technology has resolved so many of the cost constraints holding back the world’s transition to alternative energy, it’s possible to grasp the shape that America’s new industrial revolution is likely to take within a decade or even less (no matter who is the president of the United States). After rendering high-cost fossil fuels largely obsolete by 2035, solar and wind power, backed by storage farms equipped with new safer technologies like sodium-ion batteries, will create a reliable electrical grid, cutting the country’s basic energy costs by well over half and sparking a proliferation of innovation.

In the decades to come on our interstate highways, the left lanes will undoubtedly be filled with endless packs of a dozen or more electric-powered, driverless 18-wheelers, drafting six feet apart. They will be guided by uninterrupted digital signals transmitted from fiber optic cables laid down along the median strip, slashing both fuel consumption and transport costs. Those semi-trailer platoons will be headed for massive distribution depots that are likely to ring American cities, large and small. From them, drivers will be dispatched with robot-packed loads for the delivery of foodstuffs and consumer goods direct to individual households. Those truckloads will also include things like factory-produced complete kitchens and bathrooms for on-site installation at mass-assembly construction sites—slashing costs and making housing once again more affordable for working Americans.

Since an EV is simply a steel box housing a battery, for about $9,000 an American family will be able to purchase a brand-new, self-driving sedan with a 600-mile range from a single 10-minute charge, providing maintenance-free transportation for a typical monthly fuel cost of about $35. With the electrical grid generating cheap solar power, every urban hub will be connected to its suburbs by electrical rails and to its own neighborhoods by electrified mass transit. Once downtown, commuters will move about easily, freed from the stress and cost of parking by fleets of robotaxis that will move quickly through inner-city streets no longer jammed with private cars. Their only competitor for curb space will be the flotilla of delivery vehicles whose drivers will circulate ceaselessly about the city, fulfilling same-day orders.

With the world’s lowest cost for critical inputs of energy and transportation, combined with the most extensive grid of fiber optic cables, the United States will hold the pole position in the ceaseless race for international competitiveness. Once modern history’s fourth great transformation takes hold and that new energy infrastructure is in place, productivity, profits, and global power will soon follow on a far healthier and cooler planet. With domestic transport costs but a fraction of those for international shipping, the economic logic of “nearshoring” will become inescapable, making “Made in the USA” compellingly economical and creating countless new jobs that could strain the country’s labor supply.

Oh yes, and I almost forgot: all that technology will, of course, be emissions-free and so will bring America close to net-zero carbon emissions well before the 2050 date mandated by the 2016 Paris climate accord.

America’s King Canute

Ten years from now, Donald Trump will be remembered ruefully as our country’s very own King Canute, who used the full force of presidential power in a failed, futile effort to halt the tides of technological change that, by then, will have launched this country headlong into the world’s new industrial revolution.",https://i0.wp.com/s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.nationofchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20083156/17d0e2a55eba2c9ada45a9d801c455ff.jpg?fit=1242%2C699&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-20 13:15:54.227627

As the U.S. grows as a major liquefied natural gas exporter, the international need for our domestic natural gas supplies will only grow.
Why Basin Ventures is a Smart Investment in Natural Gas So, what does all this mean for Basin Ventures and why should someone consider investing in one of its funds?","The importance of natural gas in today’s energy environment is undeniable. As consumers look for cleaner, reliable sources of energy, natural gas has taken a bigger role in providing that power than ever before. Several recent events show just how big the future of natural gas could be, and these events demonstrate how Basin Ventures fund investment in natural gas can be profitable for decades. By investing in American oil and natural gas projects around the country, Basin generates revenue for investors from the production of wells in these various hotspots for oil and natural gas. The resources found in some of the largest oil and gas fields in the world allow Basin to capitalize on these exciting market conditions.

1. Sempra’s Big Move: More U.S. Natural Gas Exports

One of the most important recent events for natural gas production is the approval of a major infrastructure project called “Port Arthur LNG Phase 2.” Led by Sempra, the project focuses on liquefying natural gas, which can then be shipped to other countries. On May 29, 2025, the United States government gave the green light for the next phase of this project, allowing Sempra to double the amount of liquefied natural gas it exports to countries in Europe and Asia.

Why does this matter for the energy investor? First, it solidifies the United States as the major player in the global natural gas market. With this approval, the U.S. will send even more natural gas to countries that need it. And because liquefied natural gas is cleaner than other fossil fuels, it’s seen as a better option for countries trying to reduce their carbon emissions. This makes natural gas even more important for the global energy mix.

For Basin, this is good news because the demand for natural gas is increasing worldwide, especially given current geopolitical conditions. As the U.S. grows as a major liquefied natural gas exporter, the international need for our domestic natural gas supplies will only grow. The typical market cycle will take over: more demand will lead to more exports for the natural gas that Basin is helping to produce. That is where Basin investors will ensure not only a strong return on investment, but also benefit from the unparalleled tax benefits from investing in American energy.

2. Why Rising Demand for Electricity Makes Natural Gas More Important

In the domestic markets, another reason natural gas is in the spotlight right now is because electricity consumption is higher than ever before. As technology advances, especially with the rise of market sectors like artificial intelligence, data centers, and cryptocurrency mining, demand for electricity seems nearly limitless. But, despite their marketing hype, renewable energy sources like wind and solar can’t meet that demand on their own. Natural gas offers a reliable alternative.

For Basin and our investors, this is an opportunity to invest in natural gas production. As electricity use rises, the demand for natural gas to power these plants will continue to grow. By investing in natural gas, Basin is harnessing a crucial resource for meeting future energy needs for the entire United States.

3. The Importance of Texas Shale Assets

These market conditions have forced exploration and production companies to look for strong natural gas-based assets. One company, Rockcliff Energy III, is an example of industry veterans coming together to form a new company with a natural gas focus. One of Rockcliff’s two primary executives said recently, considering the above developments, “…we feel like the tailwinds and the structural look ahead for gas is strong.” Texas shale holds oil and gas, and companies like Rockcliff are exploring ways to tap into these rich reserves. Texas, especially the Permian Basin, is home to some of the largest shale deposits in the world.

Investing in shale fields is a smart move because it’s a reliable source of both commodities. The Permian Basin has been producing energy for decades, and it’s only getting more productive as drilling and extraction technology improves. Basin, with its focus on non-operated working interest investments that produce revenue passively, provides the opportunity to be a part of this growth without needing to directly operate the wells, letting the engineers do what they do best: get as much oil and natural gas out of the ground as possible.

4. Why Basin Ventures is a Smart Investment in Natural Gas

So, what does all this mean for Basin Ventures and why should someone consider investing in one of its funds? Focus is often only on oil, but the future of natural gas looks strong, especially with projects like Sempra’s liquefied natural gas expansion and the growing demand for electricity. American oil and natural gas deposits, where Basin Ventures focuses its efforts, will drive this growth.

Basin is making strategic investments in oil and natural gas, focusing on areas with proven reserves and strong future growth potential. With natural gas playing such an important role in meeting global energy needs, Basin is well-positioned to capitalize on the rising demand for this energy source. Whether it’s through liquefied natural gas exports or electricity generation, natural gas will be a key player in the energy expansion, and Basin is ready turn these opportunities into profit.

At the same time, his administration is weakening or erasing limits on greenhouse gas emissions and encouraging more production of oil, gas and coal.
On Monday, Senate Republicans unveiled their plan to achieve Mr. Trump’s goals, two weeks after the House passed a measure that would gut clean energy incentives entirely.
That’s because the Inflation Reduction Act “put clean energy on sale and made it more economically attractive than conventional fossil fuels,” said Jesse Jenkins, an assistant professor of energy systems engineering and policy at Princeton University.
Many scientists had hoped that states would step up efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as they did during the first Trump administration.","When President Joseph R. Biden Jr. signed the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, he called it “the most aggressive action ever, ever, ever to confront the climate crisis.”

Now, Republicans are poised to undo the law, and scientists are warning the result would increase the likelihood that the Earth will heat up by an average of 3 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by the end of this century.

“We’re already in an era now where climate change is going to be increasingly dangerous,” said Jonathan T. Overpeck, a climate scientist and the dean of the University of Michigan’s School for Environment and Sustainability.

That amount of warming — 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) over the course of a century — may sound small. But 2024, the hottest year on record, was the first calendar year where the global average temperature exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, and it delivered deadly heat, violent hurricanes, severe drought and devastating wildfires.

The Biden administration’s strategy to fight climate change consisted of tax breaks to nudge the country toward clean energy and away from fossil fuels, the burning of which is heating the planet, paired with strict limits on pollution from smokestacks and tailpipes.

That would have put the United States on track to cut emissions about 40 percent below 2005 levels by 2035, closer to the goal that scientists say all industrialized nations must meet in order to keep global warming within relatively safe limits. The United States is currently the second biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, behind China. But it is the country that has pumped the most carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution.

“By exiting the I.R.A. and eliminating other regulations and laws designed to protect the climate, the United States is going to make itself and the world more vulnerable to dangerous climate change going into the future,” Dr. Overpeck said.

President Trump has denounced the Inflation Reduction Act as the “green new scam.” He wants Congress to eliminate hundreds of billions of dollars in federal support for solar, wind and other clean energy and use the savings to help make his 2017 tax cuts permanent while also increasing spending on the military and immigration enforcement. At the same time, his administration is weakening or erasing limits on greenhouse gas emissions and encouraging more production of oil, gas and coal.

“President Trump was given a mandate to roll back the radical climate policies that are burning a hole through taxpayers’ wallets and jeopardizing the American dream for future generations,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement. “The administration is delivering,” she added.

On Monday, Senate Republicans unveiled their plan to achieve Mr. Trump’s goals, two weeks after the House passed a measure that would gut clean energy incentives entirely. The Senate version retains some support for technologies favored by conservatives, like nuclear power and geothermal energy, but still rapidly ends federal money for solar and wind power, electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel and more. It also increases some subsidies for fossil fuels.

The Senate proposal “achieves significant savings by slashing Green New Deal spending,” Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, said in announcing it.

Democrats, economists and environmental advocates said pulling out federal support for clean energy would endanger more than $500 billion in planned investment in manufacturing of solar panels, electric vehicles and batteries — most of it in Republican districts — and put more than 400,000 jobs at risk. It would also make electricity more expensive, they said.

The Republican package would “cook the planet and increase prices,” said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii.

The United States has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 20 percent below 2005 levels, according to the research firm Rhodium Group, largely thanks to cheap natural gas displacing coal. The country’s emissions fell by just 0.2 percent in 2024, Rhodium found. But Biden-era policies were expected to accelerate the decline in the coming years.

That’s because the Inflation Reduction Act “put clean energy on sale and made it more economically attractive than conventional fossil fuels,” said Jesse Jenkins, an assistant professor of energy systems engineering and policy at Princeton University.

But repealing the act would effectively stop the drop in emissions, according to early analyses from several groups, including the Princeton REPEAT project, Rhodium Group, Resources for the Future and the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.

“We are not going to be transitioning to the energy of the future, and that means we’re going to emit a lot more carbon than we would have,” said Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences and the director of the Texas Center for Climate Studies at Texas A&M University.

Many scientists had hoped that states would step up efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as they did during the first Trump administration. But some are facing legal attacks and political pressure from Washington.

The initiative is spearheaded by the Toyota Mobility Foundation and designed in collaboration with Challenge Works and the World Resources Institute. Toyota’s call to cities launched in June 2023 and more than 150 cities in 43 countries applied for the challenge.

The goal of the $9 million global initiative is to help cities accelerate toward sustainable mobility, fostering healthier and safer urban environments while enhancing people's ability to commute, work, study and access services, according to a news release.

“Eastern Market moves the food Detroiters need every day. Thanks to the Foundation, Detroit can help to pioneer solutions to lessen the environmental impact of this important commerce,” Mayor Mike Duggan said in the release.

Each of the 10 semifinalists in November received $50,000 to refine their concepts over a six-month period. In early 2026, judges will choose one or more finalists to receive the remaining $3 million in funding to execute their project.

The four finalists chosen are:

Civilized Cycles, a light electric vehicles company in Detroit, seeks to use semi-trikes to replace gas-powered options in city environments, offering sustainable and efficient mobility solutions.

ElectricFish Energy Inc., a San Carlos, Calif.-based company, aims to leverage infrastructure for battery storage and fast-charging capabilities to build systems designed to reduce strain on the grid, lower energy costs, and provide backup power during outages.

Neology, a Lutry, Switzerland-based company, will use its system to enable clean, on-demand hydrogen production, ideal for powering fuel-cell solutions at construction sites, remote heavy industries and other off-grid applications.

Orange Sparkle Ball, an Atlanta, Ga.-based company, is developing a data-powered micro-logistics platform that aims to streamline first- and last-mile freight delivery and enhance local logistics efficiency.

“Detroit is growing. By the end of 2025, Detroit’s new bridge to Canada will increase freight traffic through our city,” said Tim Slusser, the City’s Chief of Mobility. “Now is the time to discover how to move more goods around more people with less pollution.”

In a 6-3 ruling, SCOTUS reversed an appeals court decision that had blocked the commission’s license to store the waste in Andrews County out in West Texas.
The state had filed suit to stop the proposed storage site.

In a 6-3 ruling, SCOTUS reversed an appeals court decision that had blocked the commission’s license to store the waste in Andrews County out in West Texas. The state had filed suit to stop the proposed storage site.

The area is already home to a low-level radioactive site.

Benjamin Weiss, who covers Congress for Courthouse News Service, joined the Texas Standard to discuss the implications of the ruling. Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below.

This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:

Texas Standard: So tell us about the case. What was the issue for the court to decide?

Benjamin Weiss: So the central thrust of the case was that Texas and this oil and gas holding company known as Fasken Land and Minerals wanted the high court to reverse the NRC’s decision to license this facility, this Interim Storage Partners facility.

The central thesis of the majority decision in the case agreed with the commission, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, that Texas and Fasken didn’t qualify for a judicial review in the first place because they did not adequately, in the court’s view, participate in these agency-level licensing proceedings.

So how can this decision impact other potential nuclear waste sites like Yucca Mountain in Nevada?

Well, actually, I think that this is sort of an interesting takeaway from the case, which is that the court threw out Texas and Fasken’s arguments on what’s ultimately procedural grounds.

Texas and Fasken had sued under this law known as the Hobbs Act, which is not to be confused with a interstate extortion law of the same name. This Hobbs Act is administrative law, which basically says that any agency action parties that are, quote unquote, “aggrieved by the decision” have 60 days to sue the federal government to get that decision reversed.

So, Texas and Fasken had argued, ‘well, we are aggrieved by the decisions to license the ISP site, so we need the entire license reversed.’ The court only ruled that Texas and Fasken didn’t meet this party-aggrieved standard in the Hobbs Act, and they actually refused to rule on whether or not this ISP site was licensed unlawfully.

In terms of what the upshot is for future nuclear waste facilities or Yucca Mountain, the answer is still sort of unclear because the court did not weigh in on the legality of the federal government licensing away from reactor storage sites of the type that ISP is.

And I know the Andrews County facility in particular is set to store nuclear waste temporarily. Do you know if there’s a plan for permanent storage?

Currently, there is not. This has sort of been the white whale of the nuclear industry and of the federal government as they try to find a solution for where to store this around 100,000 tons of nuclear waste that’s stored at these reactor sites across the country.

Yucca Mountain is the only government-designated site so far and it’s pretty much a hole in the ground and it has been for 40 years because of political opposition from Nevada. The ISP site and there’s a sister site – or I guess I suppose you’d call it cousin site – that was proposed for southeastern New Mexico by Holtec International, which is another Nuclear Services Company are supposed to store it this nuclear waste. The ISP site would store about half of the nation’s stockpile and the Holtec site, more or less, the other half for a period of 40 years.

Of course, opponents are concerned that those sites will become de facto permanent sites in the absence of an actual federal permanent repository. The Department of Energy has been working for a few years on a project to site a potential federally operated interim storage site.

So another temporary storage facility while the government works on a final storage solution. But so far, there has been very little movement on that effort as well.",https://www.texasstandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/us-supreme-court-building-geb03fd634_1920-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 13:16:11.317874

Together, Google and CTC Global will scale the use of the latter’s high-capacity, domestically manufactured advanced conductors to rapidly boost grid capacity and reliability.
As a part of this collaboration, transmission lines across the U.S. will be selected based on their potential to accelerate grid capacity with CTC Global’s ACCC Conductor.
Future-Ready Workforce Development: Utilities will be eligible for training to equip their workforce in the deployment of ACCC Advanced Conductors.
“Our solution uniquely delivers significant electric grid capacity with unparalleled speed.","Hyperscaler Google has announced a collaboration with CTC Global Corporation, a developer and manufacturer of high-capacity advanced conductors, that aims to accelerate the deployment of next-generation transmission technology for the U.S. power grid.

Together, Google and CTC Global will scale the use of the latter’s high-capacity, domestically manufactured advanced conductors to rapidly boost grid capacity and reliability. The tandem will work together to identify high-impact transmission lines through a Request for Information (RFI) issued to states, utilities, and transmission developers interested in collaborating on solutions to unlock grid capacity.

The U.S. Department of Energy believes mass deployment of advanced conductors could double transmission capacity in just a few months, as opposed to the 7- to 10-year (or longer) timeline associated with constructing new transmission lines. Ultimately, the initiative is designed to accelerate regional economic growth and development, add capacity, improve grid reliability and performance, and lower energy costs for all.

How Will This Work?

As a part of this collaboration, transmission lines across the U.S. will be selected based on their potential to accelerate grid capacity with CTC Global’s ACCC Conductor. The partnership will prioritize projects that can deliver the greatest immediate impact and that support load growth where Google operates.

Those selected through the RFI will gain access to a combination of Google and CTC Global resources designed to accelerate deployment, including:

Cost Assistance: Funding will be available to accelerate deployment of CTC Global’s high-capacity ACCC Conductors and accelerate capacity growth.

Future-Ready Workforce Development: Utilities will be eligible for training to equip their workforce in the deployment of ACCC Advanced Conductors.

Technical Analysis: Support for technical project studies will be available to validate the technology’s integration and impact.

RFI responses are due on July 14, 2025, with a full RFP to shortly follow. Applications are encouraged from areas where Google has existing or announced data centers, as well as their associated wholesale markets.

“Expanding transmission capacity presents a significant opportunity for the power system today, and Google is committed to being a catalyst for a stronger and more reliable U.S. power grid. Expanded grid capacity will enable responsible data center growth underpinning the modern digital world, while also increasing affordability for consumers, boosting energy reliability, and accelerating key industries like manufacturing,” said Amanda Peterson Corio, Google Global Head of Data Center Energy. “Working with CTC Global, this partnership aims to dramatically cut the time and cost of adding and moving electricity to reliably power American homes and businesses.”

California-based CTC Global manufactures and assembles its advanced conductor technologies in the United States and has supplied the ACCC Conductor to projects in more than 30 states. Utilizing U.S. suppliers of carbon fiber from Alabama, fiberglass from Texas, and other key domestic components, CTC has deployed 124,000 miles of its technologies over the last two decades.

“This groundbreaking partnership with Google marks a positive turning point to lower electricity costs, generate economic growth, and advance U.S. energy dominance,” added CTC Global CEO J.D. Sitton. “Our solution uniquely delivers significant electric grid capacity with unparalleled speed. This coordinated partnership with the innovators at Google will help ensure that the U.S. invests in cost-effective solutions for the long term that help the U.S. continue to lead the AI revolution.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ChatGPT-Image-Jun-20-2025-11_25_46-AM.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 13:15:06.400983

“EPA and California may or may not prevail on the merits in defending EPA’s approval of the California regulations.
The Clean Air Act generally preempts state laws that regulate motor vehicle emissions, but it allows the EPA to issue a waiver for California — and only California.
But the EPA and California argue the producers have no legal standing, which requires showing that a favorable court ruling would redress a plaintiff’s injury.
Because the Court had ample opportunity to avoid that result, I respectfully dissent,” Jackson wrote.","The Supreme Court revived an industry effort to axe California’s stricter vehicle emissions standards Friday.

In a 7-2 decision authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court ruled fuel producers have legal standing to sue over California’s clean car standards approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), allowing the challenge to continue.

“This case concerns only standing, not the merits,” Kavanaugh wrote. “EPA and California may or may not prevail on the merits in defending EPA’s approval of the California regulations. But the justiciability of the fuel producers’ challenge to EPA’s approval of the California regulations is evident.”

Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, two of the court’s three Democratic-appointed justices, dissented.

The Clean Air Act generally preempts state laws that regulate motor vehicle emissions, but it allows the EPA to issue a waiver for California — and only California.

The EPA granted such a waiver in 2013, but during President Trump’s first term his administration partially withdraw it. Once former President Biden arrived at the White House, his EPA reinstated the waiver, putting the stricter emissions standards back in play.

A group of producers of gasoline and other liquid fuels sued, arguing California’s regulations reduce the manufacturing of gas-powered cars, which would cause a hit to the fuel producers’ sales.

But the EPA and California argue the producers have no legal standing, which requires showing that a favorable court ruling would redress a plaintiff’s injury. The EPA contended that consumer demand for electric cars would exceed California’s mandate, anyway, so the regulations no longer have impact.

The Supreme Court’s decision rejects that notion, reversing a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit that tossed the lawsuit.

“If invalidating the regulations would change nothing in the market, why are EPA and California enforcing and defending the regulations?” Kavanaugh wrote for the majority.

“The whole point of the regulations is to increase the number of electric vehicles in the new automobile market beyond what consumers would otherwise demand and what automakers would otherwise manufacture and sell,” he added.

In separate dissents, Sotomayor and Jackson said they would’ve sided with the EPA and California and noted the case may become moot.

“I see no need to expound on the law of standing in a case where the sole dispute is a factual one not addressed below,” Sotomayor wrote, saying she would’ve sent the case back to the lower court for another look.

In her separate dissent, Jackson was more forceful, saying her colleagues weren’t applying the courts’ standing doctrine evenhandedly, warning it may contribute to an erosion of public trust in judges.

“This case gives fodder to the unfortunate perception that moneyed interests enjoy an easier road to relief in this Court than ordinary citizens. Because the Court had ample opportunity to avoid that result, I respectfully dissent,” Jackson wrote.",https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2025/06/cars_california_ap_0824-e1661375582392.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-20 14:10:29.859734

Energy for Generations: A Plan Built for Ontario

The Ontario PC government’s plan ends the siloed thinking of the past and brings together electricity, natural gas, hydrogen, and emerging energy technologies under one clear, coordinated strategy. It builds on seven years of strong PC leadership by delivering:

✅ Affordable power for families, job creators and industry

✅ Record investments in nuclear, energy storage and grid infrastructure

✅ Self-reliant energy supply that reduces our dependence on foreign jurisdictions

✅ Zero-emissions electricity with a path to over 99% clean power by 2050

✅ Support for skilled trades and good-paying jobs in construction, engineering and clean tech

✅ Energy corridors and modern pipelines to boost growth and unlock national potential

✅ Smart tools to help Ontarians generate and manage their own power

With this plan, we’re not just powering homes — we’re powering housing construction, business expansion, and job creation. By supporting major projects like the largest nuclear buildout in North America, and protecting access to fuels used by farmers and industry, we’re putting Ontario workers first and attracting investment from around the world.

But Democrats also indicated less support for renewable energy and more for fossil fuels than five years ago.
Democrats' support rose from 37% to 52%.
“(They think) we just need to shout louder and hit people over the head about climate, climate, climate.
Published by Canary Media, Renewable Energy World Floodlight is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates the powers stalling climate action.","Republicans and Democrats alike are less likely to support renewable energy than they were five years ago, according to a survey released June 5 by the Pew Research Center. Floodlight examines the survey results, which mirror growing pockets of opposition to solar farms, reignited political support for coal plants and moves by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to kill federally funded clean energy projects.

This shift in opinion dates back to when Democratic President Joe Biden took office, said Brian Kennedy, Pew senior researcher and one of the study’s authors. “This isn’t a new trend,” he said.

Still, Kenneth Gillingham, professor of environmental and energy economics at the Yale School of the Environment, was surprised.

“I see this shift … as a successful effort to link climate change and renewable energy to broader culture war issues,” Gillingham said. He added that in the past, “prominent” Republicans supported renewables and sought solutions to climate change, but those stances could now be seen as “disloyal” to Trump.

Pew Research Center

The survey of 5,085 U.S. adults taken April 28 to May 4 revealed that while 79% of Americans favored expanding wind and solar production in 2020, that number has dropped to 60%. And 39% of Americans today support expansion of oil, coal and natural gas — almost double the 20% that supported it in 2020.

Combustion of fossil fuels — in transportation, energy generation and industrial production — is the No. 1 cause of climate change.

Much of the change in opinion is driven by Republicans, whose support of oil and gas grew from 35% in 2020 to 67% today. But Democrats also indicated less support for renewable energy and more for fossil fuels than five years ago.

While many results reflect Trump's policies opposing most renewables and boosting fossil fuels, Pew found a few notable exceptions: 69% of all respondents favor offshore wind — a technology Trump has specifically targeted.

Both Democrats and Republicans indicated stronger support for nuclear power, with Republicans' favorable opinions increasing from 53% in 2020 to 69% in 2025. Democrats' support rose from 37% to 52%. The Trump administration has signaled support for a nuclear renaissance, despite its high cost.

There were wide partisan splits on several topics. In March, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it would scale back environmental regulations. Pew asked whether it was possible to do that and still protect air and water quality: 77% of Republicans said yes and 67% of Democrats said no.

Pew didn’t ask the respondents why their attitudes have shifted. But Kennedy said in Pew’s past surveys, Republicans have expressed concern about the economic impacts of climate change policies and transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.

Mike Murphy, a Republican consultant and electric vehicle backer, said when the environmental benefits of clean technologies are touted, it polarizes Republicans. Instead, Murphy said messages should be about pocketbook issues — like lower fuel costs — and jobs.

“It's hard for pro-climate people to understand,” said Murphy, who has advised dozens of state and national GOP campaigns including John McCain’s 2008 presidential bid. “(They think) we just need to shout louder and hit people over the head about climate, climate, climate. The key is you want to talk about jobs and national security and other events that naturally resonate a lot more with right-of-center people.”

That's what Murphy's groups, the EV Politics Project and the American EV Jobs Alliance, are trying to do to depoliticize electric vehicles. ""Whenever electric cars are seen through a climate lens,"" Murphy said, ""their appeal narrows.""

It's a strategy also being used by the Electrification Coalition, a left-of-center pro-EV group. Ben Prochazka, the coalition's executive director, echoed Murphy's strategy, adding that EVs have ""become overly politicized and caught in the culture wars, impacting markets and ultimately hurting our ability to realize their many benefits for all Americans.""

Prochazka noted that once introduced to EVs, consumers support them: ""EV drivers love their vehicles, with more than eight out of ten reporting that their next car will also be electric.""

Perhaps those practical messages are getting through. In the Pew survey, electric vehicles were the one item that saw an uptick in support — 4 percentage points in the past year.

But popular support might not be enough to stop Congress from killing a $7,500 electric vehicle credit, which Murphy said would be “policy disaster.”

Republicans, he said, are in a “real squeeze,” because “they don’t have enough money for the tax cuts the president has promised.”

Murphy said: “It’s easier for Republicans to cut Biden electric cars … than it is for them to cut more Medicaid.”

Gillingham is still optimistic that solar, wind and other greenhouse gas-reducing technologies will move forward — because they are the cheapest.

“The continued decline in the price of renewable energy and battery technologies, as well as other new technologies, is a reason to continue to have hope that the worst impacts of climate change can be addressed,” he said.

It’s through the lens of that simple highway sign that one of Maine’s longest-tenured (and often deeply concerned) senators should consider the current budget reconciliation bill. According to the Maine Center for Economic Policy, under the proposed bill the state could lose $400 million annually in federal funding — cuts that would disproportionately harm rural Mainers.

One potential loss stands out: the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, or 25C. This bipartisan incentive is a clear success story of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Maine has led the nation in heat pump adoption, already surpassing its goal of 100,000 installations by 2025

and setting a new target of 275,000 by 2027. That progress is partly thanks to the $2,000 home energy credit offered through 25C. Eliminating it now would undermine hard-won momentum toward energy affordability and independence.

The broader clean energy economy in Maine also tells a compelling story. As of 2020, it had surpassed 15,000 total jobs and was valued at $2.1 billion statewide. Mainers have consistently demonstrated clean energy grit through community-scale projects like the 1.5 MW wind turbines on Vinalhaven, the 1 MW solar array in Dover-Foxcroft and the 7.3 MW solar project in Kennebec County. The reconciliation bill currently sitting on Sen. Collins’ desk threatens the funding that makes these types of projects — and Maine’s energy resilience — possible.

Maine’s outdoor economy would also take a hit. Outdoor recreation contributed $3.4 billion to the state economy in 2023 — roughly 3.7% of state GDP — and supported nearly 30,000 jobs. Clean air, water, and access to undisturbed public lands are essential to maintaining this vital part of Maine’s identity and livelihood.

Thom Tillis’ office in Greensboro, calling on the Republican senator to oppose the Trump administration’s One Big, Beautiful Bill and to protect North Carolina’s clean energy initiatives.

Members of the NC League of Conservation Voters (NCLCV) and the BlueGreen Alliance gathered outside the building at 3200 Northline Ave., holding signs that read “Don’t raise our energy bills” and “Protect NC clean energy jobs.”

“When I was recovering from cancer treatment, my energy bill cost me nearly $450 a month. That’s high for anyone, but especially for a mother of three fighting just to stay alive,” Crystal Barnes, a resident of Winston-Salem, said during the conference.

Barnes shared that her energy bill was cut in half after she discovered the Weatherization Assistance Program, which made her home “more energy efficient” by upgrading insulation and light bulbs, and replacing her outdated HVAC unit.

Under the current House version of Trump’s bill, the program would be eliminated as part of a broader rollback of energy-efficiency and climate-related initiatives, including key provisions of the landmark Inflation Reduction Act.

“Those making these decisions need to put themselves in our shoes. They should stop considering only what’s going to benefit special interests and big donors and consider how it affects our health, our jobs, and our finances.”

The bill, which narrowly passed the House last month, was revised and released this week by the Senate Finance Committee. The updated version keeps the plan to fully phase out the tax credits for solar and wind energy by 2028, while extending incentives for hydropower, nuclear, and geothermal energy through 2036. GOP leaders have called for the bill to be passed by July 4.

Thom Kay, a policy manager with the BlueGreen Alliance, pointed out while the revised bill doesn’t go after energy storage as directly as the House version, by removing tax credits for solar energy, “you are destroying the market for energy storage, because in recent years, solar and storage are almost inseparable.”

Gov. Josh Stein, who has praised the Inflation Reduction Act for creating 20,000 clean energy jobs and attracting $24 billion in investments to North Carolina since its passage in 2022, criticized the proposed legislation and urged Congress to protect the clean energy incentives that, he said, “have contributed to our state’s prosperity.” Without the credits, North Carolina families could see their electricity bills rise by $200 each year, Stein warned.

“As it’s currently written, the Congressional reconciliation bill stops clean energy progress in its tracks. It could cost North Carolina tens of thousands of jobs by 2030, along with billions in clean energy investments spurred by clean energy and manufacturing tax credits.” said Dan Crawford, director of governmental relations at NCLCV.

“They (Congress) should focus more on strengthening our economy and lowering costs, not on preserving tax breaks for the wealthiest and exploding the deficit. I call on Senator Tillis to demonstrate his leadership in making that happen.”

Installation of the first five units has begun and the remaining 10 will be installed in the coming weeks.

The move “will immediately lower monthly bills for our Houston-area customers,” Jason Ryan, CenterPoint’s executive vice president of regulatory services and government affairs, said in a statement. The deployment is expected to reduce bills for Houston-area customers by approximately $2/month by 2027, the utility said.

The generators range from 27 MW to 32 MW and were acquired following Winter Storm Uri, which devastated the Texas grid in 2021. CenterPoint subsequently came under fire when the mobile units were not deployed after Hurricane Beryl last summer.

The utility opted to forego some profits associated with the mobile generation lease, amid the controversy.

“CenterPoint will receive no revenue or profit from the 15 large units based on the agreement” with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the utility said Monday.

According to the June agreement, ERCOT determined that the proposed retirement of CPS Energy’s V.H. Braunig Units 1, 2, and 3 “poses a significant risk” to its system because those units “help to mitigate risk of cascading outages associated with the post-contingency overload of certain transmission lines importing power into the greater San Antonio area.”

ERCOT recommended Unit 3 continue operating under a reliability must-run agreement, but said CenterPoint’s mobile fleet “could help further mitigate the identified reliability risks more cost-effectively than committing V.H. Braunig Units 1 and 2 through RMR agreements.”

According to CenterPoint, it’s generators will deliver approximately $200 million of value to the state’s grid. The agreement with ERCOT indicates the generators could run until March 2027.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/M0BjGo780nX4su2UdWR9uDfnfvaZ99ZtHdiuC0zEKkY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMjcxNDEzMjk1LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-06-20 12:26:03.940549

The company joins a growing number of automakers that are looking to battery recycling to reduce waste and recover valuable resources, especially in the face of supply chain uncertainty.

First, it will work on testing a closed-loop raw material cycle for battery manufacturing. Following that, it aims to develop a recycling network for high-voltage batteries in collaboration with outside partners, according to an Interesting Engineering report.

""With the help of innovative recycling processes, we strive to increase our independence from volatile and geopolitically unstable raw material markets,"" said Barbara Frenkel, Executive Board Member for Procurement at Porsche, in a press release.

""Circular economy is a core pillar of our sustainability strategy, and with this pilot project, we want to underscore our ambitions.""

There have already been success stories in battery recycling, with one recent study showing it's possible to recover 99.99% of lithium from a cell, along with high amounts of nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

Porsche plans to begin by shredding high-voltage batteries from its development vehicles into a ""black mass"" of recovered material. So far, it's produced 65 tons of the stuff, which is full of valuable resources.

The next step will be to further refine and separate this into the essential raw materials needed for the production of new cells, with a focus on quality and purity, as the report noted.

Once the company has successfully manufactured batteries with a defined amount of recycled materials, it'll move to real-world testing in Porsche vehicles.

The process will not only keep harmful toxins out of the environment but also allow their reuse in a closed-loop production cycle, helping the company improve its supply-chain resilience.

Currently, China has suspended exports of many rare earth materials that are necessary for the production of new EV batteries, according to a Reuters report.

While this situation presents challenges for the manufacturing sector, it may also prompt many companies to invest in greener methodologies that benefit the planet.

EVs are already cleaner and more efficient than gas-powered vehicles. They get up to 91% of the energy from their batteries and regenerative braking systems, while gas-guzzlers max out around 25% efficiency from their dirty fuel.

Electric vehicles also don't have any tailpipe emissions and can take advantage of electricity that's generated by more sustainable sources, such as solar power.

Homeowners can even capitalize on this to reduce their fuel costs by installing solar-panel arrays and battery storage to fuel up at home.

“EPA and California may or may not prevail on the merits in defending EPA’s approval of the California regulations.
The Clean Air Act generally preempts state laws that regulate motor vehicle emissions, but it allows the EPA to issue a waiver for California — and only California.
But the EPA and California argue the producers have no legal standing, which requires showing that a favorable court ruling would redress a plaintiff’s injury.
Because the Court had ample opportunity to avoid that result, I respectfully dissent,” Jackson wrote.","The Supreme Court revived an industry effort to axe California’s stricter vehicle emissions standards Friday.

In a 7-2 decision authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court ruled fuel producers have legal standing to sue over California’s clean car standards approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), allowing the challenge to continue.

“This case concerns only standing, not the merits,” Kavanaugh wrote. “EPA and California may or may not prevail on the merits in defending EPA’s approval of the California regulations. But the justiciability of the fuel producers’ challenge to EPA’s approval of the California regulations is evident.”

Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, two of the court’s three Democratic-appointed justices, dissented.

The Clean Air Act generally preempts state laws that regulate motor vehicle emissions, but it allows the EPA to issue a waiver for California — and only California.

The EPA granted such a waiver in 2013, but during President Trump’s first term his administration partially withdraw it. Once former President Biden arrived at the White House, his EPA reinstated the waiver, putting the stricter emissions standards back in play.

A group of producers of gasoline and other liquid fuels sued, arguing California’s regulations reduce the manufacturing of gas-powered cars, which would cause a hit to the fuel producers’ sales.

But the EPA and California argue the producers have no legal standing, which requires showing that a favorable court ruling would redress a plaintiff’s injury. The EPA contended that consumer demand for electric cars would exceed California’s mandate, anyway, so the regulations no longer have impact.

The Supreme Court’s decision rejects that notion, reversing a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit that tossed the lawsuit.

“If invalidating the regulations would change nothing in the market, why are EPA and California enforcing and defending the regulations?” Kavanaugh wrote for the majority.

“The whole point of the regulations is to increase the number of electric vehicles in the new automobile market beyond what consumers would otherwise demand and what automakers would otherwise manufacture and sell,” he added.

In separate dissents, Sotomayor and Jackson said they would’ve sided with the EPA and California and noted the case may become moot.

“I see no need to expound on the law of standing in a case where the sole dispute is a factual one not addressed below,” Sotomayor wrote, saying she would’ve sent the case back to the lower court for another look.

In her separate dissent, Jackson was more forceful, saying her colleagues weren’t applying the courts’ standing doctrine evenhandedly, warning it may contribute to an erosion of public trust in judges.

“This case gives fodder to the unfortunate perception that moneyed interests enjoy an easier road to relief in this Court than ordinary citizens. Because the Court had ample opportunity to avoid that result, I respectfully dissent,” Jackson wrote.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/cars_california_ap_0824-e1661375582392.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-20 15:08:44.678982

I made several assumptions, and one of those assumptions was that the Zero would charge faster on a faster charger.
Naked bikes aren't really road trip bikes, and I knew that going in, but it was still far more comfortable than I'd expected, and the electric powertrain made it the smoothest bike I'd ever road tripped.
Was my decision to road trip the Zero stupid?
If you're interested in a Zero and want to take it on short road trips, the faster charging is definitely a requirement, though.","I did something dumb.

No, I didn't buy another Fiat 500e. I have plenty of those in my possession at the moment, although if I found the right Abarth convertible with a manual, I might be tempted. Instead, this has to do with the electric motorcycle that Zero loaned me. It's a Zero S, a naked bike that offers about 150 miles of range and makes 97 pound-feet of torque. I'd been riding it around town when it wasn't raining, and it was actually far easier to ride than you'd think, at least with traction control on (I leave the traction control on).

Now, I'm not going to pretend these bikes are cheap. With a starting price of $14,995, you really have to want an electric motorcycle in order to justify buying one, but for around-town duty, it really is fantastic. It's more comfortable than you might think, and without any need for a gas tank, it has a convenient little storage compartment that can swallow a six-pack and even a few other things, meaning I can make a quick trip to the store or a friend's house without needing to bring a backpack.

In fact, I'd argue the Zero S is almost too easy to ride. It almost feels like an e-bike you don't have to pedal, except then you look down at the speedometer, and the numbers are climbing far faster than you would have ever possibly imagined. And while it might not have enough range for a ride up to the mountains and back, 150 miles is plenty for riding around all day. Then, you just plug it into a regular wall outlet, and you're good to go the next day.

So back to the ""something dumb."" I had to go to Charlotte for an event, which for me is a distance of just under 200 miles. Of course, on the highway, the Zero wouldn't get nearly the full 150 miles of range that it got around town, but I was having so much fun on the bike here, I figured, why not ride up to Charlotte? It couldn't possibly be that bad, right? I'd stop to charge twice each way, and while I wouldn't beat a gas-powered motorcycle, it would be fun to see what the bike was like on a short road trip.

Plus, it would give me the opportunity to review a helmet I'd just received — a Ruroc AT4.0 Carbon that you may have seen advertised with a bunch of cool designs, including several from Star Wars and Marvel. They aren't exactly cheap, and you can definitely find perfectly serviceable helmets for a lot less, but I'm not against doing the important work of checking to make sure a cool-looking helmet is comfortable and well-built enough that those who can afford one can be OK with making the jump. Plus, there's a Bluetooth audio system that was begging to be tested on the highway.

So I charged the bike, packed a bag, and set out on my way. The first 90 minutes or so went swimmingly on the bike, but I hadn't set up the helmet's audio system correctly before leaving, which meant I couldn't listen to the Reacher audiobook on the way like I'd planned. Still, I liked the helmet. Everything from the visor to the trick D-ring-free strap felt well-built, and most importantly, it was the most comfortable motorcycle helmet I'd ever used.

Despite being built like I have a Victorian wasting disease, my head is both massive and oddly shaped, which means a lot of helmets give me a headache, at least right out of the box. The Ruroc, though, didn't give me a headache, and it's far lighter than my personal helmet. I haven't crashed yet, so you'll have to decide for yourself if the safety certification is enough for you to trust with your brain, but comfort and quality both got a check from me.

Then it was time for my first charge stop. I chose an Ingles because the charger was free, and I liked the idea of being able to grab some food while I waited for the bike to charge. Sure, it wasn't a fast charger, but the Zero's battery is small, and I had time. Plus, the Ingles had a small sitting area with wifi where I could wait while the bike charged. Also, did I mention the charger was free?

The free charger, however, took a long time to get me back to 80%. That could be forgiven since I wasn't paying for the charge, and it gave me time to figure out what I'd done wrong with the audio system. Eventually I got everything figured out, and I had audio coming out of both speakers and the speakers themselves positioned exactly where my ear holes are. Apparently, the sound has to go into your ears if you want to hear it. Who knew?

By the time I got going again it had been about two hours, which is far too long to stop for a charge on a road trip, but once I got to Gaffney, I figured I'd take a photo of the Peachoid, plug into a charger with a little more oomph and be on my way. I always loved seeing the Peachoid on road trips as a kid, although I will admit I remember it being bigger. Probably because I was smaller. Unfortunately for me, but lucky for you, Gaffney is also where things started to really go wrong for me.

You see, I'd planned this trip the way I usually plan things — barely. I made several assumptions, and one of those assumptions was that the Zero would charge faster on a faster charger. I was wrong. You can add faster charging to your Zero, but to help keep the cost of an already-expensive bike down, faster charging isn't included. That way, if you don't plan to go on any road trips, you don't have to pay for a feature you won't use. I also would have known this if I'd actually read all the materials that go along with the bike, but I had a bike with 97 lb-ft of torque at my disposal, and I didn't want to read the instructions. I wanted to ride.

Anyway, the way the press bike was set up — the ""not planning to take any road trips"" setup — it charged at roughly 3.3 kW. With a 14.4-kWh battery, you can do the math. The fast-charger option would have tripled that charge speed, but without it, I was going to be stuck in Gaffney for a long time. Thankfully, you can usually find a decent coffee shop in any town these days, so I ordered a large cold brew and got to waiting. And waiting. And waiting.

I couldn't even be mad at the bike. The bike hadn't done anything wrong. Naked bikes aren't really road trip bikes, and I knew that going in, but it was still far more comfortable than I'd expected, and the electric powertrain made it the smoothest bike I'd ever road tripped. You don't realize how many vibrations there are on a gas bike until you've ridden an electric one. It may not be worth the extra money to you, but let me tell you, riding on the highway without all those vibrations is a nice upgrade. No, the problem is that I hadn't read the instructions, and because of my own laziness, I was suffering. Because I'd just assumed everything would work out for me, I was stuck in Gaffney, SC, inside a combination coffee shop and bookstore that still hadn't taken down its Christmas decorations, waiting for my bike to take its sweet time charging. If I hadn't been trapped there, I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more, but when you can't leave, even a nice coffee shop starts to feel like a prison.

At that point, I also knew I was committed. I'd ridden way too far to turn back, and the only option was to continue onto Charlotte. As long as I could make it, I could spend the next couple days pretending I didn't have to ride home. Besides, the hotel had EV charging, so at least I wouldn't have to worry about that. Once I had enough juice to at least make it to the hotel, I rode on.

Between Ingles and Gaffney I'd been listening to music, but for the last stretch, I wanted something to keep my mind off how stupid I'd been, so I started the Reacher audiobook. Would it be quality literature? Of course not. No one gets into Reacher because they think it's quality literature. They like Reacher because they like a big man solving everyone's problems by punching stuff. Sadly, the one downside of the Ruroc audio system is that it couldn't quite go loud enough to hear spoken words clearly on the highway. I don't know if louder speakers would have damaged my hearing, but it's at least something to be aware of. I did think it was fine for music, though. Just not an audiobook.

As I approached my final destination the Zero's range was getting scarily low, but I was mentally exhausted and just wanted to lie down. According to the GPS, I had almost exactly as many miles to go as I had miles of range, so I decided to push it. And thankfully, rush hour traffic slowed everything down, allowing me to make it no problem. I even had 16 miles to spare by the time I got to the hotel. Once the bike was on a charger, I collapsed on my bed, wondering how in the hell I'd turned a sub-four-hour ride into an eight-hour trip.

Maybe it was more. Maybe it was less. At that point, the entire day was a blur.

Fast forward to Sunday, and I had to make the whole trip again, this time with the knowledge that it would take far longer than anyone would reasonably be willing to tolerate. I'm not a reasonable person, though, so off I went, this time looking forward to that little coffee shop slash bookstore in Gaffney.

Except when I got to Gaffney, they were closed, along with almost every other place of business in the downtown area. After walking around, the only place I could find that was actually open was a spot with a bunch of Harleys in front and the promise that Guy Fieri had once given it his seal of approval. I'd tried to find a spot that looked more inviting, but when that's all that's open, what other choice do you have?

Thankfully, by the time I gave up on finding somewhere else to camp until I could ride to the Ingles, the Harley Men had left. And being no stranger to diners, drive-ins and dives, I ordered a Cheerwine and a chili dog plate, then found a corner of the bar where I could charge my phone.

Thankfully, no one gave me too much trouble while I was there, even if I very clearly didn't belong. And believe it or not, the chili didn't, either. The hot dogs themselves weren't great, but the chili on top of the dogs was solid. Eventually, though, the regulars started talking about politics, and it probably isn't hard to guess where a bunch of drunk guys in a small-town bar on a Sunday fall on the political spectrum (hint: they wanted a lot of my friends and some of my family members dead).

I decided to finish waiting on a bench near the charger.

Once the bike was charged enough it was time to hit the road again, heading right for Ingles. Thankfully, Ingles wasn't full of vocal bigots, so my stay there was a little less memorable than the one with the racists. I bought some food and a drink, messed around on my laptop, charged my phone and counted down the minutes until the bike would be charged enough to start on the final leg of my journey.

Not long after I hit the road for the final time, I had a choice to make. I could go a slightly longer way that had more chargers, or I could go the shorter, faster way with no chargers. Maybe it was dumb, but I chose the latter. I'd been on the road for so long, and I just wanted it to be over. It paid off, too, because I made it to my girlfriend's house with multiple miles of range left. Multiple!

Was my decision to road trip the Zero stupid? Absolutely. Except it didn't make me hate the bike. I may have hated myself for not reading the instructions before heading out, but price aside, I loved the bike, and I fully get the argument that making faster charging an option helps keep the MSRP down. If you're interested in a Zero and want to take it on short road trips, the faster charging is definitely a requirement, though. You very much do not want to get stuck in a racist bar for several hours while you wait for it to charge enough to get to your next stop.

Even with the volume issue, the Ruroc helmet test went much better. Everyone is going to have their own personal preferences for comfort, but odds are, if a helmet is comfortable on my weird head, it'll probably be even more comfortable for you. It also feels high enough quality that I don't think you'll regret buying a helmet with a fun superhero or Star Wars design. $475 still buys plenty of helmets, but if you like the designs and have the cash, it gets my stamp of approval.

Surprisingly, though, all the chargers I stopped at worked perfectly, and I didn't run into any problems there. If you want to hear about charger drama, you'll just have to wait to read about my next road trip, where I took another 150-mile EV to North Carolina: my 2024 Fiat 500e. Thankfully, I didn't get stranded, but let's just say the drive to Oak Island somehow went even worse.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/i-road-tripped-the-zero-s-so-you-dont-have-to/l-intro-1750269410.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 12:26:49.489175

30%: Texas Lawmakers Seek To Delay Tesla Robotaxi Launch

""If you need a geofence area, you don't have real self-driving,"" Elon Musk said in 2019. Granted, so much has happened between that year and now, so digging up old comments might seem pointless.

But it's worth noting that this pattern of overpromising and underdelivering is getting more and more obvious with Tesla. The robotaxi launch on Sunday will indeed be in a geofenced area, limited to the safest and most predictable streets of Austin. The initial rollout is expected to involve only 10-20 Model Ys.

Meanwhile, the Texas Legislature recently approved a revision to its autonomous vehicles operations framework, getting it more in line with the basic safety guardrails that other states also require. This revised set of rules will go into effect on Sept. 1.

As per those new rules, the autonomous vehicles should be:

Capable of operating in compliance with state traffic laws.

Equipped with a recording device.

Compliant with federal law, including federal motor vehicle safety standards.

Capable of achieving a minimal risk condition if the automated driving system is rendered inoperable.

Registered, titled and insured under Texas law.

Here's what the Democratic lawmakers added:

As members of the Austin delegation in the Texas Senate and Texas House of Representatives, we are formally requesting that Tesla delay autonomous robotaxi operations until the new law takes effect on September 1, 2025.

We believe this is in the best interest of public safety and building public trust in Tesla's operations.

If Tesla opts to proceed with the June 22, 2025, launch date, we request that you respond to this letter with detailed information demonstrating that Tesla will be compliant with the new law upon the launch of driverless operations in Austin.

Nonetheless, if social media posts are any indication, the launch is taking place as scheduled.

Not without some concerns, however. A brand-new Model Y equipped with Tesla’s latest Full Self-Driving (FSD) software—the same software that will guide the robotaxis—was seen violating a Texas traffic law just last week.

In a test conducted by The Dawn Project—which is known for being fiercely critical of FSD—the EV failed to stop for a school bus flashing yellow lights, despite the bus having two stop signs clearly extended. The Model Y then struck a child-sized dummy.

Critics on social media have pushed back, arguing the dummy was introduced too abruptly for any car to reasonably stop in time. But the car's failure to stop at two plainly visible stop signs is a straightforward violation of traffic law.

By comparison, look at this footage of a Waymo braking just milliseconds before nearly hitting a runaway dog. The dog darted into the street in almost the same way the dummy was introduced in front of the Tesla. The Waymo stopped. The Tesla didn’t.

Waymo relies on a far more robust sensor suite, including multiple lidars, radars, and cameras. Tesla, by contrast, uses cameras only. Which again raises the uncomfortable question of how these camera-only Model Ys will handle sudden road interruptions and the countless edge cases that vehicles are subjected to in the non-geofenced world.

60%: U.S. EV Battery Plants At Risk Amid Policy Reversal

Ford LMR Battery Cell Production

The U.S. is currently on track to meet its EV battery demand through 2030, according to a new study by independent research firm Rhodium Group. If all projects that have broken ground or are under construction proceed as planned, the country will have enough capacity to meet local demand and then some.

This surge in battery investment was driven by the Inflation Reduction Act, passed under the Biden administration to reduce U.S. reliance on China and boost domestic energy independence. But a rollback of these policies under a second Trump administration could jeopardize thousands of jobs tied to these factories.

If EV sales decline, automakers and suppliers could be left with dozens of battery plants producing cells for a market that's much smaller. And even if a future administration attempts to put the EV market back not track, companies and investors will be hesitant to play ball. Nobody wants to build a business around policies that keep changing every three or four years.

90%: Brazil Alarmed By Affordable Chinese EVs

The Rhodium Group study also notes that China is producing enough EVs and batteries for its domestic market, and for much of the rest of the world. That dynamic is already playing out in dozens of countries across Europe, South America and Southeast Asia, where a flood of affordable Chinese EVs has rapidly accelerated adoption. But it's also setting off alarm bells within local auto industries.

As Reuters reported on Friday, Brazil is quickly becoming a flashpoint in China’s global EV expansion. With relatively low import tariffs, the country has become a prime target for automakers like BYD, which is capitalizing on the opportunity, right down to using its own cargo ships to ferry tens of thousands of low-cost EVs to Brazilian ports.

Now, industry leaders in Brazil are pushing back. They are weighing new tariffs and exploring incentives to nudge Chinese automakers into building local factories and creating jobs, rather than simply flooding the market with imports.

100%: Should Congress Keep Battery Manufacturing Credits?

The U.S. can continue to be a gas truck and SUV country as much as it wants. But there's a strong case to keep the battery factories.

It's not just EVs that need the lithium-ion batteries; hybrids, plug-in hybrids and grid-stabilizing energy storage systems need them too. Above all, they promise to supercharge the U.S. economy with thousands of jobs and cutting-edge battery tech that would reduce the country's reliance on China.

Should the Senate rethink its aggressive anti-climate efforts and preserve battery manufacturing incentives that have kickstarted a domestic EV supply chain?

(June 20, 2025) – NFIB applauds today’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the case Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC, et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency. The Court reversed the decision of the D.C. Circuit Court, which had created a heightened standing requirement for indirectly regulated parties challenging actions by government agencies. NFIB filed an amicus brief in the case with the Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA) and several other business groups.

“Small businesses have the right to challenge overreach by government agencies and seek relief from harmful regulatory actions,” said Beth Milito, Vice President and Executive Director of NFIB’s Small Business Legal Center. “The D.C. Circuit’s opinion set an unreasonable standard for plaintiffs to prove that the court can remedy their injury. This would have made it nearly impossible for indirectly regulated parties to challenge regulating agencies. NFIB applauds the Court for reversing the lower court’s opinion and ensuring that small businesses have a clear course of action and a fair chance at proving that the court can provide suitable relief.”

The case concerns the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Clean Air Act waivers and increased standards for indirectly regulated parties seeking to prove that a court can remedy a plaintiff’s injury. NFIB’s brief argued that the D.C. Circuit’s opinion set an unworkable and incorrect standard for proving that the court can remedy a plaintiff’s injury, creates confusion in standing doctrine, and would adversely affect indirectly regulated parties. The Supreme Court agreed and reversed the D.C. Circuit’s unworkable standard.

Construction has also started on an energy hub at Merotherie, which will serve as a central switchboard to efficiently gather, manage and distribute renewable energy from throughout the REZ.

Hannah McCaughey, CEO of EnergyCo, hailed the start of construction on the REZ, with the zone set to fund community initiatives and generate thousands of jobs.

The REZ is the first in Australia to begin construction. By 2028, it will deliver at least 4.5GW of new network capacity. It will also help connect 7.7GW of wind and solar PV generation projects to the grid, an increase from the initial 6GW proposed.

PV Tech has previously reported that the New South Wales government is developing at least five separate multi-gigawatt REZ facilities connected to the grid and partially using long-duration energy storage (LDES) to replace traditional centralised power plants.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said energy firms pulled 95 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of gas from storage during the week ended June 13.","(Reuters) — U.S. natural gas futures slipped on June 20, but headed for its best week in more than a month, steered by forecasts for hotter weather that should boost the amount of gas power generators burn to keep air conditioners humming.

Gas futures for July delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 2 cents, or 0.5%, to $3.97 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), after hitting its highest level since April earlier in the session at $4.148. Prices were up over 10% so far for the week.

""It’s hot hot hot. Not only are temperatures heating up in the United States with a major heat wave, the tensions between Israel and Iran are still hot,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group.

""With temperatures expected to reach triple digits in major cities from Chicago to the East Coast could lead to a record-breaking demand for natural gas as air conditioners will be humming.""

On the geopolitical front, a week into its campaign, Israel said it had struck dozens of military targets overnight, including missile production sites, a research body involved in nuclear weapons development in Tehran and military facilities in western and central Iran.

The Iran-Israel conflict has intensified supply concerns in the global gas market, fueled by fears over the secure passage of LNG cargo through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most strategically significant chokepoints in the global energy supply chain.

Financial firm LSEG said average gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states stood at 105.3 billion cubic feet per day so far in June, which remains below the monthly record high of 106.3 Bcf/d in March due primarily to normal spring maintenance earlier in the month.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said energy firms pulled 95 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of gas from storage during the week ended June 13. That was a little smaller than the 98-Bcf build analysts forecast in a Reuters poll and compared with an increase of 72 Bcf during the same week last year and a five-year (2020-2024) average of 72 Bcf for this time of year.

""This week’s EIA report indicated a smaller storage injection than we had expected... But while conceding that such a supply will continue to deter hedge selling interest, we also feel that the storage excess could be easily erased as the summer proceeds if warmer than normal temperatures extend well into next month and if some hurricane premium is required,"" Ritterbush said in a note.

Meanwhile, Freeport LNG has requested a 40-month extension from federal regulators to complete the long-delayed Train 4 expansion at its Texas export facility, aiming to bring the project online by December 1, 2031, according to a filing.

In the state of Texas, this TI investment will be focused in Sherman, TX and Richardson, TX. TI’s largest mega-site in Sherman, Texas includes investment of up to $40 billion dollars for four fabs: SM1 and SM2 – already underway – and two additional fabs, SM3 and SM4

In Sherman, TI’s first new fab there will begin initial production this year — three years after breaking ground. Construction is also complete on the exterior shell of SM2, TI’s second new fab in Sherman. Incremental investment plans include two additional fabs, SM3 and SM4, to support future demand.

In Richardson, TI’s second fab there (RFAB2) continues to ramp to full production and builds on the company’s legacy of introducing the world’s first 300mm analog fab, RFAB1, in 2011.

TI’s facilities in Utah are increasing substantially as part of the $60 billion-plus investment.

In Lehi, UT, the company is ramping LFAB1, the company’s first 300mm wafer fab in that community. Construction is also well underway on LFAB2, TI’s second Lehi fab that will connect to LFAB1.

In December 2022, utility provider National Grid informed Rev. Nathan Ives of the St. Peter’s-San Pedro Episcopal Church in Salem that they had the right to change the building’s gas meter.

“The bill went from a hundred bucks a month to three thousand bucks a month overnight,” Ives said. “Obviously the meter was broken in our favor, and we didn’t realize it.”

The abrupt change thrust the church’s ambition to wean itself from fossil fuels into overdrive.

Now Ives is spearheading a project called “Heaven and Earth,” a proposed solar-powered climate resilience hub for the church and geothermal network that would provide heating and cooling for much of downtown Salem. The project would bake in long-term cost savings, but at an upfront cost in the tens of millions.

The solar—or “heaven”—portion of the project would retrofit the 19th century granite church with solar panels and batteries. The updates would provide uninterrupted heating and cooling, lighting, phone charging, internet access and cooking capacity for nearby residents to ride out future heat waves or storms.

The “earth” part of the proposal calls for a roughly mile-and-a-quarter geothermal loop connecting the church to 20 other buildings, including public housing, museums, condos, commercial space and Salem’s City Hall.

“It’s bigger than just the church,” said Ives, 60, whose congregation includes many low-income residents from a nearby, largely Latino neighborhood known as The Point. “It’s the community in the neighborhood.”

As he described the project in his church’s office, the gregarious parish priest constantly fielded calls, responded to texts and greeted visitors. He switched seamlessly between English and Spanish as discussions ranged from a recent meeting on reparations—St. Peter’s first two rectors held enslaved people—to preparations for Sunday services.

For Ana Nuncio, a member of the vestry, or parish council, and a founder of the Latino Leadership Coalition of Salem, the proposed solar and geothermal project has a strong Biblical connection.

“‘I saw a new heaven and a new earth,’” she said, quoting the Book of Revelation. “There’s no other initiative that could fit better under that banner than this one.”

Nuncio said the project is an extension of work the church already does, writing checks to members of the congregation who are least able to pay the soaring costs of winter heating bills.

“What we’re trying to do at St. Peter’s is to bring relief with utilities as they are now, but also tap into a whole new one and show that there can be a different way,” she said.

Tapping Geothermal Potential

In early 2024 the church received a $50,000 “Kickstart” grant from the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center to begin developing the geothermal portion of its proposal. The grant was one of 12 awarded to communities across the state to support geothermal networks, particularly those in environmental justice communities.

Salem’s geothermal loop would circulate water mixed with antifreeze beneath city streets and connect to 450 boreholes drilled beneath Salem Common, a historic 9-acre park in the city center where livestock once grazed. Each borehole would be approximately 500 feet deep, allowing the system to tap into subsurface thermal energy where temperatures are a steady 56 degrees year round.

The pipes would harness this thermal energy for heating in the winter and for cooling in the summer, significantly reducing building energy needs. A ground source heat pump located in each building would provide additional heating or cooling, depending on the time of year.

The proposal, an initial sketch of what’s theoretically possible rather than a detailed engineering plan, was outlined in a 328-page draft feasibility study published in April by geothermal energy company Achieve Renewable Energy and engineering firm B2Q Associates.

The project would be similar, though significantly larger, than a recently completed geothermal network in Framingham, Massachusetts, built by gas utility Eversource.

“It’s really exciting to think of a downtown geothermal system in Salem that’s serving multiple buildings,” said Neal Duffy, the city’s director of sustainability and resiliency.

Salem, and multiple communities across the state, have a goal of zeroing out greenhouse gas emissions from buildings by 2050.

“We need to be thinking about projects like this to come anywhere close to reaching those goals, rather than one building at a time,” Duffy said.

Eight of the 21 buildings included in the report belong to the Peabody Essex Museum, one of the largest and oldest art museums in the country. The museum had previously looked at installing geothermal for its own heating and cooling needs but had decided against it.

“We thought geothermal was a little out of reach for us in our initial assessments,” said Kurt Steinberg, the museum’s chief operating officer. “This makes it a possibility for us.”

Steinberg said a community-wide project, and the economy of scale that comes with it, helps bring down the cost for everyone. “And then it’s not just you,” he added. “You’re all in it together.”

“A Model for Other Communities”

The St. Peter’s-San Pedro church was founded in 1733 on land donated by Philip English, a wealthy merchant who was accused of witchcraft during the witch hysteria that consumed Salem in the late 1600s. The Salem Witch Museum, a history museum a couple of blocks from the church on the edge of the Common, is included in the proposed geothermal loop.

Tina Jordan, the museum’s executive director, was one of more than a dozen community and business leaders who contributed to the report by sharing energy usage information.

“We want to hear, is this something that would be good for the neighborhood, the environment and the community, and is it something we can afford?” Jordan said. “With energy costs spiraling out of control, I’m hoping this is something we can control, and if successful, will be a model for other communities.”

The feasibility report puts the project cost at $56 million for the borefield and geothermal loop. The figure does not include the installation of heat pumps, ductwork or other modifications that may be required for each of the individual buildings.

Federal tax credits could cut the figure by as much as half. Geothermal projects are eligible for a 30 percent credit. Additional credits for projects that use materials made in America and are located in “energy communities”—areas that have or previously had significant fossil fuel infrastructure, such as the Salem Harbor coal power plant that closed in 2014—could take an additional 20 percent off project costs.

A federal budget reconciliation bill currently making its way through Congress could end most Biden-era clean energy tax credits in the coming months. The House version, passed by Republicans in an entirely party-line vote in May, wouldn’t immediately eliminate credits for commercial-scale geothermal projects but would end them three years earlier than planned. Large projects, like the one proposed for Salem, would need to begin construction before Jan. 1, 2032. A draft of the Senate bill would preserve the existing Jan. 1, 2035, deadline for large-scale geothermal heating and cooling projects.

“I am genuinely optimistic that geothermal utilities have a clear path forward and will remain supported,” said Zeyneb Magavi, executive director of HEET, a Boston-based nonprofit that focuses on geothermal networks.

The Framingham geothermal project cost $24 million, including building retrofits, prior to receiving a 30 percent tax credit. The $56 million pre-tax-credit projected cost for the Salem project does not include building retrofits, but the proposed project would be several times larger than in Framingham.

Eric Bosworth oversaw the Framingham geothermal project when he worked for Eversource. Now running the consultancy Thermal Energy Insights, he praised the initial feasibility assessment for Salem but questioned some of the projected costs.

For example, Bosworth said the cost to install the pipe for the loop connecting the 21 buildings was several times higher than what he would expect.

“If I were bidding this work out myself, I would push back pretty strongly on the pipe costs and markups / extras and [that’s] assuming it really needed 450 bores,” Bosworth said in an email.

More than half of the projected cost for the Salem project would go to borefield construction. However, as performance data from existing geothermal networks is becoming available, industry experts say similar projects may not need as many holes in the ground as they previously thought.

When buildings with different heating and cooling needs are connected in a network, their individual thermal energy requirements can cancel each other out, reducing the total capacity requirements of the system. In addition, the thermal energy stored in the subsurface loop that connects each building can further reduce the number of bores required.

“We have documented a significant gap between the predicted borefield size using traditional geothermal industry rules of thumb and the actual borefield size needed to meet the building loads — at times a shocking 20-50% lower!” Magavi, whose nonprofit oversaw the state’s Kickstart grant program, said in an email.

Lawrence Lessard, president of the New England Geothermal Professional Association and the director of Achieve Renewable Energy, which co-prepared the report, said the cost figures were preliminary, conservative and based on the best available information.

For example, Lessard said, they weren’t able to obtain daily energy use for individual buildings and instead had to estimate monthly averages, which can mean overestimating how much capacity is required. In addition, the report noted that “the electric and gas utility”—National Grid—did not respond to inquiries about the location of existing infrastructure, which a developer would have to work around when installing the geothermal loop.

Installing piping around existing—and often aging—infrastructure in a thickly settled urban environment could impact both the cost of installation and also the depth at which the geothermal loop is buried. If the loop can be buried deep enough underground, the network may need fewer bores. If the loop has to be placed closer to the surface, Lessard said, more bores may be needed.

“We don’t know at this time whether there’d be a net benefit or a net detriment,” Lessard said of whether the geothermal loop’s impact on the system would require fewer bores or more. “You have to remember that this is a feasibility-level evaluation.”

Another challenge for infrastructure projects unique to Salem is the massive influx of tourists that come each year for Halloween, with “Haunted Happenings” starting in early October. A shorter construction season could increase overall construction time and costs.

Lessard said he hopes the cost for the project could be “substantially less” but added that it’s better for an estimate to end up higher than actual costs, rather than the other way around.

Even if the number of bores can be reduced and organizers can take full advantage of existing tax credits, the project would still likely cost tens of millions of dollars.

For Framingham, the local gas utility paid for the project’s costs, which it plans to recoup over time through ratepayer charges.

National Grid, the gas utility for Salem, cancelled a geothermal pilot project in nearby Lowell late last year, citing cost concerns. However, the company is moving forward with another pilot in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston.

“Geothermal heat pumps, which are four times more efficient than standard electric resistance heating, can be a solution, especially for larger buildings and campuses,” said Christine Milligan, a spokeswoman for National Grid. “Our geothermal demonstration program evaluates the potential for networked geothermal energy systems to provide highly efficient space heating and cooling to multiple customers connected to the same system as an alternative to natural gas.”

While National Grid is not currently involved in the project in Salem, Milligan added, the utility is supportive of it.

St. Peter’s Ives said he would welcome the opportunity to work with National Grid on the project but is also pursuing community ownership, perhaps in partnership with a private equity company or other entity that can finance the initial costs. Such a model may prove more challenging than if it were built by a gas company that already has many of the financial and technical capabilities required for such a project.

However, community-owned projects exist elsewhere, or are in the works. The city of West Union, Iowa, owns a geothermal network that it leases to a nonprofit organization made up of building owners who manage the system.

Blacks in Green, a Chicago-based nonprofit focused on environmental justice and economic development, seeks to develop a community geothermal project on Chicago’s South Side.

In November 2024, residents in Ann Arbor, Michigan, voted to create a municipally owned geothermal energy utility to provide heating and cooling to one of its neighborhoods.

The Heaven and Earth project has received approximately $250,000 in funding thus far. Organizers have also applied for a grant from a Coalition for Green Capital program—funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund—that could provide up to an additional $2.25 million.

However, the EPA put a freeze on the entire Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund in February, an action now being challenged in court. Applications for the Municipal Investment Fund, the grant that the church and other collaborators applied for, are currently under review, “contingent on availability of funding,” according to the program’s website.

Meanwhile, Ives continues to pursue other funding opportunities. He also dials down thermostats—religiously—and layers up during the winter.

A self-described “sweater guy,” he raves about Icelandic sweaters and their triple-spun wool, which he says are “wicked warm.”

For the next few months, staying warm won’t be a challenge. However, he dreads the fall, when he’ll have to restart the church’s aging steam boiler, a time when the heating system is most prone to failing.

The church spent $10,000 on boiler repairs this past year alone, not counting asbestos removal they had to do before they could initiate the work, Ives said.

“We have to do something quickly, or as quickly as we can,” he said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Heaven-and-Earth.-Rev.-Ives.-and-boiler.-Jonathan-Wiggs-Boston-Globe-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 17:07:09.656247

According to FactSet data, shares of rooftop solar energy firms Sunrun and SolarEdge have declined by 36% and 29% since the release of the Senate's version of the One Big Beautiful Bill earlier this week, which accelerates subsidy cuts to the sector. Supplier to the sector, Enphase Energy , has also plummeted by 20%. The Senate's draft ends clean electricity tax credits for wind and solar in 2028, with a gradual decrease starting in 2026. Earlier versions of the bill prescribed subsidies would be curtailed in 2029 or 3031. Investment banks have also rushed to downgrade residential solar stocks, citing an ""ongoing and overwhelming regulatory overhang"". KeyBanc Capital Markets slashed its ratings for all three solar stocks to ""Underweight,"" warning that the new bill ""may challenge their business models"". RBC Capital Markets followed suit, lowering its price target for Sunrun and Enphase by 58% and 44%, respectively. Investors haven't slammed the brakes on all stocks in the solar energy sector, with shares of solar panel makers First Solar and Toyo taking less damage. The rooftop collapse The Senate proposal aims to terminate Section 25D, which has fueled the industry's growth by offering homeowners 30% of the cost of installing solar panels on rooftops through tax credits. ""The rooftop solar industry, they are toast,"" Per Lekander, founder of hedge fund Clean Energy Transition, told CNBC's Squawk Box Wednesday. ""I think the whole sector could get wiped out"" Wall Street analysts have echoed that bleak assessment. RBC's analysts, led by Christopher Dendrinos, said they were lowering demand and margin assumptions for residential solar names based on the proposed ""resi solar lease restrictions and termination of 25D"". Janney analysts meanwhile noted the Senate proposal means ""residential solar being boxed out of tax credits"", creating ""more headwinds for domestic residential solar demand"". These legislative headwinds come as the sector is already under pressure from higher interest rates, which have made consumer financing more expensive. Lekander pointed to the recent bankruptcy of U.S. energy firm Sunnova as evidence of his assessment. Resilient and insulated While the rooftop sector faces an existential threat, the utility-scale market — which builds large solar farms to power data centers, factories, and entire communities — appears to be somewhat insulated. It is shielded from the impact of subsidy withdrawal largely due to its customer base, its economics, and a sheer lack of viable alternatives. ""We believe utility solar will be more resilient,"" wrote RBC's Dendrinos in a June 18 note to clients, because ""these projects are not limited by the leasing restrictions"" and the ""outlook for growing electricity demand remains strong"". The customers for these projects are not individual households but corporations like Meta and Amazon, for whom energy is a relatively small part of a multi-billion-dollar data center budget. ""If you [build] a data center, energy power is like 7% of the cost. If 7% of the cost [becomes] 9% of the cost, do you think they will stop this project? I do not think so,"" Lekander said. In May, Meta Platforms, owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, inked a deal with utility AES Corp to supply 650 megawatts of solar energy in Texas and Kansas. AES, in turn, will purchase solar panels from manufacturers and suppliers to build the solar farms. In June, the utility company also announced the completion of a 500-megawatt solar farm, with 500 megawatts of battery capacity that can last up to four hour, which will supply power to Amazon's data centers. This insensitive demand is also strengthened by the impracticality of alternatives. ""If you were to go and try to do a gas turbine, you would probably get it delivered in 2033,"" Lekander said. ""If you want to build a nuclear plant, it's 2040."" ""A solar plant you can do in one year,"" the investor added. This reality, analysts suggest, makes utility-scale solar relatively better positioned. RBC's Dendrinos says that ""even absent tax credits we believe solar remains highly cost competitive with other fossil fuel generation technologies"". However, the Senate bill includes a surprise provision that would repeal the ""stacking"" of the manufacturing tax credit, and hurt Arizona-based First Solar, America's largest panel manufacturer. The change could prevent the company from claiming credits for each stage of its integrated process—wafer, cell, and module—potentially more than halving its benefit from $0.17 per watt to just $0.07 per watt, according to RBC Capital Markets. But Per Lakander says the sell-off in First Solar is not a crisis but a ""great buying opportunity"" for long-term shareholders. Asked about the valuation of First Solar's double-digit percent stock plunge, he answered unequivocally: ""It is wrongly priced. Okay? It's going to double.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106858068-1616514233528solar-home4-jpg?v=1695904818&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-06-20 12:22:02.521457

By type, air blast circuit breakers are expected to hold larger market share throughout forecast period

The air blast circuit breaker segment is expected to capture a significant share of the North American Air Circuit Breaker Market during the forecast period because of its better performance traits and applicability in medium-voltage and high-demand applications. Air blast circuit breakers utilize compressed high-pressure air to rapidly and effectively extinguish arcs, and as such, are suited for applications that demand the high-speed interruption of fault currents, such as power plants, industrial substations, and extensive business complexes. Their high-speed performance capability to manage frequent operations and guarantee greater electrical safety ranks them higher than simple air circuit breakers in mission-critical applications. In addition, air blast breakers generally represent lower maintenance requirements and longer life cycles, which add to their attractiveness for utility and industrial customers looking for long-term dependability and operational efficiency. As North America continues replacing aging infrastructure and incorporating renewable energy and distributed generation, demand for high-performance, arc-resistant switching technologies such as air blast circuit breakers is anticipated to grow steadily.

By voltage, low voltage segment to account for majority of market share throughout forecast period.

The low-voltage segment is anticipated to hold a larger market share of the North American Air Circuit Breaker Market during the forecast period, owing to its extensive usage in industrial, commercial, and infrastructure sectors. Low-voltage air circuit breakers, rated below 1 kV, play a vital role in the protection of electrical circuits in industrial plants, commercial facilities, data centers, hospitals, and institutional building environments where electrical security, equipment protection, and continuity of power are paramount. They are preferred due to their simplicity of installation, economic implications, and compatibility with intelligent monitoring systems and are, therefore, appropriate for contemporary energy management approaches. Also, contributing to the growth is the relentless growth of data centers, fast-paced commercial growth, and the upgrading of electrical infrastructure in cities throughout the US and Canada. As the focus on energy efficiency, automation, and smart grid compatibility intensifies, the low-voltage ACB segment is poised to continue leading the market.

US to lead North American market during forecast period

During the forecast period, the US is expected to dominate the North American Air Circuit Breaker Market due to massive infrastructure upgrades, increasing industrial automation, and robust policy support for clean energy integration and grid reliability.

Already, the US Department of Energy (DoE) has ordered the JH Campbell coal plant on Lake Michigan to remain open beyond its 31 May closure date, while the administration is expected to prolong the life of the Monroe power plant on Lake Erie, currently scheduled to begin closing in 2028.

Opponents say the order has little support in Michigan, could cost ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars, and is ideologically driven. The state’s utilities have said they did not ask for the plants to stay online, and the Trump administration did not communicate with stakeholders before the order, a spokesperson for the Michigan public service commission (MPSC), which regulates utilities and manages the state’s grid, told the Guardian.

“The unnecessary recent order … will increase the cost of power for homes and businesses in Michigan and across the midwest,” the chair of the MPSC, Dan Scripps, said in a statement. “We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed. As a result, there is no existing energy emergency in either Michigan or [the regional US grid].”

The massive and ageing facilities also release high levels of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter into the air. Meanwhile, their coal ash ponds leach arsenic, lead, lithium, radium and sulfate into local drinking water and the Great Lakes. The Monroe power plant is responsible for more arsenic water pollution than any other power plant in the US.

The DoE in a statement told the Guardian the plan was about grid reliability, and added: “Decommissioning baseload power sources such as coal plants would jeopardize the reliability of our grid systems.

“This administration is committed to ensuring Americans have access to reliable, affordable, and secure energy that isn’t dependent on whether the sun shines or the wind blows,” a spokesperson added.

However, Consumers Energy said in May said it did not need to keep the coal plant online to meet energy needs. It recently bought a nearby gas plant, and has begun building large-scale renewable installations.

The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which maintains the regional grid across 15 states, issued a report stating that while there is some risk for power disruption in the summer months, it is low, and “adequate resources are available to maintain reliability”.

That could set the stage for a lawsuit from Michigan’s attorney general, Dana Nessel, who said in May she may sue over the order to keep the Campbell plant open, and labeled Trump’s energy emergency “fabricated”.

The Campbell plant will initially remain open for 90 days, but the order is expected to be renewed, said Jan O’Connell, senior energy organizer with the Sierra Club Michigan.

Michigan’s climate law requires 100% clean energy for utilities by 2040. Consumers Energy, which owns the Campbell plant, has since 2021 been planning for the plant’s closure as required by the state’s energy plan. The company said the Campbell plant’s closure would save ratepayers about $600m by 2040.

The plant largely shut down for several days before reopening at the end of May, O’Connell said. She noted that many of the employees had already found other jobs, and purchasing coal on the spot is far more expensive than purchasing it months ahead of time, as is standard.

The administration’s order is costly and disruptive, and makes no sense for Consumers Energy or its customers, O’Connell said.

“This is going to cost the ratepayers a lot of money,” she added.

The Trump administration’s plans are also at odds with market forces, opponents say. Gas and renewables are generally cheaper and cause less pollution. Moreover, the nation’s utilities are planning to reduce coal generation by more than 8GW by the end of the year, according to the US Energy Information Administration.

O’Connell said it appeared to be an ideological move with no basis in the needs of residents or the energy market.

“This is part of their goal to get rid of renewables and bring back fossil fuels,” she added.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7e002ae93aafad62d511e655a4498e765b18fbb/658_0_3274_2619/master/3274.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eefd0b18b01ff0f352e80c8cff91d95c,N,,2025-06-20 12:23:16.889165

That provision is similarly meant to address declining revenue from gas taxes.","Starting next year, Minnesota electric vehicle owners will have to pay at least double to register their EVs. Blame the change on their freedom from gas taxes.

A provision in the transportation bill that passed earlier this month raises the EV registration surcharge from $75 to at least $150. Drivers of plug-in-hybrids will also have to pay a minimum of $75 to register their vehicles.

The new fees, which go into effect in January, will scale up with more expensive vehicles — meaning some drivers could see their annual registration costs hit $200 or more.

For years, Minnesota lawmakers have debated how to fill a growing gap in roadway funds as more fuel efficient cars and trucks, as well as more electric vehicles, leads to less revenue from the state’s gas tax.

“Electric vehicle drivers are going to be paying over the next four years somewhere around $40 million,” said Rep. Jon Koznick, the Republican co-chair of the House Transportation Finance and Policy Committee. “That does help offset declining gas tax revenues.”

Rep. Erin Koegel, Koznick’s DFL counterpart on the Transportation Committee, said the new fee structure is far from perfect, but she’s glad lawmakers included a sliding scale rather than a flat fee of $200, as originally proposed.

Lawmakers said that EV drivers will see reduced registration fees in July 2027, when a public charging station tax takes effect. Under that scheme, owners of certain fast chargers will have to pay 5 cents for every kilowatt hour. Minnesota’s transportation bill also created a work group to study electricity as a fuel source and recommend a kilowatt hour tax similar to the gas tax.

Republicans and DFLers each hold 67 seats in the House, which left little room for disagreement during the budget negotiations. “This is kind of the best that we could get with the circumstances of divided government and all that,” Koegel said.

Not everyone was happy with the compromise.

“We’re actually going against the state’s electrification goals by doing this,” said Carolyn Berninger, who works on public policy issues for Drive Electric Minnesota, a coalition of clean energy advocacy groups. “It’s going to make some prospective EV buyers pretty nervous. Electric vehicles already cost more upfront than a comparable gas car.”

Berninger said she’s especially concerned with the timing of the new fees, which come as Congress considers phasing out federal tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases in this year’s budget bill. The bill, backed by President Donald Trump, also includes a new $250 annual fee for electric vehicle drivers. That provision is similarly meant to address declining revenue from gas taxes.

Jukka Kukkonen, an electrical engineering instructor at the University of St. Thomas and founder of the Minnesota-based EV consulting firm Shift2Electric, said EV drivers were already paying their fair share in taxes with the $75 annual fee.

If someone driving a Toyota Prius hybrid, which gets 45 miles to the gallon, paid the gas tax, their average annual cost would be less than $100, he said.

How much Minnesotans pay in gas taxes each year on average is a matter of debate.

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics estimates that the average gasoline car gets roughly 25 miles per gallon, while trucks and SUVs get about 17 miles per gallon. Minnesotans drove an average of 13,957 miles in 2022, according to the most recent data made public by the Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration. When put together with Minnesota’s gas tax rate, which stands at 31.8 cents per gallon, an average driver in the state pays anywhere from $177 to $246 a year in gas taxes.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/20/PDTN/84285647007-bizautoevcostsminndmt.jpg?crop=2996,1687,x0,y0&width=2996&height=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-06-20 12:25:40.090428

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

_________________

No. 24–7

_________________

Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC, et al., PETITIONERS v. Environmental Protection Agency, et al.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit

Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the Court.

Pursuant to the Clean Air Act, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency approved California regulations requiring automakers to alter their fleets of new vehicles. Under those California regulations, automakers must manufacture more electric vehicles and fewer gasoline-powered vehicles. The goal is to decrease emissions from the use of gasoline and other liquid fuels. Producers of gasoline and other liquid fuels sued EPA, arguing that EPA’s approval of the California regulations violated the Clean Air Act.

The sole issue before this Court is whether the fuel producers have standing to maintain their suit.

The fuel producers assert that the California regulations reduce the manufacture and sale of cars powered by gasoline and other liquid fuels, thereby causing a decrease in sales of those fuels by the fuel producers. So fuel producers take in less revenue than they would in a free market. Invalidating the regulations, they say, would remove a regulatory impediment to their ability to fully compete in the market. And without California’s regulations in effect, manufacturers would likely make more cars powered by gasoline and other liquid fuels, thereby increasing purchases of those fuels and redressing the fuel producers’ injury.

EPA and California dispute redressability. They suggest that, even if the regulations are invalidated, car manufacturers nonetheless would not manufacture more gasoline-powered cars. They posit that the California regulations no longer have any impact because, in a free market, consumer demand for and manufacturers’ supply of electric vehicles would still supposedly exceed what the California regulations mandate.

Based on this Court’s precedents and the evidence in the record, we hold that the fuel producers have standing. We therefore reverse the contrary judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit and remand for that court to consider the merits of the fuel producers’ legal claims.

I

A

As relevant here, the Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, to periodically “prescribe . . . standards” that limit emissions of certain air pollutants from new motor vehicles. 42 U. S. C. §7521(a)(1). To promote uniformity in vehicle emissions regulations, the Act also preempts state standards “relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles.” §7543(a).

But the Act’s preemption provision exempts California. Under certain circumstances, California may adopt emissions standards for new motor vehicles that are more stringent than EPA’s. California may do so when it concludes that more stringent standards are needed to meet “compelling and extraordinary conditions.” §7543(b)(1)(B). Other States may also adopt California’s stricter limits on emissions from new motor vehicles, but may not adopt or enforce state standards that differ from California’s. §7507.

The upshot of this system is that EPA sets nationwide emissions standards for new motor vehicles; California in limited circumstances may set more stringent emissions standards for vehicles sold in the State; and other States may either follow EPA’s standards or adopt California’s but may not set their own.

Over the years, California has often requested and received EPA approval for stricter emissions standards to combat local California air-quality problems like smog. See, e.g., 38 Fed. Reg. 10319 (1973).

Beginning in 2005, California also attempted to use its unique preemption exception as one means to address global climate change. As relevant here, the State asked EPA for approval of regulations that limit greenhouse-gas emissions and force electrification of the new vehicle fleet sold in the State. See 73 Fed. Reg. 12157 (2008).

In 2008, under the George W. Bush administration, EPA denied California’s first such request. EPA explained that the Clean Air Act permits California to enact standards to address local and regional pollution where the causal factors are tied to California. But EPA reasoned that the authority granted to California did not extend to efforts to combat global climate change. See id., at 12156–12157, 12168.

Since then, as Presidential administrations have come and gone, EPA has repeatedly altered its legal position on whether the Clean Air Act authorizes California regulations targeting greenhouse-gas emissions from new motor vehicles.

This case involves California’s 2012 request for EPA approval of new California regulations. As relevant here, those regulations generally require automakers (i) to limit average greenhouse-gas emissions across their fleets of new motor vehicles sold in the State and (ii) to manufacture a certain percentage of electric vehicles as part of their vehicle fleets. Cal. Code Regs., tit. 13, §§1961.3, 1962.2 (2022). The greenhouse-gas emissions limits remain in force indefinitely into the future, and the specific requirements for electric vehicles in new vehicle fleets run through model year 2025. See ibid. (EPA has separately approved a new California electric-vehicle mandate that applies through model year 2035 and beyond; that separate set of regulations is not at issue in this suit. )

Under President Obama, EPA reversed its legal position and, in 2013, allowed the California regulations to take effect. 78 Fed. Reg. 2112 (2013). Then in 2019, under President Trump, EPA flipped back and rescinded approval of the California regulations. 84 Fed. Reg. 51328 (2019). In 2022, under President Biden, EPA again reversed course and reinstated approval of California’s regulations. 87 Fed. Reg. 14333 (2022). That is where things stand as of now, although President Trump has directed EPA to again reconsider its approval of California’s standards. Exec. Order No. 14154, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353–8354 (2025).

To date, acting pursuant to the Clean Air Act, 17 States and the District of Columbia have copied California’s greenhouse-gas emissions standards for new motor vehicles, the electric-vehicle mandate, or both. Together with California, those jurisdictions account for about 40 percent of America’s market for new cars and light-duty trucks.

In 2022, after EPA reinstated approval of California’s 2012 regulations, several fuel producers sued EPA in the D. C. Circuit. The fuel producers primarily argued that EPA lacked authority under the Clean Air Act to approve the California regulations. They reasoned that the regulations did not target a local California air-quality problem—as they say is required by the Clean Air Act—but instead were designed to address global climate change.

The fuel producers manufacture and sell automobile fuels such as gasoline, diesel, and ethanol. For example, American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers is a national trade association that represents many American fuel companies that produce and sell gasoline and other liquid fuels for automobiles. Diamond Alternative Energy sells renewable diesel, an alternative to traditional petroleum-derived diesel. Valero Renewable Fuels Company manufactures and sells ethanol.

To establish Article III standing for their D. C. Circuit challenge, the fuel producers submitted 14 declarations and devoted two pages of their opening brief to standing. In one declaration, for example, an analyst for American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers explained that “the demand for gasoline and diesel fuel will be depressed” by California’s regulations (also adopted by 17 other States) because they “require the sale of vehicles that use less gasoline and diesel fuel” or “use no liquid fuel at all.” App. 172–174. As support, the declaration quoted California’s own estimate that “its regulations would cause ‘substantial reductions in demand for gasoline exceeding $1 billion beginning in 2020 and increasing to over $10 billion in 2030.’ ” Id., at 173. Various fuel producers further stated that those “injuries would be substantially ameliorated if EPA’s decision” to reinstate the waiver “were set aside.” Id., at 137, 181.

Notably, in the D. C. Circuit, EPA did not argue that the fuel producers lacked Article III standing. EPA’s silence on standing was telling—the proverbial dog that did not bark—because EPA routinely challenges a party’s standing when the agency believes that injury in fact, causation, or redressability is questionable. So EPA’s failure to do so here tends to suggest that EPA believed that the fuel producers had standing.

California, along with other States that chose to adopt California’s regulations, intervened in the D. C. Circuit to defend EPA’s approval of those regulations. To support its motion to intervene, California submitted declarations emphasizing the importance of the regulations—now and in the future—to meeting California’s emissions-control goals. For example, a California official responsible for Clean Air Act compliance stated that, without the regulations, “it is reasonable to expect that there would be fewer” electric vehicles “produced and sold . . . , and thus additional gasoline-fueled vehicles produced and sold during these model years.” Id., at 110. All of that “would increase criteria pollutant emissions,” as California’s own “modeling has confirmed.” Ibid. Another California official explained that invalidating the fleet-wide emissions standards and electric-vehicle mandate “would result in higher greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions” from the “additional gasoline-fueled cars” that would be produced and sold. Id., at 115.

After the D. C. Circuit granted California’s motion to intervene, however, California completely changed its tune about the continuing impact of the regulations. In its merits briefing in that court, California suddenly argued that the fuel producers lacked Article III standing because they had not “established any probability” that automobile “manufacturers would change course if EPA’s decision were vacated.” Brief for State and Local Government Respondent-Intervenors in No. 22–1081 (CADC), p. 15. Specifically, California suggested that because of supposed “surging consumer demand” for electric vehicles, invalidating the fleet-wide emissions standards and electric-vehicle mandate would not cause vehicle manufacturers to make more gasoline-powered vehicles. Id., at 14. Therefore, California argued that judicial invalidation of the California regulations was not likely to redress the fuel producers’ injuries.

The D. C. Circuit agreed with California and held that the fuel producers lacked Article III standing. Ohio v. EPA, 98 F. 4th 288, 300 (2024). The court explained that redressability depended on how third-party automakers would act in the absence of California’s fleet-wide emissions standards and electric-vehicle mandate. According to the D. C. Circuit, the fuel producers failed to “cite any record evidence” or “file additional affidavits or other evidence” demonstrating that automakers would respond to invalidation of the regulations by producing fewer electric vehicles and more gasoline-powered vehicles. Id., at 303 (quotation marks and alteration omitted).

This Court granted certiorari limited to the question of whether the fuel producers have Article III standing. 604 U. S. ___ (2024).

Article III of the Constitution confines the jurisdiction of federal courts to “Cases” and “Controversies.” §2, cl. 1. For a lawsuit to constitute a case within the meaning of Article III, the plaintiff must have standing to sue. To demonstrate standing, plaintiffs must answer a basic question—“ ‘What’s it to you?’ ” FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U. S. 367, 379 (2024) (quoting A. Scalia, The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential Element of the Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 881, 882 (1983)). In other words, plaintiffs must show that they possess “a ‘personal stake’ in the dispute” and are not mere bystanders. 602 U. S., at 379 (quoting TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U. S. 413, 423 (2021)).

“By limiting who can sue, the standing requirement implements ‘the Framers’ concept of the proper—and properly limited—role of the courts in a democratic society.’ ” 602 U. S., at 380 (quoting J. Roberts, Article III Limits on Statutory Standing, 42 Duke L. J. 1219, 1220 (1993)). Standing doctrine also “ ‘tends to assure that the legal questions presented to the court will be resolved, not in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society, but in a concrete factual context conducive to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action.’ ” 602 U. S., at 379 (quoting Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 472 (1982)).

This Court’s “cases have established that the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements”: injury in fact, causation, and redressability. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992).

The first requirement, injury in fact, requires the plaintiff to demonstrate an injury that is “concrete,” “particularized,” and “actual or imminent, not speculative.” Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U. S., at 381 (quotation marks omitted). “Monetary costs are of course an injury.” United States v. Texas, 599 U. S. 670, 676 (2023).

The second and third requirements, causation and redressability, are usually “flip sides of the same coin.” Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U. S., at 380 (quotation marks omitted). Causation requires the plaintiff to show “that the injury was likely caused by the defendant,” and redressability requires the plaintiff to demonstrate “that the injury would likely be redressed by judicial relief.” TransUnion, 594 U. S., at 423. “If a defendant’s action causes an injury, enjoining the action or awarding damages for the action will typically redress that injury.” Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U. S., at 381. To be sure, redressability “can still pose an independent bar in some cases,” but “the two key questions in most standing disputes are injury in fact and causation.” Id., at 381, and n. 1. The additional redressability requirement generally serves to ensure that there is a sufficient “relationship between ‘the judicial relief requested’ and the ‘injury’ suffered.” California v. Texas, 593 U. S. 659, 671 (2021) (quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 753, n. 19 (1984)); see Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U. S. 255, 292–293 (2023).

Importantly, if a plaintiff is “an object of the action (or forgone action) at issue,” then “there is ordinarily little question that the action or inaction has caused him injury, and that a judgment preventing or requiring the action will redress it.” Lujan, 504 U. S., at 561–562.

When the plaintiff is not the object of a government regulation, however, causation and redressability often depend on how regulated third parties not before the court will act in response to the government regulation or judicial relief. See Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U. S., at 383. Courts must distinguish the “predictable” from the “speculative” effects of government action or judicial relief on third parties. Ibid.; see also Department of Commerce v. New York, 588 U. S. 752, 768 (2019). With respect to causation (and redressability), a court must conclude that “ ‘third parties will likely react’ ” to the government regulation (or judicial relief) “ ‘in predictable ways’ ” that will likely cause (or redress) the plaintiff’s injury. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U. S., at 383 (quoting California, 593 U. S., at 675).

Here, the fuel producers say that they suffered injury in fact caused by the California regulations. They point out that the entire purpose of California’s fleet-wide emissions standards and electric-vehicle mandate is to reduce the use of gasoline and other liquid fuels in motor vehicles as compared to what otherwise would occur in a free market. The regulations cause automakers to, among other things, produce fewer gasoline-powered vehicles. That in turn causes fewer gasoline sales, leading to a monetary injury in fact for producers of gasoline and other liquid fuels.

As to redressability, the fuel producers say that invalidating the California regulations would likely redress their injury because it would remove a regulatory impediment to the sale and use of their products. They further contend that, absent the regulations, automakers would likely produce fewer electric vehicles and more gasoline-powered vehicles. Production of those vehicles would predictably lead to more purchases of gasoline and other liquid fuels sold by the fuel producers. In short, they argue that when the government tells automakers to make more cars that use less gasoline, there should be little question that the gasoline producers have standing to sue.

In this Court, neither EPA nor California meaningfully disputes injury in fact or causation. But they argue that the fuel producers did not establish redressability. According to EPA and California, even if the California regulations are invalidated, the fuel producers have not shown that vehicle manufacturers would reduce the percentage of their fleets that consist of electric vehicles (or otherwise stated, increase the percentage that consists of gasoline-powered vehicles). EPA and California suggest that the automobile market has changed—apparently permanently in their view—and strong consumer demand for (and manufacturers’ supply of) electric vehicles means that automakers are unlikely to manufacture or sell any additional gasoline-powered cars even if the California regulations are invalidated.

III

We hold that the fuel producers have standing to sue.

To begin, the injury in fact and causation elements of the fuel producers’ standing, which no party disputes, are straightforward.

As for injury in fact, the fuel producers make money by selling fuel. Therefore, the decrease in purchases of gasoline and other liquid fuels resulting from the California regulations hurts their bottom line. Those monetary costs “are of course an injury.” United States v. Texas, 599 U. S. 670, 676 (2023).

As for causation, EPA’s approval authorized California (and ultimately 17 other States) to enforce regulations that require lower fleet-wide greenhouse-gas emissions and the electrification of automakers’ vehicle fleets, thereby reducing purchases of liquid fuels such as gasoline. The regulations likely cause fuel producers’ monetary injuries because the regulations likely cause a decrease in purchases of gasoline and other liquid fuels for automobiles. Indeed, that is the whole point of the regulations.

As for redressability, invalidating the California regulations would likely redress at least some of the fuel producers’ monetary injuries. Even “one dollar” of additional revenue for the fuel producers would satisfy the redressability component of Article III standing. Uzuegbunam v. Preczewski, 592 U. S. 279, 292 (2021). And as we will explain, it is “likely” that invalidating the California regulations would result in more revenue for the fuel producers from additional sales of gasoline and other liquid fuels. FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U. S. 367, 380 (2024).

A

When a plaintiff is the “object” of a government regulation, there should “ordinarily” be “little question” that the regulation causes injury to the plaintiff and that invalidating the regulation would redress the plaintiff’s injuries. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 561 (1992).

The fuel producers here might be considered an object of the California regulations because the regulations explicitly seek to restrict the use of gasoline and other liquid fuels in automobiles. When the government prohibits or impedes Company A from using Company B’s product, then both Company A and Company B might be deemed objects of the government action at issue. For example, if the government bans hot dog sales in stadiums, then hot dog manufacturers, not just stadiums, might be considered objects of the regulation. If the government prohibits aluminum bats in Little League, then aluminum bat manufacturers, not only Little League, might be objects of the regulation. If the government bans bookstores from selling certain publishers’ books, then those publishers, not just bookstores, might be objects of the regulation. See Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 169 (1997); Energy Future Coalition v. EPA, 793 F. 3d 141, 144–145 (CADC 2015).

This Court has applied principles of that kind in various contexts. For example, when a State prohibited parents from sending their children to private schools, affected schools had standing to sue, even though parents were the directly regulated parties. See Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510, 535–536 (1925). And when the Federal Communications Commission announced that it would deny a license to any broadcasting station that conducted certain business with broadcasting networks, a broadcasting network (CBS) had standing to sue even though broadcasting stations were the directly regulated parties. See Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. United States, 316 U. S. 407, 422 (1942).

According to the fuel producers, when a regulation targets the provider of a product or service by limiting another entity’s use of that product or service, the targeted provider ordinarily has standing—without the need for much additional analysis. See Bennett, 520 U. S., at 169. So too here, according to the fuel producers. As they see it, the government is targeting the use of gasoline and other liquid fuels by regulating at the assembly line rather than the gas pump. Either way, they say that the California regulations pose a legal barrier to the fuel producers’ sale of their products and deny them the opportunity to compete in the marketplace without government interference. And the fuel producers assert that removing a coercive government standard that restricts the use of their products would allow them to compete more fully in the marketplace and thus provide redress for purposes of Article III. See ibid.; Energy Future Coalition, 793 F. 3d, at 144–145.

That argument is not without force and, at a minimum, highlights how the government might seek to indirectly target a product or service “through a conduit” in addition to regulating it directly. Brief for Petitioners 43. But we ultimately need not further consider that argument in this case because, regardless, the fuel producers have readily demonstrated their standing.

B

This case presents what the Court has described as the “familiar” circumstance where government regulation of a business “may be likely” to cause injuries to other linked businesses. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U. S., at 384. As the Court has explained, “when the government regulates (or under-regulates) a business, the regulation (or lack thereof) may cause downstream or upstream economic injuries to others in the chain, such as certain manufacturers, retailers, suppliers, competitors, or customers.” Ibid.

In cases of that kind, this Court’s analysis of causation and redressability has recognized commonsense economic realities. When third party behavior is predictable, commonsense inferences may be drawn. Importantly, EPA agrees that “commonsense economic principles” can be useful when evaluating Article III standing. Brief for Federal Respondents 39.

In this case, those commonsense economic principles support the fuel producers’ standing. The California regulations force automakers to manufacture more electric vehicles and fewer gasoline-powered vehicles. See Bennett, 520 U. S., at 169. The standards force automakers to produce a fleet of vehicles that, as a whole, uses significantly less gasoline and other liquid fuels. California’s regulation of automakers’ vehicle fleets in turn will likely “cause downstream or upstream economic injuries to others in the chain,” such as producers of gasoline and other liquid fuels. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U. S., at 384.

By the same token, the fuel producers persuasively contend that invalidating California’s regulations would likely mean more gasoline-powered automobiles, which would in turn likely mean more sales of gasoline and other liquid fuels by the fuel producers. See Bennett, 520 U. S., at 170–171. Because the fuel producers have suffered classic monetary injury caused by a government regulatory action, it would be surprising and unusual if invalidating the regulations did not redress the fuel producers’ injuries. See Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U. S., at 381 (“If a defendant’s action causes an injury, enjoining the action . . . will typically redress that injury”). After all, the fact that a regulation was designed to produce a particular effect on the market ordinarily means that the likely result of vacating that regulation would be to reduce that effect on the market. Cf. Lujan, 504 U. S., at 561–562.

EPA and California push back on that reasoning, asserting that this case is unusual and does not fit the typical pattern. They suggest that the new vehicle market has developed in a way that even if the California regulations are invalidated, automakers would not likely manufacture or sell more gasoline-powered cars than they do now.

To begin with, that is an odd argument for EPA and California to advance. After all, if invalidating the regulations would change nothing in the market, why are EPA and California enforcing and defending the regulations? The whole point of the regulations is to increase the number of electric vehicles in the new automobile market beyond what consumers would otherwise demand and what automakers would otherwise manufacture and sell. And EPA and California are presumably defending the regulations because they think that the regulations still make a difference in the market.

In all events, record evidence confirms what common sense tells us: Invalidating the regulations likely (not certainly, but likely) would make a difference for fuel producers because automakers would likely manufacture more vehicles that run on gasoline and other liquid fuels.

First, the fuel producers’ standing declarations explain that California’s regulations have historically harmed the fuel producers by causing a decrease in purchases of fuel. The declarations further quote California’s estimate that its standards would produce “ ‘substantial reductions in demand for gasoline exceeding $1 billion beginning in 2020 and increasing to over $10 billion in 2030.’ ” App. 173 (emphasis added). The fuel producers’ declarations emphasize, moreover, that California itself asserted that the State’s standards would reduce emissions partly through “ ‘reductions in fuel production.’ ” Id., at 148. The declarations also note that California recognized that the “oil and gas industry” and “fuel providers” would likely be “most adversely affected” by the regulations due to “the resulting substantial reductions in demand for gasoline.” Id., at 137 (quotation marks omitted).

Second, the record reveals that California itself stated in 2021, when asking EPA to reinstate the regulations, that the regulations are “critical not just for immediate emissions reductions” but also for “greater emission reductions in the future.” Id., at 66 (emphasis added). And after the fuel producers sued EPA in 2022, California moved to intervene and attached expert declarations stating that California’s standards are likely to decrease fuel use. Specifically, California’s experts opined that absent California’s regulations, “fewer” electric vehicles “are likely to be sold than would otherwise have been . . . and thus additional gasoline-fueled vehicles would be sold.” Id., at 115; see also id., at 110. California itself therefore acknowledged that its regulations were still having an impact and that invalidating the regulations would likely affect the automobile market and increase demand for gasoline and other liquid fuels.

Third, EPA too has stated that the California regulations are likely to reduce consumption of fuel. When approving California’s regulations, EPA repeatedly affirmed that California “needs” its standards “to address compelling and extraordinary air quality conditions in the state.” 87 Fed. Reg. 14334; see id., at 14353. And in proposing to amend California’s state implementation plan under the Clean Air Act more than two years after this suit was filed, EPA credited California’s estimates that the regulations would continue reducing greenhouse-gas emissions in California through at least 2037. 89 Fed. Reg. 82558 (2024).

Fourth, five automakers who have invested heavily in electric vehicles—and thus have an interest in the government continuing to support and favor that market—intervened on the side of EPA and California in the Court of Appeals. Their motion to intervene predicted that, absent California’s regulations, other automakers would seek a competitive advantage over them by selling fewer electric vehicles and more gasoline-powered vehicles. See Motion To Intervene of Ford Motor Co. et al. in No. 22–1081 (CADC), pp. 4, 11–12, 14. As with California’s motion to intervene, the automakers’ assessment that the regulations make a difference—and that invalidating them would make a difference—indicates that the regulations are still likely having a real-world impact on the automobile market.

In short, the commonsense economic inferences about the operation of the automobile market—combined with the statements of the fuel producers, California, EPA, and the vehicle manufacturers—make it sufficiently “predictable” that invalidating California’s regulations would likely redress the fuel producers’ injury. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U. S., at 383.

Article III’s redressability requirement serves to align injuries and remedies. The primary goals of that requirement are to ensure that plaintiffs do not sue the wrong parties and that courts do not issue advisory opinions. The redressability requirement should not be misused, however, to prevent the targets of government regulations from challenging regulations that threaten their businesses. EPA and California cite no case where Article III’s redressability requirement has been applied to prevent challenges to a regulation setting a permanent ceiling on the sale or use of a business’s products. Here, the fuel producers have established their standing to challenge EPA’s approval of the California regulations.

C

EPA and California further argue, however, that the fuel producers had to introduce still more evidence—for example, affidavits either from expert economists or from directly regulated automakers explaining how they would respond to a court order invalidating California’s regulations. See Brief for Federal Respondents 17–18, 43–44; Brief for State Respondents 13.

We disagree. This Court has not demanded that plaintiffs introduce evidence from expert economists or from directly regulated third parties to show how third parties would likely respond to a government regulation or invalidation thereof. Rather, to show redressability, the plaintiff must simply “show a predictable chain of events” that would likely result from judicial relief and redress the plaintiff’s injury. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U. S., at 385. In Department of Commerce v. New York, to take just one example, this Court considered a challenge by several States and other plaintiffs to the Government’s decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the census. 588 U. S. 752, 758–759 (2019). The States argued that reinstating the question would likely cause noncitizens to respond to the census at lower rates, thereby causing noncitizen residents of the States to be undercounted, and in turn leading to reduced representation and other harms for those States. Id., at 766–767. The Court did not require the States to produce affidavits or testimony from noncitizens explaining that they would not respond to the census in light of the citizenship question.

Requiring the plaintiff to produce affidavits from regulated parties would be especially problematic in cases of this kind. It would render the plaintiff’s ability to obtain judicial review dependent on the happenstance of whether the plaintiff and the relevant regulated parties are aligned and share litigation interests—and whether the regulated party is willing to publicly oppose (and possibly antagonize) the government regulator by supporting the plaintiff’s suit. Such a rule would create incentives for gamesmanship and could make it difficult or impossible to establish standing in cases where the standing analysis should be straightforward. A heightened “proof of redressability” requirement of that kind would ultimately close the courthouse doors to many traditional challenges to agency action. Cf. id., at 768. Such a rule has little to commend it, and we decline to adopt it.

D

In ruling against EPA and California, we recognize that there may conceivably be some atypical instances where a market has permanently and dramatically changed such that invalidating a challenged regulation would have no effect on the market in question, thereby defeating redressability. But that is likely to be a fairly rare and unusual scenario, for a couple of reasons.

First, we can assume that governments do not usually continue to enforce and defend regulations that have no continuing effect in the relevant market. EPA and California continue to enforce these regulations, and for three years, EPA and California have tenaciously defended them in court. So it is difficult to put much stock in their suggestion that invalidating the regulations (in California and 17 other States) would have zero effect on the new vehicle market in America both now and in the future. Simply put, EPA’s and California’s own actions—their statements, their enforcement decisions, their litigation positions—undermine the central premise of their redressability argument. When as here a government seeks to justify its regulatory actions by, on the one hand, touting the consequences for fuel usage and emissions while, on the other, maintaining that those same regulations are unreviewable because there are no consequences, courts can appropriately be skeptical. Judges “are ‘not required to exhibit a naiveté from which ordinary citizens are free.’ ” Department of Commerce, 588 U. S., at 785 (quoting United States v. Stanchich, 550 F. 2d 1294, 1300 (CA2 1977) (Friendly, J.)).

Second, EPA and California’s view of redressability fails to account for dynamic markets and the effects of interrelated economic forces and regulatory programs that change over time. Supply and demand may depend on, among other things, the strength of the overall economy, regulatory emissions standards, international developments, government subsidies to particular industries, and tax incentives, among many other factors. Predicting developments in complex markets can be a difficult and uncertain endeavor, particularly when various governments’ regulatory, spending, and tax policies are at play.

To deny standing based on a theory that invalidating an important regulation would actually have zero impact on a dynamic and heavily regulated market requires a degree of economic and political clairvoyance that is difficult for a court to maintain. That is particularly so when the government regulation itself may be skewing the market at issue. So courts should exercise caution before denying standing because of a claimed lack of redressability rooted in questionable economic speculation.

In advancing their argument, EPA and California also point out that some automakers are now in compliance with California’s regulatory mandates. But that is not surprising. Compliance with government regulation usually suggests regulatory effect, not the absence of effect. Nor is such compliance especially probative of how all automakers are acting or would respond to a court order invalidating California’s regulations—including in the 17 other States that have adopted those regulations. In the D. C. Circuit, California pointed to evidence that seven automakers had announced future plans to sell more electric vehicles than California’s regulations required. Brief for State and Local Government Respondent-Intervenors in No. 22–1081, at 14. But California offered no evidence that the cited press releases from seven automakers represented commitments definite enough to withstand potential future market fluctuations and regulatory changes. Nor did California offer evidence that the statements of those seven automakers represented the likely behavior of the entire automaking industry, including potential new market entrants. Recall that the automakers’ own motion to intervene in the Court of Appeals suggested otherwise—that if the regulations were invalidated, other automakers would seek a competitive advantage by manufacturing more gasoline-powered cars.

In sum, this case does not present the unusual scenario where invalidating a challenged government restriction on businesses in a competitive market is not likely to have any effect. Here, it may not be certain, but it is at least “predictable” that invalidating the California regulations would likely result in the fuel producers ultimately selling more gasoline and other liquid fuels. See Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U. S., at 383.

E

Two of our colleagues have filed dissenting opinions. They primarily object to the Court’s decision to grant certiorari in this case. But having granted certiorari, we proceed to decide the question presented for our review.

Justice Sotomayor suggests that the D. C. Circuit’s erroneous standing analysis was attributable to its misunderstanding about the duration of California’s fleet-wide emissions standards. See post, at 2 (dissenting opinion). So in her view, the Court need only correct that factual misunderstanding and remand the case to the D. C. Circuit. See post, at 3. But the D. C. Circuit’s standing analysis did not rest entirely on that misunderstanding. And neither EPA nor California asked for such a remand—even though they acknowledged the D. C. Circuit’s misunderstanding. Moreover, because this litigation has gone on for three years, we see no good reason to waste the parties’ time and resources by remanding for further analysis of the standing issue in the Court of Appeals when the parties have comprehensively briefed it and we can readily resolve it now.

Justice Jackson separately argues that the Court does not apply standing doctrine “evenhandedly.” Post, at 1 (dissenting opinion). A review of standing cases over the last few years disproves that suggestion. See, e.g., Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U. S., at 374; United States v. Texas, 599 U. S., at 674; Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U. S. 255, 291–292 (2023); Reed v. Goertz, 598 U. S. 230, 234 (2023); TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U. S. 413, 417–418 (2021); California v. Texas, 593 U. S. 659, 666 (2021); Uzuegbunam, 592 U. S., at 282–283; Thole v. U. S. Bank N. A., 590 U. S. 538, 541–542 (2020); Department of Commerce, 588 U. S., at 766–768. In this case, as we have explained, this Court’s recent standing precedents support the conclusion that the fuel producers have standing.

* * *

This case concerns only standing, not the merits. EPA and California may or may not prevail on the merits in defending EPA’s approval of the California regulations. But the justiciability of the fuel producers’ challenge to EPA’s approval of the California regulations is evident. Courts should not “make standing law more complicated than it needs to be.” Thole v. U. S. Bank N. A., 590 U. S. 538, 547 (2020). The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders. In light of this Court’s precedents and the evidence before the Court of Appeals, the fuel producers established Article III standing to challenge EPA’s approval of the California regulations. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

_________________

No. 24–7

_________________

Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC, et al., PETITIONERS v. Environmental Protection Agency, et al.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit

Justice Jackson, dissenting.

Standing is a constitutional doctrine meant to promote judicial restraint. By design, it “ ‘prevent[s] the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers of the political branches’ ” and “helps safeguard the Judiciary’s proper—and properly limited—role in our constitutional system.” United States v. Texas, 599 U. S. 670, 675–676 (2023). But standing doctrine cannot serve that important purpose if the Judiciary fails to apply it evenhandedly. When courts adjust standing requirements to let certain litigants challenge the actions of the political branches but preclude suits by others with similar injuries, standing doctrine cannot perform its constraining function. Over time, such selectivity begets judicial overreach and erodes public trust in the impartiality of judicial decisionmaking.

Today’s ruling runs the risk of setting us down that path. The Court shelves its usual case-selection standards to revive a fuel-industry lawsuit that all agree will soon be moot (and is largely moot already). And it rests its decision on a theory of standing that the Court has refused to apply in cases brought by less powerful plaintiffs. This case gives fodder to the unfortunate perception that moneyed interests enjoy an easier road to relief in this Court than ordinary citizens. Because the Court had ample opportunity to avoid that result, I respectfully dissent.

I

In 2022, petrochemical companies and other fuel- industry groups filed this lawsuit challenging a Government action under the Clean Air Act.

President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Clean Air Act into law in 1963 to “protect and enhance the quality of the Nation’s air resources so as to promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of its population.” As added, 77 Stat. 392, 42 U. S. C. §7401(b)(1). One of the ways the Act sought to achieve that goal was by requiring all “new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines” sold in the United States to comply with certain emissions standards established by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). §§7521(a)(1), 7522(a)(1).

To ensure that automakers would not have to comply with a competing patchwork of emissions standards set by various States, the Act pre-empts state efforts to regulate vehicle emissions. Under the statute’s pre-emption provision, “[n]o State . . . shall adopt or attempt to enforce any standard relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles.” §7543(a).

But, notably, that provision contains an exception for the State of California, which was the only State whose efforts to regulate auto emissions predated the Clean Air Act. Recognizing that “California’s unique problems and pioneering efforts justified a waiver of the preemption section,” S. Rep. No. 403, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 33 (1967), Congress allowed California to adopt more stringent emissions standards than the Federal Government. §208, 81 Stat. 501. Thus, under the current statute, California can obtain a pre- emption waiver that allows it to adopt emissions standards that are, “in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable Federal standards.” §7543(b)(1). The statute specifically directs EPA to grant such a waiver unless the agency finds that California’s standards are “arbitrary and capricious,” not necessary to “meet compelling and extraordinary conditions,” or incompatible with specific statutory requirements. Ibid. Consistent with that directive, EPA has granted dozens of pre-emption waivers for California emissions programs over the past several decades.

This case concerns one of those waivers: a 2013 waiver that EPA granted for a California emissions program targeting greenhouse gases. 78 Fed. Reg. 2112 (2013). California’s program had two main components. Id., at 2114. First, it required automakers to ensure that a certain percentage of their vehicle fleets for model years 2017 to 2025 was composed of electric vehicles. Ibid. Second, it imposed fleet-wide limits on average greenhouse gas emissions; those fleet-wide emissions limits would gradually increase in stringency through model year 2025, at which point the limits would remain at 2025 levels permanently. Ibid. Nobody challenged the waiver in court, and California’s program went into effect without incident.

In the years that followed, automakers upped their production of electric and low-emissions vehicles significantly, investing billions of dollars in new manufacturing facilities and other infrastructure. Consumer demand for those vehicles surged, too. So much so that, by 2018, automakers were selling well over 200,000 fully electric vehicles per year—a more-than-tenfold increase from the 18,000 vehicles sold in 2011, the year before California sought the waiver from EPA.

In 2019, however, EPA changed course and rescinded the waiver. 84 Fed. Reg. 51310. The agency concluded that California’s emissions standards were not necessary “ ‘to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions,’ ” and were also pre-empted by a different federal law. Id., at 51328.

Three years later, EPA reversed its position again. In 2022, the agency reinstated the waiver, asserting that its 2019 decision to rescind the waiver rested on an incorrect understanding of federal law. 87 Fed. Reg. 14332–14333.

That 2022 waiver-reinstatement decision precipitated this lawsuit. Members of the fuel industry sought review of that decision in the D. C. Circuit, arguing that it contravened the Clean Air Act and exceeded EPA’s statutory authority. Although EPA’s reinstatement of the waiver did not regulate the fuel industry directly, petitioners claimed that the revival of California’s emissions standards would injure them by suppressing the sale of gas-powered vehicles and thus quelling consumer demand for their fuel products.

The D. C. Circuit rejected that argument. Ohio v. EPA, 98 F. 4th 288, 294 (2024) (per curiam). The panel unanimously held that petitioners lacked standing because they had failed to show that a court order invalidating the waiver would actually redress their asserted injury—namely, diminished demand for fuel. The court reasoned that petitioners’ “injuries would be redressed only if automobile manufacturers responded to vacatur of the waiver by producing and selling fewer non-conventional vehicles or by altering the prices of their vehicles such that fewer non- conventional vehicles—and more conventional vehicles—were sold.” Id., at 302. But petitioners had “fail[ed] to point to any evidence affirmatively demonstrating that vacatur of the waiver would be substantially likely to result in any change to automobile manufacturers’ vehicle fleets by Model Year 2025,” when the court believed California’s program would terminate. Ibid. To the contrary, the court concluded, the “only evidence points in the opposite direction.” Ibid.

Among other evidence, the court cited an expert declaration submitted by California, which had intervened to defend the waiver. The declaration documented how electric-vehicle sales in California had already surpassed state-mandated levels as a result of rising consumer demand and automakers’ long-term planning choices, “suggesting that vacatur of the [electric] vehicle mandate would not redress [p]etitioners’ injuries.” Id., at 305. The court also pointed to a brief from the auto industry echoing the same point and explaining that “ ‘both internal sustainability goals and external market forces’ are prompting manufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, irrespective of California’s regulations.” Id., at 303, n. 8. Based on petitioners’ failure to submit any countervailing evidence, the court found “no basis to conclude that [p]etitioners’ claims are redressable.” Id., at 305.

Seven months after the D. C. Circuit issued its decision, President Trump was elected to a second term in office. We granted certiorari the following month. 604 U. S. ___. One month later, the Government asked us to hold this case in abeyance while the new administration “reassess[ed] the basis for and soundness of ” the waiver at issue. Motion of Federal Respondents To Hold Briefing Schedule in Abeyance 3. We declined to do so and instead set this case for argument.

II

A

Article III of the Constitution restricts the jurisdiction of federal courts to actual “Cases” or “Controversies.” That case-or-controversy requirement limits our power as judges: It means that we can only resolve concrete legal disputes—those with real stakes for real people—and we must turn away litigants who ask us to decide purely hypothetical questions. Standing doctrine furthers the end of ensuring that each case has real stakes by requiring anyone who files a federal lawsuit to establish, as a threshold matter, that they have suffered a genuine injury that can actually be redressed by a court. As the majority aptly puts it, the doctrine forces every plaintiff to “answer a basic question—‘ “What’s it to you? ” ’ ” Ante, at 7.

The fuel industry’s answer to that question here should give us all pause. In their petition for certiorari, the industry members asserted that California’s emissions standards harmed them by suppressing the sale of gas-powered cars and thereby driving down demand for fuel. But they later made clear that any such harm would be exceedingly short lived: EPA is presently reviewing California’s pre-emption waiver, and as petitioners’ counsel told us at oral argument, the agency is likely to withdraw that waiver imminently, which will put an end to California’s emissions program for good. Tr. of Oral Arg. 69. In fact, petitioners’ counsel was so confident of that outcome that he told us he would bet his “bottom dollar” on it. Ibid.

His confidence is not overstated. President Trump rescinded this exact same waiver the last time he was in office. And EPA has told us that it is actively reconsidering its decision to grant the waiver. Because a withdrawal of the waiver would moot this case, an obvious question arises: Why would this Court rush to opine on whether the fuel industry’s legal challenge raises an Article III “case” or “controversy” when all involved—including petitioners themselves—believe that any such “case” or “controversy” will soon vanish?

The Court had plenty of other options. For one thing, it could have denied certiorari, recognizing that one of the core components of California’s emissions program—the electric-vehicle mandate—is about to sunset. Regardless of what EPA does here, that mandate will terminate in just a few months, when model year 2025 ends. Automakers are already accepting preorders on model-year-2026 vehicles, and, by Thanksgiving, their entire fleets for model year 2026 will be available. This means that even if the electric-vehicle mandate is currently harming the fuel industry—a dubious proposition in itself, see Part III–A, infra—that harm will cease before petitioners brief the actual merits of their challenge, let alone before any court rules on it.

Alternatively, this Court could have deferred its decision in this case until after EPA concludes its reassessment of the waiver, as the Government asked us to do. The Government rarely proposes that we withhold judgment after certiorari is granted, and it did so here before any party had filed its brief. In the rare cases where the Government does ask us to defer, we often grant those requests—and we sometimes decide to put cases on hold independently. But, for some reason, in this case, we rejected the Government’s request and proceeded to render a decision anyway.

A third option, once we granted certiorari, would have been to simply vacate the judgment and remand the case to the D. C. Circuit. The D. C. Circuit’s opinion appeared to rest, at least in part, on the erroneous factual assumption that California’s entire emissions program—and not just its electric-vehicle mandate—would sunset with model year 2025. As the majority observes, “[i]t may be that some of the D. C. Circuit’s standing analysis stemmed from a misunderstanding about when the California fleet-wide emissions standards expire.” Ante, at 7, n. 2. Once EPA clarified the regulatory timeline in its certiorari brief, it would have been reasonable for this Court to give the D. C. Circuit an opportunity to reconsider its analysis on a corrected record. Cf. Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U. S. 163, 166–167 (1996) (per curiam) (“We have GVR’d [i.e., granted, vacated, and remanded] in light of a wide range of developments, including . . . changed factual circumstances”). That approach might have even allowed for a quicker resolution of this matter by obviating the need for a seven-month detour to this Court. But the Court granted plenary review instead.

Our insistence on resolving the standing question in this case strains our usual case-selection standards, which are highly selective. We typically grant review in just a few dozen cases each year—a tiny fraction of the thousands of petitions we receive. That is because, as we have often explained, ours “is not a court of error correction.” S. Breyer, Reflections on the Role of Appellate Courts: A View From the Supreme Court, 8 J. App. Prac. & Process 91, 92 (2006). Rather, we grant review in cases “only for compelling reasons.” Supreme Court Rule 10. This case—concerning a record-specific disagreement about standing to sue in a dispute that will soon be moot anyway—hardly cries out for our involvement.

To be sure, if the lower courts were divided on some legal question in this case, then maybe certiorari would be justified. They are not. Similarly, if the lower courts had been clamoring for us to clarify how best to evaluate Article III redressability when plaintiffs assert injuries based on third parties’ responses to regulation, then maybe our intervention would have been sensible. They have not. Indeed, we recently spoke to the redressability issue—just last Term, we decided a case addressing our redressability standard at length. See FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U. S. 367 (2024); ante, at 7–22 (citing Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine nearly 20 times).

At most, then, the Court’s ruling today amounts to little more than error correction in the context of a dispute that all agree will be over soon in any event.

B

This is not to suggest that no one will benefit from the Court’s decision to dabble in error correction in this case. Our ruling will no doubt aid future attempts by the fuel industry to attack the Clean Air Act. But Article III requires a live case or controversy, not merely the potential that a favorable judgment will help the plaintiff in some future lawsuit.

Also, I worry that the fuel industry’s gain comes at a reputational cost for this Court, which is already viewed by many as being overly sympathetic to corporate interests. See, e.g., A. Liptak, Corporations Find a Friend in the Supreme Court, N. Y. Times, May 4, 2013. Some knowledgeable researchers have suggested that this reputation is unfounded. But, at this point, that unfortunate perception seems pervasive. And even the mere “appearance” of favoritism, founded or not, can “undermin[e] confidence in the integrity of the judiciary.” Williams-Yulee v. Florida Bar, 575 U. S. 433, 454 (2015); cf. Republican Party of Pa. v. Degraffenreid, 592 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 9) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (arguing that state efforts to prevent voter fraud are important even “where allegations [of fraud] are incorrect,” because “ ‘[c]onfidence in the integrity of our electoral process is essential to the functioning of our participatory democracy’ ”).

It may be difficult for the public to know exactly what to make of the Court’s decision to address the fleeting legal issue presented here. For its part, the Court does not explain why it is so eager to resolve this highly factbound, soon-to-be-moot dispute. See ante, at 22–23. For some, this silence will only harden their sense that the Court softens its certiorari standards when evaluating petitions from moneyed interests, looking past the jurisdictional defects or other vehicle problems that would typically doom petitions from other parties. This Court’s simultaneous aversion to hearing cases involving the potential vindication of the rights of less powerful litigants—workers, criminal defendants, and the condemned, among others —will further fortify that impression.

In my view, we should have either denied certiorari outright or held this matter in abeyance pending EPA’s reconsideration of its waiver grant. Barring that, we should have simply vacated and remanded for the D. C. Circuit to reconsider its ruling on a clarified factual record.

III

But that’s not all. The Court’s substantive Article III standing analysis, though not entirely implausible, also invites questions about inconsistent decisionmaking and whether this Court is holding business litigants to the same standards as everyone else. The majority has made nothing short of a herculean effort to justify the conclusion that redressability exists on this record. See ante, at 15–18. Its demonstrated concern for ensuring that the fuel industry’s ability to sue is recognized on these facts highlights a potential gap in the manner in which the Court treats the claims of plaintiffs pursuing profits versus those seeking to advance other objectives.

A

It is “a bedrock principle that a federal court cannot redress ‘injury that results from the independent action of some third party not before the court.’ ” Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U. S. 43, 57 (2024). Accordingly, “we have ‘been reluctant to endorse standing theories that require guesswork as to how independent decisionmakers will exercise their judgment.’ ” Ibid.

It is indisputable that petitioners’ theory of standing requires guesswork as to how independent decisionmakers (specifically, automakers and consumers) would respond to a court order invalidating the pre-emption waiver for California’s emissions standards. The only way that such an order could possibly benefit the fuel industry would be if it ultimately spurred the production, purchase, and usage of more gas-powered cars. The majority holds, however, that our usual skepticism about standing theories that turn on independent third-party conduct is not warranted because, in its view, petitioners’ theory of redressability rests on “commonsense economic principles.” Ante, at 14.

I have no quarrel with relying on common sense as a general matter. But we should acknowledge that what counts as a “commonsense” inference to the Justices on this Court may not be viewed as such by others. And, if anything, the actual evidence presented in this case suggests that the majority’s “[c]ommon sense is not so common.” J. Bartlett, Familiar Quotations 299 (18th ed. 2012) (quoting Voltaire, Dictionnaire Philosphique (1764)).

The central problem petitioners face is one of timing. Had they challenged California’s emissions program at its inception, then commonsense intuitions might have sufficed to establish redressability; indeed, “the whole point” of California’s program was to reduce fuel consumption, as the majority notes. Ante, at 11. But petitioners did not challenge the program at its inception. Instead, they challenged it nearly a decade after California obtained its pre-emption waiver. By that point, consumer demand for electric and low-emissions vehicles had grown many times over, and automakers had invested billions to transform their production and marketing strategies. As California’s expert attested, by the time petitioners filed suit, automakers were “already selling more qualifying vehicles in California than the State’s standards require.” App. 202.

Furthermore, several major automakers—including Ford, Volvo, Honda, BMW, and Volkswagen—explicitly told the court below that they “have no plans to abandon their extensive and growing financial commitments to electric vehicles” because their “long-term, world-wide, industry-transformative planning . . . is already well underway.” Brief for Industry Respondent-Intervenors in No. 22–1081 (CADC), pp. 12–13. Meanwhile, consumers are now “willing to pay price premiums for [qualifying vehicles], sometimes thousands of dollars above the manufacturer’s suggested retail price.” App. 192. And demand for electric vehicles continues to grow, “both in California and nationwide.” Id., at 202.

Against the weight of that evidence, the majority’s “commonsense” intuitions about automaker and consumer behavior are much less certain. Maybe some automakers would actually produce more gas-powered cars if a court were to invalidate California’s emissions program now. Or maybe not. Maybe any such uptick in production would cause consumers to buy more gas-powered cars moving forward. Or maybe not.

The only thing we know for sure is that the onus of establishing what is likely to happen is on petitioners (the fuel industry), as the party invoking the jurisdiction of a federal court. It is the fuel producers who must present evidence supporting their theory that invalidation of the waiver by a court will benefit them—intuition alone will not suffice. When redressability “ ‘depends on the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the courts,’ ” it “becomes the burden of the plaintiff to adduce facts showing that those choices have been or will be made in such manner as to . . . permit redressability.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 562 (1992) (emphasis added).

Petitioners have made little effort to meet that burden. None of the declarations they submitted below say anything substantive about redressability. None purport to address, much less refute, any of the data or analyses California’s expert or the automaker intervenors have provided. In deed, all of the language that the majority quotes from petitioners’ declarations derives from statements originally made in 2011 and 2012—a full decade before petitioners filed this lawsuit. See ante, at 15–16. Although petitioners shrewdly attempt to bolster their submissions by citing assertions from California’s intervention motion, almost all of those assertions concern the nearly defunct electric-vehicle component of California’s program—not the fleet-wide emissions limits—suggesting that any redressability is likely to expire within months.

It is perhaps due to the “paucity of evidence in the record regarding the redressability of [petitioners’] injuries,” 98 F. 4th, at 303, that petitioners’ primary contention is that they do not need to submit any evidence at all to establish redressability. Brief for Petitioners 18 (“[W]hen a third-party response is predictable, no more is needed than a dose of common sense”). Indeed, petitioners’ opening brief devotes just two pages to the argument that the actual record in this case supports redressability. See id., at 37–38 (arguing, in the alternative, that the Court should reverse “[e]ven if petitioners were legally required to produce record evidence to support redressability”).

Petitioners’ obvious disinterest in developing or relying on the evidentiary record in this litigation is the reason why the majority has had to perform yeoman’s work in cobbling together a plausible factual basis for redressability. See, e.g., ante, at 15–17 (scouring the regulatory history and scant record for redressability-related evidence). Whatever one thinks about the majority’s labored redressability analysis, the effort it expends on this endeavor is striking—especially when compared to the Court’s approach to Article III standing in cases involving civil rights.

B

The Court’s remarkably lenient approach to standing in this case contrasts starkly with the stern stance it has taken in cases concerning the rights of ordinary citizens. See, e.g., Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 155–156 (1990) (“A federal court is powerless to create its own jurisdiction by embellishing otherwise deficient allegations of standing”). Here, the Court’s “commonsense” inferences readily align with the fuel industry’s assertions of economic injury, even in the face of conflicting evidence. But for less wealthy individual plaintiffs, establishing redressability to the Court’s satisfaction is often harder to come by.

Take our decision in Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490 (1975). There, the Court held that a group of low-income plaintiffs in upstate New York lacked standing to challenge a zoning ordinance that effectively barred the construction of affordable housing in the town where they wished to move. Id., at 493. The plaintiffs had alleged that the ordinance—which prohibited the construction of multifamily housing virtually anywhere in town—excluded them from the town, causing injury, by depressing the supply of affordable housing options. Id., at 504–507. The Court rejected the claim for lack of redressability. Ibid.

Under the Court’s reasoning, the plaintiffs’ “desire to live in [the town] depended on the efforts and willingness of third parties to build low- and moderate-cost housing,” and “their inability to reside in [the town was] the consequence of the economics of the area housing market, rather than of [the defendants’] assertedly illegal acts.” Id., at 505–506. Critically, the Court stated that it was not enough for the plaintiffs to show generally that the zoning ordinance suppressed the overall supply of affordable housing. Rather, we explained, the plaintiffs needed to show that the invalidation of the ordinance by court order would lead to the availability of specific units that met their individual needs and fell within their individual budgets. Id., at 506. “[C]ommonsense economic principles,” ante, at 14—say, about the general impact of increased housing supply on housing prices—did not rescue the plaintiffs.

Our decision in Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737 (1984), was more of the same. There, we held that a group of Black parents lacked standing to challenge the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) policies concerning tax exemptions for private schools. Id., at 739–740. The parents had alleged that the IRS’s failure to deny tax-exempt status to racially exclusionary private schools in their communities was hindering desegregation efforts in the districts their children attended. Id., at 752–753. This Court held that, although the parents had stated a cognizable injury, they had not shown that denying tax-exempt status to the exclusionary private schools would redress that injury. Id., at 758–759.

Notably, in Allen, the Court specifically observed that the plaintiffs’ redressability theory hinged on speculation about, among other things, how private-school parents and administrators would respond to the loss of their tax exemptions and whether that response would actually affect the racial makeup of local public schools. Id., at 758. Justice Brennan noted in dissent that “[c]ommon sense alone would recognize that the elimination of tax-exempt status for racially discriminatory private schools would serve to lessen the impact that those institutions have in defeating efforts to desegregate the public schools.” Id., at 774. But “[c]ommon sense alone” was not enough for those plaintiffs, either.

For a more recent example, look at Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U. S. 398 (2013). In that case, the Court held that a group of human-rights, media, labor, and legal organizations lacked standing to challenge certain electronic-surveillance practices under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Id., at 402, 406. Among the reasons we provided for this holding was that any surveillance activities the Government pursued would ultimately have to be approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), and the plaintiffs could “only speculate as to whether that court will authorize such surveillance.” Id., at 413. We could have easily drawn a commonsense inference that the FISC was likely to approve at least some of the surveillance activities of concern to the plaintiffs, given that (per the Government’s own statistics) the FISC approved over 99% of the surveillance-authorization requests it received. Id., at 430 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (citing records showing that the court approved 1,674 out of 1,676 applications in 2011). But instead we “decline[d] to abandon our usual reluctance to endorse standing theories that rest on speculation about the decisions of independent actors.” Id., at 414.

I could go on. My point here is not that any of these particular standing decisions was wrongly decided. Instead, I am simply observing that the Court seems inconsistent in its willingness to premise redressability on commonsense inferences about third-party behavior. That inconsistency, which we reinforce with today’s holding, tends to redound to the benefit of particular litigants. But nothing in Article III’s text or history justifies relying on “commonsense” inferences in one standing context and not another. The Constitution does not distinguish between plaintiffs whose claims are backed by the Chamber of Commerce and those who seek to vindicate their rights to fair housing, desegregated schools, or privacy. But if someone reviewing our case law harbored doubts about that proposition, today’s decision will do little to dissuade them.

* * *

It is easy to deprecate the single phrase inscribed atop the entrance to our courthouse by conceptualizing it as a mere platitude. But “Equal Justice Under Law” remains this Court’s guiding light nearly a century after those words were first engraved there. Striving to embody that particular ideal is what distinguishes our work as judges from that of the well-heeled lawyers and lobbyists who walk into similarly ornate buildings every day to promote the interests of their clients. It may sometimes be difficult to tell one marble façade from another—especially when some of them share a common architect. But those of us who are privileged to work inside the Court must not lose sight of this institution’s unique mission and responsibility: to rule without fear or favor. If the Court privileges the interests of one class of litigants over others, even unintentionally, it can damage Americans’ faith in an impartial Judiciary and undermine the long-term credibility of its judgments.

Time will tell if today’s decision portends a broader shift in the Court’s view of Article III standing for all litigants. If it does not, and if the Court is not fastidious in maintaining consistency across its certiorari decisions and substantive rulings, its decisions will come to represent, like so many marble façades, another mere facsimile of justice.",https://www.law.cornell.edu/images/liibracketlogo.gif,N,,2025-06-20 12:25:22.233248

Edge AI can help us build a smarter, more resilient energy future.

We must act now to ensure tomorrow's grid is not only powered by innovation, but also empowers us all.

Our global energy system is changing fast as we transition to renewable energy sources, like solar and wind. This is great for the planet, but it makes our power grids more complex to manage. Add the growing impact of climate change, including extreme weather, and our traditional grids are under serious strain.

As the International Energy Agency (IEA) notes, modernizing our grids is essential to keep the lights on and integrate these new energy sources smoothly. The World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report 2024 also highlights how vulnerable our systems can be.

So, how do we build a smarter, more resilient energy future? A big part of the answer lies in edge AI.

Edge AI puts intelligence right where it's needed most – at the edges of our power networks. Instead of sending all data to a central point, AI tools work locally on or near the grid's sensors and devices. This means real-time insights and faster, automated control. It helps us manage the growing number of distributed energy resources – things like rooftop solar panels or electric vehicle chargers – and keeps the grid stable. AI can already predict when equipment might fail, spot faults instantly and balance energy loads efficiently. With the edge computing market booming – analysts predict nearly 40% annual growth between 2025 and 2030 – using it for our critical energy infrastructure is the next logical step.

How is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence?

In response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the AI Governance Alliance.

The Alliance unites industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems.

This includes the workstreams part of the AI Transformation of Industries initiative, in collaboration with the Centre for Energy and Materials, the Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chains, the Centre for Cybersecurity, the Centre for Nature and Climate, and the Global Industries team.

The infrastructure imperative: enabling AI at the grid edge

Edge AI, as powerful as it is, doesn't work in isolation. To truly bring its benefits to our energy grids, we need the right digital foundations. We need to build a new kind of infrastructure specifically designed for this critical job.

This is because a reliable and consistent power supply is paramount. Power grids can't afford to go down. The systems supporting edge AI must be incredibly robust and able to handle any hiccup without failing. Think of it as a super-charged IT system that never blinks. Then there's cybersecurity. As we connect more devices and make the grid smarter, we also open up new doors for cyber threats. Protecting our energy infrastructure from hackers is crucial to ensuring the safe flow of power and maintaining public trust. We need to secure every part of this distributed system.

Edge AI also needs fast communication. For AI to make quick decisions – like preventing a blackout or rerouting power – it needs data instantly. That’s where technologies like 5G and private LTE networks come in. They provide the high-speed, low-delay connections essential for these real-time actions. Finally, we need strong computing power at the edge. This means having enough processing muscle close to where the data is gathered, so AI algorithms can run quickly without always sending information back to a distant data centre. This local power ensures the speed and independence a smart grid needs. Building this specialized digital backbone is the real groundwork for an AI-powered, resilient energy future.

Collaboration, investment and governance for the AI-powered grid

To make this vision a reality, we must take several key steps:

Firstly, we need global teamwork on standards. Imagine trying to build something complex if everyone uses different-sized screws or speaks a different language. For an intelligent grid, all the different technologies and systems must be able to work together smoothly. Common standards will help accelerate innovation, simplify connectivity and foster a healthier market for these technologies.

Secondly, this transformation requires significant and ongoing investment in modern technology infrastructure. The smart edge AI tools and the strong digital network they rely on won't build themselves. This means that governments and private companies need to invest in upgrading our grid hardware, installing advanced sensors, rolling out fast communication networks, like 5G, and building secure edge computing sites. As the World Economic Forum often points out, strong infrastructure is crucial for managing significant risks and investing in this area directly enhances the resilience of our vital energy sector.

Lastly, we need strong rules and good governance. As AI becomes more involved in our energy systems, we need clear guidelines. These should cover important areas, such as data privacy, cybersecurity and AI bias and hallucination, as well as ensuring that everyone benefits fairly from a modernized grid. Good governance builds trust, encourages innovation and helps ensure that this smarter grid works for everyone, not just a few.

By working together on these fronts – collaborating, investing wisely and setting up fair rules – we can unlock the full power of edge AI. This is how we build the secure, sustainable and resilient energy future we all need.

Smart responsive energy systems are a must have

The road to a modern, resilient global energy grid is certainly challenging, but the way forward is becoming clearer. With climate change and new energy sources reshaping our world, smart, responsive systems are no longer a luxury – they're a must-have. Edge AI brings this intelligence to the front lines of our power networks. But its true potential can only be unleashed if we also commit to building the strong, secure and fast digital infrastructure it needs to thrive.

We need to keep in mind that this journey is about securing our energy future. It will take teamwork, smart investments and thoughtful rules of the road. By embracing edge AI and the robust infrastructure that supports it, we're not just making our power grids more efficient, we're building a more sustainable, dependable and fair world for everyone. To ensure tomorrow's grid is not only powered by innovation, but also empowers us all, the time to act is now.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_4Ar4mk3kNyCwZmAstVCs1JB8ZmEFp3piPDQeIc_fkAA.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 14:09:10.082024

From the Office of U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich:

Heinrich to Wright: “We cannot expect to maintain U.S. leadership in emerging technologies if we shortchange the offices, programs, and most importantly, people, needed to do so.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. — In his opening statement, U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Ranking Member on the U.S. Energy and Natural Resources Committee, grilled the U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright over the Trump Administration’s Fiscal Year 2026 (FY 26) budget request for the Department of Energy, which guts funding for energy programs that ensure Americans have access to affordable, domestic sources of energy and support our research and energy leadership should be shared goals.

Heinrich also pressed the Secretary on the disconnect between his recent remarks and actions, and skirting Department responsibilities by failing to respond to Congressional oversight requests.

“We need a true ‘all of the above’ strategy to adequately deliver our energy goals and this budget fails to deliver on that,” Heinrich said.

Heinrich continued, “This budget proposal does not support those goals, nor do many of the current actions at the Department.”

A video of Heinrich’s opening remarks is here.

A transcript of Heinrich’s remarks as delivered is below:

Thank you, Chairman Lee. And welcome Secretary Wright.

Secretary Wright, we are here to discuss the FY26 Budget Request.

And while this is our first opportunity to ask you questions since your confirmation, it’s not your first time defending this budget.

Last week, you testified before the Energy and Commerce Committee, and earlier, in May, you appeared before the House and Senate Energy and Water Development Subcommittees.

It’s clear from those hearings that there seems to be a noticeable disconnect between what you’ve stated publicly, and the actions taken under your leadership as Secretary of the Department of Energy.

At your nomination hearing in January, I asked you if the Executive Branch has the authority, without Congress’ approval, to withhold or terminate funding for an activity Congress approved in law.

You said that you would… “follow the laws and statutes of the United States of America.”

On May 30th, $3.7 billion in awards from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations were cancelled without any notice or without justification.

Cancellation of these awards crosses into impoundment territory and is certainly a breach of contract.

Actions like these will severely damage our country’s ability to lead in developing and commercializing next-generation technologies, while ceding ground to our competitors.

Another way to undermine our leadership?

Demoralizing the scientists and staff at DOE, the largest federal sponsor of basic research in the physical sciences.

I know you realize this, because on February 5th, you called DOE staff “the unbelievable humans that are in the room today, that are across our National Labs, in our cleanup facilities, in our offices around the country.”

Less than a month later, however, 2,000 DOE employees, including hundreds of National Nuclear Security Administration employees responsible for safeguarding the nation’s nuclear stockpile, were fired.

That was unacceptable.

But only after heavy criticism did the Department partially rescind the NNSA termination order and scramble to reinstate these employees.

In the coming months, the Department is reportedly set to lose thousands of additional employees to early buyouts.

As my colleague, Ranking Member Murray noted, taxpayers have spent $70 million to pay people not to work at this point.

But it seems that you may be regretting that decision.

The Washington Post reported that, “[a]cross the government, officials are rehiring federal workers who were forced out or encouraged to resign.”

You know that this is no way to run a business or an agency, and I believe that we have to do better.

And just yesterday, I heard from the National Labs that this budget would cut funding for the labs by $2.75 billion—or 11 percent compared to Fiscal Year 2024, an estimated loss of more than 7,700 jobs once fully implemented.

Our nation’s scientific and energy leadership is on the line.

And let’s talk a little bit about energy dominance.

In your confirmation hearings, you said you would “be an unabashed steward for all sources of affordable, reliable, and secure American energy and the infrastructure needed to develop, deliver and secure them.”

However, last week before the Energy and Commerce Committee, you said: “I have never been for ‘all of the above,’ and if I said it at one point in time, I misspoke. I’m against energy sources that make the energy system more expensive or less reliable.”

I wouldn’t call that misspeaking. That’s a disconnect.

If you truly were “against energy sources that make the energy system more expensive or less reliable,” I don’t believe that you would be propping up the uneconomic J.H. Campbell coal power plant in Michigan to produce expensive, inefficient power.

A new report by Energy Innovation shows that the average megawatt of power generated by U.S. coal plants is 28 percent more expensive in 2024 compared to 2021.

And that means families spent $6.2 billion more on electricity generated by coal in 2024 than they would’ve just three years ago.

As electricity demand continues to grow, we will not be able to meet the energy needs of new data centers, while keeping household bills low, if we prevent the growth of affordable clean energy resources.

We need a true ‘all of the above’ strategy to adequately deliver our energy goals and this budget fails to deliver on that.

During your time as Secretary, you have said that: “10 percent of Americans within the last 12 months have got a utility disconnection notice” and that one of your goals was to “shrink that number to zero by making energy more abundant and affordable.”

That is a worthy mission.

And yet this budget eliminates the Weatherization Assistance program, which saves households an average of $372 a year.

You’ve often said that artificial intelligence is ‘the Manhattan Project of our time” and yet this budget proposes a 14 percent cut to the Office of Science and the 57 percent cut to ARPA-E, where our major AI R&D efforts are currently underway.

We cannot expect to maintain U.S. leadership in emerging technologies if we shortchange the offices, programs, and most importantly, people, needed to do so.

Lastly, I want to raise DOE’s failure to respond in a timely and substantive manner to Congressional oversight requests.

I have sent 4 letters on topics ranging from staff reductions to funding freezes and project cancellations. I have received zero responses. That is unacceptable.

You and I may disagree on many things, but the need to ensure Americans have access to affordable, domestic sources of energy and support our research and energy leadership should be shared goals.",https://ladailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/favicon_30.ico,N,,2025-06-20 12:23:27.476220

The draft bill the Senate Finance Committee released this week would phase out tax credits for wind and solar beginning next year, favoring tax breaks for technologies that can provide round-the-clock power, such as geothermal and nuclear.

The phaseout would provide more flexibility than the House-passed bill, which would only grant clean electricity investment and production tax breaks to projects that begin construction within 60 days of the law’s enactment and are placed in service by 2028.

Both the House and the Senate bills would end most credits related to electric vehicles and residential energy improvements. Additionally, both versions of the bill largely would restrict prohibited foreign entities or foreign-influenced entities from the tax credit benefits. The House has stricter rules for “material assistance,” which refers to components or critical minerals from those entities used in energy projects.

New clean-energy jobs and manufacturing plants spurred by the credits in Democrats’ 2022 climate law have poured into GOP districts—especially in the South and Midwest. As a result, the rollbacks in the GOP bill are putting some Republicans in a difficult position of choosing between supporting the president’s top legislative priority or pushing for projects in their states.

Clean-energy lobbyists are preparing another major push to loosen the bill’s credit restrictions as the measure soon heads to the Senate floor for a vote. Republicans hope to get it on President Donald Trump’s desk by July 4, and Republican members of the Senate tax writing panel say they’re still discussing changes to the energy credit provisions.

Advanced Energy United—an energy industry association whose members include technology, energy, and car companies—launched a third national advertising campaign in an effort to prevent the repeals, focusing on how the credits help job creation and power bill savings.

“Congress should be unlocking certainty and growth, not locking out projects already underway,” Harry Godfrey, managing director of the association’s federal priorities team, said in a Monday statement. “The Senate must act to protect what’s working.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/5830fba/2147483647/crop/4000x1542+0+843/resize/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3f%2Ff8%2Fd954a1034149a9a1053eb9b2fc41%2Foregon-wind.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 12:21:36.407446

The Clean Economy Tracker has collected data about what the House reconciliation bill would mean for Kansas if passed in its current form.

Section 45X

Since 2022, Kansas has welcomed more than $4.6 billion in clean manufacturing investments and created 5,537 associated jobs. Battery manufacturing has accounted for over $4.1 billion and 4,180 jobs. For example, Panasonic is building a $4 billion electric vehicle battery plant in De Soto, marking the biggest economic development project in the state’s history. It will create 4,000 direct manufacturing jobs, pay 31% higher than the median income in the state, and double the area’s manufacturing workforce, creating 7,800 total jobs in the area. It will also pay $49 million in property taxes, contribute more than $166 million to improve local infrastructure, and ultimately have a $2.5 billion annual economic impact. H&T Recharge last year announced a $110 million battery component manufacturing plant in De Soto that will create 180 jobs.

Electric vehicle manufacturing has brought more than $427 million in investment and 185 new jobs to the state. For example, Orange EV employs more than 200 employees in Kansas City and built a $37 million headquarters there that can produce 1,800 terminal trucks per year. Last year, General Motors also announced that it would invest $390 million to retool its factory in Kansas City to make the Chevrolet Bolt EV.

Other investors in Kansas include Johnson Controls, which spent $35 million on a heat pump production facility, creating 782 jobs, and Siemens Gamesa, which spent $50 million to expand its wind turbine plant in Hutchinson, creating 130 jobs.

The House reconciliation bill would phase out the Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit for wind components after 2027 and all other components after 2031. Many of the above facilities would qualify for the manufacturing credit, but may not proceed if it is scaled back, jeopardizing local job creation and community investments.

Section 45Y and Section 48E

Kansas currently has 10.82 GW of operating clean power capacity and 0.63 GW under construction. The state also has plans for an additional 0.8 GW of onshore wind, solar, and battery projects. For example, EDP Renewables’ 200 MW Plum Nellie Wind Farm in Cloud County will create 300 construction jobs, add $17 million to the local economy, and pay landowners $33.6 million in property taxes. Invenergy’s 189 MW Pixley Solar Energy Center in Barber County also creates 300 construction jobs, while Sunflower Electric Corporation’s 150 MW Boothill Solar Project in Ford County will add $50 million to the local economy.

The House reconciliation bill would phase out both the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit and the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit after 2028, to be finished before 2032. However, eliminating the Section 45Y and Section 48E tax credits would diminish companies’ ability to build and produce clean energy, jeopardizing these projects and the associated construction and operations jobs. It would also reduce the state’s ability to meet electricity demand, which proves especially problematic as the Kansas Corporation Commission expects the state to face 7.2 GW more energy demand than it can supply by 2043.

Integrating utility-led DER programs into IRPs will transform distributed resources from backup options into the backbone of the power grid.","Jigar Shah is managing partner at Multiplier, an advisory firm, and former director of the U.S. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office.

The United States is facing an unprecedented surge in electricity demand, projected to grow by more than 150 GW by 2030, rivaling energy expansions seen only during World War II. Our power grid must evolve faster than ever. The recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruling and the submission of a revised fast-track interconnection process by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator underscore the critical need for innovative, scalable solutions that enhance resource adequacy.

One path forward lies in utility-led distributed energy resources (DERs), a model exemplified by Xcel Energy’s Distributed Capacity Procurement (DCP) program included in its 2024 integrated resource plan and mirrored by utility battery storage proposals from Exelon’s Maryland utilities in PJM. These programs highlight how utilities can approach deploying DERs like solar and storage up to ten times faster than traditional virtual power plant approaches, addressing load growth with precision, speed and scale.

Distributed energy resources have often been underused due to lack of predictability of use and the random siting of assets, issues that utility-led programs directly solve by integrating DERs into system planning. By strategically siting, deploying and dispatching distributed assets, utilities can provide flexible capacity that smooths peak demand, defers or replaces costly combustion turbines and peaker plants, and minimizes expensive transmission and distribution upgrades as demand grows rapidly.

This flexible, modular approach also narrows the uncertainty band around new generation buildout, enabling capacity to scale alongside real-time load growth while supporting economic expansion and community development. As DERs move from being mere “backup” resources to becoming the “backbone” of the power system, they provide an energy-dense, resilient and cost-stabilizing solution.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s 2025 “Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Virtual Power Plants” report estimates that virtual power plants — aggregations of DERs — could serve 10% to 20% of peak electricity demand by 2030, offsetting 80 GW to 160 GW of capacity needs. Leveraging VPPs would also save an estimated $10 billion annually.

Xcel Energy's recent IRP settlement — unanimously approved by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission — includes an intention to launch a DCP program and establishes Xcel as a forward-thinking leader on distributed energy resources in the MISO region. DCP’s model enables the utility to plan, procure and dispatch DERs with the speed and reliability necessary to meet emerging grid needs. Meanwhile, Exelon’s Maryland utilities — Baltimore Gas & Electric, Pepco and Delmarva Power — have also spotlighted similar utility-led DER programs in response to the Maryland Public Service Commission’s storage procurement request, illustrating broad applicability across markets.

These programs prioritize locally sited resources — solar, storage, demand response and more — to reduce congestion, enhance resilience through fractal reliability, improve utilization of the existing system and enable flexible load management in seconds. They leverage modular, pay-as-you-scale models that reduce the risk of stranded assets and align cost increases with real-time capacity needs, providing a strong economic foundation for continued DER growth. The DCP proposals build upon prior models of utility-ownership — like Green Mountain Power’s Energy Storage System program, launched in 2020 — by incorporating a planning element into DER deployment.

The MISO region has the opportunity to power new data centers and manufacturing. It also faces resource adequacy challenges. For the region’s utilities and regulators, this moment presents a pivotal opportunity to embed utility-led DER models like DCP in upcoming IRPs. These models operate within state jurisdictions and distribution systems where utilities have more control and accountability, allowing for a locally managed and optimized path to resource adequacy.

By embracing utility-led DER programs, MISO states can meet their growing capacity demands faster, cheaper and more flexibly while supporting broader decarbonization goals. This approach delivers on multiple priorities: cost stabilization, faster time to power, strong community development and a reliable, resilient grid capable of weathering future uncertainties.

To secure America’s energy future, MISO regulators and electric utility decision-makers must recognize that DERs are no longer an ancillary option; they must become a central strategy. Integrating utility-led DER programs into IRPs will transform distributed resources from backup options into the backbone of the power grid.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/SUZufHRgQDMJUEuIuFU-y1fBbQuZjllauRoj6Jt6btc/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTMxNTI1NTg2XzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-06-20 11:10:27.011748

With an estimated value of US$43bn by 2030, floating solar arrays, also known as ‘floatovoltaics’, are carving out a growing share of the power generation landscape.

One of the most visible examples is the Cirata floating solar array in Indonesia, described by ABB – a key manufacturing and engineering partner in the project – as an ""example to other global economies"" looking to strengthen their clean energy production.

ABB believes floating photovoltaics (FPVs) will play a growing role in power infrastructure development.

Changing the cost of solar technology

ABB notes that solar power generation is already well established, and that installation costs have fallen by 90% over the past 10 years.

However, floating systems like Cirata still come at a premium compared with land-based alternatives. Even so, ABB expects these costs to come down as FPV deployment becomes more widespread.

There’s also growing recognition of their potential scale. According to the scientific journal Nature, if just 10% of the world’s hydropower reservoirs were covered with floating solar panels, it could match the electricity output of all fossil fuel power stations combined.

Ken Yap, Commercial Vice President at ABB Electrification Indonesia, says that FPVs offer strategic advantages not only to Indonesia but globally.

“We are proud to be part of this project, which is not only strategically important for Indonesia but also sets an example for other global economies that are looking to bolster their decarbonisation plans with floating solar technology,” he explains.

What makes floating solar farms attractive?

ABB points to a range of benefits that make FPVs an attractive option for many countries.

First, they remove the need for land acquisition, which is important in densely populated or agriculturally focused regions. By being located on water, they offer efficient land use and ease pressure on land development.

They also fit well into existing infrastructure, particularly when co-located with hydropower facilities. Reservoir dams can support FPV systems, improving the overall energy mix.

Another benefit is technical performance: panels installed over water are more easily cooled, which boosts efficiency.

There are also water conservation advantages. FPV installations reduce evaporation from lakes and reservoirs, helping to maintain water levels, which is crucial in regions where water availability is already under pressure.

Indonesia’s manufacturing and energy shift

Indonesia, the largest economy in south-east Asia and ranked seventh globally by gross domestic product, is putting floating solar at the centre of its renewable energy plans.

The country has set targets of 23% renewable generation by 2025 and 31% by 2050 – floating solar is seen as one way to meet these goals.

A leading example is the Cirata Reservoir in West Java, about 100km from the capital, Jakarta.

There, a 250-hectare floating solar installation is already in operation. The site is the result of a collaboration between Indonesia’s government and the Abu Dhabi-based renewables firm Masdar.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/cf992c4666604bfc3e524f403dd40b24:a4d72067f36e3ca6ec90ccc5249fbf7c/floatingsolar2.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 13:14:46.880302

Hyundai Motor Group plans to open a Class 8 hydrogen production and dispensing facility, located 10 miles from the Port of Savannah, Georgia, the company announced in a press release.

The more than $30 million refueling station — dubbed HTWO Energy Savannah — is expected to generate 1,200 kilograms of hydrogen per day to support zero-emission, heavy-duty trucking operations in the region.

The initial phase of the company’s plans is set to begin operations in late fall. Phase two will establish a dual-energy facility with the added capability of commercial electric vehicle charging.

Dive Insight:

HTWO Energy Savannah will serve Hyundai’s new $12.6 billion metaplant, an electric and hybrid vehicle production and battery manufacturing facility in Ellabell, Georgia, roughly 20 miles from Savannah.

The company will utilize Xcient hydrogen-powered trucks to service the metaplant. In March, Hyundai partner Benore Logistics announced that 10 Xcient trucks hit the road in Savannah, offering an all-electric range of nearly 250 miles.

Jim Park, SVP of commercial vehicle and hydrogen fuel cell business for Hyundai Motor North America, called the production and refueling station a “breakthrough” for the heavy-duty trucking industry.

“The HTWO Energy Savannah hydrogen station will also truly fulfill our vision for HMGMA Clean Logistics, allowing our innovative new electric vehicle plant to transport plant shipments within a clean, zero-emissions ecosystem,” he said in the release.

While Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America will initially produce 300,000 vehicles annually, it is expected to build up to 500,000 EVs and hybrids for Hyundai, Kia and Genesis brands.

Likewise, HTWO Energy Savannah also has the infrastructure needed to scale. If demand increases in the future, the site can support up to 4,200 kilograms of hydrogen per day, including the accommodation of a variety of passenger and delivery vehicles.

The Power Bill Reduction Act, known also as Senate Bill 266, authored by Sens. Timothy Moffitt of Henderson County, Danny Britt of Robeson County and Warren Daniel of Burke County, was first known as the Historic Flood Event Bldg. Code Exemption. Passage in the upper chamber Thursday was 29-11 and included three Democrats for it and no Republicans against.

Stein’s friend and predecessor, former Gov. Roy Cooper, advocated mightily for the green agenda. A veto would not be a surprise. If all are present trying to override, the Senate is 30-20 meeting the required three-fifths needed, and the House – where 11 Democrats were in favor and one Republican against – is 71-49 (72 needed).

The bill would “eliminate the interim date for carbon reduction by certain electric public utilities.” The 2021 law called for 70% reduction of emissions by 2030 and net-zero by 2050. The proposal makes it 70% by 2050.

Advocates say deadlines that crush flexibility to use natural gas, nuclear and emerging technologies as well as renewables would be changed if the bill becomes law.

Projections say savings could escalate to $15 billion.

Another key bill approved by the Senate is entitled Clarify Powers of State Auditor, known as House Bill 549. Democratic Sen. Dan Blue, the former minority leader in the chamber, joined Republicans in the 27-14 passage.

Late Thursday afternoon, eight other bills were on the legislative website with a schedule date to reach Stein’s desk on Friday. It’s also the day tied to two immigration policy bills as a deadline for signature, veto or allowing to become law without his signature.

The Criminal Illegal Alien Enforcement Act, known also as House Bill 318, enhances cooperation with lawmen in the state and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Local law enforcement could not release the suspect until 48 hours after ICE is notified.

The North Carolina Border Protection Act, also known as Senate Bill 153, would give protection to taxpayer dollars through eligibility assurances for state-funded public benefits such as housing tax credits, child care subsidies and caregiver support. The Office of State Budget and Management, if the bill becomes law, would determine if unauthorized immigrants are receiving such benefits.

BluWave-ai announced the launch of the Pan-Canadian BluWave-ai EV Everywhere Infrastructure Cube, a cloud-based platform designed to transform the country’s electric vehicles (EV) into a massive distributed energy storage network. The platform seamlessly connects EV drivers and their vehicles with utilities and grids across Canada, creating a virtual pool of EV-enabled storage that far exceeds the scale of planned utility deployments.

Currently, Canada’s electricity infrastructure operates largely as isolated provincial grids. As EV adoption accelerates, unmanaged charging threatens to overwhelm local grids; especially in urban centers. The BluWave-ai EV Everywhere Infrastructure Cube addresses this by creating a unified, cross-country cloud platform that coordinates EV energy use across Canada, leveraging the investments made by private EV owners.

BluWave-ai automatically charges EVs using real-time AI deployed on the platform when surplus renewable power is available locally (such as during periods of high solar or wind generation) and likewise pauses or delays charging in areas where the grid is under stress. Participating utilities can send localized congestion signals, enabling the platform to adjust charging behavior dynamically across thousands of vehicles. EV drivers who opt-in to the platform receive rewards while helping balance the grid.

According to Statistics Canada, over one million EVs will be on Canadian roads in 2025. This collective pool of EVs, if coordinated across the country, can provide 1.1 GW of demand response power at any point and 88GWh of storage on a weekly basis.*

“As of January 2024, all electricity grids in Canada combined for only 356MW of storage according to CANREA, which roughly implies EV based storage in the 2.5-3x magnitude of utility scale storage in Canadian grids.” said Devashish Paul, CEO and Founder of BluWave-ai. “Prior to this, there was no standardized way for EV users to connect with utilities, and no automated system to balance driver needs with the provincial grids’ stability on a country-wide scale. Using deep tech AI systems, we created and launched this platform to unify electrified transportation and smart grids into the Pan-Canadian energy corridor, harnessing the power of citizen-owned assets to build a more resilient and renewable-powered country.”

How the Infrastructure Cube Works

The BluWave-ai EV Everywhere Infrastructure Cube is a cloud platform that prevents grid overload from simultaneous EV charging in congested areas and by off taking excess renewables during periods of high generation and low loads through AI managed energy flow.

Visualized as a cube, the platform connects four key faces of the energy ecosystem:

EV Users: Individual drivers can onboard to the platform to receive rewards and benefits.

Electric Vehicles: The system is compatible with major EV brands, including Hyundai, Kia, Tesla, MINI, Jaguar, and BMW, using their native telematics with more on the roadmap, including delivery EV’s and large transit

Utility Providers: Local utilities can register to send real-time data on grid congestion, enabling automated load management.

System Operators: The platform provides a macro-level view, allowing system-wide grid constraints to be managed effectively with live feeds of electricity loads and generation types streamed into the system.

Any combination of the above can work 24×7 with our AI-based automated management taking into account the needs and limitations from all sides.

At the intersection from any direction are unique AI predictors and optimizers working in real-time to balance and optimize the needs of all parties – from individual driver preferences to the needs of local utilities rolled up to system-level grid stability. The underlying technology is supported by a suite of 36 patents filed with the USPTO, 10 of which have been granted and specifically USPTO pending patent: 18/806,264 and Canada pending patent 3,258,465 which support the system to connect both personal EV’s and EV Fleets seamlessly to grids.

The BluWave-ai EV Everywhere Infrastructure Cube builds on the successful deployment of the BluWave-ai EV Everywhere platform and Canada’s first ever AI-enabled aggregated EV demand response conducted in the Hydro Ottawa utility in the IESO grid in Ontario, Canada.

The big picture, Berthou says, is that while EV repairs can be expensive, repair costs are gradually converging with ICE vehicles as repair networks adapt, parts availability improves, and insurers refine their underwriting.","Electric vehicles (EVs) were once seen as the cleaner, cheaper, and – at least initially – easier-to-insure future of personal and commercial transport. Early adopters even enjoyed discounted insurance premiums.

But the honeymoon appears to be over. As EV penetration rises, so do the challenges insurers face in underwriting these tech-heavy, high-torque machines – especially when it comes to the rising costs of repair.

“Initially, it was not uncommon for EVs to receive premium discounts,” he said, “but this has shifted due to their unique risks and repair costs.”

What’s driving EV repair inflation?

At the heart of the pricing issue is the EV’s most expensive and complex component: the battery. Not only does it account for a significant portion of the vehicle’s value, but it introduces new risks.

“It is important to note that the likelihood of EV fires is not higher than that of ICE vehicles,” he said, but also added that “the concentration of value in the battery introduces unique risks, including the potential for increased fire severity due to thermal runway.”

Yet the battery is only one part of a growing puzzle. EVs are often newer models equipped with advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), which add both safety and cost complexity. Repairs involving sensors, radar units, and calibration are expensive – and often non-negotiable.

Supply chain fragility, Berthou says, further exacerbates the issue. Just-in-time manufacturing practices, which were efficient under stable conditions, can now contribute to delays in parts availability and longer repair timelines.

Even driving style plays a role. The instant torque and acceleration of EVs can be difficult for first-time drivers to manage, Berthou points out, which increases accident risk.

Usage patterns, for instance, vary widely. Commercial fleets may favour EVs for their lower fuel and maintenance costs, which makes them a smart choice for high-mileage operations. Meanwhile, private owners often use EVs for shorter commutes or as secondary vehicles, resulting in below-average mileage that skews data on frequency and severity of claims.

Urban driving also plays a role. Many EVs are concentrated in cities where charging infrastructure is strongest – but so is traffic congestion. That increases the chance of minor collisions, making EVs appear more accident-prone per kilometre than their ICE counterparts.

“Urban driving... can lead to higher claim frequency because of traffic density. In addition, shorter trips, where collisions are more likely to occur at the beginning and end, can make EVs appear to have a higher incidence of accidents per mile driven,” he said.

On the flip side, some EV features actually reduce risk. GPS tracking helps deter theft, and the absence of catalytic converters eliminates a common theft target among ICE vehicles.

The big picture, Berthou says, is that while EV repairs can be expensive, repair costs are gradually converging with ICE vehicles as repair networks adapt, parts availability improves, and insurers refine their underwriting.

“Evidence on total loss rates for EVs compared to ICE vehicles is currently limited. This is primarily due to the relatively low number of total losses and modest EV penetration in the overall vehicle parc. As the EV market continues to grow and mature, the likelihood of total losses is expected to remain manageable and comparable to that of ICE vehicles,” he said.

The role brokers need to play

With many EVs still relatively new, expensive, and packed with emerging technologies, Berthou says that brokers play a critical role in helping clients avoid coverage gaps and misunderstandings that can lead to unpleasant surprises at claim time.

“Brokers play a crucial role in helping customers navigate the complexities of insurance policies, particularly for EVs,” he said. “Given that the EV market is still growing, with many new and expensive vehicles on the road, it is essential for brokers to provide advice that avoids coverage gaps and unfulfilled customer expectations in the event of a claim.”

Brokers should highlight the need for solid comprehensive and collision coverage, since new EV drivers often go through a learning curve. Things like rapid acceleration or screen-heavy dashboards, he says, can be distracting and raise the risk of fender benders.

“Broad coverage for own damage ensures that these high-value vehicles are well-protected against a range of perils,” he said.

Brokers, he says, should also break down the EV-specific details clients might overlook – like what’s actually covered when it comes to the battery or charging gear. Most policies won’t cover everyday wear and tear, like battery drain over time or tire wear, but they might step in if there’s sudden battery failure or damage to charging equipment.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/003/0357_638860268026984311.png,N,,2025-06-20 12:26:53.776019

This move comes as part of the Trump Administration’s broad energy and regulatory policy shift aimed at expanding domestic energy production, reducing regulatory burdens, and ensuring affordable, reliable energy, as outlined in Executive Order 14154— “Unleashing American Energy” and Executive Order 14156— “Declaring a National Energy Emergency” issued in January 2025. Critics of the Administration’s strategy fear that adverse impacts may result to the energy industry, public health, and the climate.

Proposed Rule Change Background

The Environmental Protection Agency’s June 11 announcement outlined three rules for proposed repeal under the Clean Air Act[1]:

The 2015 New Source Performance Standards for Power Plants (NSPS).[2] In 2015, the Obama Administration established New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for new, modified, and reconstructed power plants, focusing on CO₂ emissions from coal and natural gas plants.

The 2024 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Power Plants (Carbon Pollution Standards).[3] This rule, enacted under the Biden Administration, also focused on CO₂ but expanded the scope to include emission guidelines for existing power plants and new natural gas combustion turbines. According to the EPA's Regulatory Impact Analysis for the final rule, the Carbon Pollution Standards were projected to reduce 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere by 2047.

The 2024 Amendments to the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS).[4] The Clean Air Act, § 112—specifically, 42 U.S.C. § 7412—outlines regulations for controlling hazardous air pollutants from stationary sources. The EPA’s MATS rule aims to reduce mercury, chromium, nickel, arsenic, and other types of pollution that are emitted by coal-fired power plants and linked to certain health risks.[5] The Trump Administration proposal would revert to 2012 standards.

In October 2024, the Supreme Court of the United States rejected a request from 23 Republican states and a coalition of coal and natural gas industry groups to block enforcement of the MATS.[6] Now, the Trump Administration is proposing to repeal the MATS, NSPS, and Carbon Pollution Standards. The EPA estimates that the proposed repeal of the MATS and NSPS rules would save $1.2 billion in regulatory costs over the next decade, or about $120 million a year. Further, the EPA estimates the repeal of the Carbon Pollution Standards would save the power sector $19 billion in regulatory costs over the next two decades beginning in 2026, or about $1.2 billion a year. A breakdown of these savings estimates was not provided in the EPA’s June 11 announcement.

Supporters of the Trump Administration’s deregulation strategy and decision to declare an energy emergency have pointed to PJM (also known as Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland), the largest regional transmission organization in the United States, which warned of an energy capacity shortage risk as early as June 2026. PJM detailed its prediction in a December 9, 2024 letter from the PJM board of managers and outlined the following key concerns contributing to an energy capacity shortage risk: (i) rapid load growth driven by electrification and data center expansion; (ii) accelerated retirement of thermal generators due to policy and economic pressures; (iii) slow entry of replacement resources, especially dispatchable generation; and (iv) a high proportion of intermittent resources in the interconnection queue that lack the same reliability characteristics as retiring plants.[7]

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin alleges that power plant emissions in the United States “do not contribute ‘significantly’ to climate change,” as emissions from U.S. fossil fuel-burning power plants represented only 3 percent of worldwide greenhouse gases in 2022, down from 5.5 percent in 2005.[8] In contrast, media reports from The New York Times state that power plants in the United States “were responsible for about 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions generated in this country in 2022. They emitted about 1.5 billion metric tons of emissions in 2023, which is more than the total greenhouse gas emissions produced by most countries.”[9]

Response to Proposed Changes

Congressional support for the repeal of the rules came from Republicans, particularly from constituencies located in districts with large fossil fuel industries. Ohio representative Troy Balderson said that keeping the Biden administration rules “would have forced our most reliable [energy] sources into early retirement.”[10] And West Virgina representative Carol Miller, co-chair of the Congressional Coal Caucus, said, “We must unleash American coal, not bury it under red tape.”[11] Additionally, the rules have been criticized by some in the energy industry for potentially raising energy costs and impacting grid reliability.

In April 2025, a group of 180 Democratic lawmakers wrote a letter to EPA Administrator Zeldin raising concerns with new policies already implemented and anticipated to be implemented by the Trump Administration. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.), House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) and Don Beyer (Va.) signed the letter in protest of the EPA’s environmental deregulation and legislative rollback agenda.[12] Moreover, some energy industry groups have expressed concern that deregulation could create regulatory uncertainty for those that have already invested in emissions control technologies.

Included in the figure is the $249 million Prysmian Board of Director's approved during the Capital Market Day event in March. This groundbreaking marks a significant advancement for the company, nearly a year after Prysmian's acquisition of Encore Wire to serve electrical customers in North America through Encore's outstanding service model.

L to R: Michael Kowski, MEDC President & CEO, Bill Cox, Mayor City of McKinney, Andrea Pirondini, CEO Prysmian North America, Troy Skidmore, Encore Wire Head of Human Resources, Michelle Bishop, District Director for Rep. Keith Self, Michael Flusche, North Texas Regional Director for Sen. Ted Cruz

The Encore Campus and its unique business model are essential as part of Prysmian's evolution from a cable manufacturer to a solutions provider, serving customers with the quality and speed that is essential to unlock major energy priorities, ranging from data centers, the U.S. industry, and the strengthening of our power grid.

The project centers around a state-of-the-art medium voltage cable production facility totaling more than 650,000 square feet. Expected online in 2027, the plant will significantly increase Prysmian's medium voltage capacity and add 120 new jobs.

""This new plant will be one of the largest standalone facilities on our campus, which is the largest vertically integrated cable factory on the planet and is a major milestone in the Prysmian/Encore Wire growth,"" said Andrea Pirondini, Prysmian North America CEO.

Encore Wire started in 1989 with a 68,000 square foot industrial warehouse building in McKinney. Over the past 35 years, Encore has grown to over 3.5 million square feet across 460 acres. The new investment reinforces Prysmian's commitment to the City of McKinney and the region, while strengthening Prysmian's portfolio of U.S. manufactured products.

In addition to Prysmian leaders, U. S. Representative Keith Self's District Director Michelle Bishop presented a Congressional certificate to Pirondini marking the importance of this investment. Governor Greg Abbott also issued a proclamation commemorating the groundbreaking. McKinney's new Mayor Bill Cox joined other local leaders for the ceremony, including the Michael Kowski from McKinney Economic Development Corporation (MEDC).

""Building on Encore Wire's successes, Prysmian's investment in McKinney will be significant to this community in so many different ways,"" said Michael Kowski, MEDC President & CEO. ""We're proud to help bring new opportunities to our citizens and continue to showcase McKinney as fertile ground for business growth and expansion.""

""I'm honored that my first groundbreaking as mayor is for a project as big and as important as what we see here today from Prysmian,"" said Mayor Bill Cox. ""We thank Andrea and the Prysmian team for their investment in McKinney and look forward to further growth in the years to come.""

Guests also signed a commemorative beam that will be placed in a prominent location in the new facility. The medium voltage plant is the first phase of Prysmian's investments in McKinney. To learn more on the vertically integrated campus, visit Encore Wire's website.

,EPA,2025-06-20 14:30:05+00:00,news.bloomberglaw.com,Supreme Court's Clean Air Ruling Risks Enforcement Divide (1) - Bloomberg Law News,Taylor Mills,,,,,https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/supreme-courts-clean-air-ruling-poses-enforcement-divide-risk,"The US Supreme Court’s new standard for when the Environmental Protection Agency can move Clean Air Act enforcement disputes to the D.C.
Circuit has the potential to create circuit splits and disparate rulemaking for clean air standards, legal observers say.
The ruling could limit the effectiveness of the pollution program, because the new standard now allows those disputes to be heard anywhere in the country, environmentalists say.
The program governs nitrogen oxides pollution that travels across state lines to meet the EPA’s 2015 National Ambient Air Quality Standards.
“The Clean Air Act’s judicial review provisions are designed to ensure orderly court review that respects the Act’s vital, time-sensitive protections for public health,” Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, said in a statement.","The US Supreme Court’s new standard for when the Environmental Protection Agency can move Clean Air Act enforcement disputes to the D.C. Circuit has the potential to create circuit splits and disparate rulemaking for clean air standards, legal observers say.

In an unanimous opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas Wednesday, the high court raised the bar for the agency to steer challenges over ozone pollution State Implementation Plans to its preferred venue, the US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Only EPA actions where “justification of a nationwide breadth is the primary explanation” can be transferred to that forum, the justices said.

Oklahoma v. EPA regarded SIP disapproval—part of the Biden administration’s “Good Neighbor” nationwide ozone plan—as a local or regional application of agency decision. The ruling could limit the effectiveness of the pollution program, because the new standard now allows those disputes to be heard anywhere in the country, environmentalists say.

The program governs nitrogen oxides pollution that travels across state lines to meet the EPA’s 2015 National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

“What we’re seeing is splintering of how this nationwide thing the EPA is modeling is getting assessed across the country,” said Zachary Fabish, a senior attorney with the Sierra Club. “We’re really running the risk of seeing disparate decisions,” and there are “enormous public health and equity problems with that,” he said.

Federal governance of interstate ozone migration is meant to ensure that states that present “do nothing SIPs,” can be held accountable for pollution traveling from their jurisdictions to “downwind” states, Fabish said.

With different circuits hearing cases and potentially offering different standards for how the EPA can scrutinize things like data and public comments, state plans may take longer to finalize and ultimately go into effect, he said.

An EPA spokesperson said in a statement that the agency is reviewing the decision.

Two-Part Program

The two-part Good Neighbor program directs the EPA to review states’ implementation plans to reduce pollutants to NAAQS levels, then offer a federal alternative if the agency deems the plan out of compliance.

Pending challenges to SIP disapprovals currently span six US appeals courts and include over a dozen states.

The Supreme Court blocked the second part of the Good Neighbor rule last year, finding that the EPA failed to explain how the traveling ozone plan would work with patchwork participation from states that managed to curb enforcement in separate legal battles.

The agency last updated the Good Neighbor program in December, saying the agency’s four-step analytical framework adequately determines state obligations and doesn’t require adjustments even with fewer states participating.

Still, with scattered orders across lower courts putting various SIP disapprovals on hold, the EPA can’t impose a federal alternative plan.

The Supreme Court’s latest decision means a uniform standard will likely take longer to implement.

“The Clean Air Act’s judicial review provisions are designed to ensure orderly court review that respects the Act’s vital, time-sensitive protections for public health,” Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, said in a statement.

‘Nationwide Scope’

The D.C. Circuit has long been the authoritative court for EPA rulemaking, and the Clean Air Act includes a “nationwide scope” exemption from deferring to hearing disputes in the other circuits on locally applied rules.

But the Supreme Court held that the agency led with “predominately fact-intensive, state specific analysis” while the nationwide contribution factors were “at most heuristics that aided EPA’s analysis, as opposed to the primary drivers of its disapprovals” for Oklahoma and Utah’s SIPs, which were the ones at issue in the case the justices heard.

The decision is an opportunity for the EPA to restructure its rulemaking to put enforcement of a nationally applicable standard first, as opposed to individualized review of pollution controls within state borders, said Brian Bunger, a land use and environment partner at Holland & Knight LLP who is not involved in the case.

“EPA can do the upfront work to structure their review” of state-submitted plans likes SIPs or small refineries exemptions “in a way that the court would say were in the national framework, as opposed to localized review,” he said.",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/34ad483/2147483647/crop/4000x1542+0+464/resize/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F56%2F3e%2F4c60e31c48cd9e1bef0708c65748%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2167038892,N,,2025-06-20 13:15:35.994723

Though this was a session designed to focus largely on fiscal matters, lawmakers went far beyond that and by any measure their work was major in its scope.

Leaders for a Better Louisiana commends lawmakers for many of their efforts, particularly in areas focused on improving the state’s economic competitiveness, enhancing education and workforce opportunities, and bringing new jobs to the state.

This session addressed several of the challenges that have held Louisiana back while setting the stage for significant economic growth opportunities in the future.

Leaders for a Better Louisiana Policy Initiatives

While Better Louisiana was involved in a wide range of bills this session, the organization took the lead championing four pieces of legislation designed to enhance educational, training, and career opportunities for citizens:

HB 533: Combines two existing tax credits into a single credit for apprentices and interns and aligns them with the new work-based learning requirements in the state school accountability system. It is designed to encourage employers to expand work-based learning opportunities for more students and workers.

SB 233: Expands an existing tax credit for businesses that pay a portion of the costs for employee childcare. Its goal is to increase access to quality early learning experiences for children and address one of the critical workforce issues faced by employers.

SCR 38: Creates a task force to study ways to implement education-to-career counseling at Louisiana colleges to help connect students to career and job opportunities in Louisiana early in their studies. This is intended to retain talent in Louisiana after graduation to help address the state’s challenges with outmigration.

SCR 29: Creates a task force to study Louisiana’s Incumbent Worker Training Program, evaluate the workforce needs of Louisiana businesses, and consider ways the program could be better utilized to enhance workforce training.

Both of these resolutions are intended to shape policy recommendations for the 2026 legislative session and beyond.

Economic Development

The Legislature again took a number of steps to significantly enhance the state’s economic development efforts. Key bills include:

SB 161: Continues the organizational changes begun last year to LED, giving the department more budgetary flexibility and additional authority over land leasing and the purchase and sale of land.

HB 433: Creates the Site Investment and Infrastructure Improvement Fund which will receive $150 million for the first year to help make Louisiana more competitive in developing workable sites for major companies looking to locate within the state. This fund is closely linked to the new LED strategic plan that Better Louisiana supported last year. Its funding represents the state’s largest ever investment in economic development site development and enhances Louisiana’s competitiveness with other states.

HB 1 & HB 461: Appropriate $272 million from the Revenue Stabilization Trust Fund to the Louisiana Economic Development Initiatives Fund. Besides making the initial payment of $150 million to the Site Investment fund, this appropriation also supports:

Rapid Response Fund: $65 million to provide immediate funding for projects to create or retain jobs in Louisiana.

Marketing Fund: $5 million for talent recruitment and state marketing efforts.

Major Events Incentive Fund: $10 million to support events such as the Super Bowl, NCAA Final Four, and other events that have a significant economic impact for the state.

Various Other LED Initiatives: $42 million

HB 507: Creates the new High Impact Jobs Program. It is a grant-based incentives program which replaces the tax credit approach used in the Quality Jobs Program repealed in last fall’s special session.

HB 365 & 366: This constitutional amendment and statute revisit changes to the business inventory tax that were part of Amendment #2 which failed at the ballot in March. Together they provide a mechanism for local governments to voluntarily phase out, repeal, or reduce the business inventory tax. This tax has been a longstanding obstacle in attracting new companies to Louisiana.

Agency Reorganizations

Last year the Legislature undertook a major reorganization of Louisiana Economic Development. This year, with SB 161 they updated portions of that reorganization, but also approved major changes in the Department of Transportation & Development, the Workforce Commission, and the Department of Children & Family Services.

The DOTD reorganization is the most sweeping. HB 528, HB 556, and HB 640, begin the process of transforming the way Louisiana handles highway maintenance, construction, and repair. Among other things, this package of bills:

Changes the organizational and operational structure of DOTD.

Creates the Office of Transformation with a director charged with developing and implementing more innovative and efficient ways to deliver highway projects across the state.

Creates the Office of Louisiana Highway Construction. It would oversee the 4,800 miles of state roads that do not receive federal funding and would have the ability to accelerate the implementation of projects on those roads.

Allows much greater use of privatization and outsourcing for engineering work, project planning, construction, and other services.

Two bills, HB 617 and HB 624 reorganize DCFS and transfer a number of family and support programs from that agency to the Louisiana Workforce Commission. The goal is to create a “one-door” system, where someone seeking job training from LWC will also have access to various other types of support to facilitate their training and help ensure they are able to participate in the workforce. This could include such things as Medicaid enrollment, SNAP benefits, or childcare assistance if eligible. LWC has been renamed Louisiana Works.

Lawmakers also reorganized the Department of Energy & Natural Resources and gave the agency its third name in as many years: The Department of Conservation & Energy. And they merged the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness into the Military Department, which oversees the Louisiana National Guard.

Insurance

In an effort to address the high cost of auto insurance in Louisiana (see: Better Louisiana insurance report), the Legislature debated numerous bills focusing on legal reforms to address some of the cost-drivers that contribute to our high auto insurance rates, as well as some actions affecting property insurance issues.

Modified Comparative Fault (Act 15): Prevents drivers who were 51% or greater at fault from receiving damages. More than half of U.S. states apply some form of modified comparative fault.

Repudiation of“Houseley Presumption” (Act 18): Rolls back a court-created presumption that injuries were the result of an accident if the plaintiff did not have the condition prior to the accident. Requires plaintiffs to prove their injuries stem from the accident.

No Pay, No Play (Act 16): Raises the bar for recovery of bodily injury and property damage for a driver without auto insurance. Previously, state law barred recovery for the first $15,000 of bodily injury and $25,000 of property damage, and this bill increased the bar to the first $100,000 for both injury and property claims.

Medical Transparency (SB 231): Provides transparency during jury trials involving bodily injury to show how much was actually paid to cover medical costs following an accident versus the often-higher amount that a health care provider bills.

Other actions: A handful of other positive changes will assist homeowners including doubling the income tax deduction for those who privately retrofit their roof to the latest construction code, an additional $10 million for roof fortification grants, as well as creating a new, dedicated fee for ongoing funding of these roof grants.

We have concerns about one of the pieces of legislation on insurance issues, HB 148 or Act 11, that was signed into law. The bill places the Commissioner of Insurance in the position of declaring rates “excessive” under a subjective standard, meaning the Department could reject rates without data-supported evidence (actuarial analysis) as has been required prior to this law. More concerning still, the law allows the Commissioner to order refunds by a company to the state where a rate—even one that had previously been approved and is in effect—is deemed excessive.

The bill did not include an end-date to how far back in time an Insurance Commissioner can look at past rates. The bill also adds a change in the rate-filing process that potentially exposes carriers’ confidential and proprietary information to disclosure to competitors, which could affect the insurance products that companies are willing to offer in Louisiana. These elements of Act 11 make Louisiana an outlier and could deter insurers from entering the market due to the potentially volatile regulatory environment made possible by these changes. Unfortunately, given this new uncertainty, we worry that the passage of this bill could undercut the impact on rates that could be realized from the positive legal reform measures described above.

Education & Workforce

Often in education and workforce, legislative sessions focus on changes in policy. There were a few of those this year, but in most cases the big items dealt with money.

HB 466, HB 473, & HB 579: These bills worked in tandem to bring back the effort that failed with Amendment #2 to provide a permanent pay increase for teachers and school personnel. Together they liquidate three education trust funds, use about $2 billion from the funds to pay off debt in the teachers’ retirement system, and utilize savings to fund a permanent teacher pay raise of $2,250 per year. This package includes a constitutional amendment which voters will have to approve next year before it takes effect.

HB 77: Creates a new higher-tier TOPS awards of up to $12,000 per year for students who earn a 3.5 GPA in high school and score a 31 or above on the ACT. This is designed to encourage Louisiana’s highest-performing students to continue their education at a Louisiana institution.

HB 566: Creates a streamlined procurement process to speed up routine deferred maintenance projects on college campuses

SB 72: Continues a bond issuance program to raise almost $44 million per year to fund eight capital projects on community college campuses.

Higher Education Campus Revitalization Fund: $43 million will be deposited into this fund from the Revenue Stabilization Trust Fund. Almost $30 million of this will go to pay for deferred maintenance and capital improvement projects on college campuses. The rest helps fund graduate assistantships, campus security, new buildings, and debt payments at UNO.

Revenue Stabilization Trust Fund

The state has two savings accounts, the Budget Stabilization Fund (“Rainy Day”) and the Revenue Stabilization Trust Fund. The Revenue Fund has been holding about $3.9 billion and can be tapped by lawmakers with a two-thirds vote for almost any purpose. They did that with HB 461, transferring $1.2 billion from the fund for a variety of uses. Some of these are mentioned above.

Louisiana Transportation Infrastructure Fund: $709 million

Louisiana Economic Development Initiatives Fund: $272 million

Criminal Justice & First Responder Fund: $23 million

Higher Education Campus Revitalization Fund: $43 million

Modernization & Security Fund: $67 million

Water Sector Funds: $75 million

Voting Technology Fund: $10 million

Bills of Concern

Better Louisiana also had concerns about a number of bills and was able to help defeat or mitigate several of them, particularly on education policy issues. A few others on broader subjects stand out.

HB 674: This was a major rewrite of the state ethics code. The original bill raised many concerning issues. Working with legislators and PAR, a number of its more problematic issues were either removed or changed before final passage. Still, we have concerns about the higher bar it establishes for the ethics board to investigate possible ethics violations.

HB 160: This bill went even further in some ways to impede ethics violation investigations. Though it passed in the House it was never voted on in the Senate.

SB 8: This constitutional amendment, which will be decided next year by voters, gives the Legislature the sweeping authority to create new unclassified civil service positions in state government. While we support comprehensive civil service reform, we are concerned that passage of this amendment could politicize the state workforce in ways we have not seen in Louisiana in decades.

HB 633: After Katrina, CABL was instrumental in reforming levee boards in the New Orleans area and creating a system to help remove politics from the process of levee board appointments. For nearly 20 years, CABL had a designee to the nominating committee that vetted and recommended levee board appointments to the governor. In the original bill, that nominating committee was abolished for one of the two major New Orleans-area levee boards. In working with legislators and other stakeholders the nominating committee was restored, and Better Louisiana was added to replace CABL on that committee. There are still concerns about the governance of these levee boards because of legislation passed last year to allow the governor to choose the board chairs, but that was not addressed in the final legislation that passed.

Conclusion

Better Louisiana believes the 2025 session yielded several major wins for the state as we work to grow our economy, improve educational and training opportunities for our citizens, and retain top talent in Louisiana. No session is perfect. Certainly, there were some disappointments along the way and actions taken where the ultimate outcomes are uncertain. But overall, we believe this session builds on the groundwork laid with last year’s tax reforms and better positions Louisiana for a more prosperous future.",https://cabl.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/capitol8-1024x540.png,N,,2025-06-20 11:11:28.405014

A new study from solar energy company Wolf River Electric puts Texas at No. 2 among the states most at risk for power outages this summer. Michigan tops the list.

Wolf River Electric analyzed the number of large-scale outages that left more than 5,000 utility customers, including homes, stores and schools, without summertime electricity from 2019 to 2023. During that period, Texas experienced 7,164 summertime power outages.

Despite Michigan being hit with more summertime outages, Texas led the list of states with the most hours of summertime power outages — an annual average of 35,440. That works out to 1,477 days. “This means power cuts in Texas tend to last longer, making summer especially tough for residents and businesses,” the study says.

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates the electric grid serving 90 percent of the state, predicts its system will set a monthly record for peak demand this August — 85,759 megawatts. That would exceed the current record of 85,508 megawatts, dating back to August 2023.

In 2025, natural gas will account for 37.7 percent of ERCOT’s summertime power-generating capacity, followed by wind (22.9 percent) and solar (19 percent), according to an ERCOT fact sheet.

This year, ERCOT expects four months to surpass peak demand of 80,000 megawatts:

June 2025 — 82,243 megawatts

July 2025 — 84,103 megawatts

August 2025 — 85,759 megawatts

September 2025 — 80,773 megawatts

One megawatt is enough power to serve about 250 residential customers amid peak demand, according to ERCOT. Using that figure, the projected peak of 85,759 megawatts in August would supply enough power to serve more than 21.4 million residential customers in Texas.

Every time you ask ChatGPT a question, to generate an image or let artificial intelligence summarize your email, something big is happening behind the scenes. Not on your device, but in sprawling data centers filled with servers, GPUs and cooling systems that require massive amounts of electricity.

The modern AI boom is pushing our power grid to its limits. ChatGPT alone processes roughly 1 billion queries per day, each requiring data center resources far beyond what’s on your device.

In fact, the energy needed to support artificial intelligence is rising so quickly that it has already delayed the retirement of several coal plants in the U.S., with more delays expected. Some experts warn that the AI arms race is outpacing the infrastructure meant to support it. Others argue it could spark long-overdue clean energy innovation.

AI isn't just reshaping apps and search engines. It's also reshaping how we build, fuel and regulate the digital world. The race to scale up AI capabilities is accelerating faster than most infrastructure can handle, and energy is becoming the next major bottleneck.

Why AI uses so much power, and what drives the demand

Running artificial intelligence at scale requires enormous computational power. Unlike traditional internet activity, which mostly involves pulling up stored information, AI tools perform intensive real-time processing. Whether training massive language models or responding to user prompts, AI systems rely on specialized hardware like GPUs (graphics processing unit) that consume far more power than legacy servers. GPUs are designed to handle many calculations in parallel, which is perfect for the matrix-heavy workloads that power generative AI and deep learning systems.

To give you an idea of scale: one Nvidia H100 GPU, commonly used in AI training, consumes up to 700 watts on its own. Training a single large AI model like GPT-4 may require thousands of these GPUs running continuously for weeks. Multiply that across dozens of models and hundreds of data centers, and the numbers escalate quickly. A traditional data center rack might use around 8 kilowatts (kW) of power. An AI-optimized rack using GPUs can demand 45-55 kW or more. Multiply that across an entire building or campus of racks, and the difference is staggering.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

Cooling all that hardware adds another layer of energy demand. Keeping AI servers from overheating accounts for 30-55% of a data center's total power use. Advanced cooling methods like liquid immersion are helping, but scaling those across the industry will take time.

On the upside, AI researchers are developing more efficient ways to run these systems. One promising approach is the ""mixture of experts"" model architecture, which activates only a portion of the full model for each task. This method can significantly reduce the amount of energy required without sacrificing performance.

How much power are we talking about?

In 2023, global data centers consumed about 500 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity. That is enough to power every home in California, Texas and Florida combined for an entire year. By 2030, the number could triple, with AI as the main driver.

To put it into perspective, the average home uses about 30 kilowatt-hours per day. One terawatt-hour is a billion times larger than a kilowatt-hour. That means 1 TWh could power 33 million homes for a day.

5 AI TERMS YOU KEEP HEARING AND WHAT THEY ACTUALLY MEAN

AI’s energy demand is outpacing the power grid

The demand for AI is growing faster than the energy grid can adapt. In the U.S., data center electricity use is expected to surpass 600 TWh by 2030, tripling current levels. Meeting that demand requires the equivalent of adding 14 large power plants to the grid. Large AI data centers can each require 100–500 megawatts (MW), and the largest facilities may soon exceed 1 gigawatt (GW), which is about as much as a nuclear power plant or a small U.S. state. One 1 GW data center could consume more power than the entire city of San Francisco. Multiply that by a few dozen campuses across the country, and you start to see how quickly this demand adds up.

To keep up, utilities across the country are delaying coal plant retirements, expanding natural gas infrastructure and shelving clean energy projects. In states like Utah, Georgia and Wisconsin, energy regulators have approved new fossil fuel investments directly linked to data center growth. By 2035, data centers could account for 8.6% of all U.S. electricity demand, up from 3.5% today.

Despite public pledges to support sustainability, tech companies are inadvertently driving a fossil fuel resurgence. For the average person, this shift could increase electricity costs, strain regional energy supplies and complicate state-level clean energy goals.

Can big tech keep its green energy promises?

Tech giants Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta all claim they are working toward a net-zero emissions future. In simple terms, this means balancing the amount of greenhouse gases they emit with the amount they remove or offset, ideally bringing their net contribution to climate change down to zero.

These companies purchase large amounts of renewable energy to offset their usage and invest in next-generation energy solutions. For example, Microsoft has a contract with fusion start-up Helion to supply clean electricity by 2028.

However, critics argue these clean energy purchases do not reflect the reality on the ground. Because the grid is shared, even if a tech company buys solar or wind power on paper, fossil fuels often fill the gap for everyone else.

Some researchers say this model is more beneficial for company accounting than for climate progress. While the numbers might look clean on a corporate emissions report, the actual energy powering the grid still includes coal and gas. Microsoft, Google and Amazon have pledged to power their data centers with 100% renewable energy, but because the grid is shared, fossil fuels often fill the gap when renewables aren’t available.

Some critics argue that voluntary pledges alone are not enough. Unlike traditional industries, there is no standardized regulatory framework requiring tech companies to disclose detailed energy usage from AI operations. This lack of transparency makes it harder to track whether green pledges are translating into meaningful action, especially as workloads shift to third-party contractors or overseas operations.

AI CYBERSECURITY RISKS AND DEEPFAKE SCAMS ON THE RISE

The future of clean energy for AI and its limits

To meet soaring energy needs without worsening emissions, tech companies are investing in advanced energy projects. These include small nuclear reactors built directly next to data centers, deep geothermal systems and nuclear fusion.

While promising, these technologies face enormous technical and regulatory hurdles. Fusion, for example, has never reached commercial break-even, meaning it has yet to produce more energy than it consumes. Even the most optimistic experts say we may not see scalable fusion before the 2030s.

Beyond the technical barriers, many people have concerns about the safety, cost and long-term waste management of new nuclear systems. While proponents argue these designs are safer and more efficient, public skepticism remains a real hurdle. Community resistance is also a factor. In some regions, proposals for nuclear microreactors or geothermal drilling have faced delays due to concerns over safety, noise and environmental harm. Building new data centers and associated power infrastructure can take up to seven years, due to permitting, land acquisition and construction challenges.

Google recently activated a geothermal project in Nevada, but it only generates enough power for a few thousand homes. The next phase may be able to power a single data center by 2028. Meanwhile, companies like Amazon and Microsoft continue building sites that consume more power than entire citie.

SCAMMERS CAN EXPLOIT YOUR DATA FROM JUST ONE CHATGPT SEARCH

Will AI help or harm the environment?

This is the central debate. Advocates argue that AI could ultimately help accelerate climate progress by optimizing energy grids, modeling emissions patterns and inventing better clean technology. Microsoft and Google have both cited these uses in their public statements. But critics warn that the current trajectory is unsustainable. Without major breakthroughs or stricter policy frameworks, the energy cost of AI may overwhelm climate gains. A recent forecast estimated that AI could add 1.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide to global emissions between 2025 and 2030, roughly 4% more than the entire annual emissions of the U.S.

Water use, rare mineral demand and land-use conflicts are also emerging concerns as AI infrastructure expands. Large data centers often require millions of gallons of water for cooling each year, which can strain local water supplies. The demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements — used in servers, cooling systems and power electronics — creates additional pressure on supply chains and mining operations. In some areas, communities are pushing back against land being rezoned for large-scale tech development.

Rapid hardware turnover is also adding to the environmental toll. As AI systems evolve quickly, older GPUs and accelerators are replaced more frequently, creating significant electronic waste. Without strong recycling programs in place, much of this equipment ends up in landfills or is exported to developing countries.

The question isn’t just whether AI can become cleaner over time. It’s whether we can scale the infrastructure needed to support it without falling back on fossil fuels. Meeting that challenge will require tighter collaboration between tech companies, utilities and policymakers. Some experts warn that AI could either help fight climate change or make it worse, and the outcome depends entirely on how we choose to power the future of computing.

Kurt’s key takeaways

AI is revolutionizing how we work, but it is also transforming how we use energy. Data centers powering AI systems are becoming some of the world’s largest electricity consumers. Tech companies are betting big on futuristic solutions, but the reality is that many fossil fuel plants are staying online longer just to meet AI’s rising energy demand. Whether AI ends up helping or hurting the climate may depend on how quickly clean energy breakthroughs catch up and how honestly we measure progress.

The council received $62.5 million in appropriations from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 to collect data and improve federal environmental reviews. This is more than ten times what the council typically gets annually.

In December 2024, $46 million of the funds were still available. They expire on September 30, 2026.

After we told the council about our prior work on evidence-based policymaking, staff said they would use our work to guide their planning for the remaining funds. This could help them better assess whether funds are achieving intended results.

What GAO Found

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) appropriated $62.5 million to the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to support environmental and climate data collection and CEQ's role in federal environmental reviews. CEQ had obligated about $16 million (26 percent) as of December 31, 2024, to hire personnel and award contracts, and most of these obligations were expended. CEQ used its IRA appropriation for environmental and climate data collection to, among other things, develop a scorecard to track federal progress toward environmental justice goals. This effort was based on a now-revoked executive order, and the scorecard is no longer accessible online. CEQ used its IRA appropriation for supporting environmental reviews to, among other things, create a plan to improve federal environmental review and permitting processes related to the amended National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), which requires federal agencies to review the environmental effects of certain proposed federal actions. As of December 2024, about $46 million in CEQ's IRA appropriations remained available to be obligated through September 30, 2026. In January 2025, a new executive order required agencies to pause disbursement of IRA appropriations and review their uses for alignment with current polices. In February 2025, CEQ indicated it was reviewing the order's effect on its uses of IRA appropriations.

Status of Council on Environmental Quality Uses of Inflation Reduction Act Appropriations, as of December 31, 2024

CEQ staff said that the Council had used its standard, largely informal approach to oversee its uses of IRA appropriations. They said that leadership and staff met regularly and that CEQ coordinated within the Executive Office of the President to assess how IRA appropriations were being used to achieve environmental goals. In December 2024, GAO discussed with CEQ the key practice of planning for results outlined in GAO's prior work. CEQ then provided GAO, in April 2025, updated internal guidance that stated CEQ would plan for results when using the remaining IRA appropriations to advance current policy objectives and meet IRA requirements. GAO's prior work found that planning for results is a key practice that can help federal entities enhance their efforts. GAO welcomes CEQ's intention to guide its planning with the key practices found in GAO's prior work should it obligate its remaining IRA appropriations.

Why GAO Did This Study

CEQ is an office within the Executive Office of the President that advises the President on environmental policies. It also oversees the implementation of NEPA, which requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of certain proposed federal actions. Title VI of the IRA provided more than 10 times CEQ's typical annual appropriations to support environmental and climate programs.

GAO was asked to review CEQ's use of IRA appropriations. This report examines (1) how CEQ obligated and expended IRA appropriations through December 2024, and (2) CEQ's oversight of its uses of IRA appropriations.

GAO reviewed CEQ obligations and expenditures data through December 2024; reviewed documentation about CEQ's use and oversight of IRA appropriations; and interviewed CEQ staff about spending decisions and oversight practices.

The nation's second-largest petroleum company has acquired a roughly 125,000-acre leasehold position in the Smackover geologic formation in southwest Arkansas and northeast Texas. The Smackover extends into all of north Louisiana.

The 100,000 acres in Arkansas were acquired from Houston-based TerraVolta Resources. The 25,000 East Texas acres came from East Texas Natural Resources LLC, also based in Houston.

The mineral lithium, a key component in batteries of all types but especially important in electric vehicle technology, has been found in commercial quantities in Arkansas and Texas. The current epicenter of the rush is Union, Miller, Lafayette and Columbia counties in South Arkansas.

Leases in Louisiana were not a part of the reported purchases.

Testing to determine lithium quantities in north Louisiana brine water will be started this summer. Ipsita Gupta, a Ph.D. and associate professor at the LSU Craft & Hawkins Department of Petroleum Engineering, has received a grant to determine exactly what lurks in produced waters from oil and gas fields in Louisiana’s Smackover geologic formation.

In their news release, Chevron stated that this buy-in represents “Chevron’s first step toward establishing a commercial-scale domestic lithium business.”

Petroleum engineer Dave Hackney retired from Chevron after 39 years that took him to jobs in Africa, Asia and South America. “We were drilling and completing $150 million wells that made 20,000 barrels a day,” he said.

Hackney, who now lives in Shreveport, said that companies like Chevron don’t want to be the last in on a play, but “for a long time, you didn’t want to be the first until things start to get sorted out a little bit.”

“I’m guessing that everyone is saying, “Well, the way to get this [Smackover] lithium is in our wheelhouse and it looks to be a kind of clean process as far as just moving a lot of fluid through reservoirs and you know, it’s not the unsightly, stinky, dirty oilfield kind of stuff.”

US Geologic Survey estimates that 5 million to 19 million metric tons of lithium could be in the brines in the South Arkansas portion of the Smackover alone. Lithium content levels in East Texas brine tests have shown even higher amounts than some tested in Arkansas.

Chevron says it intends to use a process called direct lithium extraction or DLE, a process it says is “faster and more efficient production and is expected to have a smaller environmental footprint compared to traditional extraction methods.”

It appears that the lithium royalty question in Arkansas that was threatening to stall lithium extraction has been answered. On June 23, the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission approved a rate of 2.5% for ExxonMobil’s 56,000-acre Pine Unit in Lafayette and Miller counties in southwest Arkansas.

FEOC Definitions

""Prohibited Foreign Entity"" (PFE) includes both ""Specified Foreign Entities"" and ""Foreign-Influenced Entity""

generally determined on the last day of taxable year

except in the first taxable year after enactment, determined on the first day of the taxable year

""Specified Foreign Entity"" (SFE) is an entity that:

meets the definition as provided in Section 9901(6) of the William Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year (FY) 2021:

designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. Secretary of State under Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189)

included on the list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons maintained by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)

alleged by the U.S. Attorney General to have been involved in activities for which a conviction was obtained

is identified as a Chinese military company

is included on a list as a result of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act

is specified under Section 154(b) under the NDAA of FY 2024 (specifically, the entities listed in paragraphs 1-7 on page 47 of L. 118-31)

is a ""foreign controlled entity"" (the government of a covered nation, an agency or instrumentality, a person who is a citizen or national of a covered nation, an entity or business unit incorporated or organized or having its principal place of business in a covered nation, or any entity ""controlled"" by those described in this parenthetical) (where ""control"" = 50 percent vote or value of stock of corporation, or 50 percent capital interest or beneficial interests)

""Foreign Influenced Entity"" (FIE) is an entity, except for certain publicly traded companies, whereby:

an SFE has direct or indirect authority to appoint a covered officer (where ""covered officer"" = board of director, supervisor or equivalent, or executive officer or equivalent)

a single SFE owns at least 25 percent of such entity

one or more SFEs own, in aggregate, 40 percent or more of such entity

at least 40 percent of the debt is held in the aggregate by one or more SFEs

during the previous taxable year, made a payment to an SFE pursuant to a contract, agreement or other arrangement under which SFE has effective control (referred to as ""payment rule"")

Effective control means authority over key aspects of production of eligible components, energy generation or energy storage, which are not included in measures of control through authority, ownership or debt.

With respect to licensing agreement, this includes when such agreement allows SFE to source items (components, subcomponents, critical minerals), direct the operation, utilize intellectual property, receive royalties, etc. The only exception is for bona fide purchase of intellectual property.

""Material Assistance to a Prohibited Foreign Entity"" means:

requires consideration of ""material assistance cost ratio"" to determine if below ""threshold percentage""

Threshold percentages vary by year and technology but increase over time.

For Section 45Y and Section 48E, the ratio looks to total costs to the taxpayer for all ""manufactured products (including components)"" from PFEs.

For Section 45X, the ratio looks to the total direct materials costs for the production of the eligible component that are attributable to a PFE (applying Section 461 and regulations under Section 263A).

Safe harbor tables are available for certain facilities.

There are some exceptions for existing contracts.

There is a six-year statute of limitations on material assistance and increased tax penalties on taxpayer and suppliers making certifications.

""Covered Nation"" means North Korea, China, Russia and Iran.

""Covered Entity"" means an entity organized under laws or is otherwise subject to jurisdiction of a covered nation.

The most recent federal data shows more than 73,000 families in Wisconsin have taken advantage of the tax credits. However, those incentives would disappear as soon as the end of this year under the House budget bill and six months after a bill is passed in the Senate version introduced this week.

Republicans have taken aim at the expanded tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, which were intended to combat climate change, as they seek to pay for President Donald Trump’s $4.5 trillion tax cuts.

Kevin Kane, chief economist with Green Homeowners United, said the repeal will make it more difficult for middle- and low-income families to make home upgrades or install rooftop solar.

“I think there’s going to be a mad dash for people to try to use it,” Kane said.

Tax credits provide a dollar-for-dollar reduction on what people owe in federal taxes. Residents can claim 30 percent of the cost for heat pumps up to $2,000 each year and up to $1,200 each year for insulation, air sealing and ventilation. They can also claim 30 percent of the cost to install geothermal heating, solar panels and battery storage.

In Wisconsin, families claimed an average of more than $5,100 on clean energy investments like rooftop solar, according to the most recent federal data. On home improvements, they claimed an average of $761 on things like heat pumps, air conditioners and windows.

Angie Kochanski, director of business development at Arch Solar, said they’re expecting that the elimination of tax credits will dramatically shrink the market for residential solar installations.

“We’ll adjust. It’s going to be a new era, and there’s going to be a smaller market of buyers, and we’re all going to have to work a little bit harder,” Kochanski said.

Solar companies have already been facing a dip in residential solar installations, which declined 31 percent last year due in part to higher interest rates.

Arch Solar installed solar on about 240 homes in southeastern Wisconsin last year, and the company anticipates that number could grow to 300 homes this year as homeowners try to act before tax credits disappear.

Rooftop solar installations could drop by half next year

Cory Neeley, executive director of SolarShare Wisconsin Cooperative, said the repeal is a huge slap in the face for businesses that have been scaling up their operations.

“These companies are going to have a hard time planning for any additional work. They’re also just going to see a huge glut of solar panels on the market,” Neeley said. “Because this market existed, and then all of a sudden, there’s no demand for it.”

Under ideal circumstances, Kochanski added, contractors need around six to 10 weeks to obtain permits or approval from utilities to connect with the grid.

Energy data firm Ohm Analytics estimates residential solar installations could fall by half next year. Wisconsin labor and clean energy advocates have said repealing the tax credits could jeopardize thousands of jobs.

Kathy Kuntz, director of the Dane County Office of Energy and Climate Change, said it’s not the time to sit on the fence if residents and businesses are thinking about home energy upgrades.

She said installation of solar and energy efficient appliances helps reduce costs for homeowners and demand on the grid at a time when the nation has seen increased electricity demand from data centers.

“I’m just concerned that it’s the wrong moment to slow down the consumer and business investment in clean energy given what else is going on with the grid,” Kuntz said.

All Wisconsin Republicans in the U.S. House voted for the budget bill and its provisions to repeal tax credits. In a social media post Tuesday, Republican Rep. Tom Tiffany urged people to tell their senators not to “water down” the House bill.

“We must terminate the IRA and stop wasting taxpayer dollars on wind and solar subsidies,” Tiffany said.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Solar-Installation-Team-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 10:11:09.696036

Minnesota Passes $700 Bill For Infrastructure Projects

On June 9, the Minnesota Legislature passed a $700 million deal during a one-day special session.

The infrastructure bill is called a “bonding bill” because the state government issues bonds — i.e. borrows money — to pay for the projects. Sixty percent of both the House and Senate must vote “yes” to allow the state to issue bonds, so bonding bills require robust bipartisan support. This one passed 116-15 in the House and 57-10 in the Senate.

The bill distributes money across the state to a wide variety of projects. In some cases, the funding will go to a state agency, which has discretion over where exactly the money goes; in other cases, lawmakers directed money to a specific project.

The DFL-controlled Legislature passed a $2.6 billion infrastructure package in the 2023 session, including $1.5 billion in bonds. In 2020, lawmakers passed a $1.9 billion bonding bill.

Here are the biggest-ticket items:

$176 million to the Minnesota Public Facilities Agency to build, upgrade, and repair municipal water treatment plants.

$84 million to Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system, mostly for asset preservation; $24 million will go toward a new transportation center at Alexandria Technical and Community College.

$80 million to the Minnesota Department of Transportation, largely for road and bridge repairs.

$60 million to the University of Minnesota.

$67 million for a new Bureau of Criminal Apprehension headquarters in Mankato.

$55 million for a new 50-bed psychiatric facility on the campus of the Anoka Metro Regional Treatment Center.

$44 million to the Department of Natural Resources for asset preservation, accessibility, flood mitigation, and more at state parks.

$40 million for repairs and upgrades of state prisons.

$29 million to the Minnesota Housing Finance Authority, mostly for the rehabilitation of public housing.

$16 million to the Metropolitan Council, the vast majority for metro-area sewer work and $1 million for tree planting.

$13.7 million to the Minnesota Zoo, mostly for a new animal hospital.

$11.5 million for the Capitol complex, mostly to make one of the underground tunnels connecting the buildings compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The rest is for asset preservation and security improvements.

Meta Investing In 150MW Of Geothermal Energy In New Mexico

Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham announced last week that XGS Energy and Meta have entered into an agreement to develop 150 megawatts of advanced geothermal energy in the state of New Mexico.

The project will use XGS Energy’s proprietary technology to generate geothermal electricity without using operating water — critical in an arid state like New Mexico. The electricity will power Meta’s New Mexico data center operations and be delivered through the PNM electric grid. This project has the potential to increase geothermal generation in New Mexico tenfold, according to the press release from the governor’s office.

Meta, one of the world’s largest corporate clean energy buyers, sees geothermal as a key piece of its growing energy portfolio. “Advances in AI require continued energy to support infrastructure development,” said Urvi Parekh, Global Head of Energy at Meta. “With next-generation geothermal technologies like XGS ready for scale, geothermal can be a major player in supporting the advancement of technologies like AI as well as domestic data center development. We’re excited to partner with XGS to unlock a new category of energy supply for our operations in New Mexico.”

The two-phase project is expected to be fully operational by 2030, with the first phase launching on a smaller scale and the second expanding to full capacity. Both phases will be located in New Mexico, strengthening the state’s grid and helping meet its clean energy goals.

The announcement coincides with the release of a report, “The Future of Geothermal in New Mexico,” authored by Project InnerSpace, New Mexico Tech, and the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources. The report identifies over 160 gigawatts of untapped geothermal potential in the state.

In Dominican Republic, New MOU Puts $760M Toward Port of Caucedo

Global logistics provider DP World recently signed a $760 million Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the government of the Dominican Republic to expand the Port of Caucedo there and its Free Trade Zone. The MoU, signed with the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and MSMES (MICM), initiates negotiations that will raise Caucedo’s container handling capacity from 2.5 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) to approximately 3.1 million TEUs, while unlocking 225 hectares of development-ready land for the Free Trade Zone.

Caucedo serves as a transshipment and logistics hub in the region, and this expansion will enhance its role as a launchpad for global trade. DP World has operated in the Dominican Republic for more than 25 years and currently manages the marine terminal at the Port of Caucedo and the adjacent 86-hectare Free Trade Zone Park. Since 2003, the company has invested more than $700 million in its development, boosting capacity from 900,000 TEUs in 2003 to 2.5 million.

The new $760 million investment will be split evenly:

$380 million for the port, including the expansion of the quay and breakwater to accommodate next-generation vessels and general cargo operations, new ship-to-shore cranes, yard equipment, advanced surveillance systems and security infrastructure, and upgrades to gates, roads, and automation systems.

$380 million for the Free Trade Zone, including a new road network, utilities, a commercial and marketing center to attract global tenants, and pre-built storage units.

In Quebec, Urban Microbiome Network Project Will Be Living Lab

In the southwest region of Quebec, the city of Laval will be the location for the Urban Microbiome Network, an integrated project that seeks to sustainably balance and optimize the health of people, animals, and ecosystems. This project is set to operate in Carré Laval — a revitalization project within the city of Laval aimed at developing a low-carbon neighborhood . The Urban Microbiome Network is to be centered around a large regional park spanning nearly 22 hectares (more than 30 football fields).

The Urban Microbiome Network Project will be a hub of discovery toward the concept of “One Health,” emerging technologies, and innovative educational practices. Students, professionals, and emerging tech companies will collaborate there.

Located north of Montreal, Laval is positioned to become a key player in this field, in part to its dynamic agri-food sector, which offers a living lab to explore the links between human health, nutrition, and the environment. With the future 22-hectare regional park, Carré Laval becomes an ideal testing ground.

Génome Québec serves as the scientific and financial catalyst for the project. By supporting the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) — a technology for identifying invisible biodiversity — the organization builds links between research, civic engagement, and informed decision-making.

The Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS) leads the scientific component of the project, using an innovative approach focused on the urban microbiome. Led by Professor Philippe Constant of INRS (in collaboration with colleagues from INRS and Université Laval), the project will transform Carré Laval into a living lab, generating internationally comparable data on the effects of green infrastructure on human and environmental health.

The Urban Microbiome Network Project stems from the INRS–Ville de Laval Partnership Research Chair in Microbiome Engineering for Environmental and Agri-Food Applications.",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/incentives-infrastructure-update_icon.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 12:22:14.755625

According to the EIA, 97% of those wind subsidies came from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
Therefore, there is essentially no cap on the credits awarded for solar energy through the IRA.
According to these numbers, the wind and solar tax credits outweighed the tax deductions of oil and gas companies by a factor of 15 in FY 2024.
Conclusion The House has passed a bill that essentially phases out the IRA tax credits for wind and solar power over a short period.","The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), President Biden’s signature climate bill, passed solely by Democrats, contains lucrative, essentially uncapped subsidies for wind and solar-generated power. Under current law, the tax credits phase out over four years, starting in either 2032 or when the U.S. power sector’s greenhouse gas emissions fall to a quarter of their 2022 levels — whichever comes later. An essentially uncapped phase-out defies the original purpose of tax credits, which is to spur the advent of young industries. The wind and solar power industries are decades old and should be able to advance without continued support from lawmakers and American taxpayers. These industries supplied 15.6% of the electricity generated by central generating stations in 2024, surpassing coal generation for the first time, which accounted for 15.2% of that power in the same year. As such, solar and wind tax credits should be phased out much earlier, as they are in the House version of the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

Wind Energy Tax Credits

Wind energy is far from a modern innovation — it has been utilized for hundreds of years. The United States made an early push to establish a wind power sector in the 1970s, starting in places like California’s Altamont Pass. However, those early efforts eventually lost momentum. Today’s wind turbines are significantly more advanced than those of the past, thanks to state requirements and both federal and state-level incentives. These modern turbines are built with better materials, operate more efficiently, and come at a lower cost. Nonetheless, wind energy still faces a major limitation: it’s intermittent. When the wind isn’t blowing, alternative energy sources must step in — either through costly battery storage systems or conventional power plants fueled by coal, natural gas, or nuclear energy. These backup systems must be available nearly all the time and could operate as primary sources on their own, running up to 85% of the time or more.

Roughly half of U.S. states have laws mandating that a specific portion of their electricity come from renewable sources, such as wind and solar. On top of that, the federal government has provided substantial financial support to these industries. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that federal subsidies for wind power increased tenfold between fiscal years 2007 and 2010. During that same period, wind power production jumped by 175%, growing from just 0.8% of the national electricity mix in 2007 to 2.3% in 2010. However, achieving that growth required a significant investment — $5 billion in subsidies in fiscal year 2010 alone. That year, taxpayers spent $56 in subsidies for every megawatt hour of wind energy produced, compared to just 64 cents for electricity from coal or natural gas. According to the EIA, 97% of those wind subsidies came from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

From FY 2010 to FY 2013, wind subsidies climbed another 8%, and wind’s share of electricity generation rose to 4.1%. By FY 2016, wind energy received $1.27 billion in subsidies (adjusted to 2016 dollars), with most of that aid delivered through tax incentives. Even so, wind generated only 5.6% of the nation’s electricity, while coal and natural gas together provided 64%. The EIA’s most recent report shows that federal subsidies for wind energy more than quadrupled between FY 2016 and FY 2022, rising from $846 million to $3.59 billion (both figures in 2022 dollars).

Wind power comes with notable limitations. As previously noted, it only generates electricity when wind conditions are favorable, regardless of the current demand for electricity. This variability means wind has limited capacity value — it can’t be called upon reliably like coal or natural gas plants, which can be dispatched on demand. Despite this, wind energy often receives preferential grid access when available. This helps utilities meet state renewable mandates and allows wind operators to claim the federal Production Tax Credit (PTC), which compensates them simply for generating power, regardless of whether it’s needed at the time.

The PTC was first introduced in 1992 under the Energy Policy Act, offering a tax credit of 2.3 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced from wind for the first ten years of a facility’s operation. Though it was originally designed as a temporary support to help the industry grow, the credit has now been in place for over three decades. Since 1999, it has been extended more than a dozen times. According to estimates from the U.S. Treasury, the current form of the PTC will cost taxpayers $289.63 billion between fiscal years 2025 and 2034, making it the most costly energy subsidy currently in the tax code.

Although wind advocates claim that the technology is now competitive with conventional power sources, the industry continues to push for continued support through the IRA’s credits. However, these incentives have unintended consequences. One major issue is their impact on electricity markets. The PTC can cause wholesale electricity prices to fall below zero, forcing other generators to accept negative prices. Because taxpayers pay wind operators, they can still turn a profit even if they must pay the grid to accept their electricity. Negative pricing means that power producers are actually paying to stay online.

Negative wholesale prices typically signal oversupply, warning the market that generation exceeds demand and urging producers to scale back. But wind facilities are insulated from these signals because of government subsidies that reward them for producing energy no matter what. In effect, the federal government is tipping the scales, incentivizing electricity production whether it’s needed or not, distorting market dynamics and undermining more flexible and responsive power sources.

The PTC also distorts the true cost of electricity generation by shifting a significant portion of the financial burden onto taxpayers. Because wind is an intermittent resource — it doesn’t generate power continuously—it needs to be backed up by more reliable sources, typically coal or natural gas plants that can be ramped up when electricity demand rises and wind output falls. This redundancy means consumers effectively pay twice: once for the wind infrastructure and again for the conventional backup power that ensures the lights stay on when wind conditions aren’t favorable.

Adding to the challenge, wind output is often highest during times of low electricity demand, such as late at night or in the early morning hours. Yet, cost estimates for wind energy often exclude the expense of maintaining backup power sources or deploying large-scale battery systems — another costly solution made necessary by the inconsistent nature of wind and solar energy. Utility-scale batteries, while seen as a potential fix, are extremely expensive and wouldn’t be required if not for policies that subsidize and mandate intermittent renewables.

Wind power also faces other significant drawbacks beyond cost and reliability. Wind turbines generate noise, require vast areas of land, and pose a serious threat to wildlife, particularly birds of prey and bats that are killed by spinning blades. Moreover, the best wind resources are usually located in remote regions, far from population centers. Transmitting power from these distant sites to where it’s actually needed requires building out costly new infrastructure — transmission lines that ultimately show up on consumers’ utility bills.

The lifespan of a wind turbine is typically between 20 and 25 years, considerably shorter than fossil fuel or nuclear power plants, which can operate efficiently for 40 to 50 years. Decommissioning wind turbines presents its own environmental challenge, especially the disposal of their massive blades. These components are difficult to recycle and often end up in landfills, creating a growing waste management issue.

Solar Investment Tax Credit

The Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar energy provides a 30% tax credit on the investment in a qualifying solar facility, meaning that taxpayers literally purchase 30% of the capital cost of every solar array on roofs or in industrial solar farms. Because about 80% of U.S. solar panels originate overseas, U.S. taxpayers are contributing 24% of the cost of manufacturing solar panels overseas. The Solar ITC, initially introduced in 1978, was significantly enhanced in 2005 with an expiration date of 2007, which was later extended to 2016, accompanied by a clear phase-down path. It underwent 15 extensions, culminating in the IRA.

The EIA found that solar subsidies were $3.036 billion in FY 2016,doubling to $7.522 billion in fiscal year 2022, representing 33% of total renewable subsidies. The EIA found that federal subsidies and incentives to support renewable energy in FY 2022 totaled $15.6 billion — almost five times higher than those for fossil energy, which totaled $3.2 billion in subsidies. The subsidies in the EIA’s reports do not include state and local subsidies, mandates, or incentives that, in many cases, are quite substantial, especially for renewable energy sources. The EIA also did not include the massive subsidies authorized in the IRA.

In 2024, the Treasury estimated that the ITC would cost taxpayers $24.2 billion in FY 2024 and $131.44 billion between FY 2025 and FY 2034. As mentioned above, the IRA sunsets the ITC only after the U.S. electricity sector achieves a 75% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the 2022 baseline, which is unlikely to be achievable. Therefore, there is essentially no cap on the credits awarded for solar energy through the IRA. Solar energy has not benefited the U.S. power system because it has led to increased reliability problems and added costs, causing issues for the electric grid and threatening blackouts, as recently occurred in Spain when two large solar farms went offline.

Oil and Gas Tax Deductions

When discussions arise about whether to extend tax credits for wind and solar energy, environmentalists and some lawmakers often respond by citing “taxpayer subsidies to big oil companies” as justification. However, what is commonly referred to as subsidies for the oil industry are actually tax deductions — not credits — and they primarily benefit small, independent oil and natural gas producers, not the large, multinational firms typically labeled as “big oil.”

One of these deductions is available to all domestic manufacturers, not just those in the fossil fuel sector. The remaining deductions are standard business write-offs, similar to tax breaks for research and development that apply across various industries.

Two specific deductions that mainly support small producers are the percentage depletion allowance and the ability to expense intangible drilling costs. The percentage depletion allowance permits small oil and gas operators to deduct a portion of the value of extracted resources as the well is depleted. While this may sound complex, it functions similarly to asset depreciation in other industries, comparable to how a manufacturing facility’s value is gradually written down over time. This provision dates back to 1926 and was intended to reflect the diminishing value of a finite resource. Importantly, it has not applied to major oil companies since it was removed for them in 1975. This tax deduction was estimated to save independent oil and gas producers about $0.7 billion in fiscal year 2024.

Independent oil producers can also deduct certain expenses related to drilling and developing wells as part of their regular business operations. Specifically, the tax code allows these smaller producers to fully write off what’s known as intangible drilling costs — such as labor, site preparation, and survey work — each year. This provision is designed to incentivize continued exploration of new oil resources. Larger, integrated oil companies are treated differently under the tax code. While they are still allowed to deduct intangible drilling costs, they can only expense about one-third immediately and are required to spread the remaining deductions evenly over five years. This approach mirrors how other industries treat similar investments, like research and development, by allowing businesses to recover costs over time. This tax deduction was estimated to save independent oil and gas producers about $0.6 billion in fiscal year 2024.

Another tax deduction is the Domestic Manufacturing tax deduction, which allows all industries and businesses (not just oil companies) to deduct a certain percentage of their profits — it is 6% for the oil and gas industry and 9% for all other industries (software developers, video game developers, the motion picture industry, and green energy producers, among others).

Comparison of Major Tax Incentives

According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the production tax credit for wind was estimated to cost taxpayers $3.4 billion in FY 2024, the investment tax credit for solar was estimated to cost $15.9 billion, and the three tax deductions for oil and gas listed below combined were estimated to cost $1.3 billion. According to these numbers, the wind and solar tax credits outweighed the tax deductions of oil and gas companies by a factor of 15 in FY 2024. Furthermore, this comparison does not include the tax deductions that the wind and solar industries receive for depreciation and manufacturing, nor the benefits they derive from state mandates and subsidies.

When compared to the relative amounts of energy produced by each source, taxpayers are receiving little benefit from wind and solar energy, and a significant benefit from oil and natural gas. Almost all of our transportation is fueled by oil, and natural gas is the largest source for both heating homes and making the electricity that cools our homes, fuels our factories, schools, and hospitals, making modern life possible.

Conclusion

The House has passed a bill that essentially phases out the IRA tax credits for wind and solar power over a short period. The Senate is now debating the issue. The wind and solar industries want to keep the tax credits that were in the Democrat-passed IRA. The small tax benefits available to oil and gas producers pale in comparison to the vast sums of taxpayer money being handed to wind and solar generators. While the wind and solar industries receive lucrative subsidies from the IRA, the oil and gas industry receives tax deductions estimated to total approximately 6% of what wind and solar would receive. Yet, these energy forms provide very different benefits to Americans, including revenue to the government, employment opportunities, and energy contributions. Even after investing billions, the U.S. economy obtains less than 3% of its primary energy from wind and solar, compared to 74% from natural gas and oil. However you slice it, the wind and solar tax credits are a bad deal for taxpayers and consumers, as they have only escalated the cost of electricity, which increased for residential homeowners by 25% during the Biden administration.",https://www.americanenergyalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/bigstock-Money-Is-Falling-From-The-Sky-451548691.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 12:27:36.265629

These credits have incentivized corporations like Samsung, GM, Toyota, Stellantis, Entek and Nucor, to make major investments in Indiana for production of batteries, EV’s and utility structures and chargers.

Beyond manufacturing, if the tax credits are repealed, Indiana stands to lose dozens of solar projects totaling 21GW of capacity. These projects would drive millions in property tax revenues for local counties, reduce air pollution and rein in electricity costs, which are rising along with demand. It’s estimated a typical American family will spend $400 more annually on electricity if the credits are canceled.

Indiana and the U.S. cannot afford to let these projects slip away. Today, China dominates 60% or more of the world’s solar panel, wind turbine and EV production, so American companies are way too dependent upon technology and components from China. National security, our country’s economic leadership and the future of multiple American industries, including automotive, demand that we build our manufacturing muscle in these areas.

In accordance with President Trump’s Executive Order, Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy, DOE issued a Request for Application (RFA) and is seeking qualified U.S. reactor companies interested in constructing and operating their test reactors outside of the national laboratories using the DOE authorization process. Today’s action represents an important step toward streamlining nuclear reactor testing and ensuring at least three reactors achieve criticality by July 4, 2026.

“For too long, the federal government has stymied the development and deployment of advanced civil nuclear reactors in the United States,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, we are expediting the development of next-generation nuclear technologies and giving American innovators a new path forward to advance their designs, propelling our economic prosperity and bolstering our national security.”

President Trump is committed to re-establishing the United States as a global leader in nuclear energy and securing a reliable, diversified, and affordable energy supply to drive American prosperity and technological advancement. The new reactor pilot program will help to unleash American nuclear energy capabilities, support U.S. jobs and strengthen American innovation.

The pilot program builds on current efforts to demonstrate advanced reactors on DOE sites through microreactor testbeds and other projects led by the Department of Defense and private industry. It is specifically designed to foster research and development of nuclear reactors and not demonstrate reactors for commercial suitability. Seeking DOE authorization provided under the Atomic Energy Act will help unlock private funding and provide a fast-tracked approach to enable future commercial licensing activities for potential applicants.

The Slate Truck represents a bit of a throwback in an industry where pickups have grown into road-hogging behemoths.
If the $7,500 subsidy does hold up, drivers could walk away with a new Slate truck for less than $20,000.
Personally, I’ll be rooting for the Slate Truck for one simple reason.","Earlier this spring, in Venice, California, residents started noticing some odd new compact pickups and SUVs parked on the city’s main drag. It wasn’t the design that caught people off guard, but their unique liveries. One blue and pink pickup featured a custom wrap adorned with cartoonish crying babies, a giant, pacifier-shaped hood ornament, and most notably, a rooftop cargo rack toting three infant car seats. Branded as a CryShare fleet vehicle, the rear window featured a vinyl decal describing the (hopefully) fictitious company: “When Baby Drives You Crazy, We Drive Them To Sleep”.

Other odd autos included a broom-toting truck advertising a rather mystical service dubbed “Witch on Demand”, as well as a few rather macabre models like the tiger-stripped Rare and Raw Catering Company SUV (“Serving Up Exotic Animals and Wild Nights Since 2025”) and the decidedly creepy Taxiderm-My-Family truck, complete with some suspicious coolers and a roof-mounted biohazard barrel. While these services might be tempting for some sleep-deprived parents, Harry Potter fans, and paleo dieters, they’re all part of a publicity stunt intended to introduce the world to the Slate Truck.

Founded in 2022, Slate is an ambitious startup that’s looking to transform the EV segment with a new, budget-priced, all-electric pickup that could end up retailing for as little as $20,000. While other affordable EVs have hit the market in recent years, the nascent brand is taking an entirely new tack by providing a blank slate onto which drivers can paint their own automotive masterpiece. The Slate Truck is a no-frills pickup that allows drivers to personalize their ride with over 100 optional accessories to choose from, most of which can be easily installed by the average DIYer. Financed by deep-pocketed investors including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former CEO Jeff Wilke, Slate could be the EV brand that succeeds where many other startups have failed in recent years. Are drivers ready for this sort of Build-a-Bear approach to the EV segment, and is the company’s “radically simple, radically affordable” ethos all it promises to be? Let’s take a closer look at the Slate Truck and see if the Bezos bookmobile is a page-turner or a dime-store disappointment.

Build-a-Truck Workshop

When reviewing the industry’s newest vehicles, touching on every stat, feature, and option can be tough. The Slate Truck presents no such challenge. In this case, covering what the EV pickup doesn’t have might be easier. Stereo system? Nope. Radio? Good luck. Aside from the digital gauge cluster, the truck is totally screen-free, though it can accommodate a smartphone or tablet to fill the infotainment-shaped hole in its resume. The Slate Truck doesn’t even have power windows, which means it’ll be the only vehicle on the road with old-fashioned crank windows when it hits the market in 2027. The pickup does pack power locks, cruise control, and all the legally required safety features like airbags, a backup camera, and emergency braking, but tech-forward it is not.

This stark design might come as a surprise given the involvement of tech sector bigwigs like Bezos, but it’s all part of the automaker’s unique “Blank Slate” approach. Instead of loading the truck with a full suite of advanced features or providing a range of trims aimed at different sectors of the market, the Slate Truck allows drivers to create a one-of-a-kind ride with over 100 available accessories on offer. From a two-inch lift kit, one-inch lowering kit, power windows, and speakers to an infotainment system, roof rack, and more, the truck can be transformed into virtually anything, including an SUV. Slate gives drivers the opportunity to blur the line between the two segments with the SUV kit, adding a roof panel, rear bench seat, roll bar, and airbags that increase the seating capacity to five passengers. Best of all, the vehicle can be converted from truck to SUV and back again as many times as you like, or even transformed into an open-top SUV or fastback wagon.

The truck is also as gray as the Slate name implies, but just think of it as a blank canvas that’s simply awaiting a little inspiration. Slate will provide a wide range of vinyl wraps, which, in addition to helping reduce the truck’s total cost, give drivers the opportunity to express themselves with a singular exterior. The vinyl wrap can even be applied to the wheels when choosing the 17-inch steel option, which is sure to turn some heads when you hit the highway. Those who prefer a simpler approach can choose between so-called “starter packs” that essentially serve the same role as the typical trim ladder, but that sort misses the point of this whole automotive experiment. The new pickup is designed for the DIY crowd. Slate says that every upgrade, from the speakers to the long list of available wheels and even the SUV kit, can be installed by any driver who can figure out which way to turn a wrench thanks to helpful how-to videos provided by the brand’s Slate U content hub. An authorized service center can also install these accessories and kits, but no matter which route you take, all enhancements will be covered under the truck’s warranty.

Throwback, or Vision of the Future?

The Slate Truck represents a bit of a throwback in an industry where pickups have grown into road-hogging behemoths. Measuring 174 inches, the EV is reminiscent of the modest pickups that ruled the road in the mid-1980s. By today’s standards, it looks more like a typical compact crossover than a true pickup, and is around two inches shorter than Subaru’s compact Crosstrek. Cozy dimensions aside, the Slate Truck offers plenty of room where it counts, with a five-foot cargo bed that beats the Ford Maverick by six inches. The bed boasts a drain plug that allows the rear cargo to double as an impromptu cooler, and 35 cu.ft. of cargo volume, complemented by a front trunk that adds an extra seven cu.ft. to the mix.

The Slate Truck might not be the most powerful EV on the road, with a single rear-mounted 150kW electric motor that produces 201 hp and 195 lb-ft of torque. However, considering the low starting price and target audience, the pickup still seems to pack some value. The compact truck currently lacks an all-wheel drive option, so drivers will have to settle for a 1,000-lb towing capacity that, while pretty modest, is offset by the Slate Truck’s serviceable 1,433-lb payload capacity. That’s just around 70 lbs short of the Ford Maverick, though it all depends on which battery you choose. The truck will ship with a 53-kWh battery that Slate says will provide 150 miles of range, but the larger 84.3-kWh pack could increase that number to 240 miles at the cost of some payload.

Slated for Success

Customization potential aside, the Slate truck’s best selling point would have to be the price. The EV pickup is expected to retail for as little as $27,500, making Slate’s debut model the most affordable all-electric vehicle on the market. The Nissan LEAF S currently holds the record with an MSRP of just under $30,000, but the Slate truck could blow that number out of the water with a little help from the federal government. While EV buyers can still claim a $7,500 subsidy for certain models, ever-shifting trade and economic policies have left the future of the lucrative tax credit in doubt. If the $7,500 subsidy does hold up, drivers could walk away with a new Slate truck for less than $20,000. That sort of accessibility could go a long way towards stimulating the EV segment, which has experienced slower-than-expected growth in recent years as drivers increasingly turn to hybrid models.

Even with the $7,500 tax credit, Slate’s success is far from assured. While the brand brings a fresh new approach to the EV market with its “Blank Slate” ethos, it wouldn’t be the first to flounder before it gets off the ground. The EV segment has seen its fair share of fledgling brands that fail to take flight, with companies like Lordstown Motors, Canoo, and Fisker filing for bankruptcy in recent years. Even the segment’s relative success stories struggle to turn a profit, with brands like Lucid and Rivian posting consistent losses as they fight to carve out a place for themselves in the EV landscape.

What does Slate have going for it, and how does it expect to succeed in the competitive EV segment? Mega-rich investors certainly help, with Bezos, Hollywood bigwig Thomas Tull, Guggenheim Partners CEO Mark Walter, and others filling the brand’s coffers to the tune of more than $111 million, but two other key factors could spell success for the spunky Slate. The first would be the company’s made-in-the-USA approach, which should help shield it from the unpredictable tariffs currently rocking much of the auto market. While Slate will probably have to import some materials, especially those used to make the EV’s battery, focusing on domestic manufacturing and the brand’s Indiana-based plant could help Slate gain an edge as the current administration continues to advance its protectionist trade policies.

Slate’s other key advantages come down to its focus on customization. While producing any new vehicle from the ground up is a long, expensive process, much of the cost is tied to building the interior with cutting-edge gadgets, premium materials, and, surprisingly, the paint job itself. Investing in a production-level paint shop is not only pricey, it’s also one of the most heavily regulated parts of the vehicle manufacturing process. The Slate truck’s unpainted gray composite body panels allow drivers to opt for their own wraps and exterior flourishes, eliminating a considerable cost and helping the brand to slash the starting price. By creating a bare-bones pickup and letting customers invest in optional upgrades, Slate has drastically reduced production costs to create a value-packed EV that trades on its low price and customization potential.

Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained

The Slate Truck is bucking some well-established trends to bring something entirely new to the market, but are drivers ready? While the EV segment holds much promise, sales haven’t always kept up with expectations as buyers cite concerns around charging infrastructure, convenience, and cost. The Slate Truck seems to address the last issue, but only time will tell if the automaker’s outside-the-box approach will resonate with potential EV customers. It’s also hard to understate the importance of the current EV tax credit when it comes to the Slate Truck’s success. If the pickup can be had for less than $20,000, it’ll have a marked advantage by drastically improving accessibility to the all-electric segment. It’s a much harder sell without the subsidy. If the Slate Truck rings in closer to $30,000, plus the cost of additional accessories that make it feel less like an anonymous grey box on wheels, it might struggle in a market where much more capable, spacious, and powerful pickups can be had for a similar price. Personally, I’ll be rooting for the Slate Truck for one simple reason. If the Build-a-Car method gains traction, it could help put the power back in the hands of a driving public that’s become too accustomed to paying a high price for over-the-top models that aren’t tailored to their individual driving needs. The Slate Truck might not revolutionize the market alone, but it could represent the first chapter in an entirely new automotive story.",https://www.autoinfluence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Slate-Truck-charging.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 11:11:18.843600

The justices took up an appeal by the companies of a lower court's ruling rejecting their claims that the lawsuits belong in federal court because the parishes of Plaquemines and Cameron were suing over oil production activities undertaken to fulfill U.S. government refinery contracts during World War Two. Federal court is considered a friendlier venue for businesses in such litigation.

The justices are due to hear the case in their next term, which begins in October.

Paul Clement, a lawyer for Chevron, welcomed the court's decision to hear the dispute.

""Chevron is pleased that the Supreme Court has decided to grant review in these cases, and we look forward to presenting our arguments to the court,"" Clement said.

Beginning in 2013, six Louisiana parishes along the coast filed 42 lawsuits accusing the oil and gas companies of violating Louisiana's State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978, a state permitting law.

In the first of those to go to trial, a jury in April found that Chevron must pay Plaquemines Parish $744.6 million.

The appeal by the companies to the U.S. Supreme Court concerned the suit by Plaquemines and one by Cameron parish, both of which raised jurisdictional issues common to a subset of the 42 cases.

The various parishes accused the companies of damaging coastal marshlands through dredging and pipeline development and have sought billions of dollars in damages to fund land restoration and storm protection efforts to mitigate erosion.

The companies have long argued those cases have no business being in state court, a venue considered more favorable to plaintiffs. They pointed to the April verdict to underscore the stakes in the litigation in asking the Supreme Court to take up their appeal. The justices in 2023 declined to hear an appeal of an earlier ruling sending the cases back to state court on different grounds.

The latest appeal was based on a U.S. law that authorizes federal officers and contractors acting under them who are facing litigation in state court involving their official duties to move the matter to federal court, with the goal of avoiding local interests prejudicing the proceedings.

The companies said the cases belonged in federal court because the companies had federal contracts to supply the U.S. government with refined petroleum products during World War Two and produced oil to fulfill the contracts.

But the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld decisions by lower courts remanding the cases back to state court, saying the exploration and production activities at issue were unrelated to the companies' contracted refining operations.",https://www.bicmagazine.com/downloads/23961/download/Courtroom.jpeg?cb=8ed9fa55bda536ea8832f6d7528528bd&w=1200,N,,2025-06-20 11:11:39.625013

Fadli emphasized that the solar panel factory not only supports the national clean energy export agenda, but also marks a significant step in exploring the domestic potential of Indonesia’s new and renewable energy (NRE) industry.
He clarified that Indonesia’s clean electricity production will not be dedicated solely to exports.
He also highlighted that clean energy exports could go beyond solar power, with potential expansion into wind power and other renewable energy sources targeting countries beyond Singapore.
Private sector participation is expected to play a critical role in the clean energy export scheme.","A subsidiary of state-owned energy company PT Pertamina, PT Pertamina New & Renewable Energy (Pertamina NRE) has announced plan to build a solar panel manufacturing facility as part of Indonesia’s broader strategy to export clean electricity to Singapore.

“We will soon begin groundbreaking for a collaboration with one of the world’s tier-one solar manufacturing companies,” Fadli Rahman, Pertamina NRE Director for Strategic Planning and Business Development, told a press conference in Jakarta on Thursday, June 19, 2025.

Fadli emphasized that the solar panel factory not only supports the national clean energy export agenda, but also marks a significant step in exploring the domestic potential of Indonesia’s new and renewable energy (NRE) industry.

“We’re entering the sector as a developer, but for now, we’re starting from the manufacturing side,” he said.

Indonesia has set an ambitious target to export 3.4 gigawatts (GW) of clean electricity to Singapore by 2035, primarily sourced from solar power plants and supported by battery-based energy storage systems.

Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) Bahlil Lahadalia noted that the initial target of 3 GW stemmed from early discussions between Singapore’s Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto.

“The initial request was 3 GW, but the figure is expected to grow over time,” Bahlil said on June 13, 2025.

He clarified that Indonesia’s clean electricity production will not be dedicated solely to exports. A portion of the energy will serve domestic needs, particularly in green industrial sectors that rely on downstream processing.

“Not all of it will be exported − some will go to domestic consumption,” he said.

He also highlighted that clean energy exports could go beyond solar power, with potential expansion into wind power and other renewable energy sources targeting countries beyond Singapore.

“I’ve been negotiating with Singapore on the basis of mutual benefit. Once we reach a win-win point, we must remain open to opportunities,” he added.

Private sector participation is expected to play a critical role in the clean energy export scheme. However, the involvement of state electricity firm PT PLN as a power supplier remains uncertain.

The state Utilities Commission, which regulates rates and services for public utilities, already has pushed back the 2030 deadline — as the 2021 law allows — by at least four years.
The panel acknowledged last year it was ""no longer reasonable or executable"" for Duke Energy to meet the reduction standard by 2030.
They say the interim goal still holds an aspirational purpose and was something that Duke Energy had agreed in 2021 to meet.
Bill support came from the North Carolina Chamber and a manufacturers' group, in addition to Duke Energy.","North Carolina legislators finalized a bill Thursday that would eliminate an interim greenhouse gas reduction mandate set in a landmark 2021 law, while still directing regulators to aim to cancel out power plant carbon emissions in the state within the next 25 years.

With some bipartisan support, the state Senate voted to accept the House version that would repeal the 2021 law's requirement that electric regulators take ""all reasonable steps to achieve"" reducing carbon dioxide output 70% from 2005 levels by 2030. The law's directive to take similar steps to meet a carbon neutrality standard by 2050 would remain in place.

The bill's Republican supporters pushing the new measure say getting rid of the interim goal benefits ratepayers asked to pay for future electric-production construction and is more efficient for Duke Energy, the state's dominant electric utility.

The bill now goes to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, who can veto the measure, sign it or let it become law without his signature. Stein previously expressed concerns about the Senate version of the measure, worried that it could hurt electricity users and threaten the state's clean-energy economy. His office didn't immediately provide comment after Thursday's vote.

With over a dozen House and Senate Democrats voting for the final version, the chances that any Stein veto could be overridden are higher. Republicans in charge of the General Assembly are only one House seat shy of a veto-proof majority.

The bill also contains language that would help Duke Energy seek higher electric rates to cover financing costs to build nuclear or gas-powered plants incrementally, rather than wait until the project's end.

The 2021 greenhouse gas law marked a rare agreement on environmental issues by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Republican lawmakers.

At least 17 other states — most controlled by Democrats — have laws setting similar net-zero power plant emissions or 100% renewable energy targets, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. North Carolina and Virginia are the only ones from the Southeast.

The legislation came about as President Donald Trump's administration has proposed rolling back federal environmental and climate change policies, which critics say could boost pollution and threaten human health. Republicans are promoting them as ways to reduce the cost of living and boost the economy.

The state Utilities Commission, which regulates rates and services for public utilities, already has pushed back the 2030 deadline — as the 2021 law allows — by at least four years. The panel acknowledged last year it was ""no longer reasonable or executable"" for Duke Energy to meet the reduction standard by 2030.

Bill supporters say to meet the goal would require expensive types of alternate energy immediately. If the interim standard can be bypassed, GOP bill authors say, Duke Energy can assemble less expensive power sources now and moderate electricity rate increases necessary to reach the 2050 standard.

""Our residents shouldn't be saddled with higher power bills to satisfy arbitrary targets,"" Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said in a news release after the vote.

Citing an analysis performed by a state agency that represents consumers before the commission, GOP lawmakers say removing the interim goal would reduce by at least $13 billion what Duke Energy would have to spend — and pass on to customers — in the next 25 years.

Bill opponents question the savings figure given uncertainty in plant fuel prices, energy demand and construction costs. They say the interim goal still holds an aspirational purpose and was something that Duke Energy had agreed in 2021 to meet.

Provisions in the measure related to recouping plant construction expenses over time would reduce accumulated borrowing interest.

Environmental groups argue the financing option would benefit Duke Energy's bottom line on expensive projects even if they're never completed, and the bill broadly would prevent cleaner energy sources from coming online sooner. They also contend another bill section would shift costs to residential customers.

""This bill is bad for all North Carolinians, whether they're Duke Energy customers or simply people who want to breathe clean air,"" North Carolina Sierra Club director Chris Herndon said after the vote while urging Stein to veto the measure.

Bill support came from the North Carolina Chamber and a manufacturers' group, in addition to Duke Energy.

""We appreciate bipartisan efforts by policymakers to keep costs as low as possible for customers and enable the always-on energy resources our communities need,"" the company said this week.",https://wfdd-live.s3.amazonaws.com/styles/featured_card/s3/2025-06/AP25170680520513.jpg?h=cfd4cd81&itok=0-HbDp2H,N,,2025-06-20 11:11:01.535231

The leaders of Hull City Council and East Riding Council have warned that thousands of jobs in the renewable energy sector could be at risk – including hundreds locally – without urgent Government backing.

In a joint letter addressed to Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds and Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander, Councillor Mike Ross and Councillor Anne Handley have stressed the need for strong central Government support for Vivergo Fuels.

The future of the Vivergo plant, based at Saltend Chemicals Park, on the outskirts of Hull, is at imminent risk as a result of the recent UK-US trade deal.

In their letter, the council leaders have outlined the wider impact closure of Vivergo Fuels could have on the region, and how it also raises questions about the Government’s commitment to green energy and its policies to support it.

Cllr Ross said: “Not only is Vivergo Fuels the UK’s largest bioethanol producer, with a crucial role to play in UK transport decarbonisation, but it’s also a strategically important anchor employer in the region.

“It supports over 160 skilled jobs directly and around 4,000 more in the supply chain, the majority of which are based in our Hull and East Riding region.

“The Humber has gained a deserved reputation as a beacon for renewable energy development and production, and we are working extremely hard to attract further investment to the region in emerging technologies, such as hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel.

“This would be immeasurably harder to do if regulatory and financial support are not forthcoming for this business, which has already seen over £700m of private sector investment since 2012.

“The Government’s new UK-USA trade deal has deliberately moved the commercial goalposts, damaging a UK business which invests in the UK and employs UK workers, whilst advantaging American businesses who produce their product overseas.

“Allowing closure of the Vivergo Fuels plant would send a hugely damaging signal to clean energy investors and to any businesses who are considering investing in this region and across the UK.

“The Government has identified clean energy as one of its priority industries and states that its number one focus is encouraging growth, so we now need to see that rhetoric matched with concrete actions and support.

“On behalf of Hull City Council and East Riding of Yorkshire Council, I urge you to act swiftly to secure the necessary support for this business which is of great significance to the residents of our authority and many across our wider region.”

Ben Hackett, managing director of Vivergo Fuels, added: “Vivergo Fuels is a fantastic asset to Hull and East Yorkshire. Not only do we employ a highly skilled workforce and support thousands more jobs in the supply chain, we are a catalyst for further green industrial development and investment which would allow the fuels of the future to be pioneered right here on the Humber.

“We are simply asking the Government for measures that will allow UK ethanol producers to remain competitive in the face of US imports, which benefit from a range of advantages from genetically modified crops to cheaper energy costs.

“We now need to see concrete commitments from ministers in the coming days to safeguard jobs, and protect against the loss of significant investment in the people of this region.”",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eb0828c5ab0a73ac072de78/5eb7de33257cac76592f068b/6855562f7bbf9150445e4ff0/1750423675493/P2+LEAD.+Vivergo+Fuels+at+Saltend+Chemicals+Park.jpg?format=1500w,N,,2025-06-20 13:14:50.544832

Competing versions of the incentive rollback in the House and Senate are now up for negotiation, with the House version offering to continue the credit for smaller EV and PHEV makers through the end of 2026 while cutting off bigger ones at the end of this year. The provisions are part of proposals for Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget bill.

The Senate version, released from the Finance Committee on June 16, treats all automakers the same by ending the EV tax credit within 180 days of the bill’s passage. That proposal would also cut the EV leasing credit immediately for vehicles that don’t meet local content rules and in 180 days for those that do.

Sun setting on incentives?

A $7,500 incentive would end this year for automakers that reach a quota of 200,000 electric vehicles or plug-in hybrids sold since 2010 under a House Republican proposal for the Trump administration’s budget bill. Those under the cap remain eligible through 2026. S&P Global Mobility registration data from January 2015 to April 2025 gives a rough idea of where automakers stand.

The Senate text suggests that the chamber is taking an even harder line than the House bill passed May 22 in eliminating Biden-era incentives for EVs. The Senate proposal would also end a $4,000 used-vehicle EV tax credit after 90 days.

“I think the Senate version is worse, totally cold turkey, and the lease thing is so important,” said Mike Murphy, a Republican political consultant and CEO of the American EV Jobs Alliance, a pro-EV lobbying group. “Bottom line is the Senate is really trying to put a stake in the heart of EV subsidies.”

While both rollback plans will likely reduce consumer demand and automaker investments by also phasing out credits for battery production, the House version gives some automakers more time to build on their modest EV sales, analysts say.

Sign up for the weekly Automotive News Mobility Report newsletter for the latest developments at the intersection of transportation and technology.

The House proposal does that by returning to the quota-based program from 2010 to 2022 that phased out the credits once an automaker reached sales of 200,000 electric models, including battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.

With the proposed revival of that mechanism, automakers exceeding that threshold would lose access to the credit Dec. 31 while those still under the cap would have until the end of 2026. The result could be a short-term rush by consumers to take advantage of the tax break, followed by a decline in demand.

“Although some brands may have a longer runway with the House’s proposal for discontinuing the EV credits, the cap would eliminate EVs from many of the industry’s most popular brands,” said Brent Gruber, executive director at J.D. Power’s EV practice. “The Senate’s version may spur EV sales in the short term, but it, like the House’s version, ultimately may jeopardize EV adoption.”

Reversing tax credit policy

The current tax credit, signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, doesn’t use quotas. It does impose North American content rules and battery-material requirements, but leased EVs get the credit without having to comply with those rules.

EV makers already exceeding 200,000 in U.S. registrations include Tesla, General Motors, Ford Motor Co., Hyundai, Volkswagen, BMW and Stellantis, according to data from S&P Global Mobility that covers the period from January 2015 to April 2025.

EV makers who are safely under the quota include startups Rivian Automotive and Lucid Motors, electric vehicle latecomers Honda and Subaru, low-volume brands such as Mazda and Mitsubishi, and sports car manufacturers including Porsche, McLaren and Maserati.

The registration data from S&P Global Mobility does not include the years 2010 to 2014 when EV and plug-in hybrid sales were still relatively modest. Ultimately, it would be up to the IRS to determine which automakers would get cut off at the end of this year and which would still be eligible in 2026, analysts said.

Also, the House and Senate could negotiate a different set of rules from their original proposals for the EV credit phaseout.

Automakers’ viewpoints

In response to questions from Automotive News, Mercedes-Benz said its cumulative EV and PHEV sales in the U.S. were approaching 150,000 as of mid-June. Mercedes said interest in “sustainable mobility” remains strong, and it will offer a variety of powertrains to meet consumer needs.

“The pace of transformation is determined by market conditions and the needs of our customers,” Mercedes said. “Into the 2030s, we can flexibly offer vehicles with both fully electric drivetrains and electrified high-tech combustion engines.”

Mercedes said it supports “a more orderly phase out of the existing federal EV incentives,” a stance shared by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents most automakers selling vehicles in the U.S.

According to J.D. Power survey data, a majority of EV buyers cited tax credits and incentives as a key reason for purchasing a new electric vehicle in 2024 and this year.

“For customers of Honda and Volkswagen, on average, the tax credit was the No. 1 purchase reason. For brands like Tesla, Cadillac and Chevrolet, among others, tax credits were amid the top three most influential purchase reasons,” Gruber said.

Nissan, an EV pioneer with the Leaf hatchback in 2010, said EV adoption will continue to grow despite the loss of the federal tax credit.

“We anticipate continued growth in the EV market, driven by strong demand and the many benefits that EVs provide,” Nissan said. “However, we acknowledge that the pace of growth may slow compared to earlier projections.”

In addition to targeting the consumer EV tax credit, the Trump administration has taken steps to roll back federal emissions standards and withhold funding for a nationwide charging network.

“If tax credits are abolished, the price competitiveness of BEVs and PHEVs relative to internal combustion engine vehicles is generally expected to decline,” Mazda said.

BMW said that a change in the tax credits wouldn’t affect its strategy of offering different powertrains for different consumer needs.

“From the start, BMW’s strategic approach has been one of ‘technology openness,’ where we offer our customers the ability to choose the vehicle that best suits their lifestyle — whether that be a highly efficient internal combustion vehicle, plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, or battery electric vehicle,"" the automaker said.

Toyota, which has focused on hybrids over fully electric vehicles, said the loss of the EV and PHEV tax credits would not have a significant impact on its business.

“While there may be a small impact on leases in the short term, the impact to our business will not be substantial,” Toyota said. “We feel a strong, competitive product with a more robust national charging infrastructure will drive sales when consumers are ready to purchase a BEV.”

Some EV fans expect sales to suffer without the tax credit but mostly on lower-cost electric vehicles where the credit allows monthly payments similar to gasoline vehicles and hybrids. Some buyers will still prefer EVs even at a higher price.

“I don’t want to say the tax credit had no impact. Clearly it did,” said Loren McDonald, chief analyst at EV consultancy Paren. “But I’ve always believed that it was 10 percent, 20 percent maximum of the market where it actually converted people to EVs.”

Some EV skeptics welcome the return to a more level playing field where consumers, not government regulations, drive the auto business.

“Once the smoke clears and the incentives clear, I think you’ll see a pullback from how much the automakers are investing in this technology and the number of consumers who are buying EVs,” said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars. He said EVs have advantages in refinement, but range and charging limit their appeal.

“I believe that financial viability is supposed to be a cornerstone of capitalism, which is supposed to be the cornerstone of the U.S. economy,” Brauer said. “You shouldn’t have cars that are drastically losing money with no real long-term horizon on when they’re going to be profitable.”

The cars were declared at 2.77 million rupees ($31,988) and attracted more than 2.1 million rupees in import duties — a levy that’s consistent with India’s 70% tariff on fully-built imported cars under $40,000 plus surcharges, the documents show.

The model is expected to go on sale for more than $56,000 before taxes and insurance, though Tesla will determine the final sticker price based on its margin and positioning strategy, according to people familiar with the plans.

That compares with an ex-showroom price of $44,990 for the same model in the US, which sells for $37,490 once tax credits are applied.

The premium price tag will likely be a major hurdle to Tesla’s plans as the automaker will need to convince value-driven consumers to open their wallets. EVs account for just over 5% of new passenger vehicle sales in India, but premium cars still represent less than 2% of the market, data with Indian government’s vehicle registration portal show.

Beefing Up

The company hasn’t appointed a new country head following the departure of Prashanth Menon, but is beefing up hiring across charging, retail and policy teams, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Model Y imports represent an initial foray into the market and Tesla plans to expand its presence, including offering more models.

It’s leasing warehouse space in Karnataka, in India’s south, and is adding more in Gurugram, outside New Delhi, the people said.

Tesla executives from other countries are making weekly visits, the people said, to the Mumbai and New Delhi showrooms, which are in high-profile, luxury business precincts in an effort to attract affluent shoppers.

Cllr Ross outlined the wider impact closure of Vivergo Fuels could have on the region and how it also raises questions about the government’s commitment to green energy and its policies to support it.
In the letter, Cllr Ross said: “Not only is Vivergo Fuels the UK’s largest bioethanol producer, with a crucial role to play in UK transport decarbonisation, but it’s also a strategically important anchor employer in the region.
“The Humber has gained a deserved reputation as a beacon for renewable energy development and production and we are working extremely hard to attract further investment to the region in emerging technologies.
“Allowing closure of the Vivergo Fuels plant would send a hugely damaging signal to clean energy investors and to any businesses who are considering investing in this region and across the UK.","Cllr Mike Ross, leader of Hull City Council, has warned that thousands of jobs in the renewable energy sector could be at risk, including hundreds locally, without urgent government backing.

In a joint letter with Cllr Anne Handley, leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, addressed to secretary of state for business and trade, Jonathan Reynolds MP, as well as Heidi Alexander MP, secretary of state for transport, Cllr Ross stressed the need for strong central government support for Vivergo Fuels ahead of next week’s launch of the national Industrial Strategy.

He stated that the future of the Vivergo plant, based at Saltend Chemicals Park, is at imminent risk as a result of the recent UK-US trade deal and poor regulation.

Cllr Ross outlined the wider impact closure of Vivergo Fuels could have on the region and how it also raises questions about the government’s commitment to green energy and its policies to support it.

In the letter, Cllr Ross said: “Not only is Vivergo Fuels the UK’s largest bioethanol producer, with a crucial role to play in UK transport decarbonisation, but it’s also a strategically important anchor employer in the region.

“It supports over 160 skilled jobs directly and around 4,000 more in the supply chain, the majority of which are based in our Hull and East Riding region.

“The Humber has gained a deserved reputation as a beacon for renewable energy development and production and we are working extremely hard to attract further investment to the region in emerging technologies. such as hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel.

“This would be immeasurably harder to do if regulatory and financial support are not forthcoming for this business, which has already seen over £700m of private sector investment since 2012.

“The Government’s new UK-USA trade deal has deliberately moved the commercial goalposts, damaging a UK business, which invests in the UK and employs UK workers, whilst advantaging American businesses who produce their product overseas.

“Allowing closure of the Vivergo Fuels plant would send a hugely damaging signal to clean energy investors and to any businesses who are considering investing in this region and across the UK.

“The government has identified clean energy as one of its priority industries and states that its number one focus is encouraging growth, so we now need to see that rhetoric matched with concrete actions and support.

“On behalf of Hull City Council and East Riding of Yorkshire Council, I urge you to act swiftly to secure the necessary support for this business which is of great significance to the residents of our authority and many across our wider region.”

Ben Hackett, managing director of Vivergo Fuels, added: “Vivergo Fuels is a fantastic asset to Hull and East Yorkshire. Not only do we employ a highly skilled workforce and support thousands more jobs in the supply chain, we are a catalyst for further green industrial development and investment which would allow the fuels of the future to be pioneered right here on the Humber.

“We are simply asking the government for measures that will allow UK ethanol producers to remain competitive in the face of US imports, which benefit from a range of advantages from genetically modified crops to cheaper energy costs.

“We now need to see concrete commitments from ministers in the coming days to safeguard jobs, and protect against the loss of significant investment in the people of this region.”",https://news.hull.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/guildhall_ross-e1655900108632.webp,N,,2025-06-20 12:22:27.952819

The Financial Times reports that, under the new guidance, “ministers will consider the economic benefits of North Sea oil and gas projects along with carbon ‘removal’ activities when deciding whether to grant consents”.
The Scotsman reports that “the oil and gas industry has welcomed the consent process being restarted by the UK government”.
The Daily Express covers the news under the headline ”Ed Miliband U-turns on drilling of North Sea – despite branding idea ‘climate vandalism’”.
Failure to do so would infuriate the GMB union, which is concerned that thousands of jobs could be lost in the North Sea.","The UK government has published its “long-awaited environmental guidance” on how “scope 3 emissions” – the downstream emissions from the use of oil and gas – should be treated in future government decisions to approve oil and gas drilling projects, reports Reuters. The newswire quotes a statement by energy minister Michael Shanks, who says the guidance “marks a step forward in ensuring the full implications of oil and gas extraction are considered for potential projects and that we ensure a managed, prosperous and orderly transition to the North Sea’s clean-energy future, in line with the science”. The Financial Times reports that, under the new guidance, “ministers will consider the economic benefits of North Sea oil and gas projects along with carbon ‘removal’ activities when deciding whether to grant consents”. It adds: “The language could be helpful to two vast oil and gasfields being developed by Shell and Equinor whose consents were quashed last year because downstream emissions had not been considered…Shell and Equinor are now expected to reapply for consents for their respective Jackdaw and Rosebank projects in the wake of the fresh guidance, which sets out how oil and gas companies should write environmental impact assessments when submitting applications.” BusinessGreen says the “move will prove highly controversial with climate campaigners, who will argue it could be interpreted as a breach of Labour’s manifesto pledge not to issue any new oil and gas drilling licenses”. The Press Association quotes Tessa Khan, executive director of Uplift, who says: “The new rules mean that oil and gas companies will finally be forced to come clean over the enormous harm they are causing to the climate.” The Times calls the news a “boost for North Sea drilling”, adding that “Ed Miliband has moved to unblock the development of two controversial new North Sea oil and gas fields, setting out new criteria under which the projects can be approved”. BBC News says the guidance was “drawn up in response to a landmark Supreme Court ruling last year, that Surrey County Council should have considered the full climate impact of burning oil from new wells”. The Scotsman reports that “the oil and gas industry has welcomed the consent process being restarted by the UK government”. The Daily Express covers the news under the headline ”Ed Miliband U-turns on drilling of North Sea – despite branding idea ‘climate vandalism’”. MailOnline has a similar headline, while the Daily Telegraph says: “Miliband opens door to North Sea drilling.” Meanwhile, the Times asks: “Is eco-warrior Ed Miliband destined to turn on the taps of North Sea oil?” The newspaper says: “The government insists it is too early to say how Miliband will rule and all decisions will be made on a ‘case-by-case basis’ – but the politics suggest that a way will be found to give them the go-ahead. Failure to do so would infuriate the GMB union, which is concerned that thousands of jobs could be lost in the North Sea. A green light would have a significant climate change impact. Rosebank would release an estimated 129m tonnes of CO2 over its lifetime, Simon Evans of the website Carbon Brief has calculated. Green group Uplift estimates that Jackdaw would add a further 32m tonnes. UK emissions last year were the equivalent of 384.2m tonnes of CO2.” The newspaper adds that “environmental groups such as Uplift and Greenpeace could also launch legal challenges based on how Miliband has interpreted the new guidance written by his department”.

Separately, Desmog reports that chancellor Rachel Reeves “told a fossil-fuel giant that the industry would receive a ‘quid pro quo’ in return for higher taxes on its windfall profits”. The piece, co-published with the Guardian, continues: “In a meeting with the Norwegian state energy company Equinor on 27 August last year, Reeves suggested that the government’s carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) subsidies were a payoff for oil firms being hit with a higher tax rate.” Meanwhile, a Scotsman “exclusive” says that opening up the North Sea oil field to drilling could cause the UK government to miss out on more than £250m in tax revenue. Elsewhere, the Daily Telegraph reports that the “Crown Estate is to build giant floating wind farms off the coasts of Wales and south-west England”. The Press Association reports that Jo Stevens, the secretary of state for Wales, says that “new floating windfarms, set to be among the biggest in the world, will create thousands of jobs and power millions of homes”. BBC News quotes Stevens, who says the wind farms will have a “positive impact for generations to come”.

Heavy rainfall fuelled by Typhoon Wutip has caused the “worst flood in a century” in China’s southern province of Guangdong, with the Sui river in the Huaiji county swelling to “over five metres above the official danger level…the highest on record”, reports state broadcaster CGTN. Local authorities have declared a “top-level emergency” as economic losses from the floods are estimated at $5.7m, the outlet adds. The National Development and Reform Commission has allocated $8m towards flood relief in Guangdong, according to state news agency Xinhua. The Guangdong power company is “rushing to restore power” as “rising temperatures” were expected from 19 to 22 June, says financial news outlet Jiemian. Many regions in the central Hunan province also face “record-breaking” rainfalls, reports state-supporting newspaper Global Times.

Meanwhile, Huang Runqiu, the head of China’s Ministry of Economy and Environment, met the UK’s energy secretary Ed Miliband earlier this week in London to discuss the “multilateral process of climate governance, respective policies on addressing climate change, and the next steps of climate cooperation”, reports Jiemian News. It was the “first China-UK Environment Ministers’ Dialogue”, according to the outlet, adding: “The two sides agreed to deepen exchanges through the ministerial dialogue mechanism on climate change, strengthen dialogue and cooperation in the fields of climate change adaptation, carbon market construction, climate investment and financing, and methane emission control, and jointly promote the multilateral process of climate governance.”

Elsewhere, China’s “green-energy” partnership with the EU is “expanding with unprecedented scope and depth”, according to Xinhua. Reuters publishes an article under the title: “China floods Brazil with cheap EVs triggering backlash.” The “self-discipline measures” adopted by China’s solar industry six months ago to “rein in rampant overproduction” were “doomed from the start” due to companies’ “deeply fragmented and fiercely competitive” nature, Bloomberg reports. Japanese news outlet Nikkei Asia publishes an article under the headline: “Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ threatens to pull [the] plug on China solar players.”

Finally, Dialogue Earth explains why “betting on gas is a short-sighted strategy for China”, which has sought to promote the fuel as a “clean alternative to coal”. An analysis in Nikkei Asia says that China is “rushing to tamp down fears of an abrupt end” to its $42bn subsidy programme after several cities “suspended or downsized” their plans earlier than expected amid reports of “alleged misuse of the programme”. Bloomberg has a podcast with Lauri Myllyvirta, co-founder of the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, talking about whether China’s carbon emissions have “finally peaked”, citing analysis he first published in Carbon Brief.

The “dangerous” 32C heat forecast in England for Saturday “will have been made 100 times more likely by the climate crisis”, according to new analysis covered by the Guardian. The newspaper continues: “Global heating, caused by the burning of fossil fuels, is making every heatwave more likely and more intense. The 32C day forecast on Saturday would have been expected only once every 2,500 years without the climate crisis, the researchers said, and June heatwaves are now about 2-4C hotter than in the past. The heat is expected to cause premature deaths, particularly among older and vulnerable people.” The Press Association says the rapid study by the World Weather Attribution group “also found the current heatwave in the south-east of England was around 10 times more likely than without human activity warming the planet”. The Daily Mail also covers the analysis.

Separately, BBC News says that temperatures of 32.2C have been recorded in Kew and Heathrow, London. It continues: “[The temperature is] higher than the previous record for 2025 of 29.4C in Suffolk on 13 June. Suffolk became the first place in the UK to officially enter a heatwave on Thursday after temperatures passed 27C for the third day in a row…The heat is expected to build towards a high of 33C on Saturday, with central and eastern England seeing the peak temperatures.” Sky News reports that the hottest day of the year could be recorded today, for the second day in a row, according to the Met Office. The Independent reports that the UK Health Security Agency have ”issued an amber heat-health alert, warning that a rise in deaths is likely”. The Guardian says the alerts came into force at midday on Thursday and were “expected to remain in force until 9am on Monday”. It also carries a warning from the Met Office that the UK could “exceed temperatures of 40C in the near future, and highs of 45C “may be possible” in the current climate”. The Independent says: “Firefighters have issued a warning over wildfires in London after two blazes broke out on green spaces in the capital in the past 24 hours.” Bloomberg warns that the UK could see “tropical nights” in which nighttime temperatures stay above 20C. This is a “threshold beyond which many people report trouble sleeping”, according to the outlet. The Press Association says: “The heatwave is piling more pressure on farmers who were already struggling to produce food in the face of the very dry conditions.” The Guardian covers analysis from the Department for Education which finds that “children in England face prolonged ‘lost learning’ caused by extreme heat and flooding at school”. MailOnline says that, according to the analysis, “learning can be ‘very difficult’ due to the ‘one or two days’ per year when indoor temperatures reach 35C”. It continues: “And even on just averagely warm days, the heat could be causing pupils to currently lose seven days of learning per year, it said.” Separately, MailOnline says “doctors are demanding the right to go on ‘heat strike’ as temperatures are set to soar to 33C over the next few days”. The Financial Times says that, according to the Met Office, “the country had a 50-50 chance of a 40C day in the next 12 years, after that threshold was broken for the first time in 2022”.

In other news of extreme heat, the Associated Press reports that a “heat dome” is set to bring “extreme heat and humidity” to more than 200 million people across the US. The outlet says: “Temperatures are forecast to exceed [32.2C] for around 220 million people across the country. Temperatures may reach or exceed [37.7C] for an additional 35 million people next week, including those living in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic.”

Hurricane Erick hit the Pacific coast of Mexico as a “powerful category 3 storm” yesterday, BBC News reports. According to the outlet, the storm dropped to a category 1 shortly after making landfall. It continues: “The US National Hurricane Centre warned of a potential for ‘life-threatening’ storm surge in the hurricane’s wake and Mexico’s environment ministry also warned of waves of up to 10m (33ft)…State-owned utility CFE said that more than 120,000 users lost power in Oaxaca, with service restored to a quarter of those affected by late morning.” The Associated Press reports that at least one death from the flooding was confirmed yesterday. Separately, the Associated Press says the storm “threaded the needle between the resorts of Acapulco and Puerto Escondido, tearing into a sparsely populated stretch of coastline near the border of Oaxaca and Guerrero states”. Forbes says: “Stronger hurricanes are typically not expected until later in the season. However, the sea surface temperatures, wind shear patterns, and moisture have been optimal for Erick’s intensification.” The Associated Press reports that the hurricane “on Wednesday chugged through the ideal environment to power up quickly as it approached Mexico’s southern Pacific Coast”. The newswire notes that the storm intensified rapidly, pointing to climate change as a “likely contributor”. CNN reports that Erick is the “strongest [storm] to hit Mexico so early in the year”. Al Jazeera and the New York Times also cover the news.

In other extreme weather news, the Associated Press reports that South Africa “was under a declared state of national disaster on Thursday as the death toll from floods caused by severe rains in the Eastern Cape region rose to 92”.

The UK’s “long-awaited industrial strategy due to be unveiled next week” will outline plans for UK manufacturing to “receive support to ease energy costs”, the Guardian reports. The newspaper continues: “Energy-intensive industries have long complained that they pay too much for electricity compared with competitors in the EU…Ministers have drawn up plans to take aim at energy costs through two policies, one targeted at businesses that use the most electricity – such as steel and aluminium – and another designed to support manufacturing more broadly.” However, it adds: “Energy costs are likely to remain significantly higher than in Germany and France, chiefly because UK electricity prices are linked to the cost of wholesale gas, which is a larger part of the British energy mix than on the continent.” Sky News reports that industrial electricity prices in the UK are currently the highest in the G7 and 46% above the average for the 32 member states of the International Energy Agency. Politico says: “Less than 400 businesses in sectors including steel, ceramics and chemicals currently receive a 60% rebate on energy bills under the so-called British Industry Supercharger. According to one of the people briefed on the government’s plans, the number of businesses that could be eligible may double or triple. At the same time, the support available could increase to 80-90%.” The Financial Times says that eight sectors would be covered by the new industrial strategy – “advanced manufacturing, clean energy, creative industries, defence, digital and technologies, financial services, life sciences, and professional and business services”. The Times says the government is also launching a consultation into extending subsidies power to “other key growth sectors such as AI databases and advanced manufacturing”. It continues: “This would mean firms being exempt from paying towards the costs of the government’s renewable energy policies – bringing the UK into line with others that largely fund the upfront costs of transitioning to net-zero through general taxation.” Meanwhile, BusinessGreen reports that the UK will host four new green manufacturing research and development hubs “following the award of £44m in funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council”.

Separately, Bloomberg reports that the government has published its infrastructure strategy, which outlines plans to spend at least £725bn on the country’s infrastructure over the next 10 years. The outlet says that at least £9bn per year will be committed to “critical maintenance of schools, hospitals, prisons and courts”. BusinessGreen says the “much-anticipated” strategy is “underpinned by plans to deliver a clean power system by 2030, decarbonise heavy industry, and rejuvenate nature in line with environmental goals”. It continues: “The document pulls together a range of previous and upcoming sectoral plans, such as the government’s aim to deliver a clean power system by 2030, improve the nation’s resilience to worsening climate impacts and fix creaking water infrastructure up and down the country.”

Meanwhile, BBC News reports that “Northern Ireland’s first draft Climate Action Plan has been published for consultation”. The outlet says the plan sets out how Northern Ireland will meet its target of cutting emissions by 33% by 2023-37, compared to 1990 levels. Separately, BBC News reports that Scotland has unveiled a new set of climate targets. It says: “Annual targets were abandoned by Scottish ministers last year after they were repeatedly missed but the pledge to reach net-zero by 2045 was retained. The new target states emissions need to fall by an average of 57% over the next five years and by 69% by 2035, when compared with 1990 levels. The targets will be met using a carbon budgeting system and the proposals will be voted on by MSPs in the autumn.”

Laurence Tubiana, veteran climate negotiator and CEO of the European Climate Foundation (which funds Carbon Brief), writes in Time that 2025 has seen a “spate of mostly unreported warnings from leading insurance companies…all with equally bleak messages.” She lists warnings from insurance companies, including Aviva and MunichRE, arguing that “when insurers are this vocal, we really ought to take notice”. She continues: “The risks are very real, as are the costs. Often I hear: if only we had a plan. In truth, we already have a plan: it’s called the Paris Agreement, which I helped deliver in 2015. We are not seeing countries shift as fast as they need to, but we are seeing them shift. This was always part of the plan…The next tranche of these plans are due this year. In the coming months we can expect the EU, India, and China to deliver their goals for 2035. Given they represent nearly 45% of global emissions, these three are key.” She concludes: “I firmly believe COP30 will represent another step in the right direction, with over 190 countries signalling support for tougher climate action, delivering better climate plans and facilitating access to climate finance in times marked by austerity and cuts to overseas aid. Paris kickstarted the fourth industrial revolution. The gates are now open and they will not close. Only one country has ever quit a global climate deal: the US which exited the Kyoto Protocol in 2001 and the Paris Agreement in 2016 and again in 2025. History tells us they won’t be joined by others.”

Elsewhere, Bloomberg columnist David Fickling writes that “renewables didn’t cause Spain’s grid blackout”. Fickling writes: “When Spain’s grid suffered a massive blackout in April, the knee-jerk response – that the country’s rapid buildout of renewable energy was responsible – had the virtue of a clear narrative and a ready cast of stock characters…There’s just one problem with that picture: it wasn’t true, as reports this week from Spain’s grid operator and an official commission of inquiry detailed.” He concludes: “Grids shifting to a new source of generation might occasionally trip, but the effects have always been short-lived, and easily fixed. The future is already here, and it’s clean.” (See Carbon Brief’s updated Q&A on “What we do – and do not – know about the blackout in Spain and Portugal”.)",,N,,2025-06-20 10:11:43.091848

Data center electricity demand is reshaping U.S. power markets. Could geothermal provide clean, firm capacity as utilities face rising stress?

The structure of the U.S. power sector is going through a fundamental shift. The rapid growth of AI-driven data centers is leading to a surge in electricity demand—demand that is now starting to outpace grid capacity and is putting pressure on traditional utility business models. It is therefore not surprising to see an increasing number of articles and studies addressing this development.

According to the latest Horizons report by Wood Mackenzie, more than 130 GW of proposed data center capacity has now entered the development pipeline. This is more than double the capacity reported just one year ago. What is particularly noteworthy—based on Wood Mackenzie’s analysis—is that this growth is not limited to established tech hubs. It is now also expanding to other parts of the country, including Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Ohio. These are regions where local power systems are often less prepared for this scale of new load.

For utilities, keeping pace with this trend is becoming increasingly difficult. They are caught between multiple pressures: ensuring grid reliability, avoiding stranded investments, and dealing with regulatory uncertainty. In regulated markets, some utilities are starting to respond with new large-load tariffs and faster generation planning. But in deregulated areas, where market prices are expected to drive investment, forward price signals are currently not sufficient to trigger new capacity. As a result, the gap between what data centers are planning and what the grid can provide continues to widen—raising concerns around system stability, financial risk, and who will ultimately pay for the necessary infrastructure.

In this context, geothermal energy – particularly next-generation solutions like enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) – is receiving new attention as a possible clean and firm power source. A March 2025 study by the Rhodium Group, which we covered earlier this year, suggests that geothermal could supply a significant share of future electricity demand from data centers. In a scenario where these facilities continue to cluster around traditional infrastructure hubs, geothermal could meet up to 64% of the new load by the early 2030s. If data centers were to locate closer to strong geothermal resources, this figure could rise to 100%, with significantly lower electricity costs compared to grid-connected supply.

Geothermal is especially well-suited for this type of application due to several key characteristics: high capacity factors, constant availability, and the possibility to operate behind the meter. This last point is important – especially as delays in grid interconnection and regional congestion are becoming more frequent. Being able to bypass the grid and deliver electricity directly to data center operations presents a clear strategic advantage. At the same time, geothermal plants have a relatively small land footprint, which is attractive for developers seeking reliable and space-efficient solutions.

However, there are still barriers to overcome. Permitting processes – particularly on federal land – remain long and complex. How recent changes by the new U.S. administration will indeed on a broader scale help speed up those processes will have to be seen, yet recent news are proimising in that direction. In many states, legal clarity around subsurface heat rights is still lacking. And while investment into geothermal drilling and development is increasing, the supply chain and workforce are only beginning to scale. Furthermore, the independent power producer (IPP) model that most geothermal developers follow may face regulatory and contractual challenges, especially when entering procurement systems designed with other technologies in mind.

A further question that often comes up in discussions is whether data center companies will actually invest in power generation directly – or if they will remain purely electricity buyers. In the past, most preferred to rely on utility partnerships and renewable energy credits. But this could be changing. Companies such as Google are engaging beyond power purchase agreements, but how and if they are actively investing in clean energy supply, including geothermal will have to be seen. In select cases, there are early signals that hyperscale developers may enter into direct contracts with IPPs, especially if the projects can deliver firm, hourly-matched clean power that aligns with corporate climate targets.

This could open new opportunities for geothermal developers – particularly those able to offer behind-the-meter or co-located solutions. It would, however, also require new forms of collaboration and risk-sharing between project developers, investors, and corporate buyers – something that will not happen automatically, but needs to be designed and built.

As Wood Mackenzie points out, this is not only a matter of energy supply – it is a question of how the electricity market is structured. If utilities and competitive power markets are not able to deliver at the speed and scale that is now required, other models will have to emerge. Geothermal may not have been developed with AI infrastructure in mind, but its characteristics make it a compelling option for addressing the combined challenges of reliability, emissions, and load concentration. Whether the sector can take on this role will depend on more than technology – it will require faster permitting, clearer regulation, willingness to partner with new types of buyers, and a much more ambitious approach to scaling deployment in the years ahead.",https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/California_powerlines_Nevada.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 12:23:45.130469

Car shoppers balked at the high prices of fully electric models and the challenges of charging them.
That was around twice the market share of fully electric vehicles in that period.
Ford Motor’s hybrid sales rose 31 percent in the same period.
Honda is on track this year for its highest hybrid sales ever, and the hybrid versions of its Accord sedan and CR-V sport utility vehicle now outsell the gasoline-only models.","There are a lot of things Sarah Martens likes about the 2025 Toyota Highlander hybrid she bought a few months ago. Its pearlescent white paint shimmers in the sunlight. It has lots of safety features. And for a large sport utility vehicle, it sips gasoline, getting nearly 30 miles per gallon at times.

But the thing she likes most: It doesn’t feel like a hybrid.

“It’s so smooth,” said Ms. Martens, a Pilates instructor in Ann Arbor, Mich. “When it starts off from a stoplight or switches from electric to gas, I can’t tell I’m driving a hybrid. It just seems like I’m driving a normal car.”

Not so long ago, it seemed that the heyday of hybrids had come and gone. As Tesla and the potential of electric vehicles grabbed the imaginations of drivers and automakers, hybrids appeared destined to be remembered as an interim step on the way toward a fully electric, emissions-free future.

Just four years ago, for example, General Motors set a goal of ending production of all internal combustion models by 2035, and all but eliminated hybrids from its future product plans. Other manufacturers also bet heavily on electric vehicles and scaled their hybrid plans.

But then a funny thing happened. Car shoppers balked at the high prices of fully electric models and the challenges of charging them. In the last few years, sales of electric vehicles have grown at a much slower rate than automakers once expected. And hybrids have stepped in to fill the gap, accounting for a large and growing share of new car sales.

“People like the attributes that hybrids bring to the table,” said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds, a market researcher. “They offer better mileage than pure gasoline models, and the prices are pretty close to pure gas vehicles, so they’re much more affordable than E.V.s.”

In the first three months of this year, hybrids — including cars that can and cannot be plugged in — made up about 14 percent of all light vehicles sold in the United States, according to the Department of Energy. That was around twice the market share of fully electric vehicles in that period.

Republican legislation working its way through Congress could further lift sales of hybrids. In May, the House passed a policy bill backed by President Trump that would eliminate a $7,500 tax credit available to people who bought or leased electric vehicles. That legislation would also impose an annual tax of $250 on electric cars and $100 on hybrids to finance road projects. The Senate version of the bill introduced this week would do away with the tax credit, too, but does not include the annual tax.

A few large automakers dominate the sale of hybrids.

Nearly half the cars and trucks that Toyota and its luxury brand, Lexus, sold in the first five months of the year were hybrids — and sales of those vehicles were up about 40 percent from a year earlier. Ford Motor’s hybrid sales rose 31 percent in the same period. Honda is on track this year for its highest hybrid sales ever, and the hybrid versions of its Accord sedan and CR-V sport utility vehicle now outsell the gasoline-only models.

Hybrids are typically powered by a small gasoline engine that is paired with an electric motor driven by a battery that is much smaller and, thus, less expensive than the batteries in fully electric vehicles. These batteries are charged primarily by regenerative brakes and gasoline engines.

Plug-in hybrids, which account for a small share of hybrids, have bigger batteries than regular hybrids and can also be charged from power outlets at home or at charging stations. Some plug-ins can go around 50 miles on battery power alone before the gas engine kicks in.

Hybrid technology burst onto the automotive scene more than two decades ago when Toyota introduced the Prius, which was able to go more than 45 more miles on a gallon of gas — a remarkable feat at the time.

Early hybrids, including the Prius, sometimes felt a little clunky as they switched from gas engine to electric motor and back, and many were small vehicles that lacked the power and room some drivers were accustomed to. Some auto engineers at rival car companies brushed the Prius off as a toy, and objected to the idea of a car’s having two propulsion systems under the hood because they found it too complicated or unconventional.

But when gasoline prices rose in the early 2000s, the Prius drew raves from environmentally minded consumers and cost-conscious drivers. As Prius sales took off, other automakers hopped on the hybrid bandwagon.

Hybrids gained proponents especially in periods when gas prices spiked. But once Tesla’s sales took off in the middle of the last decade, the industry’s focus shifted to electric vehicles.

Consumer are now gravitating toward hybrids because the technology has improved significantly. Batteries are smaller in size but hold more power. The switching between the gas engine and the electric motor — as Ms. Martens has noticed — is now pretty seamless.

“When the Prius came out in 1997, it was mostly tuned to be fuel-efficient,” said David Christ, group vice president and general manager for the Toyota brand in North America. “But we’ve had 25 years to refine the technology in a way that makes our hybrids not only fuel-efficient but also fun to drive.”

The hybrid version of Toyota’s RAV4, Mr. Christ noted, now has more power and torque than the pure gasoline version.

At the same time, automakers have created hybrid versions of all types of vehicles, and have found ways of using the hybrid’s battery to offer consumers additional features. Ford offers a hybrid version of its F-150 pickup truck that can run power tools and lighting on job sites. The truck can also provide electricity during power outages.

“I think a lot of consumers are seeing that it’s a better propulsion system,” said Jim Baumbick, Ford’s vice president of advanced product development, cycle planning and programs. “You get better fuel economy, and it unlocks a lot of new capabilities that they never had before.”

And in some cases, automakers have decided hybrid technology is the only way to go. Several mainstream Toyota models, including the Sienna, Camry, Crown and RAV4, are or will soon be available only as hybrids.

Several automakers are slowing the introduction of new electric vehicles, and have accelerated development of new hybrids. Hyundai plans to double its hybrid offerings to 14 models. Ford plans to make hybrid variants across its model line by the end of the decade. Stellantis, which already makes plug-in versions of its Pacifica minivan and certain Jeeps, plans to add a hybrid option for its Jeep Cherokee and Ram pickup.

“There are still people who don’t like hybrids and don’t want hybrids. They still want a V8 or just that raw power,” Ms. Caldwell said. “But it’s a shrinking number. There’s definitely a lot less resistance to hybrids now.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/16/multimedia/00hybrid-cars-gzhj/00hybrid-cars-gzhj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 08:09:32.667123

BETHESDA, Md., June 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Centrus Energy (NYSE American: LEU) today announced that the U.S. Department of Energy has exercised an option to extend Centrus' competitively-awarded contract to produce High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) through June 30, 2026. The Department has additional options for continued production for up to eight additional years beyond that date.

""This extension reflects the ongoing value of the partnership that the Department launched with Centrus in 2019 to restore America's ability to enrich uranium and provide a source of HALEU that the Department and the nation urgently need,"" said Centrus President and CEO Amir Vexler. ""We are delivering meaningful quantities of HALEU to catalyze a new generation of reactors, while laying the groundwork to establish a large-scale, U.S.-owned uranium enrichment capability to meet America's commercial and national security requirements.""

In 2019, the Department of Energy contracted with Centrus to license and construct a cascade of advanced centrifuges to demonstrate HALEU production at the American Centrifuge Plant in Piketon, Ohio. In 2022, Centrus won a competitively-awarded, three-phase follow-on contract to bring the cascade into production and deliver HALEU for the Department's use. Centrus completed Phase I of the contract in late 2023 by launching enrichment operations and demonstrating first-of-a-kind HALEU production with the delivery of 20 kilograms of HALEU.

Phase II of the contract called for Centrus to produce an additional 900 kilograms of HALEU by June 30, 2025, for the Department's use. Phase III of the contract included three optional extension periods of three years each, for up to nine additional production years at an annual rate of 900 kilograms of HALEU UF6. On June 17, 2025, the Department of Energy executed a contract amendment to split the first three-year extension period into a one-year extension option followed by a two-year extension option. The Department has exercised the first of these options, kicking off Phase III with additional HALEU production through June 30, 2026. The remaining options in the contract – at the Department's sole discretion and subject to appropriations – would, if exercised, provide for up to eight additional years of production beyond the current extension.

The HALEU produced under this contract belongs to the Department and can be used to advance key national priorities like enabling the demonstration and commercialization of HALEU-fueled advanced reactors.

On May 23, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued an emergency order demanding that the J.H. Campbell plant “remain available for operation” — just eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down, a plan that has been in place since 2021.

On Wednesday, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a request for rehearing with the DOE, challenging what she described as an “arbitrary and illegal order.”

Energy experts say the cost to keep the plant open beyond its planned closure date could pass along millions in costs to taxpayers.

LANSING — Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has challenged the U.S. Department of Energy’s forcing the Consumers Energy-owned J.H. Campbell plant in Port Sheldon to remain open for 90 days, arguing that the move will force customers to absorb exorbitant costs.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued the emergency order demanding that the plant “remain available for operation” on Friday, May 23 — just eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down, a plan that has been in place since 2021.

The U.S. Department of Energy said the move is intended “to minimize the risk of blackouts and address critical grid security issues in the Midwestern region of the United States ahead of the high electricity demand expected this summer.”

On Wednesday, Nessel filed a request for rehearing with the DOE, challenging what she described as an “arbitrary and illegal order seeking to stop the planned retirement of Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Michigan, under the pretense of a fabricated energy emergency.”

She said the order “will burden Michigan utility customers with unnecessary costs and needless additional pollution from the 60-year-old Ottawa County coal plant that was scheduled to close May 31.”

A request for rehearing is a legal process where a party asks a court to reconsider a decision it has already made. It’s typically used when a party believes the court made a mistake in its initial ruling, whether by overlooking a crucial fact, misinterpreting the law, or making some other error.

The Campbell Plant is Consumers’ last — and largest — coal-fired plant in the state.

The plant, operating since 1962, was originally scheduled to close partially in 2030 and wholly in 2040. But the utility announced in 2021 it was moving the plan up by 15 years for an operations end date of May 31, 2025.

The utility was seeking to end coal use altogether by 2025 as part of its goal to achieve carbon neutrality.

Since the announcement, Consumers has been actively preparing the plant for “full retirement,” a spokesperson said last year.

“The complex will officially go into retirement with an aim to go cold and dark after 2025,” said former Consumers spokesperson Kristen Van Kley. “In 2026 and on, the complex will be demolished with a plan to restore the site over time.”

The plant, when operating at full capacity, can generate 1,450 megawatts of electricity. Michigan consumed about 113,740 gigawatt hours of electricity in 2019, according to a 2020 report from the U.S. Department of Energy.

At the time, Van Kley said new technologies would ensure Consumers would be able to continue supporting the statewide grid.

“Energy efficiency, demand response and emerging technologies such as grid modernization and battery storage will help us lower peak customer demand for electricity and deliver exactly what Michigan needs,” she said. “Our plan is designed to respond to emerging needs, adapt to changing conditions and embrace emerging innovative technologies as we work to achieve net-zero carbon emissions.”

The emergency order came after a yearlong effort from a local grassroots organization petitioned Ottawa County officials to intervene in some way to prevent the closure of the Campbell plant.

Organizers of the “Save the Campbell” effort coalesced at the beginning of 2024 — mainly members of far-right fundamentalist groups such as Ottawa Impact, The Gideon 300 and the Ottawa County GOP — said a government-owned electric co-op was possible if voters approved a “home rule charter” at the ballot box.

The issue was never put up for a vote, so a change in government structure is not forthcoming; however, local officials asked Consumers for reassurance earlier this year that local energy supplies will be uninterrupted as the Campbell plant headed for closure at the end of May.

In February, the Ottawa County Board of Commissioners approved a resolution urging delay in the plant’s closure, however, officials stopped short April 22 of opting to bring litigation to prevent the closure altogether.

Commissioners pointed to two separate reports — from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, as well as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC — that gave them concerns over the energy grid’s reliability once the Campbell is taken offline.

MISO published the results of its annual survey in June 2024, which indicated at the time that there was “a growing capacity deficit beginning in the 2025-26 planning year.”

“Next summer, MISO could see resource sufficiency ranging from a 2.7 GW capacity shortfall to a 1.1 GW surplus, underscoring the need to accelerate resource additions, monitor large load additions, and delay resource retirements to reliably manage the anticipated growth in electricity demand,” according to the survey.

NERC is a nonprofit international regulatory authority that more broadly looks at reliability standards as well as seasonal and long‐term outlooks for the entire U.S. grid. The group published a long-term reliability assessment in December 2024 that labeled MISO’s section of the grid as “high risk,” meaning the grid subsection that includes the state of Michigan “falls below established resource adequacy criteria in the next five years.”

“High-risk areas are likely to experience a shortfall in electricity supplies at the peak of an average summer or winter season. Extreme weather, producing wide-area heat waves or deep-freeze events, poses an even greater threat to reliability,” the report said.

Commissioner Jacob Bonnema questioned why Consumers opted to sunset the plant five years ahead than previously planned.Dena Isabell, stakeholder engagement manager at Consumers, told commissioners in February that Consumers adopted in 2021 that helped the company identify about $600 million in savings for its customers over 20 years with the retirement of the plant.“That includes renewables that get brought onto the grid, which are cheaper than what we have,” she said, “so that is a savings to our customers, which is part of the clean and affordable and reliable energy — so it’s an economic decision.”One component of the cost savings was coal.

Rich Houtteman, community affairs manager for Consumers, explained to commissioners in February that the cost of shipping coal is a huge financial consideration for the energy company.

“It’s about $50 a ton to ship excess coal off-site,” he said. “We had 30,000 tons. That’s a lot for our customers. So we’re trying to burn up all the coal as we kind of bring in 130 train carloads a day.”

Last-minute intervention

On May 23, Secretary Wright directed MISO, in coordination with Consumers, to ensure that the 1,560 megawatt plant “[remain] available for operation, minimizing any potential capacity shortfall that could lead to unnecessary power outages.”

“Today’s emergency order ensures that Michiganders and the greater Midwest region do not lose critical power generation capability as summer begins and electricity demand regularly reach high levels,” Wright said in a prepared news release.

The Energy Department said the emergency order, which is issued by the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, is authorized by Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act and is in accordance with President Trump’s Executive Order: Declaring a National Energy Emergency to ensure that power generation availability in the region does not “dip below 2024 capacity levels.”

“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families. With President Trump’s leadership, the Energy Department is hard at work securing the American people access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy that powers their lives regardless of whether the wind is blowing, or the sun is shining.”

The topic became a political talking point this year with Ottawa Impact commissioners. When the far-right group held a controlling majority on the board in 2023 and 2024, they largely avoided the subject, but since transitioning to a four-seat minority on the 11-member board in January, the topic has come up frequently.

OI Commissioner Allison Miedema strongly backed the county suing Consumers to prevent the Campbell closure; however, the measure lost in a 7-4 vote at the board’s April 22 meeting.

OI Commissioner Sylvia Rhodea said at the board’s May 27 meeting that Wright’s order provided a “90-day reprieve” of the delayed closure of the Campbell plant.

“Man, we dodged a bullet with that one,” she said.

What’s the cost to keep Campbell open?

Nessel said Wright’s order would lead to Michiganders “feeling a pinch in their pockets.”“The costs of maintaining production at the plant, long since prepared for closure, could be an enormous burden on the rate-paying customers of Consumers Energy,” she said. “And that’s before taking into account the environmental and public health costs of continuing to fuel a coal-powered plant.”In a June 3 statement, a Consumers spokesperson said the company is currently complying with the order.

“We are currently in compliance with the order, have arranged for new shipments of coal, some of which arrived last week, and will continuously operate the Campbell Plant,” Trisha Bloembergen, West Michigan media relations specialist, said in a June 3 email. “We are still determining the overall cost, but want to ensure those costs are shared across MISO and not all on Consumers Energy customers.”

Generating power at the Campbell plant is likely to be costly for ratepayers, experts from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis wrote June 5.

Campbell Units 1 and 2, which are 63 and 58 years old, respectively, were already increasingly uncompetitive in the MISO market, meaning it cost more to generate electricity than what it could be sold for, said energy data analysts Seth Feaster and Dennis Wamsted.According to data filed by Consumers at FERC, the operation and maintenance costs for the two units totaled $45.80 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in 2023 (the most recent data available). That puts both units in the red almost all the time in MISO: S&P data shows that the monthly around-the-clock price at the Michigan hub has been above $40/MWh just twice in the past two years, and never during the summer.”In other words, the plant would lose money on virtually every MWh generated if past prices hold this summer, costs that could add up to many more millions of dollars if the units at Campbell are run for any substantial amount of time,” Feaster and Wamsted said.Beyond operational costs, there are fuel and staffing costs as well.

“Coal itself has gotten more expensive,” said Frank Rambo, executive director at Horizon Climate Initiative, a nonprofit organization that works to use cost-saving energy market reforms to address the causes and impacts of climate change.

“That fleet has gotten more expensive to run. It’s coal, which used to be synonymous with cheap power. It’s now among the most expensive power … and then the excess costs that are incurred because they’re running more expensive resources.

Ultimately, it will be residents who foot the bill, Rambo said.

“They run those coal plants, and then they turn around, go to their commissions and recover those excess costs from their customers,” he said.

Rambo said the price could be even higher than normal because Consumers would need to buy coal on the open market rather than enter into a new contract with a mine.

“We don’t need to sign a new long-term coal supply contract because we’re shutting the plant down,” he said. “Now they may have to buy coal on the spot market.”

The price of coal has hovered around $110 per ton on the U.S. commodities exchange. As of June 19, the price of coal was $103.85 per ton.

In 2024, Campbell burned more than 3.7 million tons of coal, Feaster and Wamsted said. That is an average of 12,700 tons of coal a day, which would amount to $1,318,895 per day using today’s prices.

All of the Campbell plant’s coal previously was delivered by rail from the Powder River Basin in northern Wyoming, according to the IEFF.

Two of the PRB’s biggest mines provided that coal: Arch Resources’ Black Thunder Mine, which delivered 2.25 million tons, and Peabody Energy’s North Antelope Rochelle Mine, which delivered 1.47 million tons.

Rambo also noted the plant staffing issue, explaining that Consumers likely already had phased out several employees who were then called back.

“We were laying these people off. Now we’re going to have to hire them as contractors,” likely at a higher pay rate because the work would be temporary, Rambo explained.

“There are all sorts of excess costs that would not be incurred, but for the fact that there’s now this executive order,” he said.

What happens next?

Feaster and Wamsted said Consumers has brought online 502MW of wind generation since 2020, bought the 1,055MW Covert combined cycle gas plant in 2023, and is in the process of adding 515MW of solar generation to its system by 2027.

They said this indicates that the DOE intervention wasn’t necessary.

“These capacity-replacement moves were clearly enough for MISO. The system operator’s endorsement is critical, since it has the authority to require plants to continue operating if it believes grid stability or shortages could occur,” the analysts wrote.

They pointed to MISO requiring Missouri-based Ameren to keep its 1,195MW Rush Island coal plant open in 2022 for reliability reasons. The decision was upheld by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the plant remained open until 2024.

“MISO found no similar problems with Consumers’ plan to close the Campbell plant, saying as recently as May 8 that the region has sufficient resources to meet projected demand this summer,” Feaster and Wamsted said. “Despite this, the Department of Energy said in its May 24 emergency order that it was directing MISO and Consumers to keep the plant open due to an expected ‘insufficiency of dispatchable capacity’ during the summer.”

Rambo said he’s concerned that this could indicate more federal intervention in the energy sector, which could drive up costs for all.

“This very well could be a bellwether of more things to come. And that’s why I’m concerned about this as an example. Because if this does turn out to be the first of many, we should all be prepared for higher energy bills,” he said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-24-065259.png,N,,2025-06-20 12:23:50.110013

His time with the Cities & Towns Initiative was not his first foray into environment protection work, but it was the watershed moment for his passion.","Former La Crosse mayor Mitch Reynolds is onto his next project, a newly formed organization focused on removing plastic pollution from middle America’s vital waterways.

The MidAmerica Clean Future Alliance was created this past fall by Mississippi River Cities & Towns Initiative clean water director Jennifer Wendt. Reynolds served as a member of the Initiative as part of his role as mayor, and as his time wound down, Wendt approached him to help on the Alliance project.

Not much later, Reynolds hopped on board as a program specialist. It’s not a full-time position, but a project he spends significant time with as a new venture.

He’s taking his experience working with municipal governments to get cities in the Mississippi River basin connected to environmental protection programs, including some cities that don’t even have recycling programs.

“We have underserved communities, especially in the South, that really struggle with dealing with just some of the basic necessities of their communities, and sometimes waste management falls outside of that,” Reynolds said.

Reynolds’ duties are different from his time with the Cities & Towns Initiative, where he took more of an advocacy role traveling to Washington, D.C., South Korea and even Dubai to communicate the need middle America has for environmental protections.

Instead, Reynolds and the alliance are focused on direct action in Mississippi River basin communities. They have been connecting recycling programs, educational outreach, reuse incentives and more up and down the basin.

“Any amount of mitigation that we can do in middle America, especially in relation to the Mississippi River basin, will have a significant and profound effect not only on the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, but the global oceans as well,” Reynolds added.

Big plans for the big river

According to EBSCO’s research database, 40% of the country drains into the Mississippi River. All of this fresh water feeds into the Gulf of Mexico, which in turn flows to the Pacific Ocean and the rest of the world.

The massive area of drainage combined with pollutants and dam systems have created ""dead zones"" in the Gulf. These dead zones are areas where oxygen levels have been depleted to the point the water cannot sustain life.

The main causes of the Gulf’s dead zones are excess nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients from fertilizers and urban runoff.

This is where the alliance plans to step in. Wendt’s primary vision is to get the Mississippi River basin to a point where these dead zones can be mitigated and even reversed. One of Wendt’s long-game projects is to get producers linked to extended producer responsibility and available grants to implement the policy.

Some of the same partnerships the Alliance formed helped Greenville, Mississippi, create its first recycling incentive program with Cans for Cash. The new Cans for Cash drop off center launched April 22 rewards Greenville residents $0.30 per pound of recycled material.

It's the first program of its kind in the state of Mississippi.

“There's a lot of folks who are looking to do this work, but we have to get in front of them and talk about what we'd like to do,” Reynolds said.

Like any organization, the work takes serious funding. The alliance started rolling out its public presence at the Social Innovation Summit in San Francisco two weeks ago and is trying to build more partnerships across the country.

Current partners include Ducks Unlimited, the Can Manufacturers Institute, Niagara Bottling and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, among others.

History of environmental protection

The former La Crosse mayor is not new to the game. His time with the Cities & Towns Initiative was not his first foray into environment protection work, but it was the watershed moment for his passion.

“I've always been the reusable water bottle, reusable bag kind of guy,” Reynolds laughed. “I didn't understand the depth and the scale until I really started to dig into it as a member of MRCTI.”

Wisconsin state laws prevent bans on plastic bags and plastic food containers, but Reynolds said he tried to do everything else in his mayoral powers to get plastic out of the rivers.

As mayor, he banned the use of Styrofoam packaging for city operations, nixed balloon releases and represented La Crosse via the Cities & Towns Initiative in Washington, D.C.

“There are very few things that we can do from the municipal level. And so we really do have to find a way to address plastics in a much different way,” Reynolds said.

To accomplish climate neutrality, European industry, which is responsible for , has to cut its emissions while continuing to deliver the technologies needed for the low-carbon transition (heat pumps, solar, wind, electrolysers for the production of hydrogen, batteries…).

EU companies are also facing challenges on global markets. To make the low-carbon transition possible in a competitive way, the European Commission presented the Clean Industrial Deal in February 2025. The document focuses on two main sectors: clean technology and energy-intensive industry.

The key industries that need to change

Clean technology sector

Clean technologies will be essential for decarbonising the economy, and their market is expected to triple by 2035. However, the EU’s global market share of the clean tech sector is falling and manufacturing is lagging behind.

The root causes for the EU’s lack of competitiveness in the clean tech sector include high energy prices, global competition (mainly from China and the USA), reliance on imports of critical raw materials and the administrative burden faced by businesses (especially on obtaining permits for starting operations, getting access to finance and receiving support from governments).

Energy-intensive industries

Materials such as iron, steel, cement, paper and chemicals are crucial for manufacturing clean technologies but also for other industries, such as car making and defence. They contribute to Europe’s strategic autonomy and are of crucial importance to the EU’s economy.

However, these sectors require a lot of energy and this means their carbon emissions are hard to eliminate. Energy-intensive industries produce the greenhouse gas emissions that are attributed to manufacturing.

The European Parliament’s reaction to the Clean Industrial Deal

In a resolution approved by the European Parliament in the June 2025 plenary sitting, MEPs welcomed the Clean Industrial Deal and stressed the need to keep European industry strong and competitive while fighting climate change.

MEPs supported new financing tools to invest in clean technology.

To help businesses innovate and switch to cleaner methods faster, MEPs called for simpler rules and faster approvals for permits, especially for small companies and projects. They want less paperwork and easier access to funding.

They also want to make permanent carbon removals a viable option for businesses in sectors where emissions are hard to reduce.

MEPs backed the affordable energy action plan and called for better cooperation among European countries on energy networks and trading electricity. The Palriament pointed out that EU countries have very different rules, which slows down progress.

Modernising electricity grids

In a separate own-initiative report, also approved in plenary in June 2025, the European Parliament put forward ideas on how to modernise Europe's electricity grid infrastructure. The upgrade is needed to accommodate the growing demand for renewable energy. The text calls for significant investments to both modernise the grids and increase transmission capacity across borders.

The importance of enhancing EU grid resilience was clearly shown during the electricity system blackout that occurred in Spain, Portugal and parts of France on 28 April 2025.

rPlus Energies secures $500 million for 400MW/1.6GWh Utah solar-plus-storage project

Renewables developer rPlus Energies has secured more than US$500 million for a 400MW/1.6GWh solar-plus-storage project in Emery County, Utah, US.

The financing was secured through a tax equity commitment of over $500 million from RBC Community Investments and a consortium of investors. The funding will leverage the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) to support the development of the Green River Energy Centre.

The Green River Energy Centre, currently under construction, includes 400MW of solar PV and 400MW/1,600MWh of battery energy storage system (BESS).

The solar-plus-storage project is expected to be completed in 2026. The company describes it as one of Utah’s largest planned solar-plus-storage projects.

The project is backed by a power purchase agreement (PPA) in place with US utility PacifiCorp, which was signed by both parties in October 2022.

“This project will use federal tools, such as the investment tax credit, to ensure that rural communities continue to lead the country’s energy production,” said Luigi Resta, CEO of rPlus Energies.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4-3.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 11:10:41.543553

The city’s central business district is buzzing with new developments and national attention. The 2024 NFL Draft brought 775,000 fans downtown—just one visual reminder that Detroit is back.

But this revival isn’t just about new buildings and marquee events. It’s about rethinking how those buildings operate. The city’s story is rooted in reinvention: leveraging its historic architecture, its legacy of grit, and a willingness to embrace technology to create a modern urban blueprint.

Historic Landmarks, High-Tech Makeovers

Some of Detroit’s most iconic structures have become flagships for this transformation. The 1926 Book Tower, formerly a symbol of abandonment, reopened in 2023 after a meticulous restoration. While its Renaissance-style exterior was preserved, the interior now runs on a smart operating system—KODE OS—that unifies HVAC, lighting, and other key systems. It’s a 1920s building with a 2020s brain, allowing operators to manage everything in real time.

Meanwhile, Hudson’s Detroit—a 49-story mixed-use development and future home of General Motors’ headquarters—was designed with smart tech from the start. Integrated from the ground up with the same platform powering Book Tower, it connects elevators, climate control, and energy systems into a centralized interface. Bedrock, Detroit’s largest real estate owner and developer, now requires this level of technology in all of its buildings.

Michigan Central, built in 1913 as Detroit’s grand train station, was abandoned for three decades and has also undergone a similarly radical shift. Thanks to a $950 million investment by Ford Motor Co., the Beaux-Arts building is an innovation hub outfitted with adaptive building systems, sensors, and Wi-Fi infrastructure. Ford’s engineering teams stepped into one of the most intelligent workspaces in the country, embedded within a historic landmark. It reopened with great fanfare in June 2024.

Laying a Digital Foundation: Fiber Internet

None of these smart buildings would function without the digital foundation. Back in 2014, my cofounders and I launched Rocket Fiber to fix what was missing in Detroit: world-class internet infrastructure. We built a next-gen, high-speed network from the ground up, connecting downtown with the kind of bandwidth you’d expect in a top-tier tech hub.

This wasn’t just about faster internet. Rocket Fiber was founded in Detroit, built in Detroit, and backed by Detroit – specifically Dan Gilbert and the broader effort to reinvent the city from the inside out. It wasn’t just about renovating buildings. It was about proving Detroit was serious about leading, not following. This was foundational work meant to leapfrog the city years ahead, and it laid the groundwork for everything from smart buildings to a smart city.

Smart Buildings at Scale: A New Operational Model

Modernizing one building can be difficult. Modernizing an entire portfolio is a revolution. When Bedrock began restoring and renovating over 100 buildings downtown, it faced a challenge: each building had unique systems and controls. Our team at KODE Labs recognized this complexity and built KODE OS as a unified solution. Today, all of Bedrock’s buildings feed data into a centralized smart buildings command center, where operators monitor systems, adjust setpoints, and respond to issues—remotely, in real time.

This centralized approach allows Bedrock to manage more buildings more efficiently, without sacrificing comfort or responsiveness. Instead of dealing with isolated systems, property managers now interact with a unified interface, backed by predictive analytics, fault detection, and real-time alerts. The result? Faster issue resolution, optimized energy use, and a consistent tenant experience across the portfolio.

Detroit’s use of centralized smart building operations is now being replicated in other national and global cities. Strategies developed here are shaping national conversations around operational efficiency, sustainability, and scalable urban management.

Building an Urban Tech Ecosystem

Smart buildings don’t thrive in isolation; they need a supportive ecosystem. That’s why the Urban Tech Xchange (UTX), launched in Detroit in 2023, is so important. A collaboration between NextEnergy, Bedrock, Bosch, Cisco, KODE Labs, and civic leaders, UTX is a real-world lab for testing urban technologies. Located in downtown Detroit’s Central Business District, UTX features the latest infrastructure and is directly integrated with Bedrock’s broader real estate portfolio.

Startups and enterprise partners alike can test their technologies within UTX and plug directly into anonymized building performance data through open APIs. It’s a proving ground that accelerates innovation by embedding it within the built environment.

UTX joins a growing network of innovation hubs across Detroit—from Newlab at Michigan Central in Corktown to TechTown in Midtown Detroit and the Detroit Smart Parking Lab. These spaces break down silos and foster collaboration across government, real estate, tech, and automotive industries. That spirit of collaboration—born from necessity and sustained by shared vision—is one of Detroit’s greatest strengths.

A Blueprint for Resilient, Smart Cities

Downtown Detroit’s tech revival holds lessons for cities across the country. The first: never underestimate a city with grit. The turnaround was built from within. Led by Dan Gilbert and Mayor Mike Duggan in collaboration with countless longtime Detroit businesses and organizations, individuals, entrepreneurs, developers, civic leaders, and foundations, they came together to imagine something better and build toward it, one fiber strand and smart sensor at a time.

Second, Detroit proves that modernization and preservation aren’t mutually exclusive. Retrofitting historic buildings with smart technology allows cities to retain their character while upgrading their capabilities. From Book Tower to Michigan Central, Detroit shows that historic buildings can be reborn without sacrificing their distinct character.

Finally, Detroit teaches us the value of tech ecosystems. Smart buildings don’t just save energy—they’re nodes in a broader strategy. They rely on broadband access, startup collaboration, strong policy, and data integration. When all of these elements come together, cities can transition from reactive maintenance to proactive, efficient management at scale.

As someone who’s had a front-row seat to Detroit’s transformation working in Detroit commercial real estate since 2011, I believe our city is more than a case study. It’s a beacon for what’s possible when resilience meets innovation. We’ve shown that technology, when paired with a bold vision and a collaborative spirit, can help cities transform and redefine their futures.

And Detroit isn’t done yet.",https://rejournals.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-Rejournals_logo_512-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 10:10:40.331560

A Harvard University study projects that future EV sales will fall if the tax credit goes away.
Under existing law, EV sales could be 48% of new car sales by 2030.
Kuehl said that a few things are working against Tesla sales and EV sales.
State Rep. John Resman, an Olathe Republican, represents a district near the Panasonic plant.","Slumping Tesla sales, uncertainty around auto tariffs and proposed cuts to electric vehicle incentives could have serious implications for the new $4 billion Panasonic factory in De Soto, Kansas.

The sprawling complex is being built to make batteries for electric vehicles — specifically Teslas and other brands. As the factory nears completion, industry observers are watching worrisome changes in the market.

“There is cause for concern,” said John Higham, vice president of communications and media outreach for the Electric Vehicle Association.

Kansas lawmakers approved $829 million in tax incentives to lure the plant to the Kansas City suburbs. When the deal was announced in 2023, Panasonic promised as many as 4,000 jobs with an average salary of $50,000.

But the contract the company ultimately signed with Kansas doesn’t have any job or pay requirements. A local incentive deal with De Soto did include hiring quotas, but they are much lower than the number of jobs originally touted.

Critics warned when the deal was signed that the company was not required to follow through on its initial hiring promises. Now, there’s growing concern Panasonic will tap the brakes on hiring amid economic uncertainty.

“Are (jobs) at risk?” Higham said. “The only possible answer that anyone can give you is, yeah, maybe.”

Projections of a slumping EV market

The Beacon spoke with multiple people who said short-term hiring could be at risk, but most added that the Panasonic plant should be secure for the long haul. The company has already made substantial investments and the plant will ramp up production over a period of years.

Even so, there are several signs the EV market may not meet expectations in the coming years.

Notably, first-quarter revenue at Tesla was down 9% and net income was down 71%.

“Uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers,” the company said in an earnings presentation. “This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term.”

The company’s reference to “changing political sentiment” was widely seen as an acknowledgement of the impact of Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s high-profile relationship with President Donald Trump, and a backlash from prospective customers who might otherwise buy the company’s vehicles.

Tesla sales dropped for the fifth straight month in Italy, Germany and Britain in May. In Britain, Tesla sales dropped 45% in May. Fewer U.S. customers are buying Teslas as well.

Tesla’s poor sales results come amid federal proposals that would discourage people from buying electric vehicles. Notably, Trump wants to eliminate the $7,500 tax credit that makes EVs cheaper.

A Harvard University study projects that future EV sales will fall if the tax credit goes away. Under existing law, EV sales could be 48% of new car sales by 2030. But that would drop to 42% of the market if the tax credit disappears. In the most extreme scenario, Harvard economists said EVs could plunge to 32% of new car sales by 2030.

There’s also federal legislation proposing to charge EV owners an additional $250 annually. Hybrid car owners would be charged an additional $100 annually.

That comes in addition to a pause on spending $3 billion to build new charging stations. Finally, there is ongoing uncertainty around tariffs — which can make batteries with foreign components more expensive to produce.

“It’s a … shame that the current administration has politicized it to the point that they’re ready to decimate this part of auto manufacturing … for political points,” Higham said.

Businesses rely on regulatory certainty to make plans, Higham said. Right now, he said fears of a recession and cuts at the federal level create uncertainty, “and businesses are going to respond to that with fear and trepidation.”

That means fewer capital investments and slower hiring, he said.

Joshua Jefferson, deputy secretary of business development with the Kansas Department of Commerce, said that Panasonic has diversified its battery offerings in response to the evolving market. The plant was initially touted as a Tesla and Toyota manufacturing plant. Now the company makes batteries for Lucid, Hexagon Purus and Harbinger Motors.

What can Kansas do?

The Kansas City Star reported in 2022 that the state’s contract with Panasonic didn’t include job and pay requirements. But Panasonic has things it needs to do to get more than $800 million in state-approved tax incentives:

Spend $4 billion on the factory to get an estimated $500 million in incentives, by far the largest requirement for taxpayer dollars.

Stay in Kansas for at least 15 years.

Have an annual payroll of $234 million. It’ll then get $234 million in rebates over 10 years.

The Star reported in 2022 that Panasonic promised up to 4,000 jobs but refused to answer questions about an exact number of openings and pay. The De Soto City Council offered an estimated $229 million in tax-increment financing incentives if the company hired 2,500 full-time employees and invested $1 billion.

Panasonic has hired 660 people so far, Jefferson said. The company is planning a grand opening event on July 14, and Jefferson said the 660 figure is about right for a factory that hasn’t made a single battery.

Jefferson emphasized that these incentives are only given if Panasonic invests in Kansas and hires locally. He also noted that the incentives aren’t handed out in one big chunk. It’ll take years for every dollar to be awarded.

Jefferson said the investment is already paying off — De Soto was able to lower its taxes because of the additional sales tax brought in during the plant’s construction.

He stands by the contract the state signed.

“If we would have changed one thing in this package,” Jefferson said, “the deal would have gone somewhere else … These types of deals unfold in a very real, intentional way.”

Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, has been sounding the alarm for years about what he sees as a poorly written contract.

LeRoy said if he could, he’d go back in time and tell Kansas to make the agreement all about jobs. He wants Panasonic to only get the taxpayer dollars if they hired enough people with good benefits at full-time hours and local hiring preferences and apprenticeship training programs.

The contract does require an average salary at the plant, but averages are not the perfect measure.

“Performance-based incentives just make more sense,” LeRoy said. “They’re more precise, they’re more calibrated, they’re more politically feasible.”

Reasons for optimism

As for Tesla, Musk said the EV market will turn around.

“I encourage people to look beyond the bumps and potholes of the road immediately ahead of us,” Musk said to Axios. “Lift your gaze to the bright shining citadel on the hill — I don’t know, some Reaganesque imagery — and that’s where we’re headed.”

Panasonic, which is in line to receive billions of dollars in federal tax incentives by 2032, declined interview requests for this story.

A February presentation from the company said it is harder to make money on battery sales because the EV market growth is slow, but battery development remains a top priority.

Top Panasonic officials did answer questions about U.S. tariffs and the De Soto plant during a recent investor call.

Yuki Kusumi, CEO of Panasonic, said he expects difficulties manufacturing batteries using Chinese components in American factories, but there’s no major financial concern.

There’s been no significant slowdown in demand, Kusumi said. Panasonic estimates U.S. tariffs will cost the company’s energy segment $540 million, but that’s just 1% of group sales.

The company’s larger concern is a potential recession that will discourage buying electric vehicles. Panasonic’s investor presentation said sales will pick up because of more affordable vehicles.

The Toyota Corolla Hybrid and Prius are both on the more affordable end. But Teslas are not affordable for working-class Americans, said economist Chris Kuehl.

Kuehl said that a few things are working against Tesla sales and EV sales.

Owning a Tesla signals certain political opinions that can scare off some customers. There are also concerns about the range of EVs and ability to find charging stations.

But the Panasonic plant doesn’t have to tie itself to Tesla forever. Both Kuehl and Higham said the factory could pivot to make batteries for other cars, energy storage devices or something else.

State Rep. John Resman, an Olathe Republican, represents a district near the Panasonic plant. He said the plant will create a strong workforce in the long run. Panasonic is a multinational corporation that can attract other businesses to the area. That’ll help.

And projected EV sales may drop in the short term, but not forever.

“EVs are not going away,” Resman said. “Every day you read about companies that have expanded the amount of miles that batteries can take a car, and they can recharge even quicker now than they have in the past. So the technology is there.”

Public support for green energy tax credits and renewable energy expansion has declined compared to 2022. Only about 4 in 10 favor providing tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles, down from half in an AP-NORC poll conducted in September 2022. Support for solar panel tax credits also declined from about two thirds to just over half.

Along with the fall in support for green energy tax credits, fewer people want to see the United States expand offshore wind farms or solar panel farms compared to 2022. Still only third of the public want increased offshore drilling for oil and natural gas, unchanged from 2022, and even fewer support an increase in coal mining.

Few adults have a lot of confidence in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of water, food, or air. Though confidence in FEMA is quite low, most say the federal government should play a major role in managing and dealing with natural disasters. The public has more confidence in national and local weather services and reports.

The decrease in support for green energy tax credits is driven mostly by Democrats and independents. In September 2022, 71% of Democrats and 49% of independents favored tax credits for electric vehicles. Now, while still a majority, 58% of Democrats support electric vehicle tax credits along with only 28% of independents.

Along with the reduction in support for tax credits, there is less support for expanding offshore wind farms or solar panel farms. And only about a third continue to favor the expansion of offshore drilling for oil and natural gas. Few would like to see more coal mining.

As with the support of tax credits, Democrats and independents are less in favor of an expansion of solar panel farms or offshore wind farms compared with September 2022, while Republicans have stayed more consistent.

A majority of the public support consumer information and rebates for more efficient home appliances and a reduction in the amount of greenhouse gases companies can emit. About 4 in 10 favor funding projects to reduce inequality in the impact of climate change. Few support auctioning off more public land for oil drilling with 40% in opposition. These levels of support are about the same as 2022.

Only about a fifth of adults are extremely or very confident in the federal government’s ability to ensure the safety of drinking water, the air they breathe outdoors, or meat, poultry, and produce sold in grocery stores. About 4 in 10 are somewhat confident and another 4 in 10 have little confidence. About half of Democrats have little to no confidence in the federal government’s ability to guarantee the safety of water, food, or air, compared with about 7 in 10 Republicans who have at least some confidence.

The majority of adults, including majorities in both parties, say the U.S. government should be taking a major role in dealing with natural disasters. Tracking and warning people about natural disasters, providing aid, and helping to rebuild after a natural disaster are seen as key responsibilities of the federal government.

Fewer, though still 56%, say the same for the federal government’s role in combatting climate change to try to keep extreme weather from getting worse. Democrats and independents are much more likely to say the U.S. government needs to be taking a major role in combatting climate change, while most Republicans think the U.S. government should have a minor or no role at all in this issue.

While most of the public wants the U.S. government to take a major role in handling natural disasters, only 22% are extremely or very confident in the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and a third have little to no confidence. Members of both parties are skeptical about FEMA. About 4 in 10 are highly confident in the National Weather Service or their own local weather report.

The nationwide poll was conducted June 5-9, 2025 using the AmeriSpeak® Panel, the probability-based panel of NORC at the University of Chicago. Online and telephone interviews using landlines and cell phones were conducted with 1,158 adults.

“The windmills are killing our country by the way,” the president said before signing bills to block California’s gas car phase-out. Wind turbines are “garbage,” he said, as well as “bullshit,” “horrible” and “very expensive to paint.”

“We’re not going to approve windmills unless something happens that’s an emergency,” Trump said. “I guess it could happen, but we’re not doing any of them.”

That near-total opposition to wind has been particularly catastrophic to the offshore industry, squelching investments and halting ongoing projects in their tracks at a time when Northeast states are desperate for more power. POLITICO’s E&E News found that about a dozen East Coast wind projects planned during the Biden administration are now in purgatory, potentially collapsing a portfolio that could power hundreds of thousands of homes.

More projects could falter if Republicans follow through with their plans in Congress to gut clean energy tax credits, industry advocates say.

“We’ve seen a chilling effect across the industry from the administration’s stance on offshore wind, and subsequent damaging executive orders,” said Katharine Kollins, president of the Southeastern Wind Coalition.

On his first day in office, Trump withdrew all federal waters from offshore wind leasing and ordered a review of all wind leasing and permitting. His executive order directs agencies to not “issue new or renewed approvals, rights of way, permits, leases, or loans for onshore or offshore wind projects pending the completion of a comprehensive assessment and review.”

The White House did not answer questions from E&E News about the status of that review. But analysts do not expect it to be completed.

“It was not written with the purpose of being transparent and encouraging,” said Jonathan Elkind, a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “Anybody in the industry must assume that barring some wholesale change of heart, perhaps driven by new policy perspectives … from the Trump administration and from the president, it’s really hard to imagine how there’s going to be a lot of progress.”

Interior Secretary Doug Bergum’s decision earlier this year to stop — and then restart — oil giant Equinor’s Empire 1 offshore wind project only further reinforced the Trump administration’s deep antipathy for wind turbines. The project off New York was already permitted and under construction when Bergum issued a stop work order, claiming the project’s approval had been rushed.

The fallout from the administration’s opposition to wind has been swift.

This month, the lone wind project being constructed off the coast of New Jersey pulled the plug on its state power contract following a revoked air permit from EPA. Earlier this year, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the Interior agency that manages wind leasing in federal waters, paused the environmental review process for a wind farm in the New York Bight that had been announced in the final days of the Biden administration.

It doesn’t just affect offshore wind, either. In a court filing last month, the Alliance for Clean Energy New York wrote that federal agencies across the country “ceased issuing approvals for wind projects nationwide.”

“The outcome that I fear is one in which there are unexplained and unexplainable delays, and there’s just not any transparency at all,” Elkind said.

BOEM and Interior did not answer questions about how agencies are interpreting the executive order halting offshore wind approvals.

Sidelined projects

There are around 30 offshore wind projects that have leases in the outer continental shelf, according to BOEM data. Those range in status from early-stage lease acquisitions to a few that are operating commercially. Several that were in planning stages have been canceled recently.

“We’re seeing announcements that companies are sidelining projects with the expectation that no progress will be made during the administration,” said Stephen Maldonado, a research analyst at the firm Wood Mackenzie.

For example, Shell had invested in offshore wind projects before earlier this year pulling out of Atlantic Shores, the now-canceled New Jersey project. The oil major told E&E News that the company “will not lead new offshore wind developments.”

“We remain interested in offtakes where commercial terms are acceptable and are cautiously open to equity positions, if there is a compelling investment case,” a spokesperson, Natalie Gunnell, said in an email.

Five offshore wind farms are under construction now — including Empire Wind — and are expected by analysts to be completed roughly on schedule. That will add 5.7 gigawatts of power to East Coast power grids, with the last project set to finish construction in 2027.

But a dozen other projects — including ones off of New England, New Jersey, Delaware and North Carolina — have not yet progressed to the construction stage. All are unlikely to make much progress over the next four years, prompting analysts to slash their predictions for the amount of offshore wind power the U.S. will build over the next decade.

BloombergNEF, the market research firm, slashed its forecast of new offshore wind power to come online by 2035 by 56 percent as a result of the Trump administration’s policies, according to an April report.

That’s because any projects that have yet to reach a “final investment decision” — lingo for securing the money to begin construction — are expected to completely stall out during Trump’s term. That will delay or cancel $114 billion in investments in some 22 gigawatts of projects.

That outlook is digging a massive hole in state and federal climate targets that had been counting on offshore wind to help power the densely populated Eastern Seaboard, the BloombergNEF report found. States that have set goals for offshore wind still rely on BOEM to permit projects that are in federal waters.

There will be just 6.1 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2030, BloombergNEF predicted, which is only 20 percent of former President Joe Biden’s goal of 30 gigawatts. Eleven states have offshore wind targets, and none of them are on track to come even close to hitting them, according to a review of active projects by the firm.

Supply chain troubles

Even before Trump took office, the industry faced headwinds, including supply chain constraints and rising interest rates. After peaking in late 2020, wind energy investments have largely trended downwards ever since, according to data from the Clean Investment Monitor.

Siemens Gamesa, a major turbine manufacturer, canceled its plan to build blades in Virginia back in 2023. Vestas, another manufacturer that planned to construct a New Jersey assembly plant for nacelles, the piece of a turbine that generates power from its movement, may never build it without sufficient demand. Other manufacturing proposals in New York have also been shelved. (Vestas did not respond to a request for comment.)

The lack of domestic suppliers means projects in the U.S. pipeline will continue to rely on Europe for parts, which leaves them extremely vulnerable to Trump’s tariffs.

Power generation costs could also increase by nearly a quarter for wind farms if Republicans terminate the investment tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, according to the BloombergNEF report.

The House-passed GOP megabill would roll back the credits, requiring clean energy projects to begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage to still qualify. The bill also requires such projects to be placed in service by 2028 to get the credits.

It’s unclear whether those cuts will survive the Senate. The current Senate proposal scrapped the 60-day timeline but would begin to phase out the credits for wind in 2026.

“The prospect of tariffs and a roll back of federal tax credits have created an environment where key steps in building an offshore wind farm — like signing financing deals and supplier agreements — are now impossible,” said Harrison Sholler, an offshore wind analyst who authored the BloombergNEF report.

That environment has quieted new investments and made offshore wind developers keep their heads down.

“The market right now is frozen,” Jennifer Granholm, who served as Energy secretary under Biden, said at this month’s POLITICO Energy Summit, referring to energy investors generally. “Nobody is doing anything until they get the rules of the road.”

For some clean energy advocates, the administration’s opposition to offshore wind is perplexing: coastal wind farms provide thousands of domestic jobs and could boost efforts to rekindle U.S. manufacturing.

“Given the ideal alignment between offshore wind’s priorities and those of the administration: onshoring large manufacturing and shipbuilding, energy independence and dominance, and economic development, the industry has every reason to believe that offshore wind can be successful during the Trump administration,” said Kollins of the Southeastern Wind Coalition.

Hillary Bright, the leader of offshore wind advocacy group Turn Forward, said in a statement that the administration “should take full advantage of America’s many energy resources and the unique ability of offshore wind to help meet surging demand, support economic competitiveness, and further American energy.”

Elizabeth Wilson, an environmental studies professor at Dartmouth College who researches offshore wind, said there is one possible silver lining to the wind industry’s slowdown: extra time for developers and regulators to understand how to get projects built.

“I don’t like this pause, but from a learning perspective of, ‘How do we operationally make these things work,’ it might not be a bad thing,” she said, adding that ultimately, shifting to technologies like wind are necessary for energy markets in a world faced with climate change.

“None of our infrastructures are ready for the world we’re moving into,” she said. “We have to do something differently.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/66/06/65cf409840ec8e542e936106e939/south-fork-wind-24392.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 10:11:17.453979

But crunching the numbers, researchers found that the trees' collective ability to remove carbon through photosynthesis can't stand up to the potential emissions from the fossil fuel reserves of the 200 largest oil, gas and coal fuel companies — there's not enough available land on Earth to feasibly accomplish that.

And even if there were, if those 200 companies had to pay for planting all those trees, it would cost $10.8 trillion, more than their entire combined market valuation of $7.01 trillion. The researchers also determined that the companies would be in the red if they were responsible for the social costs of the carbon in their reserves, which scientists compute around $185 per metric ton of carbon dioxide.

“The general public maybe understand offsetting to be a sort of magic eraser, and that’s just not where we’re at,” said Nina Friggens, a research fellow at the University of Exeter who co-authored the paper published in Communications Earth & Environment, a Nature Portfolio journal.

Carbon offsetting essentially means investing in tree planting or other environmental projects to attempt to compensate for carbon emissions. Trees are one of the cheapest ways to do this because they naturally suck up planet-warming carbon. Fossil fuel corporations, along with other companies and institutions, have promoted tree-planting as key part of carbon offset programs in recent years.

For example, TotalEnergies, a global energy company, said in a statement that it is “investing heavily in carbon capture and storage (CCS) and nature-based solutions (NBS) projects.”

To do their calculations, the researchers looked at the 200 largest holders of fossil fuel reserves — the fuel that companies promise shareholders they can extract in the future — and calculated how much carbon dioxide would be released if this fuel is burned. The researchers also focused solely on tree planting because the expense and technological development needed for other forms of carbon capture are still mostly cost-prohibitive.

Forestry expert Éliane Ubalijoro, who was not involved with the research, called the study “elegant.”

It “gives people a sense of proportion around carbon,” said Ubalijoro, CEO of CIFOR-ICRAF, an international forestry research center.

But she cautioned against oversimplifying the equation by looking only at carbon capture, noting that tree planting done right can foster food security and biodiversity and protect communities from natural disasters.

The paper effectively makes the point that it's financially impossible to offset enough carbon to compensate for future fossil fuel burning, said Daphne Yin, director of land policy at Carbon180, where her team advocates for U.S. policy support for land-based carbon removal. And the idea that companies would be required to account for the downstream emissions from the fossil fuel they extract is a “fantasy,” she said.

The idea of planting trees is appealing to the public and to politicians because it’s tangible — people can literally see the carbon being incorporated into branches and leaves as a tree grows, Friggens said. But she says other methods shouldn't be overlooked — microbes underground store carbon too, but they can't be seen.

And it's a physically and mathematically inescapable fact, illustrated in part by this study, that there's no getting around it — we have to stop emitting carbon, said Jonathan Foley, the executive director of Project Drawdown, who also was not part of the study. Carbon emissions are like an overflowing bathtub, he says: Before you start cleaning up, you have to turn off the water.

“Trees are the sponges and the mops we use to clean up the mess,"" he said. ""But if the taps are still running and the water’s pouring out over the edges of your bathtub, destroying your bathroom and your home, maybe you’ve got to learn to turn off the taps too.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/19/PDTN/84279058007-ap-25169592296583.jpg?crop=3375,1899,x0,y175&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-06-20 12:25:16.703343

Britain’s workers in industrial heartlands such as Teesside, Scotland, South Wales and East Anglia are set to benefit from a major deal crowding in investment for the country’s industrial renewal.

The Government and Great British Energy, the UK’s publicly owned clean power company, have joined forces with industry and The Crown Estate to invest £1 billion in offshore wind supply chains.

The aim is to secure Britain’s renewal through manufacturing facilities and skilled well-paid jobs, and to deliver on the Government’s mission to make the UK a clean energy superpower.

The investment comes after the Spending Review confirmed what the Government claims is “the biggest programme of investment in homegrown energy in history” and forms part of the Government’s upcoming Industrial Strategy.

This investment will power the next generation of offshore wind in Britain, supporting British innovation from blueprint to blade, by backing the manufacturing of turbines, floating platforms, HVDC cables, and cutting-edge technologies, alongside upgrading vital port infrastructure from Leith and Teesside to Great Yarmouth and Port Talbot.

This investment will unlock thousands of jobs, kickstarting growth in coastal communities and industrial towns, and secure a cleaner, more independent energy future for Britain.

The funding is made up of:

• £300 million announced by Great British Energy in April, which provides upfront public investment to crowd in funding from the private sector into Britain’s industrial regions

• £400 million from The Crown Estate, intended to support new infrastructure, including ports, supply chain manufacturing and research and testing facilities

• £300 million being developed by the offshore wind industry to match fund Government through the Industrial Growth Plan, to deliver new investments into supply chains such as advanced turbines technologies and foundations and substructures

This takes the pot to £1 billion, building the industries of the future in Britain, such as floating offshore wind, and securing the UK as an attractive investment destination for international investors and existing UK companies.

Funding will support thousands of additional jobs, from the electricians manufacturing the turbines and blades to the engineers responsible for the construction and maintenance of wind farms.

The Government is giving long-term industrial certainty to hardworking British people as part of the Plan for Change.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “This is an unprecedented collaboration between public and private investors with Great British Energy crowding in millions of private sector investment from industry and The Crown Estate, to ensure that British companies and workers win the global race for clean energy.

“We are witnessing the coming of age of Britain’s green industrial revolution as we build this new era of clean energy abundance, helping deliver new jobs, energy security and lower household bills through our Plan for Change.”

The funding comes as Great British Energy has announced that leading public finance and investment institutions have come together to accelerate the deployment of funding, supporting domestic supply chain development for offshore wind projects.

Great British Energy will bring together the National Wealth Fund, The Scottish National Investment Bank, The Crown Estate, Crown Estate Scotland and The Development Bank of Wales, agreeing to develop a unified public finance ‘ecosystem’ to build Britain’s offshore wind supply chains.

The Government will also allocate up to £544 million from its Clean Industry Bonus, which provides funding to offshore wind developers for prioritising their investment into some of Britain’s most deprived communities, and in cleaner supply chains.

Funding will go to developers investing in regions such as Scotland, the North East and East Anglia. Subject to the outcome of this year’s renewables auction, industry estimates this could support up to 14,000 jobs, and drive up to £9 billion of private funding into these communities over the next four years. For every £1 spent on the bonus, it is estimated to crowd in £17 of private investment.

Granted by the Federal Network Agency, the 141 square kilometre site lies around 150km northwest of Heligoland and will support the development of 1GW of offshore wind capacity.

This project enhances TotalEnergies' growing presence in Europe and supports its ambition to deliver more than 100 TWh of clean electricity annually by 2030.

Strategic growth in the North Sea

The N-9.4 concession is located near two other adjacent offshore wind sites, N-9.1 and N-9.2, jointly owned by TotalEnergies and RWE.

This proximity allows the company to develop the cluster more efficiently by pooling infrastructure and project management resources, reducing both capital and operational expenditure.

With an initial 25-year operating licence, extendable to 35 years, the N-9.4 concession positions TotalEnergies for long-term impact in the North Sea energy transition.

Investing in nature and grid infrastructure

As part of the award conditions, Offshore Wind One GmbH (which includes TotalEnergies as a shareholder) will pay €18m (US$20.8m) to the German federal government in 2026, earmarked for marine biodiversity protection and environmentally responsible fishing.

An additional €8.1m (US$9.3m) will be paid annually for 20 years to the electricity transmission system operator responsible for connecting the wind farm to the grid, starting once the site is commissioned.

However, in light of extended connection timelines from German TSOs, TotalEnergies has initiated a strategic review of all offshore wind concessions obtained since 2023.

The company is engaging with authorities to reassess development conditions and connection strategies to maintain momentum.

Offshore wind for decarbonisation

The N-9.4 development complements TotalEnergies’ broader electricity strategy, which combines offshore wind, solar and flexible energy assets like combined cycle gas turbines and battery storage.

As of March 2025, the company had 28GW of gross installed renewable electricity capacity and is targeting 35GW by the end of the year.

“Our priority is two-fold,” says Patrick Pouyanné, CEO and Chair of TotalEnergies.

“The first challenge we face is to continue to produce the energy the world needs today while reducing our industrial emissions and in particular moving towards zero methane emissions by 2030.

“The second challenge is to build the low-carbon energy system of tomorrow.

“Decarbonising electricity plays a key role in the energy transition.”

Patrick added that the company has already surpassed its methane emissions reduction goal a year ahead of schedule.

“In 2024, we reached and even exceeded our 2025 methane emissions reduction target (a year ahead of schedule -55% vs. -50% compared with 2020),” he says.

“We are therefore stepping up our efforts to reach -60% by 2025 and -80% by 2030.

“This is a priority for us, but it must also become a priority for the entire oil and gas industry.”

Thom Tillis’ office in Greensboro, calling on the Republican senator to oppose the Trump administration’s One Big, Beautiful Bill and to protect North Carolina’s clean energy initiatives.

Members of the NC League of Conservation Voters (NCLCV) and the BlueGreen Alliance gathered outside the building at 3200 Northline Ave., holding signs that read “Don’t raise our energy bills” and “Protect NC clean energy jobs.”

“When I was recovering from cancer treatment, my energy bill cost me nearly $450 a month. That’s high for anyone, but especially for a mother of three fighting just to stay alive,” Crystal Barnes, a resident of Winston-Salem, said during the conference.

Barnes shared that her energy bill was cut in half after she discovered the Weatherization Assistance Program, which made her home “more energy efficient” by upgrading insulation and light bulbs, and replacing her outdated HVAC unit.

Under the current House version of Trump’s bill, the program would be eliminated as part of a broader rollback of energy-efficiency and climate-related initiatives, including key provisions of the landmark Inflation Reduction Act.

“Those making these decisions need to put themselves in our shoes. They should stop considering only what’s going to benefit special interests and big donors and consider how it affects our health, our jobs, and our finances.”

The bill, which narrowly passed the House last month, was revised and released this week by the Senate Finance Committee. The updated version keeps the plan to fully phase out the tax credits for solar and wind energy by 2028, while extending incentives for hydropower, nuclear, and geothermal energy through 2036. GOP leaders have called for the bill to be passed by July 4.

Thom Kay, a policy manager with the BlueGreen Alliance, pointed out while the revised bill doesn’t go after energy storage as directly as the House version, by removing tax credits for solar energy, “you are destroying the market for energy storage, because in recent years, solar and storage are almost inseparable.”

Gov. Josh Stein, who has praised the Inflation Reduction Act for creating 20,000 clean energy jobs and attracting $24 billion in investments to North Carolina since its passage in 2022, criticized the proposed legislation and urged Congress to protect the clean energy incentives that, he said, “have contributed to our state’s prosperity.” Without the credits, North Carolina families could see their electricity bills rise by $200 each year, Stein warned.

“As it’s currently written, the Congressional reconciliation bill stops clean energy progress in its tracks. It could cost North Carolina tens of thousands of jobs by 2030, along with billions in clean energy investments spurred by clean energy and manufacturing tax credits.” said Dan Crawford, director of governmental relations at NCLCV.

“They (Congress) should focus more on strengthening our economy and lowering costs, not on preserving tax breaks for the wealthiest and exploding the deficit. I call on Senator Tillis to demonstrate his leadership in making that happen.”

Utilizing the Cellular Fabrication (C-Fab) process by advanced 3D printing platform Branch Technology, the project will design and manufacture customized insulation panels to enhance the building’s exterior.

This initiative aims to showcase the potential of 3D printing for large-scale energy efficiency upgrades and establish a replicable model for retrofitting military and federal facilities. The project is part of the Department of Defense’s Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP).

Joint Effort to Advance Energy Efficiency

Ameresco is working alongside Branch Technology and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to design and install a customized, energy-efficient cladding system produced with the C-Fab process. This method uses 3D printing to digitally scan, design, and fabricate insulation panels, offering a precise and cost-effective solution that improves the energy performance of the building’s exterior.

Spanning approximately 6,250 square feet of the Detroit Arsenal’s exterior, the project aims to boost energy efficiency by nearly 50%. This project is expected to generate significant energy savings and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, supporting the Department of Defense’s wider sustainability and resilience goals. As a key component of this pilot, NREL will build a 300-square-foot mockup at its Colorado research facility to evaluate the system’s energy performance and cost-effectiveness.

“Partnering with the U.S. Army as they push the envelope on sustainable innovation is inspiring,” said Nicole Bulgarino, President of Federal Solutions and Utility Infrastructure at Ameresco. “This pilot project isn’t just about lowering energy costs; it’s about rethinking how we approach building retrofits across large institutions. Using 3D printing to bring energy efficiency to Detroit Arsenal is a bold step, and we’re proud to be part of the Army’s journey toward a greener future.”

Construction 3D Printing for Military

In February, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) introduced its first 3D printed barracks at Fort Bliss, home to the 1st Armored Division. Designed to meet the DoD’s updated Unified Facilities Criteria, which now includes standards for additive manufacturing, the project was led by Texas-based construction 3D printing company ICON. Each building spans 5,700 square feet, with plans announced in 2022 and development starting last year.

Elsewhere in 2023, the Indian Army completed its first 3D printed dwelling unit in Ahmedabad Cantonment, designed to be disaster-resistant and compliant with Zone-3 earthquake specifications and green building standards. Built by the Military Engineering Services (MES) in aliance with Gujarat-based MiCoB Pvt Ltd, the 71-square-meter structure, including garage space, was constructed using 3D Rapid Construction Technology.

The process involved printing walls, slabs, and the foundation, reducing the construction time to 12 weeks. At the time of this announcement, it was revealed that the army was also testing 3D printed precast defenses and overhead protection structures, including in Ladakh, for potential operational deployment.

While the pace of EV sales had slowed, U.S. automakers were building battery factories and looking to design less expensive models.

Two bills passed during the Biden administration, the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, provided tax incentives not only to automakers but also for battery production and other aspects of the EV supply chain. Regulations aimed at reducing vehicle tailpipe emissions also incentivized the industry to shift toward electric vehicles (EVs).

Now, an argument published in Foreign Policy Magazine, “America’s Electric Vehicle Surrender,” is all but sounding the death knell of the U.S. EV industry.

Narayan Subramanian, who served as director for energy transition at the National Security Council in the Biden White House and is currently an adjunct assistant professor at the Columbia Climate School, was a co-author of that piece.

LISTEN to the interview

This interview has been edited.

Julie Grant: What difference was President Biden’s push toward EVs making?

Narayan Subramanian: So you saw a couple of things. One, the increase in EV sales rapidly increased just between 2022 and 2024, after the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law were passed. You also saw a slow — and an emphasis on slow — a slow increase in the amount of EV infrastructure all across the country, so that’s charging stations. Then you saw a record number of announcements from automakers entering joint ventures and partnerships to manufacture all these different components and parts that go into the electric vehicle itself.

There’s generally a widespread consensus that the U.S. helped innovate a lot of these battery technologies, only to then see them go overseas.

So what you were also starting to see is this technology transfer where a lot of the next generation or current generation batteries, the manufacturing know-how, was coming back to the United States. There’s generally a widespread consensus that the U.S. helped innovate a lot of these battery technologies, only to then see them go overseas.

And so what the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act incentives were doing was not only helping with the deployment and the adoption of electric vehicles, but also starting to reshore the manufacturing supply chains for those electric vehicles.

Julie Grant: China is charging ahead in electric vehicles, as you talk about in your article. Can you give us an overview of what’s been happening there and how quickly they’re moving [toward EVs]?

Subramanian: This has been a decades-long bet by China to basically ramp up and start controlling the electric vehicle market. So just to give you an example, China, about 20 years ago or even more, started establishing clear requirements that if you were a U.S. automaker, or any foreign automaker, that wanted to sell into the Chinese market, you had to do that through establishing a joint venture with a local Chinese firm. So that was step one for China to start building the manufacturing know-how on how to literally build an automobile.

Then China started providing incentives for the supply chain for electric vehicles, so batteries, the sub-components to batteries, and then slowly starting to go out and source and take control of large parts of the critical minerals value chains as well.

One example that we talk about in our article is this example of A123, a battery company that was innovating the next-generation lithium iron phosphate battery. So they had gotten a Department of Energy grant during the Recovery Act period.

China started providing incentives for the supply chain for electric vehicles…and take control of large parts of the critical minerals value chains.

And then, through completely legal means, after that company filed for bankruptcy, because they weren’t able to scale up and compete commercially, a Chinese firm was able to acquire that company and then essentially take that lithium iron phosphate battery technology overseas, scale it up. And now the next generation of electric vehicles in China are actually using these LFP batteries. They’re easier to charge. They’re able to even go longer distances, and they take less critical minerals.

What Trump’s halt of $5 billion charging program could mean for Pennsylvania EV owners

Grant: You’ve written that if President Trump’s bill passes, the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, with its mix of tax cuts and cuts to programs like Medicaid and the clean energy incentives in the Senate, then the entire EV supply chain could be ceded to China. Why?

Subramanian: The only thing that was anchoring the electric vehicle supply chain, the batteries, the sub-components like cathodes and anodes and critical minerals — the only thing anchoring the demand for those things to be produced here in the United States was that electric vehicle tax credit that had the sourcing requirements in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Absent that, there’s really nothing stopping an automaker like a Ford or GM or Tesla from purchasing from foreign sources for batteries and critical minerals.

The only thing that was anchoring the electric vehicle supply chain…to be produced here in the United States was that electric vehicle tax credit.

Now, one can say tariffs might be able to provide some incentives for U.S. automakers to avoid buying from foreign sources. But in order for a tariff regime to really have that impact, it would have to be stable and very, very clear in its purpose.

And right now, [in what] we call it the tariffication strategy, we’re not seeing clarity in terms of timeline or purpose that provides enough certainty for an automaker to really develop a supply chain in the U.S. or in friendly countries to respond to that.

So we’re basically left in this chaos where U.S. automakers are probably going to want to opt for the cheaper foreign alternatives, which are going to be largely Chinese-owned, in order to meet their material requirements to produce electric vehicles.

The picture looks bleaker when you look out into the 2030s, when the…Chinese counterparts are going to have gone fully into the electric vehicle space, leaving the U.S. automakers quite behind.

And it’ll have ripple effects, not just on the electric vehicle makers, but also on the battery makers and the critical minerals producers. And so, overall, that entire supply chain could be ceded to China over the next couple of years if these incentives and regulatory requirements are taken out.

Grant: You mentioned in the article, “the battery belt,” in the South and the Midwest. So what was happening with battery production, and what’s happening now that there’s uncertainty around this industry?

Subramanian: Just in the last couple of months, there have been a record number of announcements to delay or cancel a number of projects in the EV and battery supply chain where you will see the impact of this most acutely is in the Southeast in South Carolina, North Carolina. Georgia, Kentucky, because these states were the location of a number of these new critical minerals processing and battery supply chain projects. So the economic impacts are going to be quite substantial in those states.

Grant: If the [budget] bill passes, what would this do to the EV industry here long-term, and what have automakers been saying about this?

Subramanian: The uncertainty around the tariffs has already hit automakers quite hard. The macroeconomic headwinds that the country’s generally facing right now are also probably having a dampening effect on consumers going and buying new vehicles anyway. I would say that U.S. automakers are probably headed for pretty dire straits for the next couple of years if this bill is passed in its current form or even only just mildly modified.

What the U.S. had in terms of the luxury brand dominance via Tesla, perhaps will be lost as well.

The picture looks bleaker when you look out into the 2030s, when the U.S. automakers’ Chinese counterparts are going to have gone fully into the electric vehicle space, leaving the U.S. automakers quite behind both technologically and also perhaps even aesthetically.

The Chinese automakers are even building the luxury brands out quite a bit. And so what the U.S. had in terms of the luxury brand dominance via Tesla, perhaps will be lost as well.

Grant: Let’s talk about California. The Biden administration gave the state waivers to create tailpipe emission rules that were tougher than federal standards. Those rules said all new vehicles there would be zero-emission by 2035. In May, the U.S. Senate voted to revoke the waivers. What’s going on here, and why is California such an important player in this space?

Subramanian: California, being a major demand driver, does orient the long-term business strategy of a lot of these automakers, just inevitably because of the sheer size and weight of California as a state.

So this law is significant because the Clean Air Act actually allowed states to go above and beyond the federal floor that the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation provided. So California essentially said by 2035, we’re going to be phasing out gas-powered vehicles.

What Congress did, what the Senate did under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), was essentially trying to take away that waiver authority that California had to go above and beyond the federal floor. It’s unclear whether the CRA even gave them that authority to take the waiver away from California. Nevertheless, it’s an opening salvo from the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Senate that they’re going to be going after the “EV mandate.”

I would push back generally against the notion that it is a mandate because it’s purely based on tailpipe emissions, and it’s not a federal mandate either, and there’s significant demand and supply-side incentives to help support that 2035 target, so to speak, that California has.

Grant: President Trump is pushing to increase the supply of critical minerals, which is dominated by China. Critical minerals are used by the defense industry and also to make electric vehicles. Why do you argue that Trump’s approach might not be worthwhile?

Subramanian: One of the fundamental problems with that approach is, as we say in the piece, minerals don’t move without markets. And what we mean by that is ultimately something has to provide an incentive or a disincentive for someone to not buy critical minerals from China, but instead buy it from a U.S. producer or an allied producer, a friendly producer of critical minerals.

It’s really hard to compete in the global auto market, innovate next-generation batteries and secure critical mineral supply chains unless you view all three of those imperatives as intertwined.

Every supplier is trying to find the cheapest cost material to sell their product at the cheapest cost so that they can get the most consumers, right, the most buyers. And so the minute you take out the demand-side incentive or any kind of regulatory incentives to buy from a U.S. producer or friendly producer, most of these producers of batteries are going to go and source from Chinese or other low-cost producers. There’s nothing stopping them from doing that.

That’s where this whole strategy kind of falls apart, in my opinion, because the biggest demand driver for critical minerals right now, outside of the defense context, is coming from electric vehicles. That’s a hard fact that the administration has to grapple with.

All of these incentives and the regulatory signals are intertwined is really, really important. It’s really hard to compete in the global auto market, innovate next-generation batteries, and secure critical mineral supply chains unless you view all three of those imperatives as intertwined.",https://i0.wp.com/www.alleghenyfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/EV-11-1619x1080-1.jpg?fit=1619%2C1080&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-20 07:04:01.044881

LG Energy Solution and Toyota Tsusho Corporation have announced the formation of a joint venture focused on battery recycling in the United States. The new company, named Green Metals Battery Innovations, LLC, will construct and operate a pre-processing facility in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, marking a significant step towards creating a sustainable battery supply chain.

Key Highlights

New Joint Venture: LG Energy Solution and Toyota Tsusho have established Green Metals Battery Innovations, LLC.

North Carolina Facility: A new battery pre-processing plant will be constructed in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and is scheduled to begin operations in 2026.

Core Function: The plant will dismantle and shred battery scrap to extract black mass, a material rich in valuable metals like nickel, cobalt, and lithium.

Processing Capacity: The facility aims to achieve an annual processing capacity of 13,500 tons of scrap, which is equivalent to over 40,000 automotive batteries.

Strategic Goal: The venture intends to establish a battery-to-battery closed-loop system, promoting a circular economy and securing a stable supply of raw materials.

Advancing a Circular Economy

The collaboration between LG Energy Solution and the Toyota Group is designed to significantly lower carbon emissions through circular economy initiatives. The North Carolina facility represents LG Energy Solution’s first battery recycling joint venture in North America and underscores its commitment to developing a competitive recycling infrastructure in the region.

Initially, the plant will process scrap generated during the production of EV batteries by LG Energy Solution for Toyota Motor. The extracted black mass will then undergo a separate post-processing stage to recover the raw materials contained within. The ultimate objective is to circulate these recovered resources back into the manufacturing of new battery materials, creating a true circular economy for the battery supply chain.

Executive Vision for Sustainable Mobility

Leaders from both companies have emphasized the venture’s strategic importance. “This joint venture will not only help secure a stable supply of key battery materials but also enhance the competitiveness of our recycling business in North America,” said Chang Beom Kang, CSO of LG Energy Solution. “We are fully committed to leading the recycling market through innovative and differentiated technologies.”

Masaharu Katayama, COO of Toyota Tsusho, echoed this sentiment. “We are proud to partner with LG Energy Solution to advance the battery recycling infrastructure in North America,” he stated. “This joint venture is a significant step toward realizing a circular economy for batteries, which is essential for building a sustainable mobility society.”

In rural South Carolina, there’s not an abundance of opportunities.
He quickly proved his capabilities, and convinced the farmer to hand over two sows, or adult female pigs.
At one point, he was offered a chance to purchase one of the largest hog farming operations in southeast South Carolina.
In January, at just 25 years old, Streeter was named Farmer of the Year by the South Carolina Farmer and Agribusiness Association at their annual conference.","Evan Streeter specifically remembers one crisp October morning last year when one of his sows was nursing a litter of 16 piglets. The sun was bursting through the trees and in the distance, orange, red and yellow leaves gently danced in the morning breeze.

“I mean there’s nothing like that – it’s incredible,” Streeter said proudly.

A first-generation farmer, the 25-year-old is the owner of Streeter Heritage Farms in Chester, South Carolina. He raises pigs and tends to his vegetables the way nature intended. Streeter believes that treating animals and the earth with care results in a healthier product on our tables, and prioritizes the care of his livestock over profit.

An early start to farming

At 12-years-old, Streeter was handed a hen who couldn’t lay eggs anymore. For the older farmer, the hen was no longer of any use, but Streeter made it his top mission to nurture and comfort her. “I would go out there and take care of her, and in my eyes, I was a big time farmer,” he exclaimed.

After a week of caring for the hen, he walked out to check on her after school and found little brown eggs laying in the nest. “That was definitely when I got hooked,” he said.

After graduating from high school, he knew he had to pave his own way in life.

In rural South Carolina, there’s not an abundance of opportunities. While the state’s job growth outpaced that of other states since 2020, most of those jobs are in manufacturing. A local farmer offered Streeter room and board in exchange for a job as a farm-hand.

Streeter knew this was an opportunity he couldn’t turn down.

He quickly proved his capabilities, and convinced the farmer to hand over two sows, or adult female pigs. From those first two sows, Streeter expanded his first farming operation to more than 20 pigs, and just five years later, he was named South Carolina Hog Farmer of the Year.

Opportunities continued to emerge for Streeter. At one point, he was offered a chance to purchase one of the largest hog farming operations in southeast South Carolina. The massive operation had four confinement houses with approximately 2,500 sows, and produced 75,000 piglets each year.

Before finalizing the sale, he spent a week at the farm familiarizing himself with operations. He described it as the worst experience of his life.

“Every sow in there had sores on their shoulders, sores on their hips,” said Streeter. “A third of them had blood on their mouths from chewing on the metal bars in front of them.”

Streeter said the smells were awful and most of the sows were kept in four-foot long by two-foot wide cages where they couldn’t even turn around.

“All of the sows looked really sad and depressed, heads hanging low, ears hanging low, they didn’t really look happy at all.”

After spending only one week there, he was horrified. He knew that farming was a business and understood that animals are a source of food, but he felt that there had to be a better way.

Changing the status quo

Streeter walked away from that job, but had to come up with a different plan to fulfill his dream. He wanted to raise pigs that would be healthy and safe for humans to eat, while also treating the animals with care and dignity.

The experience from working at a commercial pig operation helped shape the guiding principles that would be part of Streeter Heritage Farms.

In January, at just 25 years old, Streeter was named Farmer of the Year by the South Carolina Farmer and Agribusiness Association at their annual conference.

Today Streeter’s farm is a place where livestock is raised the way nature intended, as he puts it, with conservation and animal happiness a top priority. The pigs are raised in open pastures and in woodland environments.

“I believe this results in a more beneficial product for our consumers as well as America’s ecosystem,” said Streeter.

After eight years, Streeter now has 60 sows, roaming 20 acres of free range forest land. He raises about 1,000 piglets each year.

“My story is a dream come true one,” Streeter said.

While only a fraction of what a corporate farm might produce, he fulfilled his promise to respect animals, and is providing a healthier, cleaner food source for his customers.",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/latest-news/331lgi/picture309006865/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Streeter_main.jpeg,N,,2025-06-20 12:26:14.006737

To help businesses advance their net-zero transformation and seize future opportunities, RECCESSARY, a new energy and carbon market media platform, and EnergyOMNI, a net-zero knowledge platform, jointly hosted the New Energy and Carbon Market Business Forum on June 19. The event brought together industry leaders and experts to unpack global trends and investment opportunities, drawing over a hundred participants from the business, academic, and civil sectors.

RECCESSARY founder and CEO Jason Huang said the motivation behind the forum was the belief that media organizations shouldn’t just compete but also collaborate. He pointed out the significant information gap in the global conversation on new energy and carbon topics and expressed the hope that RECCESSARY’s editorial and research teams could help assign value to quality information.

EnergyOMNI founder Joi Wu noted that this year marks the platform’s fourth anniversary. She emphasized that media’s core function is not only to deliver news, but also to engage in policymaking and facilitate public dialogue across industries. Through in-depth observation, she said, media can help the public better understand complex developments in specific sectors.

Tze-luen Lin, Deputy Executive Director of the Executive Yuan’s Office of Energy and Carbon Reduction, shared that he has been involved in decarbonization for two decades. He noted that this year marks the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement, and that global discussions are accelerating. Since the approval of Article 6 last year, carbon market development has gained momentum. He stressed that keeping global warming under 1.5°C is now a central issue.

VPPs development depends on market mechanisms

The first half of the forum focused on virtual power plants (VPPs), hydrogen, and electricity trading platforms, exploring both challenges and opportunities in the market.

George Hsu, Chair of the Taiwan Industry-Academia Technology Alliance for Energy Digital Transformation (TAEDT), gave a talk titled From Policy to Practice: Building Supportive Regulations and Market Mechanisms for VPPs. Citing data from the U.S. Department of Energy, he said VPPs are expected to replace 10%–20% of peak-load power plants by 2030, saving $10 billion annually in grid costs. Hsu believes Taiwan should aim for at least 15%–25% of its peak capacity to come from VPPs, and emphasized that VPPs must rely on market mechanisms to scale.

To reach commercialization, VPPs need to overcome five major challenges:

Expand distributed energy resources (DERs)

Simplify the registration process for VPPs

Improve standardization in VPP operations

Integrate VPPs into utility planning and incentive structures

Enable VPP participation in the wholesale electricity market

Roger Chen, Head of Enel X Taiwan, gave a presentation titled VPPs: Turning Electricity Costs into Business Opportunities for Sustainability and Innovation. He said achieving net zero will require more flexible demand response. Taiwan experiences peak demand for about 200 hours per year—just 2% of the total 8,760 hours. Demand response, he argued, is a fast and cost-effective way to meet peak loads. For companies, participating in VPPs brings added revenue, improved sustainability, greater reliability, and stronger grid resilience.

Jeffery Shan, Vice President of Merchant and Clean Energy at Linde LienHwa Industrial Gases, spoke on Seizing the Hydrogen Opportunity in Asia-Pacific: A Supply Chain Strategy. Linde LienHwa Industrial Gases has been producing hydrogen for over 30 years, and by Q3 this year, it expects to complete two hydrogen refueling stations in partnership with CPC Corporation. This would mark the beginning of Taiwan’s hydrogen-powered transportation era. Given the lack of low-carbon hydrogen in Taiwan, hydrogen may not be suitable for power generation, but it can serve as long-duration energy storage using surplus renewable power during peak times, helping reduce grid stress.

Yu-Tien Chiu, Vice President of Taiwan Smart Electricity & Energy（TSEE）, discussed Electricity Retail Platforms: Offshore Wind Procurement Flexibility and Opportunities. TSEE is the 100th licensed electricity retailer in Taiwan. According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, renewable power demand is projected to reach 48 billion kWh by 2030 and 100 billion kWh by 2040.

However, companies still face challenges when procuring offshore wind power, such as banks requiring minimum purchase volumes of 50MW and contracts of 25–30 years, often with the need for international credit ratings. To address this, TSEE plans to aggregate 1GW in purchases, mainly from offshore wind farms sites 3-1 and 3-2, providing businesses with more flexible procurement options.

Beyond borders: carbon markets and corporate entry points

The second half of the forum focused on carbon trading, carbon removal, and biochar sinks, outlining how companies can position themselves and track emerging market trends.

Nadine Lim, International Policy Analyst at the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), shared insights on Current Status of Carbon Markets in Asia and Worldwide. She observed that Asia is poised to lead in the growth of carbon pricing mechanisms over the next few years, with many countries considering carbon taxes or emissions trading systems.

Based on IETA’s modeling, if countries collaborate under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and allow mitigation where it is most cost-effective, global emission reduction costs could drop by $250 billion annually by 2030. Lim added that the boundary between domestic and international carbon markets is becoming increasingly blurred. The EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) has encouraged other countries to develop their own pricing schemes and even design their own versions of CBAM.

Sherry Hu, Carbon Market Analyst at RECCESSARY, presented on Corporate Approaches to Carbon Trading. She noted that the voluntary carbon market has started to stabilize after two years of decline. When it comes to managing carbon credit quality, the risk of greenwashing remains significant and must be addressed with caution.

She pointed out that beyond buying and selling, companies can take on five roles in the carbon market:

Strategy management

Operational oversight

Project development

Data and trend analysis

Market matchmaking

These roles help build a more complete ecosystem where buyers, consultants, platforms, and developers all have a role to play.

Tank Chen, Co-founder of CDR.fyi, presented New Business in Carbon Removal: Trends and Strategic Insights. He emphasized that simply reducing emissions will no longer suffice to keep global warming below 1.5°C. Investment in carbon removal technologies is now essential. Chen outlined five roles that companies can take in this emerging field:

Technology developer

Project developer

Value chain supplier (e.g., raw materials, energy, logistics)

Financier

Buyer

Peter Peng, Managing Director of Guangtai Environmental Energy (TCHAR), a biochar manufacturer, focused on Biochar Carbon Sinks: How Companies Can Invest in Carbon Market. He explained that biochar has a wide range of applications—from agriculture and pollution control to advanced material use. TCHAR is actively expanding biochar into plastics, sports gear, construction materials, and cosmetics. The company also uses digital monitoring, reporting, and verification (dMRV) tools to ensure full transparency and regulatory compliance in its operations.

To foster dialogue and engagement, the forum included networking lunches, tea breaks, and panel discussions. These interactions helped companies better understand decarbonization strategies and navigate shifting market dynamics, strengthening their green competitiveness.",https://www.reccessary.com/data/news/cover/1750379616822496287.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 12:24:02.036106

The spot price for Mono PERC modules of less than 450 W EXW East Coast Warehouse (from distributors to installers) also stood stable at $0.325/W.
Trade groups, like the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), say they are pushing for additional changes.
A developer said he is mostly focused on the threat of a new anti-dumping/countervailing duties investigation opening into suppliers operating out of Laos and Indonesia.
“I think whatever (the situation) is, whether the reciprocal tariffs stay as is, or there's an AD/CVD case, the clock is ticking on Laos and Indonesia supply,” he said.","The spread between panel prices from Indonesia/Laos and from India compared with the average OPIS DDP US price has widened from 2.65% point in early April 2025 to 11.74% point this week. The market is increasingly nervous about the threat of a new anti-dumping and countervailing duties investigation opening into suppliers operating out of Laos and Indonesia which had recently become an important source of panel supply to the US market.

The spot price for TOPCon over 600 W modules DDP US rose 0.76% this week to $0.264/W, with quotes for cargoes from Southeast Asia rising 0.39% to $0.257/W and quotes for cargoes from India stable week-over-week at $0.288/W. The spot price for Mono PERC modules of less than 450 W EXW East Coast Warehouse (from distributors to installers) also stood stable at $0.325/W.

Quotes for US-assembled modules with imported cells continue to be heard between $0.26/W and $0.33/W, while modules with domestic content – which are still limited to just a handful of producers – are generally quoted between $0.4/W and $0.5/W.

The U.S. Senate Finance Committee on Monday released an updated budget draft proposal that softens some of the stricter changes to clean energy incentives included in the House version.

In perhaps the most newsworthy modification, the draft provides some breathing room for solar developers hoping to secure eligibility for the Investment Tax Credit (ITC or 48E, worth up to 30% of eligible costs) and the Production Tax Credit (PTC or 45Y, worth $0.60 per kWh produced), both of which were established by 2022's Inflation Reduction Act and have driven a record boom in new solar power on the U.S. grid.

For solar and wind, 48E and 45Y would drop to 60% of their value for projects that start construction in 2026, and to 20% for projects that break ground in 2027, before phasing out entirely by 2028. The previous version of the bill would have denied the credits to any project not under construction within 60 days of the bill's enactment and in service before 2029.

Generally, the industry has viewed this update as relatively good news in light of the worse alternatives. Trade groups, like the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), say they are pushing for additional changes.

The bill fleshes out ‘Foreign entity of concern’ (FEOC) restrictions with cost ratio thresholds to determine ‘material assistance,’ which scale up from 40% next year to 60% after 2029.

In a statement, Mike Carr, Executive Director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition, applauded the Senate for restricting Chinese firms' access to the Advanced Clean Energy Manufacturing Credit (or 45X) and “making the domestic content bonus more effective.”

But he said the phaseout of the ITC (which originally kept its full value into the early 2030s) makes these changes “functionally irrelevant.” Senate Republicans have said they are aiming to get a bill to President Trump by July 4.

The budget proposal that passed through the House last month would have blocked ITC and PTC eligibility for any project not under construction within 60 days of the budget becoming law, a window that would have likely closed sometime in the fall.

Though Monday evening’s updated budget bill provides two years of breathing room, a U.S. developer source said the threat of the 60-day window was enough to start a rush for modules. Had the 60-day window stuck, he said, the rush would have been exaggerated.

That source said this anticipation – of disruptions to both domestic and trade policy – has applied the “little bit of upward pressure” that imports from Southeast Asia have seen recently.

A developer said he is mostly focused on the threat of a new anti-dumping/countervailing duties investigation opening into suppliers operating out of Laos and Indonesia.

“I think whatever (the situation) is, whether the reciprocal tariffs stay as is, or there's an AD/CVD case, the clock is ticking on Laos and Indonesia supply,” he said. “If you significantly choke off that (cell) supply, there's not much else out there right now.”",https://www.pv-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OPIS-PVMag_20250620_Graph.v1-1200x665.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 10:11:27.706131

Still, Allen said he will aggressively pursue adjustments that would restore funding to the environmental agency.","Mayor Muriel Bowser’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget, currently being considered by the D.C. Council, is on pace to slash 24.1% from the Department of Energy and the Environment.

The potential cuts are sounding alarms for D.C. environmentalists who fear the move will seriously damage the city’s climate.

Several groups representing clean river and energy initiatives rallied on the steps of the John A. Wilson Building on Pennsylvania Avenue on Monday to bring attention to the issue.

Ward 6 Council member Charles Allen, who chairs the Committee on Transportation and the Environment, is looking for ways to restore funding to critical environmental measures, and shares their concerns.

“It really is a devastating cut to a big part of our city’s priorities, and we’re working hard to figure out how to reverse it,” Allen said.

“(DOEE) is the only agency seeing a cut like that,” Allen added. “It’s really going to hurt our ability to deliver affordable utilities, being able to help have clean energy, be able to clean up the Anacostia River.”

He pointed to proposed changes to the city’s five-cent tax on plastic bags, which was enacted in 2009 with a promise to residents that proceeds would pay for programs improving the health of the Anacostia River.

The proposed budget now treats the bag fee as a general tax, not specifically for the Anacostia cleanup.

“The mayor’s proposal just swipes all that money. It’s just a tax, and I think it’s a broken promise to the residents,” Allen said, underscoring the move means the city can’t clean up the river.

“There are a lot of tough decisions in this budget across all of our clusters,” Bowser, who is navigating the toughest budget condition of her tenure, told WTOP on Wednesday at the opening of a Southwest upscale housing development, The Stacks, in Buzzard Point.

Congressional intervention has resulted in the city having to cut more than $1 billion over the next five years, she said. The mayor was able to accommodate an immediate $347 million cut affecting the current budget cycle without layoffs or significant reductions in services.

“The government’s utility costs have increased more than 50% in the last five years, with about the same usage,” the mayor said, adding that the spending pressures have to be addressed somehow.

“Any moves within the budget means something else has to get moved, unless the council raises taxes,” she said — something Bowser is resolved to not do.

Still, Allen said he will aggressively pursue adjustments that would restore funding to the environmental agency.

“When we talk about energy and the environment, these aren’t things that are kind of nice to have,” Allen said. “These are generational consequences we live with.”

He thinks that if the D.C. government doesn’t repair the deficits in its proposed budget, the city will see “generational and lasting damage, and we’re working hard to fix it and overturn it.”

The idea was to set up a picture of the global economy, add on some estimates of the economic costs of warming with a “damage function,” plus estimates of what climate policy would cost, and all adjusted with a discount term to account for how people value current production more than future production (according to economists, at least). That way you can calculate an “optimal” climate policy in the form of a carbon tax that would precisely compensate for warming damages without burdening the economy too much.

At the time, I wrote an extensive critique of the model, focused mainly on its damage function. For this, Nordhaus used a smooth quadratic equation, meaning it ruled out the possibility of any sharp upward breaks from tipping-point effects, like the Arctic Ocean becoming permanently ice-free or Siberian permafrost melting and releasing massive amounts of methane. Following Nordhaus’s advice to let warming drift up to 3.5 degrees Celsius, I argued, would be taking a hideous risk.

Fast-forward seven years, and it turns out that I was wrong: The economic damage of climate change is already much, much worse than DICE predicted, and the economic cost of policy to fix climate change is actually negative. I would like to apologize for the error.

More from Ryan Cooper

On the first point, Bloomberg Intelligence has the details in a new report estimating that climate disasters cost America $955 billion in the 12-month period ending May 1 this year, or about 3 percent of GDP. This mainly comes from skyrocketing home insurance premiums, which have doubled since 2017, as well as expensive weather disasters, like the one-two punch of Hurricanes Helene and Milton ($113 billion) and the Los Angeles fires ($65 billion).

Now, some caveats are in order. This is just one year in one country, and damages are surely not uniform across the globe. Additionally, much of the disaster response shows up as more spending that is included in GDP. But undoubtedly most of it must be counted as damage, as it involves spending to replace structures or infrastructure that otherwise would have gone to productive business, particularly in the context of a low-unemployment, high-interest-rate economy. As the Bloomberg analysis argues, disaster spending is “crowding out consumer discretionary spending elsewhere in the economy and putting pressure on local governments to prioritize disaster repair over other infrastructure projects.”

Ultimately, the Bloomberg analysis is very straightforward and plausible. Home insurance is obviously in crisis because of weather disasters that are obviously caused by climate change. And however you slice it, 3 percent of GDP is wildly outside the range of the 2018 DICE model, which predicts a hit of just 0.5 percent of GDP from 1.47 degrees Celsius of warming (the global average of 2024). If we’re off by a factor of six in the world’s second-largest economy, then something is seriously amiss.

On the second point about the costs of climate action, we have a natural experiment in the form of Donald Trump attempting to tear up President Biden’s climate policy. A recent analysis from Yale’s REPEAT Project estimates that should this effort succeed, by 2035 it will raise American household and business energy costs by more than $50 billion per year, or $270 to $415 per household; reduce capital investment in electricity generation and clean fuels production by $1 trillion; threaten $522 billion in existing investment in clean energy and manufacturing; end the battery manufacturing boom; and seriously hinder new electricity generation projects, thus increasing average electricity bills by about 9 percent by 2030, or up to 17 percent in some states, including Pennsylvania and Texas. An analysis by Energy Innovation estimated that by 2030, Trump would destroy 1.7 million jobs and reduce U.S. GDP by $320 billion per year.

The reason is obvious: Renewable energy is now the cheapest kind of energy, and it’s getting cheaper every year. Just since 2018, the price of lithium batteries has fallen by 47 percent; the price of solar panels has fallen by 35 percent. New green technology using that ever-cheaper power to produce carbon-free concrete, steel, and so on will clearly drive global economic growth for the rest of this century at least. Trump’s plan to force Americans to keep paying for uneconomical coal plants is not unlike the Soviet obsession with filth-spewing heavy industry that was already outdated by the 1950s. Trump’s administration will cede the industries of the future to China and Europe for the foreseeable future.

To Nordhaus’s credit, he published an updated version of DICE in 2023 taking critiques like mine into account, particularly raising much more caution about high levels of warming. “Note that the damage function has been calibrated for damage estimates with temperature increases up to 4 °C and is not well-suited for temperature increases above that range,” he writes in the instruction manual. Still, even this model only estimates a 1.6 percent hit to GDP for three degrees of warming—far too small.

I don’t think that Trump is much concerned with economic estimates of anything, least of all climate change. He isn’t ripping up the Inflation Reduction Act because of the DICE model. Like all fascisms, MAGA is a movement of irrational cultural grievance bent on evil for its own sake. Wind turbines, solar panels, and EVs are liberal-coded, and therefore must be destroyed, regardless of the heavy collateral damage to conservative regions like, again, Texas.",https://prospect.org/downloads/23087/download/Cooper-Climate%20costs%20062025.jpg?cb=31703be6da26da26e55eff6235d29706&w=1024,N,,2025-06-20 08:09:37.312943

China is taking continuous efforts in improving the electric vehicle charging infrastructure. For instance, China installed 284,000 public EV charging outlets in 2020, including 112,000 in December alone. China had over 800,000 publicly available EV charging outlets installed at the end of 2020 – up from 516,000 in 2019 and 300,000 in 2018. In Japan, automobile industry giants are forming partnerships to expand electric vehicle charging stations network across Japan, which supplements the market growth. For instance, in April 2022, Porsche Japan and Audi Japan formed a premium charging alliance business partnership to expand the 150kW rapid charging stations across Japan. This alliance will enable Porsche and Audi owners to utilize the 50 Porsche Turbocharger units at 41 locations and the 52 units nationwide from Audi Japan, by the end of 2022.

The growth of the global electric vehicle charging station market is propelling, due to rise in adoption of electric vehicles owing to government initiatives. However, high cost of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and lack of standardization of current EV charging infrastructure are the factors hampering the growth of the market. Furthermore, incorporation of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) EV charging stations is the factor expected to offer growth opportunities during the forecast period.

Many states in the Great Lakes region—Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Minnesota among them—are offering tax credits and incentives for data center developments.
The Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity has approved tax breaks for more than 20 data centers since 2020.
“Hyperscale data centers are the really large data centers that are being built now for [generative] AI, which is really driving a lot of the growth in this sector because it requires vast data processing capabilities,” said Volzer.
In Minooka, the village would still have to develop the infrastructure to get reclaimed water to the data center.","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

While Pennsylvania is poised to see an economic boost as companies like Amazon and Microsoft move into the state, Illinois is already a top destination for data centers, and more are headed to that state. One small Chicago suburb alone has approved one large complex and has proposals for two more.

Once they’re online, data centers require a lot of electricity, which is helping drive rates up around the country and grabbing headlines. What gets less attention is how much water they need, both to generate that electricity and dissipate the heat from the servers powering cloud computing, storage and artificial intelligence.

A high-volume “hyperscale” data center uses the same amount of water in a year as 12,000 to 60,000 people, said Helena Volzer, a senior source water policy manager for the environmental nonprofit Alliance for the Great Lakes.

Increasingly, residents, legislators and freshwater advocacy groups are calling for municipalities to more carefully consider where the water that supplies these data centers will come from and how it will be managed. Even in the water-rich Great Lakes region, those are important questions as erratic weather patterns fueled by climate change affect water resources.

When it comes to siting data centers, “we don’t see a lot of coordination or long-term thinking about water,” said Michelle Stockness, executive director of Freshwater Society, a nonprofit focused on water preservation. Some places cannot support data centers, she said, “and you’ll have water-use conflicts if you put them there.”

Illinois already has more than 220 data centers, and a growing number of communities interested in the attendant tax revenue are trying to entice companies to build even more. Many states in the Great Lakes region—Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Minnesota among them—are offering tax credits and incentives for data center developments. The Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity has approved tax breaks for more than 20 data centers since 2020.

“Hyperscale data centers are the really large data centers that are being built now for [generative] AI, which is really driving a lot of the growth in this sector because it requires vast data processing capabilities,” said Volzer. “The trend is larger and bigger centers to feed this demand for AI.”

Much of the water used in data centers never gets back into the watershed, particularly if the data center uses a method called evaporative cooling. Even if that water does go back into the ecosystem, deep bedrock aquifers, like the Mahomet in central Illinois, can take centuries to recharge. In the Great Lakes, just 1 percent of the water is renewed each year from rain, runoff and groundwater.

“You have to think of [water] as a bank account. What is the input? What is the output? What is your nest egg in there? And how fast are you drawing it down?” said Carrie Jennings, the research and policy director at Freshwater Society. “That’s where groundwater governance, your Illinois State Water Survey and your empowered local groups that have the right data to work with can think about managing this system.”

In Illinois, 40 percent of the population gets its water from aquifers. In some places, like Chicago’s southwest suburbs in Will and Kendall counties, the amount of water in those aquifers is dwindling.

To ensure that they can supply citizens with safe drinking water, officials from six suburbs southwest of Chicago—Joliet, Channahon, Crest Hill, Minooka, Romeoville and Shorewood—made an agreement with the city two years ago to buy millions of gallons of water a day from Lake Michigan. They are currently building a $1.5 billion pipeline to transport the water, which is expected to be completed by 2030.

Illinois is unique among the Great Lakes states when it comes to water. The Great Lakes Compact each state signed in 2008 bans diversions of water from the lakes to communities outside the basin, but it makes an exception for Illinois thanks to a 1967 Supreme Court ruling allowing Chicago to sell water to farther-flung municipalities.

“We are concerned about the planning of the explosion of data centers, and if these far-out suburbs are actually accounting for that,” said Iyana Simba, city government affairs director for the Illinois Environmental Council. “How much of that was taken into account when they did their initial planning to purchase water from the city of Chicago? This isn’t reused wastewater. This is drinking water.”

Last year, Equinix Inc. proposed building a data center in Minooka. If it’s approved, it could use 30 percent of the drinking water allocated to that municipality from the new pipeline.

The company would prefer to use reclaimed water, according to Michelle Lindeman, a spokesperson for Equinix, and a law passed in May by state legislators explicitly permits that.

The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency already allowed reclaimed water to be used for industrial purposes in certain circumstances, but the agency has only permitted one facility to use treated wastewater discharge. The new law clarifies that companies can apply for permits to use treated municipal wastewater for industrial purposes, and the agency said it will apply existing regulations to approve or deny those applications.

“Where the data centers want to set up is not where we have great water resources [in Illinois], but we do have water reclamation facilities that generate water every day,” said Tim Gualandri, president of the Illinois section of the WateReuse Association. The trade group, which focuses on “recycled water” policy, is working with municipalities and state agencies to develop regulations.

“We just want to tap into that resource so that we can attract industries, grow our jobs and continue to grow economic development here,” Gualandri added.

In Minooka, the village would still have to develop the infrastructure to get reclaimed water to the data center.

Non-disclosure agreements that companies ask municipalities to sign when they propose a data center further obscure how much water is needed and where it would come from, making it difficult to determine whether municipalities have enough supply, said Volzer, with Alliance for the Great Lakes.

To help combat that, some states in the region like Ohio and Indiana are now conducting regional water-demand studies, which would help communities determine where water is available before approving a data center. Some water managers are also conducting those studies in Illinois, but they are not required.

A bill proposed in February by Illinois state Sen. Steve Stadelman would have required data centers to disclose how much electricity and water they use, but lawmakers failed to vote on it before the legislative session ended May 31.

“The Great Lakes region is seen as water-rich. And it’s true, we have a lot of water here, but there’s an important detail not to be missed: Water abundance requires proper management to ensure that it’s available going forward,” Volzer said. “Our surface water is connected to our groundwater supply.”

Ordinances in other Great Lakes states could serve as a model for how to regulate water diverted to data centers, she added. In Michigan, for example, companies proposing data centers must show that there is enough existing water supply to support the facility in order to get the state tax incentive.

“With all of this demand, and with climate change, it seems prudent to start making these legislative changes now,” said Volzer.

“We’ve lost the culture war on climate,” Harvard law professor and former Obama administration adviser Jody Freeman told Politico last Wednesday. The article amounts to a dry eulogy for efforts to combat climate change, with Freeman’s refrain that the climate movement failed to go mainstream in the background. What goes unmentioned: Freeman’s extracurricular work as oil industry whisperer.

Freeman served on ConocoPhillips’s board of directors from 2013 to 2023, making over $350,000 a year from the oil and gas giant. She resigned after pushback from Harvard students and activists during the fight against the Willow Project, ConocoPhillips’s $8 billion drilling effort in the Alaskan wilderness. But she has retained her position on the climate advisory board at Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which manages Norway’s sovereign wealth fund. The fund, whose current value is estimated to be around $1.75 trillion, is commonly known as the Oil Fund because it exists to invest the nation’s substantial petroleum revenue in global companies—including in oil and gas.

“There’s no way around it: The left strategy on climate needs to be rethought,” Freeman told Politico. “We have to figure out a way for it to not be a niche leftist movement.” Asked about what a better strategy would look like, she admitted that she “struggled” to articulate it, but offered up two ideas: more fracked gas, and making it easier to permit energy infrastructure. This is not a new strategy at all, but the same old industry-friendly playbook: slow the transition to renewables in the name of a “bridge” fuel, and make it easier for fossil fuel infrastructure to dodge the environmental review process and public-interest litigation that has dogged short-sighted projects like the Willow Project.

Freeman hasn’t updated her priors since the “all of the above” energy politics of the Obama administration in which she served. But over the past decade, research into natural gas’s impact on warming the planet has dramatically evolved. Methane leaks at every stage of the gas supply chain, and is majorly undercounted by national inventories. This is especially alarming because methane has over 80 times more warming power than carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after its release. In 2022, gas pipelines in the Permian Basin were found to leak at rates 14 times higher than the Environmental Protection Agency’s estimate.

ConocoPhillips is a major oil and gas producer in the Permian Basin; its business is so pollution-intensive that in 2019 the Norwegian government told NBIM to divest its $714 million stake in ConocoPhillips, while keeping significant shares in dozens of other oil majors with more diversified assets.

The methane fee in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was one of the Biden administration’s strongest steps to curb fossil fuel pollution, incentivizing gas operators to curb methane leaks, venting, and flaring by fining “excess” releases above a certain threshold. Now, Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress are blocking the fee from being implemented. Scientists with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in a major climate report in 2022 that we have the tools we need to decarbonize; what we lack is the political will. This moment starkly reflects that limitation.

The existential question of what we can still save deserves more than status quo apologism. Freeman embodies the futility of a particular kind of intervention: being the better angel at the tables of powerful decision-makers who profit from continuing business as usual. During her decade-long tenure at ConocoPhillips, abruptly capped during the Willow Project’s controversial advancement, the company increased oil and gas production. Freeman’s current role advising NBIM, the largest single owner of global stocks, owning about 1.5 percent of all shares in the world’s listed companies, magnifies the stakes and limitations of this approach.

Oil to Oil, Gas to Gas

Oil was first discovered offshore of Norway by ConocoPhillips, then known as Phillips, in 1969. Norway established the Oil Fund in 1990 to funnel drilling revenue from companies like Phillips into a diversified fund that invests in international companies, including those same oil and gas companies. As of 2024, the fund owns shares in almost 500 energy and utility companies around the world, including a 4.4 percent stake in BP, a 2.78 percent stake in Shell, a 1.46 percent stake in ExxonMobil, and a 1.14 percent stake in Chevron. NBIM has frozen its 0.86 percent stake in Gazprom during Putin’s war on Ukraine, as the value of its shares cratered from $932.1 million in 2021 to $13.6 million in 2024.

While the fund’s revenue stream comes from oil and gas and continues to be invested in oil and gas, NBIM positions itself as a global leader in responsible investing. Freeman is one of four external advisers brought on in 2023 to NBIM’s climate advisory board to shape their climate action plan and broader management of climate “risk and opportunities.” According to the Oil Fund’s 2025 climate action plan, “It is the goal of our responsible investment management for our portfolio companies to align their activities with global net zero emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.” Yet the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement—to limit planetary warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit—has likely already been missed. The consequences of exceeding this threshold will be catastrophic for many.

NBIM claims that “the heart of our efforts is driving portfolio companies to net zero emissions by 2050 through credible targets and transition plans for reducing their scope 1, scope 2 and material scope 3 emissions.” But when NBIM votes against climate resolutions brought by other shareholders at oil and gas companies in which they own stakes, it often justifies this by stating that it won’t support shareholder proposals when a company “does not appear to have significant gaps in their management or reporting of the relevant sustainability risk.”

During Freeman’s tenure on NBIM’s climate advisory board, NBIM used that justification to vote against:

A resolution calling for Southern Company to adopt greenhouse gas emissions targets aligned with the Paris Agreement;

A resolution calling for Shell to disclose its demand forecast for liquefied natural gas and how its new capital expenditure on gas infrastructure is consistent with its climate commitments;

Two resolutions calling for Phillips 66 to publish a report on the impacts of reduced virgin plastic demand;

A resolution calling for NextEra to report on its climate lobbying; and

A resolution calling for Chevron to commission a third-party assessment of implementation of its human rights policy, among many others.

None of this resembles pushing fossil fuel companies to take action to decarbonize their operations at the speed and scale consistent with global need.

In 2023, NBIM voted against 17 of 21 resolutions at 16 different companies that would have supported better climate management or disclosure, according to a report by Norwegian organization Framtiden i våre hender (The future in our hands). The 21 resolutions examined in the report were a small sample flagged as critical resolutions by advocacy organizations, but the extent of this pattern is likely far greater. NBIM votes on 110,000 resolutions a year, at over 11,000 annual shareholder meetings.

We are currently losing the battle against climate change; that much is clear. But it’s quite the handy misdirection for Freeman, who is used to sitting at the most powerful tables, to place the blame for that on the shoulders of the relatively powerless political left. Climate change is not a “niche left” issue. A 2024 study published in Nature found that an overwhelming global majority—89 percent—want their national governments to do more to fight climate change. The authors described the world as being in “a state of pluralistic ignorance, wherein individuals around the globe systematically underestimate the willingness of their fellow citizens to act.”

If so many people want to see greater action on climate, what is really standing in the way? Is it the political left? Or maybe it’s those with trillion-dollar houses of cards built on the bedrock of the status quo?",https://prospect.org/downloads/23082/download/RDP%20062025.jpg?cb=1ce2e703128525c8ecf4708f1d97e19a&w=1024,N,,2025-06-20 07:03:52.435638

Carbon capture isn’t just about compliance — it enables a job engine.","We see that Louisiana is poised for healthy job growth across the state if we don’t mess up this historic opportunity. The future of energy is a big part of driving that potential. Traditional oil and gas production remains a centerpiece of the state’s capability in energy.

Now, as global markets demand cleaner energy solutions, new products and technologies are driving investment, including blue and green hydrogen, blue and green ammonia, liquefied natural gas, biofuels, direct air capture and data centers for artificial intelligence. Nearly all of these and more are enabled by a key technology: carbon capture, utilization and storage — abbreviated CCUS.

Louisiana is fortunate to have a great geographic location for economic development as well as unique geological advantages. Our underground geology makes carbon capture attractive here. In turn, that advantage is presenting parishes and regions with big opportunities for statewide job creation projects. With $23 billion in CCUS-related investments projected to generate 4,500 construction jobs, Louisiana is poised for a wave of economic growth.

The stakes couldn’t be higher. If we fail to lead in carbon management, nearby state competitors like Texas and global competitors like China and Japan will, costing Louisiana billions in investment and thousands of jobs.

LNG exports are now a cornerstone of Louisiana’s economy, supporting thousands of jobs and billions in investment. In some cases, this export network is happening entirely intrastate, such as natural gas from the north Louisiana’s Haynesville Shale being exported in south Louisiana as LNG.

But as international markets demand cleaner energy, integrating CCUS is and will be essential to ensuring Louisiana’s energy industry remains competitive. Without carbon capture, economic development projects such as LNG exporters, biofuels, hydrogen or ammonia projects and data centers will risk missing emissions targets, putting economic development projects and thousands of jobs in jeopardy.

Carbon capture isn’t just about compliance — it enables a job engine. Building infrastructure for CCUS will fuel Louisiana’s construction sector, while captured CO2 supports enhanced oil recovery, synthetic fuels and advanced materials — reinforcing our leadership in energy innovation.

As we’ve already seen with the Meta data center in north Louisiana, our state is uniquely positioned to become a national hub for more AI-driven data centers — energy-intensive facilities driving AI, cloud computing and digital services. While renewable power generation is expanding, it alone cannot provide the round-the-clock reliability that these facilities require, so natural gas combined with CCUS is critical in the near term for low-carbon power generation. CCUS and direct air capture allow Louisiana to offer a stable, low-carbon energy mix, making our state a prime destination for high-tech investment.

We believe the future of Louisiana’s economy depends on decisive action and a statewide strategy. The Legislature is working to ensure servitude and property owners’ rights are protected while Louisiana scales up to the global needs enabled by carbon capture. Further, the ability to safely capture and monitor CO2 thousands of feet underground with no risk to the water table has already been established.

With billions in investment on the horizon, Louisiana has a chance to lead. Investing in CCUS secures our energy future, protects existing jobs and can extend the prosperity for our state.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/99/099454b3-4e85-5932-a6a2-38557e6e6308/66f6e36c27809.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-06-20 11:11:47.427481

Billed as a way to fight climate change and boost the state economy, lawmakers in both parties fought off efforts to ban such operations or to even allow local control over the planning.

Opponents of carbon capture voice several concerns, namely the minimal impact on the state carbon footprint, the industry's reliance on federal subsidies and potential threats to local communities' health and safety.

The industry plan is to inject concentrated carbon waste into depleted oil reservoirs or other underground formations and keep it there forever. But scientists say this can’t be guaranteed. By nature, carbon seeks vertical escape, and its movement can cause seismic shift, release arsenic and lead into water and, in large enough quantities, cause asphyxiation.

As professors of property law, we see one threat the Legislature failed to adequately address: that carbon-capture technology will erode Louisianians’ traditional property rights.

Within limits, property owners have the right to be free from unwanted intrusions, to decide whether to keep or sell their land and to seek compensation from those who degrade their resources. With carbon capture, these rights are being renegotiated.

Let’s start with an intrusion, otherwise known as trespass.

Imagine a plume of pressurized carbon waste escapes from an underground reservoir and migrates into the mineral layers below your land, where it causes lead and arsenic to leach into your crawfish pond or causes shifts in the foundation of your home. Is this a trespass? We don’t know. In Louisiana, and in many other states, the law against trespass is unsettled where carbon is concerned.

Now consider an owner’s right to keep or sell. Generally, the law protects us from being forced to sell or lease our property to another private party. There are exceptions. Louisiana allows private utilities, within certain limits, to take private land (with compensation) for the purpose of building transmission cables or pipelines. We justify this because the infrastructure provides a product to the public at-large (electricity, natural gas).

The state Legislature earlier expanded this process to include carbon-capture pipelines. Unlike utilities, these pipeline are part of a private industry’s waste disposal system. Why should individual landowners subsidize that?

Finally, consider the possibility of an accident — an explosion, an earth tremor, a massive leak — that hurts nearby property owners or the public more generally. Tort law generally holds a property owner liable for damage caused to neighboring properties or to other people due to their negligent or reckless activities.

But carbon capture legislation has altered this arrangement as well. Louisiana law holds the carbon-capture company liable only for the first 50 years and only as to certain kinds of damage. After that, all liability is assumed by the state.

The 2025 legislative session saw several attempts, and failures, to address these concerns. Bills aimed at giving parish authorities autonomy over carbon capture permits did not make it out of committee. House Bill 691, which requires reporting of carbon capture failures, has been sent to the governor, but House Bill 696, which would have created greater protections for safety and drinking water monitoring, failed.

As Louisianians, we know from experience the damage to our land and health that hydrocarbon exploration has caused. It’s up to us to stand up for our health, our environment and our property, and after this legislative session there is more work to do.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/dd/2dd841e2-0dac-41b0-a8af-f00b99d33d84/645d3742b3e80.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-06-20 07:03:56.581126

The new company, to be called Green Metals Battery Innovations LLC, will focus mainly on recycling electric vehicle (EV) batteries.

Under the agreement signed by LG Energy Solution Michigan and Toyota Tsusho America, the two partners will build and operate a pre-processing plant in Winston-Salem, in the US state of North Carolina.

The facility, scheduled to go into operation in 2026, will carry out pre-processing operations to recover black mass containing raw metals such as nickel, cobalt, and lithium, by dismantling and shredding battery production scrap. The black mass will later undergo a separate post-processing stage to extract the valuable raw materials, thus establishing a “battery-to-battery” closed-loop recycling system whereby the recycled materials are used to produce new batteries.

Just 2 gigawatts of residential solar would be installed in 2026 if the bill passes in its current form, according to a forecast from market research firm Ohm Analytics. That’s nearly 60% lower than the 5.1 GW installed last year.

The reason for this projected sharp decline is that the GOP budget bill, now under consideration in the Senate, would eliminate federal tax credits for residential solar within six months. These long-standing incentives were renewed for another decade under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and can make solar 30% cheaper for homeowners.

It’s bad timing for those hoping to lower their energy costs by installing rooftop solar. Across the country, utility bills are rising, and the budget bill and other Trump administration actions impeding clean energy development are expected to drive the price of energy up further.

Most households that install rooftop solar see their electricity costs drop. Poorer households experience the most pronounced bill savings.

But without these tax credits, installing rooftop solar will be significantly more expensive — putting it out of reach for many, especially the lower-income residents who stand to benefit the most. It would take the average homeowner five or six years longer to break even on their solar system if incentives disappear, per Ohm Analytics.

The tax-credit repeal would be only the latest blow to residential solar in the U.S., which hit a high-water mark in 2023 when 6.8 gigawatts of panels were put on rooftops across the country.

That same year, California, the country’s largest residential solar market, slashed the amount of money households can earn from selling solar power back to the grid, eroding the economics of solar as a result. High interest rates over the last few years have also hampered installations because most buyers finance solar panels. In recent weeks, two major national rooftop-solar firms have gone bankrupt due to a combination of these factors and the new uncertainty over the tax credits.

It remains unclear what the final outcome for the tax credits will be. On Monday, the Senate Finance Committee released its version of the tax bill, which aligns with the House budget bill in eliminating tax credits for rooftop solar, among other home-energy upgrades.

If the tax credits are indeed repealed or significantly reduced, it would be a major setback not only for energy affordability and for the U.S. residential solar industry that employs around 100,000 people, but for efforts to reduce carbon emissions from the power system, too.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/COTW-rooftop-solar-1.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=0b152d2ce79f4f60f027be633a0e02f8,N,,2025-06-20 05:04:51.678547

The Senate Finance Committee released its portion of the ​“Big, Beautiful Bill” on Monday, including highly anticipated plans for clean energy tax credits that the House’s version sought to repeal. Here’s what’s better off in the Senate text — which still could change — and what’s not looking so hot.

Winners

Solar and wind — sort of

The House version would require clean power projects to start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage to access production and investment tax credits introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act. The Senate proposes a more gradual phaseout of credits for solar and wind projects before they terminate entirely at the end of 2027. Certain wind and solar projects would be able to access the tax credits beyond that point, as long as they are at least 1 gigawatt, are on federal land, and have already earned right-of-way approval from the Bureau of Land Management. But as Heatmap notes, those exceptions are unlikely to help any projects already in development.

Utility-scale battery storage

Incentives for energy storage projects would’ve ended just like those for wind and solar under the House bill, but that’s changed in this version. The Senate specifically says battery storage projects can access those production and investment tax credits until 2036, though the value of the incentives will taper over the years.

Geothermal, hydropower, and nuclear

Nuclear power was notably spared in the House’s gutting of clean energy incentives, but it got a few new friends in the Senate iteration. Like battery storage and advanced nuclear, geothermal and hydropower projects will be able to tap 45Y production tax credits until 2036.

Losers

EVs

The $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases would end about six months after the legislation is signed, while the $4,000 incentive for used EV purchases would end in three. The House extended that rebate for new EVs through 2026 for some emerging automakers, but the Senate didn’t carry over that same exemption.

Home energy improvements

Homeowners would only be able to get tax credits for rooftop solar installations for 180 days after the bill’s passage. Rebates for home energy upgrades, including to help homeowners buy electric heat pumps and other efficient appliances, will also be phased out in 180 days.

Hydrogen

The IRA’s green hydrogen production credit will only be available to projects that start construction this year, and after that, would end immediately. That cut would be brutal for the already-struggling industry, Canary Media’s Julian Spector reports.

What’s next

While the Senate’s proposal steps back some from the House version, tax credits that directly benefit consumers remain the most at risk. And as many experts have warned, those slashed tax credits will put jobs, energy bill savings, and major clean power projects at risk.

Still, these changes aren’t set in stone. Once the whole bill is drafted, the Senate will have to actually pass it, and then reconcile its differences with the House, with an ultimate goal of getting the package on President Donald Trump’s desk by July 4. His signature would start the clock ticking on all those tax credit phaseouts.

Another big energy story

A wave of community solar wins

The skies are cloudy for clean energy, but community solar is still providing some bright spots.

In Delaware, power will soon begin flowing from a 4.7-megawatt array that will help power as many as 750 homes and small businesses. It’s the first of six projects planned across the state to help locals — especially renters and low-income residents — tap into cleaner power, WHYY reports.

More community solar is on the way in the Northeast. A developer broke ground this week on a 3-MW array in Glastonbury, Connecticut, that’s part of a raft of projects across the region. And in New Jersey, lawmakers advanced a bill that would expand the state’s community solar capacity by 50% in an attempt to help curb power bills.

Meanwhile in Minnesota, the preservation of a community solar program will stand as a piece of state Rep. Melissa Hortman’s lasting legacy on clean energy. Hortman, a Democrat who was assassinated in her home last weekend, played a pivotal role in passing the state’s clean electricity standard and updating a community solar program in 2023. More recently, she pushed to keep the repeal of that program out of the state’s energy omnibus bill passed earlier this month.

However, Kazakhstan has no nuclear energy production capacity, with its energy mix dominated by coal at 68%, followed by natural gas and hydro.

Kazakhstan has identified China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) as a key strategic partner for building nuclear power plants, and will sign a cooperation agreement with China on nuclear energy.

This partnership also includes joint research on transboundary uranium ore belts straddling the two countries. According to Kazakhstan President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, bilateral and trade relations between the two countries have reached a new golden period, with Beijing a time-tested and reliable partner of Kazakhstan. China is Kazakhstan’s largest trade partner, with bilateral trade volume reaching a record $44 billion in 2024.

China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) also took center stage at the forum, specifically highlighting infrastructure development. That included plans to modernize logistics corridors, build new border facilities and simplify customs procedures, reinforcing Kazakhstan’s role as Central Asia’s leading transit hub.

“We consider the Chinese company CNNC [China National Nuclear Corporation] as a reliable strategic partner in the NPP construction project. CNNC is known worldwide for its high competence, so it will certainly occupy a worthy niche in our market. In addition, Kazakhstan is a reliable supplier of natural uranium and nuclear fuel to China,” Tokayev said.

Kazakhstan is the United States’ second largest supplier of uranium after Canada, supplying 25% of the country’s imports in 2022--more than twice the volume it ordered from Russia. Kazakhstan is home to 12% of the world’s natural uranium reserves and 43% of the global uranium supply. However, Kazakhstan has no nuclear energy production capacity, with its energy mix dominated by coal at 68%, followed by natural gas and hydro.

For its part, Beijing’s move to secure uranium supplies appears strategic. Five years ago, the country set a target to build 150 nuclear plants by 2035, potentially surpassing the United States in nuclear-generated electricity. Last year, a report by the non-partisan Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF) revealed that the U.S. could be up to 15 years behind China in next-generation nuclear power development.

Currently, China has 27 nuclear reactors under development, more than double the tally for any other country, with the country’s fleet now standing at 56 reactors. China is building reactors at a 6-8 per year clip, putting it on track to hit a total of 150 new nuclear reactors by 2035 and surpass the U.S. in nuclear-generated electricity by 2030. In contrast, the U.S. has only launched two new nuclear reactors over the past decade.

According to ITIF researchers, Beijing will likely use this large domestic capacity as a launch pad for competitive reactor exports, similar to its strategy with electric vehicles and batteries. Two years ago, a report emerged that Saudi Arabia was considering a bid from China to build a nuclear power plant, potentially sidelining the United States. This move came as Saudi Arabia seeks to diversify its energy mix and potentially develop a domestic nuclear industry. The U.S. had previously expressed interest in partnering with Saudi Arabia on a civilian nuclear program, but also imposed non-proliferation conditions that resulted in delays.

Beijing is also winning on the innovation front. In December 2023, China unveiled the 200 MW gas-cooled Shidaowan-1 nuclear plant, the world’s first fourth-generation nuclear power plant built with 90% of the technology developed in China. The bulk of China’s current fleet are third-generation reactors initially designed by the U.S. company Westinghouse in the late-1990s. According to ITIF, China’s systemic and organizational approach is largely to credit for the country’s success in nuclear power innovation, noting that it has developed a comprehensive and well-streamlined national strategy for nuclear power. This includes adopting several supportive policies such as feed-in tariffs and low-interest financing, among other subsidies that make the country’s nuclear sector cost-competitive. Additionally, China has streamlined the regulatory approval processes and supply chains.

However, the Trump administration is keen on reviving the U.S. nuclear sector, with Trump signing four executive orders in April in a bid to expedite the deployment of nuclear reactors and ramp up the country’s nuclear energy production from 100 GW in 2024 to 400 GW by 2050.

Unfortunately, the U.S. owns less than 1% of global uranium reserves, meaning that it will be forced to rely on the likes of Kazakhstan for its uranium supplies for years to come. The U.S. produced 700,000 pounds of yellowcake in 2024, good for an impressive 12-fold increase from the previous year, but still a long way off the 32 million pounds it imported in the same year.

In terms of job creation, the overall number of people working in data centers has risen dramatically nationwide, a 60% increase between 2016 and 2023 according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
According to Good, the infrastructure required to connect data centers to the grid is expensive.
That’s where some see nuclear power as a promising option, even if its potential hasn’t yet been met.","It’s a big achievement — Pennsylvania won out over other states for the largest capital investment in its history, $20 billion from Amazon for data centers and technology infrastructure.

Though the project promises to create over 1,200 jobs, at least initially, not everyone is happy about where things are going.

At the June press conference when Gov. Josh Shapiro announced the historic influx of capital, there was a protest nearby. One reporter asked Gov. Josh Shapiro for his message to the people who oppose the erection of data centers in their communities.

“Obviously local zoning decisions are going to be made by the local government, and we’re going to work hard to make sure we incorporate concerns of the neighbors to make sure this project gets built and also people’s interests are protected,” Shapiro said.

In terms of job creation, the overall number of people working in data centers has risen dramatically nationwide, a 60% increase between 2016 and 2023 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That’s largely a product of the rapid proliferation of the industry.

Shapiro said job creation means local students in towns like Berwick have “the most to gain” from the new centers, but many argue that these jobs are primarily in construction. According to a 2023 study conducted by the commonwealth of Virginia’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, a 250,000-square-foot data center can expect to employ about 50 full-time workers after construction has been completed.

That means, while construction jobs will abound in Luzerne and Bucks County where the first two of Amazon’s new centers are being built, in as little as two years, the centers’ employment impact will likely dwindle to a much smaller footprint.

Meanwhile, regardless of where centers are built, the expansion of AI technology itself promises to shift the nature and availability of family-sustaining work globally. In what has been dubbed by many experts as the upcoming “Job Apocalypse,” it’s essentially impossible to predict the future employment landscape for today’s students.

On the other hand, once online, the carbon footprint of those centers will expand, perhaps as exponentially as the technology they harbor has. In Virginia, unconstrained demand for energy is expected to double in the next 10 years, largely as a result of the centers that are springing up in the northern region of the state.

Virginia, like Pennsylvania, gets its power from the PJM grid, one that is already engaged in tan ongoing struggle to keep consumer costs down.

The Amazon center in Luzerne County will be hitching its wagon to the existing Salem Nuclear Power plant, just as Microsoft has cut a deal to bring Three Mile Island back online to power its AI technology.

Quentin Good, a policy analyst with Frontier Group, said that the first thing that happens when a data center is announced is that the local utility will begin to incorporate it into their planning, sometimes delaying the expected closure of coal or gas-fired plants or even considering opening new ones.

This doesn’t just increase the state’s reliance on the fossil fuels that contribute to climate change. It also results in strain on the energy grid and expensive upgrades. According to Good, the infrastructure required to connect data centers to the grid is expensive.

“Those infrastructure costs to an extent, especially in the short run, will be passed on to normal, everyday ratepayers like households and small businesses,” Good said. “And, you know, prices will go up likely in the short term for energy.”

Amazon as a company has a 2040 goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, which is good news for those concerned about environmental harm from the centers, but in the meantime, Good said clean energy sources simply aren’t coming online fast enough to meet the demands of big tech. That’s where some see nuclear power as a promising option, even if its potential hasn’t yet been met.

“They’re also sort of banking on new nuclear technology that hasn’t really been advanced yet to the point where it’s going to be effective in the way that we think it is. And that’s something called small modular reactors,” Good said. “I think there’s a great hope among data centers and the AI industry that small modular reactors will be a technology that sort of matures over the next 10 years and become more widely available.”

Good added that at this point, a good way to store or dispose of the nuclear waste created by power plants still hasn’t been developed. Salem, like most other nuclear facilities, stores it on-site, an environmental concern that has long plagued the otherwise clean energy source.

As for protests from local community members?

“We have seen pushback from communities, from local groups, but they are not approaching it as much from the environmental angle,” Good said. They’re saying, “It’s big and ugly and really loud, and it’s ruining my perfect idea of the town that I wanted to retire in.”",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.altoonamirror.com/images/2016/10/18173137/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 08:09:23.668413

The company’s growth has heavily relied on tax credits tied to third-party ownership (TPO) systems.","The solar sector is reeling after the release of the Senate Finance Committee’s proposed tax-and-spending bill, which targets renewable energy sources. Sunrun (RUN), a major player in residential solar, was particularly vulnerable to the news, shedding almost 40% of its valuation in the past week. Having traded as high as $13.20 per share in late May, the stock is now languishing at ~$6 following this week’s news.

In my view, the proposed incentive cuts pose a significant threat to Sunrun’s viability, particularly given its ongoing inability to generate profits despite these benefits being in place. Without that financial support, a turnaround seems even less likely, leaving me firmly bearish on the stock.

Sunrun’s Model Comes Under Fire

For those unfamiliar, Sunrun primarily operates under a third-party ownership (TPO) model. Instead of homeowners purchasing solar systems outright, Sunrun installs and owns the panels, allowing customers to either lease the system for a monthly fee or pay for the electricity it generates at a fixed rate. This model has gained popularity because it enables homeowners to adopt solar with little to no upfront cost.

Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which extended and enhanced the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC), Sunrun, as the system owner, can claim a tax credit typically worth 30% of the system’s cost. This significantly lowers installation expenses and enables Sunrun to pass those savings on to customers, making the model more financially appealing.

The Senate’s Proposal is a Direct Threat to Residential Solar

The Senate Finance Committee has recently proposed eliminating solar tax credits in favor of supporting other energy sectors, such as geothermal, nuclear, and hydropower. If passed, this legislation would require Sunrun to absorb the full cost of its solar systems, which would inevitably be passed on to customers. The result would be a significant squeeze on margins and an acceleration of the company’s ongoing cash burn. Senate Republicans are reportedly aiming to pass the bill before the July 4th holiday.

Upon closer examination, this appears to mark a broader shift in U.S. energy policy away from residential solar and wind. The market has already begun to react, with notable declines in Sunrun’s peers, including Enphase Energy (ENPH) and SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG), underscoring the potential sector-wide impact.

Regulatory and Political Battles Ahead for RUN

There’s still hope for solar advocates. The proposed bill faces strong resistance from Democrats, particularly from the original architects of the clean energy tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act. The clean energy industry is also mounting an aggressive lobbying effort, warning of potential job losses and higher energy costs. And while the bill is led by the GOP, not all Republicans are aligned in support.

The legislation still has a long way to go. It narrowly passed the House in May with a 215–214 vote, and the Senate draft was just introduced on June 16. While the Senate version includes more extended phase-out periods for some clean energy incentives, it still calls for the elimination of Section 48E credits, which are key to residential solar leases.

A Senate vote is expected soon, and if proponents can secure a simple majority, the bill could advance to President Trump’s desk. For context, the current Senate makeup is 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats, and two Independents.

Sunrun’s Financials: Persistent Challenges Intensified

In the near term, Sunrun could experience a temporary boost in demand as customers rush to take advantage of tax credits before they’re phased out. However, expectations for 2026 and beyond point to a sharp and sustained decline in demand.

A closer look at Sunrun’s financials reveals troubling signs. The company has consistently reported negative operating cash flow, with a loss of over $100 million in Q1 2025 and nearly $800 million in total for 2024, highlighting the financial pressure it faces even before potential incentive cuts take effect.

Meanwhile, Sunrun, in its pursuit of growth opportunities, is becoming increasingly leveraged, increasing its risk profile should things take a turn for the worse.

Moving forward, ongoing tariff pressures and the disappearance of incentive credits spell long-term trouble for solar installers.

Is Sunrun a Good Stock to Buy?

Analyst sentiment on Sunrun (RUN) stock is mixed. The stock carries a consensus Hold rating, based on seven Buy, six Hold, and four Sell ratings over the past three months. Despite the cautious stance, RUN’s average price target of $10.44 suggests significant upside potential—about 70% from current levels.

Mizuho analyst Maheep Mandloi has a Buy (Outperform) rating on RUN with a price target of $16. He notes that the House’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” won’t derail grandfathered credits until 2028. He also believes that demand for renewable energy will remain high without government incentives because it is “still the cheapest option.”

However, not everyone shares Mandloi’s bullish outlook. Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin Smith downgraded RUN to Sell (Underperform) with a price target of $5. Due to the same legislation, Smith notes that Sunrun is exposed to “both near- and long-term headwinds.” He believes that the market is underestimating “how consequential the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ is uniquely on residential solar.”

Sunrun Faces Uncertainty as Senate Bill Threatens Core Business Model

The so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” poses a major threat to solar companies like Sunrun. The company’s growth has heavily relied on tax credits tied to third-party ownership (TPO) systems. Even with those incentives, Sunrun has struggled to achieve consistent profitability. Without them, serious doubts emerge about its ability to maintain its current business model. If the bill passes, Sunrun—and others in the space—will likely be forced to pivot toward new strategies or market segments.

That said, the bill could still fail, or be amended in ways that lessen the impact on Sunrun. Additionally, the proposed phase-out period provides a window for the company to adjust. From my perspective, I’d prefer to stay on the sidelines until there is more regulatory clarity.

The panel acknowledged last year it was “no longer reasonable or executable” for Duke Energy to meet the reduction standard by 2030.
They say the interim goal still holds an aspirational purpose and was something that Duke Energy had agreed in 2021 to meet.
Bill support came from the North Carolina Chamber and a manufacturers’ group, in addition to Duke Energy.","RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina legislators finalized a bill Thursday that would eliminate an interim greenhouse gas reduction mandate set in a landmark 2021 law, while still directing regulators to aim to cancel out power plant carbon emissions in the state within the next 25 years.

With some bipartisan support, the state Senate voted to accept the House version that would repeal the 2021 law’s requirement that electric regulators take “all reasonable steps to achieve” reducing carbon dioxide output 70% from 2005 levels by 2030. The law’s directive to take similar steps to meet a carbon neutrality standard by 2050 would remain in place.

The bill’s Republican supporters pushing the new measure say getting rid of the interim goal benefits ratepayers asked to pay for future electric-production construction and is more efficient for Duke Energy, the state’s dominant electric utility.

The bill now goes to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, who can veto the measure, sign it or let it become law without his signature. Stein previously expressed concerns about the Senate version of the measure, worried that it could hurt electricity users and threaten the state’s clean-energy economy. His office didn’t immediately provide comment after Thursday’s vote.

With over a dozen House and Senate Democrats voting for the final version, the chances that any Stein veto could be overridden are higher. Republicans in charge of the General Assembly are only one House seat shy of a veto-proof majority.

The bill also contains language that would help Duke Energy seek higher electric rates to cover financing costs to build nuclear or gas-powered plants incrementally, rather than wait until the project’s end.

The 2021 greenhouse gas law marked a rare agreement on environmental issues by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Republican lawmakers.

At least 17 other states — most controlled by Democrats — have laws setting similar net-zero power plant emissions or 100% renewable energy targets, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. North Carolina and Virginia are the only ones from the Southeast.

The legislation came about as President Donald Trump’s administration has proposed rolling back federal environmental and climate change policies, which critics say could boost pollution and threaten human health. Republicans are promoting them as ways to reduce the cost of living and boost the economy.

The state Utilities Commission, which regulates rates and services for public utilities, already has pushed back the 2030 deadline — as the 2021 law allows — by at least four years. The panel acknowledged last year it was “no longer reasonable or executable” for Duke Energy to meet the reduction standard by 2030.

Bill supporters say to meet the goal would require expensive types of alternate energy immediately. If the interim standard can be bypassed, GOP bill authors say, Duke Energy can assemble less expensive power sources now and moderate electricity rate increases necessary to reach the 2050 standard.

“Our residents shouldn’t be saddled with higher power bills to satisfy arbitrary targets,” Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said in a news release after the vote.

Citing an analysis performed by a state agency that represents consumers before the commission, GOP lawmakers say removing the interim goal would reduce by at least $13 billion what Duke Energy would have to spend — and pass on to customers — in the next 25 years.

Bill opponents question the savings figure given uncertainty in plant fuel prices, energy demand and construction costs. They say the interim goal still holds an aspirational purpose and was something that Duke Energy had agreed in 2021 to meet.

Provisions in the measure related to recouping plant construction expenses over time would reduce accumulated borrowing interest.

Environmental groups argue the financing option would benefit Duke Energy’s bottom line on expensive projects even if they’re never completed, and the bill broadly would prevent cleaner energy sources from coming online sooner. They also contend another bill section would shift costs to residential customers.

“This bill is bad for all North Carolinians, whether they’re Duke Energy customers or simply people who want to breathe clean air,” North Carolina Sierra Club director Chris Herndon said after the vote while urging Stein to veto the measure.

Bill support came from the North Carolina Chamber and a manufacturers’ group, in addition to Duke Energy.

The CEO, Jim Wood, employs nearly 300 workers and calls on lawmakers to support domestic solar jobs while securing future power and reducing foreign energy reliance.

What's happening?

EnergySage, a premier source of objective, independent solar industry expertise, shared that thousands of manufacturing jobs will disappear if Congress eliminates tax credits fueling clean energy progress.

EnergySage helps people get quick solar estimates and compare installer quotes for the best deals.

According to EnergySage, Jim Wood is a North Carolina resident who is deeply concerned about how solar tax credit cuts would impact his employees, business, community, and clean energy goals. SEG Solar manufactures solar models for American energy projects in the U.S.

In his letter to North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, Wood wrote, ""Our work aligns directly with the administration's stated goals. We're not asking for handouts — we're asking for a level playing field and consistent support for the American workers, companies, and communities building our energy future here at home.""

Wood asked his senator to stand with solar jobs and local workers to support clean energy policies that promote energy independence rather than a reliance on foreign competitors.

Tillis, for his part, signed a letter with four other Republican senators in April seeking to preserve clean energy provisions, but as of reporting this week, it is unclear if the senator or others will follow through on fighting to preserve them as the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" goes through the Senate.

Why are solar industry jobs important?

Installing solar panels on your home is one of the most effective ways to save money on utility bills while reducing planet-overheating pollution. Solar energy jobs boost local economies and facilitate the transition toward clean, affordable energy for everyone.

Government investments in solar manufacturing help keep jobs in America and make the U.S. more self-sufficient in its energy production. These jobs help people support their families and encourage communities to limit pollution for a less toxic, more breathable environment.

What's can I do to protect and grow the solar economy?

EnergySage offers free services to compare trusted solar installation quotes and save up to $10,000 on upfront investments. It has a useful mapping tool that shows the average cost of home solar systems in each state to get the best deal on your solar upgrade.

A federal proposal moving through Congress could stall Michigan's booming rooftop solar industry by ending key tax credits that have fueled clean energy growth, nationwide.

What is being called the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" would eliminate the 30% credit for rooftop solar and other home energy systems, including those leased by companies.

Michigan leads the nation in Inflation Reduction Act-funded projects, attracting more than $27 billion in investment and creating more than 26,000 jobs.

Allan O'Shea, founder and CEO of 50-year-old CBS Solar in Copemish, said about 90% of his family-owned business is residential rooftop solar.

""That 90% would lose one of the benefits that go with solar and that's a 30% tax credit,"" O'Shea pointed out. ""The other 10% of our business is commercial and it would survive but the damage would be done. We're talking 25+ employees here.""

O'Shea sent a heartfelt letter to most senators, expressing concerns about the bill's effects on his livelihood and others'. Supporters of the big tax-cut and spending bill argued it would boost the economy and strengthen national security.

Backers also said the bill delivers the biggest tax cut in U.S. history for those earning $30,000 to $80,000 a year, with 15% off their taxes. O'Shea emphasized he and his customers are money-smart and value long-term investments, adding the issue is not the goal, but how the bill is being pushed through.

""I just hope for the saner minds, the senators and the Congress people that we have in Michigan, to step up and slow the pace down,"" O'Shea urged. ""You can sunset it.""

In 2023, solar power jumped 51% nationwide, with solar making up more than half of all the new electricity added to the grid.

A new analysis of what Congressional lawmakers have dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act found it would eliminate thousands of jobs in South Dakota and slow economic growth.

The bill's current language repeals multiple federal policies, funding programs and tax credits meant to boost American clean energy and manufacturing.

Daniel O'Brien, senior modeling analyst for the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation, said South Dakota could lose as many as 1,600 jobs by 2030 as funding is diverted to jobs in the coal, oil and gas industries.

""Those are but a fraction of the number of jobs that are being lost in manufacturing, construction, utilities, farming and agriculture,"" O'Brien explained.

O'Brien noted up to 840,000 jobs nationwide could be eliminated over the next five years if the current bill remains intact. It repeals more than $500 billion in Inflation Reduction Act investments, which some House Republicans have dubbed a ""green new scam.""

South Dakota households currently benefit from low energy prices, partly due to the growth of renewable energy. The industry has drawn more manufacturing to the state, along with data centers in need of large amounts of cheap power. But the analysis showed a shift toward fossil fuels will increase annual statewide energy bills by more than $180 million by 2035.

O'Brien stressed industries looking to reduce costs may choose to operate elsewhere.

""When you repeal these tax credits, you lose the incentivization of companies to build out cheap renewables in South Dakota,"" O'Brien pointed out. ""For that reason, companies that are relying on their cheap power might go to other states or they might move outside of the U.S.""

He added gas prices are also expected to rise with the repeal of EPA rules on vehicle tailpipe emissions and fuel economy standards. Zero-emission vehicle sales in South Dakota are expected to fall from more than 50% in 2030 to around 30% over the next five years.

As Washington D.C.'s sole gas company continues a multi-billion dollar, 40-year project to replace methane pipes, clean energy advocates argue the projects are misguided and alternatives to gas pipes are better for public health and the environment.

Washington Gas's plan will upgrade 200 miles of gas pipes in the District, costing more than $200 million for the third phase of pipe replacement, paid for by rate hikes on consumers.

In February, a majority of District council members signed a letter urging the Public Service Commission to direct the company to focus only on pipes that need to be fixed.

The company has fallen behind on a similar project in Maryland.

Claire Mills, District of Columbia campaigns manager with the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said many pipes being replaced are plastic and less than 25 years old.

She says only lead pipes over 40 years old are likely to leak.

""Even small gas leaks that don't have the potential to explode,"" said Mills, ""are putting methane gas, which is a hugely powerful greenhouse gas, into our atmosphere and creating climate change.""

Washington Gas claims in a brochure that the D.C. project has led to the creation of more than 600 jobs. The company also argues it cuts down on greenhouse gas emissions by more than 5,000 metric tons.

Since 2018, when the District project began, the number of gas leaks across the District has decreased by nearly 25%, according to the Public Service Commission.

There were more than 1,200 instances of the gas leaks in 2023.

Mills says groups like hers are urging the Public Service Commission to create a plan that transitions the District to clean electricity, rather than doubling down on methane gas.

""Even if your gas pipe is all good, just burning methane gas in your home in your gas stove or your furnace has really negative health impacts,"" said Mills. ""So in the long term, the real solution to this problem is moving the District off of methane gas through a managed transition that takes a serious approach.""

The Public Service Commission is holding a hearing on the project tomorrow at its office in downtown D.C. at 5:30 p.m.

Through a four-pillar approach - Electrify, Decarbonise, Conserve and Thrive - the company reports on measurable targets, internal governance and business outcomes as it aims to contribute directly to global climate action.

At the heart of the energy transition

With more than 100 manufacturing sites across more than 25 countries, GE Vernova produces the hardware and software that powers grid infrastructure, including gas turbines, solar inverters, wind blades and modular nuclear reactors.

The company operates with a procurement footprint that includes 109 countries and raw material spending of US$20bn.

Last year, GE Vernova generated US$35bn in revenue, backed by a US$119bn project backlog.

It describes itself as the world’s “energy manufacturer,” a title grounded in more than a century of engineering history dating to Thomas Edison.

EV energy and grid innovation for a growing world

In 2024, GE Vernova delivered 31 GW of new generation capacity, equivalent to the electricity needs of Virginia, and 71 GW of grid-enabling capacity, similar in scale to South Africa’s entire grid.

This capacity includes technology for integrating renewable power sources and stabilising supply.

To support this growth, the company deployed 310,000 automation devices and 6 GW of solar inverter technology.

EV adoption depends on stable and responsive grid systems.

Technologies like GridOS and GridBeats, GE Vernova’s AI-enabled grid management tools, help balance supply and demand, which is vital for managing EV charging infrastructure and the increased load it places on national grids.

Around 25% of global electricity now flows through GE Vernova systems.

Of that, 62% of new generation and 34% of grid-enabling capacity supported developing and emerging markets, including major projects in Iraq, Turkey, Ghana, Indonesia and Nigeria.

These regions often experience grid instability and supply gaps that hinder EV adoption, so improved infrastructure here supports wider transition goals.

Scott Strazik, CEO of GE Vernova, says: “I'm more confident and optimistic than ever about delivering on our mission to electrify and decarbonise the world.”

“We are not just imagining the future of energy, we are shaping it.”

GE Vernova is targeting an additional 150 GW of capacity by 2030. It is also preparing for electricity demand linked to AI and data centres, expected to account for 12% of US electricity consumption by 2035.

Small modular nuclear reactors like the BWRX-300 and high-efficiency gas turbines are designed to provide consistent power where needed – including co-located supply for data centres and fast-charging EV hubs.

Emissions, efficiency and circular production targets

The company says that it has helped avoid 27 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions through cleaner generation and higher system efficiency.

Average carbon intensity of the new capacity installed in 2024 was 368 grams of CO₂ per kilowatt-hour, around 20% lower than the global grid average.

Gross Scope 3 emissions, those from the company’s wider value chain, fell 38% to 796 million metric tonnes.

Scope 1 and 2 emissions, covering direct operations and energy used, dropped 51% from 2019 levels.

The company attributes this fall to large-scale investments in process improvements, not reliance on renewable energy credits.

Its 2030 target remains full carbon neutrality in direct operations.

GE Vernova’s long-term decarbonisation strategy is based on four core technologies: small modular reactors, hydrogen systems, carbon capture and direct air capture.

Research and development, along with cross-sector collaboration, is pushing each of these solutions toward broader deployment.

Circularity is rising on the company’s agenda. In 2024, 38% of top-selling products were part of its 4R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Recover) framework, up from 23% in the previous year.

GE Vernova wants to raise this to 90% by 2030.

More than half of product lines are now supported by either Life Cycle Assessments or Environmental Product Declarations, helping guide environmentally responsible decisions at design and supply stages.

Water use across operations hit 2.7bn gallons, with 1.9bn gallons used for once-through cooling.

Eleven environmental spills and two wastewater exceedances were reported, but there were no air quality breaches.

Governance, investment and EV implications

Sustainability oversight at GE Vernova is managed through a council structure chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer, who reports directly to the CEO and board.

This includes 20 business functions, covering areas from safety and operations to legal and workplace culture and is designed to keep strategy aligned with global ESG standards.

In 2024, GE Vernova spent US$1.2bn on research and development and plans to invest US$9bn in capital and R&D between now and 2028.

This funding will develop advanced grid systems, low-carbon fuels and new power generation platforms that are central to wider EV infrastructure deployment.

As EV uptake accelerates, power systems must deliver consistent and scalable output.

Duke Energy Indiana and Reliable Energy Inc., which represents several of Indiana’s major coal producers, have reached a settlement in Duke Energy Indiana’s request pending before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for a proposed new natural gas plant at its Cayuga Generating Station in Vermillion County.

According to The Reporter’s newsgathering partner WISH-TV, the proposed new plant would include two natural gas-fired combined cycle generating units with a total capacity winter rating of 1,476 megawatts. The new units would be placed in service by September 2029 and May 2030. They would replace two coal-fired units that have been in use since the 1970s, with a total capacity winter rating of 1,005 megawatts.

If state utility regulators approve the gas plant proposal as well as the settlement, Duke Energy Indiana has agreed to perform an engineering study to evaluate the technical feasibility of continued operation of the site’s current coal units by third parties that may be interested in purchasing them. Duke Energy would then issue a request for proposal to solicit interest in the coal units, which could be available for sale after the two proposed gas units are placed in service in 2029 and 2030.

“The settlement is aligned with Indiana Governor Mike Braun’s recent executive orders aimed at making sure there’s a careful evaluation before retiring coal units and encouraging additions to the state’s power supplies,” Duke Energy Indiana President Stan Pinegar said. “The new natural gas units we’ve proposed add additional, highly efficient power capacity to Indiana’s electric grid. This agreement commits to studying the feasibility of a third party continuing to operate Cayuga’s existing coal units once the Cayuga gas units are operational.”

A condition of the settlement is that this process will not affect the construction schedule, estimated cost or future operation of the new gas units.

“This agreement represents a meaningful step toward preserving reliable, in-state power generation for Hoosiers,” said Reliable Energy President Savannah Kerstiens. “It wouldn’t have been possible without the leadership of Governor Braun and Secretary Jaworowski, whose continued commitment to Indiana’s energy resilience made this outcome achievable. As the state works to attract new investment and grow the economy, ensuring affordable electricity for working families means keeping every option on the table to maintain generation capacity.”

Duke Energy estimates the project will cost about $3.33 billion. The electricity utility serves about 900,000 customers in 69 Indiana counties.",,N,,2025-06-20 12:27:17.267537

And it's not just that fact that should make the likes of Elon Musk reach for his steering wheel. Of the 22 million EVs projected to be sold this year, two-thirds are likely to be in China. This demonstrates an increasing alignment between climate goals and markets, the gold standard of all responsible businesses.

Strong policy support, such as fuel economy and CO2 standards, along with fiscal incentives, are helping to drive demand, which, in turn, have helped create this climate-market sync. The largest automobile market in the world is clearly proving that what is good for the planet can also be good for business.

Policy support is critical for clean tech to be readily accepted and thrive, especially since upfront cost of climate tech solutions like EV is high. Changes in levels of such support can translate quickly into sales. Take Europe, where EV sales growth has stagnated as several major markets phased out or reduced subsidies while regulatory requirements remained stagnant.

CO2 targets for cars in the EU remained the same between 2023 and 2024. In the US, where the Trump regime's proposed cuts to EV tax credits will likely see a steep drop in EV sales by 2030, EVs are now to account for 27% of total car sales, down from earlier projections of 48%.

There's a Chinese lesson for countries like India with high and growing domestic demand to make the shift: support through fiscal and policy interventions can pay off. With China now dominating the global EV ecosystem, this should make it easier for India to make the necessary 'gear shift'. The longer India waits, though, the more it will have to contend with overcapacity of China's EV industry.","https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-121965563,imgsize-8574,width-1200,height=627,overlay-etmanufacturing,resizemode-75/news/industry/chinas-dominance-in-electric-vehicle-sales-a-global-shift.jpg",N,,2025-06-20 06:02:20.538314

Board of Elections spokesperson Vincent Ignizio declined to comment on the Cuomo’s campaign complaint.
In a statement, City Hall spokesperson Kayla Mamelak Altus deferred to the Board of Elections, adding that it’s an independent agency.
“As Andrew Cuomo should know, elections are managed by the New York City Board of Elections – an independent body, separate from the Adams administration,” she said.
“While it’s hot out in New York today, it’s only going to get hotter,” Cuomo’s campaign wrote in an email to supporters Thursday.","The city Board of Elections’ heat plan “is insufficient, it’s unacceptable,” Cuomo spokesperson Jason Elan said. “We’ve been clear that the city should be distributing water on site, and that they would be installing a/c systems to make sure that everybody who wants to can make their voice heard on election day.”

The former governor has reason to be concerned about turnout next Tuesday: His anticipated victory relies upon robust support from older voters, who are more susceptible to dangerous heat conditions.

Board of Elections spokesperson Vincent Ignizio declined to comment on the Cuomo’s campaign complaint. The board emphasized its preparation for the heat wave, releasing a statement earlier Thursday that staffers are finding fans for poll sites without air conditioning, “ensuring a steady supply of water” and pledging a continuous supply of electricity, given the increased possibility of power outages.

Ignizio couldn’t say Thursday how many of the city’s 1,213 poll sites lack air conditioning since the board’s “site-by-site assessment” was ongoing. Contingency plans are in place to keep voting going through power outages, he added. And the board doesn’t expect any voters having to wait in long lines, whether indoors or out.

“Our anticipation is that there is ample amount of bandwidth in the system to accommodate the voting,” he said.

There are just as many poll sites for the local primary as there were for the presidential election last year, which had roughly triple the turnout expected for the race to replace Mayor Eric Adams.

Cuomo was the first candidate to publicly raise concerns about the heat wave. On Wednesday, he called on Mayor Eric Adams’ administration to guarantee every poll site is “cool, comfortable and accessible,” and ensure bottled water is provided to every voter.

The former governor is running on his experience and take-charge attitude, and has taken digs at Adams’ management. In a statement, City Hall spokesperson Kayla Mamelak Altus deferred to the Board of Elections, adding that it’s an independent agency.

“As Andrew Cuomo should know, elections are managed by the New York City Board of Elections – an independent body, separate from the Adams administration,” she said. “Mayor Adams believes that all New Yorkers should exercise their democratic right to vote, and we are coordinating closely with the New York City Board of Elections in advance of Tuesday’s forecasted heat to monitor for impacts.”

Cuomo isn’t the only candidate with concerns.

“It’s going to be blazing hot,” mayoral candidate Brad Lander said Thursday after casting his vote early. “Let’s make sure now that the air conditioning is working in every polling site, and let’s make sure it’s on in advance.”

“I do not have confidence that Eric Adams’ administration will do it,” Lander added.

Hot temperatures hurting Cuomo’s vote total has been the subject of jokes from supporters of Zohran Mamdani. Cuomo’s leading rival has a highly motivated base of younger voters who may be more likely to vote early, or to show up Tuesday despite the weather.

“Someone’s worried about the old turnout Make it HOTTER!!!” leftist podcast host Stylianos Karoldis posted on X, referring to Cuomo. “Praying to God it’s a temperature only people under 45 can withstand,” he added.

Mamdani’s campaign is taking a more sober view. “We’re concerned about the health and safety of every voter, and want people to take every precaution,” spokesperson Andrew Epstein said.

That includes the campaign’s “tens of thousands” of volunteers who will be standing outside poll sites as well, The campaign is preparing with pop-up tents, snacks, water and “a lot of very specific guidance to canvassers to dress appropriately for the heat, to take breaks,” Epstein said.

The National Weather Service is predicting a high near 94 Tuesday, with the heat index potentially exceeding 100 degrees at times, calling it “a true summertime hot and humid regime.”

Accuweather is also predicting that the high Tuesday could break the New York City record for June 24 of 96 degrees, set in 1888. Later that year, New Yorkers elected 30-year-old Tammany Hall favorite Hugh Grant, the youngest mayor in the city’s history.

Hoping to hold off the 33-year-old Mamdani, Cuomo’s pushing his supporters to vote early, through Sunday, when temperatures will be merely hot, and not yet miserable.

“While it’s hot out in New York today, it’s only going to get hotter,” Cuomo’s campaign wrote in an email to supporters Thursday. “So please, vote today, and encourage everyone you know to vote now to avoid next week’s extreme heat.”

Voting rights advocates are pushing the same message.

“I don’t ever remember a primary or any election day in New York state being remotely this hot,” said Perry Grossman, director of the Voting Rights Project at the New York Civil Liberties Union. “My strong message to everybody is: early vote. Whether it’s today, tomorrow, Saturday, Sunday, it’s gonna be a little bit cooler. Take advantage of it.”",https://static.politico.com/27/0f/41c0bb5d4c019b8e00387a0885b9/election-2025-nyc-mayor-99209.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 05:04:30.603580
