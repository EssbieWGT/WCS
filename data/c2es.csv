Mike Jacobs, a senior energy manager at UCS, uncovered these additional costs by analyzing last year’s filings from utilities in seven PJM states and identifying 130 projects that will connect private data centers directly to the high-voltage transmission system.
Over 95% of the projects identified passed all of their transmission connection costs onto local people’s electricity bills, totaling $4.3 billion in costs previously undistinguished from other, more typical expenses to upgrade and maintain the electricity grid.
“People deserve to understand the full extent of how data centers in their communities may affect their lives and wallets.
This is a clear case of the public unknowingly subsidizing private companies’ profits.","CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (September 15, 2025)—A new analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) reveals how millions of people across Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia are footing the bill for an additional $4.3 billion in electricity infrastructure projects approved in 2024 solely to connect wealthy private companies’ data centers.

This $4.3 billion was previously obscured through opaque utility filings and is on top of an estimated $9.3 billion in data center electricity costs to be paid between June 2025 and June 2026 by the 65 million people who are customers supplied by PJM, the regional utility operator spanning 13 Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley states plus the District of Columbia.

Mike Jacobs, a senior energy manager at UCS, uncovered these additional costs by analyzing last year’s filings from utilities in seven PJM states and identifying 130 projects that will connect private data centers directly to the high-voltage transmission system. Over 95% of the projects identified passed all of their transmission connection costs onto local people’s electricity bills, totaling $4.3 billion in costs previously undistinguished from other, more typical expenses to upgrade and maintain the electricity grid.

Jacobs’ seven state analysis found household electricity bills subsidizing the following in direct data center transmission costs approved in 2024:

Illinois: $239 million

Maryland: $107.5 million

New Jersey: $14.5 million

Ohio: $1.3 billion

Pennsylvania: $491.7 million

Virginia: $1.9 billion

West Virginia: $215.8 million

“The big tech companies rushing to build out massive data centers are worth trillions of dollars, yet they’re successfully exploiting an outdated regulatory process to pawn billions of dollars of costs off on families who may never even use their products,” said Jacobs. “People deserve to understand the full extent of how data centers in their communities may affect their lives and wallets. This is a clear case of the public unknowingly subsidizing private companies’ profits. Utilities and regulators must do more to protect people from this outrageous practice that is already driving up household electricity bills for millions of people across the country.”

There are several ways state and federal regulators can reverse this subsidy, Jacobs explains, and these solutions could save people billions of dollars as data centers are projected to increase U.S. energy demand by 130% by 2030, potentially repeating these cost shifts in many more states.",https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/media-release-image.png,N,,2025-09-29 09:01:10.694594

Meanwhile, on the supply side, veteran uranium supplier Centrus Energy (LEU -2.19%) has seen its shares soar 450%.
The question now is: Is it too late to buy into Centrus stock?
Is Centrus Energy stock a buy?
The problem is, at its present market capitalization of more than $5 billion, Centrus stock is selling for 47 times free cash flow and 48 times earnings.","In case you haven't noticed, nuclear energy stocks are having a moment in 2025. Four months ago, President Trump signed a series of executive orders designed to accelerate the development of nuclear power stations and secure access to supplies of nuclear fuel in the United States.

Investors in nuclear stocks have been quick to respond to the news. Over the past 12 months, shares of start-ups developing small and micro nuclear reactor plants are on the rise. For example, names like NuScale Power and Nano Nuclear Energy are up 246% and 267%.

Meanwhile, on the supply side, veteran uranium supplier Centrus Energy (LEU -2.19%) has seen its shares soar 450%. Does it still have room to run?

Right place, right time

And what lies behind Centrus's amazing rise -- I mean, in addition to the well-timed support from the President?

Well, there's Russia's war in Ukraine, for one thing. The United States imports 99% of the uranium used in American nuclear power plants, and 27% of that comes from Russia. ""Thanks"" to the war, however, the U.S. government has passed laws banning imports of Russian-sourced uranium, effective in 2028, and that means Centrus' role as a buyer and reseller of imported uranium is only going to get more important over time.

Centrus is further cementing its centrality by developing the capacity to enrich uranium domestically, such that the U.S. won't need to import so much uranium from abroad -- even from friendly suppliers such as France's Orano or from the British-Dutch-German company Urenco.

Alongside Urenco, which operates an enrichment facility in New Mexico, Centrus is the only other company licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to produce low enriched uranium (LEU) in the U.S. (Centrus also possesses a license to produce high-assay enriched uranium, or HALEU, for next-generation nuclear reactors.)

The second part of the puzzle is the artificial intelligence revolution, which is driving up electricity demand to levels where only the rapid building of new nuclear power plants can provide the amounts of power needed. This is why everyone -- from Microsoft to Alphabet to Amazon -- has been inking electricity supply agreements with nuclear power companies lately.

It also speaks clearly to a trend of rising demand for enriched uranium fuel -- which is what Centrus aims to supply.

And yet, this is a story that's been developing for more than a year now -- ever since Constellation Energy Group (CEG 1.59%) announced last year that it would need to reopen Three Mile Island in order to provide the kind of power levels that Microsoft needs. By this point, it's hardly a secret that Centrus is sitting in the proverbial catbird's seat, and likely to profit handsomely as this new nuclear story plays out.

This is the reason Centrus stock is up 450% over the past year. The question now is: Is it too late to buy into Centrus stock? I fear it may be.

Is Centrus Energy stock a buy?

Don't get me wrong -- I'm totally on board with the idea that Centrus will perform well as a business as old reactors ramp their power output, and new reactors -- including new types of small reactors from NuScale, Nano Nuclear, and others -- come online. I'll even acknowledge that Centrus is doing just fine already today.

Centrus recorded a profit of $105 million over the past 12 months -- and these are high-quality profits, resulting in the generation of $107 million in positive free cash flow. The company's balance sheet is also flush, with $400 million more cash than debt in the bank. The problem is, at its present market capitalization of more than $5 billion, Centrus stock is selling for 47 times free cash flow and 48 times earnings.

Those valuations might be defensible if Centrus were growing rapidly today. However, most analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence forecast relatively flat profit growth for the next several years, with earnings only really taking off in 2030 and after, once new reactor types start going online.

While it's possible the stock's valuation will prove justifiable in those years, it's also possible something will happen over the next half-decade to upset this nuclear apple cart, and make Centrus stock look less attractive than investors currently hope for.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/835039/nuclear-power-plant-next-to-a-pond-glowing-red-at-sunset.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 09:01:14.617123

West Virginia is awash in coal, natural gas and oil, making it the fifth-leading producer of energy in the United States. Yet the state’s electricity costs have risen much faster than the national average. Some energy experts say West Virginia is a harbinger of what could happen as President Trump champions fossil fuels and throttles renewable energy.

Trump administration officials have ordered aging coal power plants to stay open and pushed for the quick approval of new oil and natural gas projects. And the administration has denied permits or ordered work to be halted on renewable energy projects.

In the past few decades, generating electricity from coal has become much more expensive than other energy sources like natural gas, wind and solar. Coal plants are also relatively inefficient and expensive to maintain.

There is additional downside risk if further permitting delays threaten solar and storage projects.” The residential storage market saw a leap in installations in Q2 as well.
California and New York led Q2 in the segment’s storage installations, accounting for over 70% of total capacity, while Illinois gained traction, said ACP.
The report forecast US storage will reach 87.8 GW by 2029, driven by residential and utility-scale segments.","The United States had a record quarter for battery energy storage deployment from April to June, adding 5.6 GW of installations, according to a report released by the ACP and Wood Mackenzie.

Utility-scale storage led the way, adding 4.9 GW in the quarter and growing 62% year-over-year. This is enough to power 3.7 million US homes during average peak-demand hours, said the ACP.

California, Texas, and Arizona each added more than 1 GW of storage in the quarter, said the report. Wood Mackenzie forecast that Florida and Georgia will be major growth markets, ahead, due to aggressive procurement by vertically integrated utilities. For example, Georgia Power just issued a request for proposals for 500 MW of grid-scale storage.

However, supply challenges may hamper utility-scale growth, said Allison Weis, global head of storage at Wood Mackenzie. Weiss commented, “After 2025, utility-scale storage projects must comply with new, stringent battery sourcing requirements to receive the ITC [investment tax credit]. While domestic cell supply is ramping up, supply chain shortages are possible although developers are continuing to consider supply from China to fill in any gaps. A rush to start construction under the more-certain near-term regulatory framework uplifts the near-term forecast. Projects that have not met certain milestones by the end of 2025 are at risk of exposure to changing regulations. There is additional downside risk if further permitting delays threaten solar and storage projects.”

The residential storage market saw a leap in installations in Q2 as well. It added 608 MW in the quarter, representing a 132% increase year-on-year. Most of the growth was driven by California, Arizona, and Illinois, as attachment rates hit new highs and higher-capacity systems gained market share.

Batteries are included at an increased rate in quoted residential solar projects, said a report from EnergySage. Outside of Hawaii, which has a 100% battery attachment rate, California led the way among top-10 solar state markets, with 79% of quoted projects including batteries. This was followed by Texas (61%), Arizona (47%), Utah (44%), Florida (43%), and Illinois (25%).

“Residential storage is expected to outpace solar due to stronger policy resilience, high attachment rates in key markets like California and Puerto Rico, and continued ITC access through third-party ownership,” said Allison Feeney, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie.

The community-scale, commercial and industrial segment expanded 11% in Q2, adding 38 MW. California and New York led Q2 in the segment’s storage installations, accounting for over 70% of total capacity, while Illinois gained traction, said ACP.

The report forecast US storage will reach 87.8 GW by 2029, driven by residential and utility-scale segments.

However, the report warns US utility-scale storage installations could drop 10%, year-over-year, in 2027, largely due to uncertainty over pending Foreign Entity of Concern regulations on battery cell sourcing.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BESS.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 09:01:42.228073

Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.
More buyouts worry opponents Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.
Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock’s ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete’s suggestion that it’ll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn’t been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie’s concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power’s parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”

“While the federal government takes us backwards on energy policy, New York will not be thwarted in its commitment to clean energy.
Projects developed in this latest solicitation are expected to deliver more than $5 billion in clean energy investment and create over 2,500 jobs across New York, according to NYSERDA.
This latest RfP is under NYSERDA’s 2024 Tier 1 Renewable Energy Standard solicitation, which seeks to procure 5.6 million Tier 1 eligible Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), with each REC equalling one MWh of electricity generation.
Moreover, solar PV or other renewable energy projects co-located with energy storage, will require a minimum output of 5MWac for the energy storage element.","For that reason, this newest RfP will seek to intensify efforts to advance shovel-ready projects, “with a focus on qualifying projects that seek to access existing federal tax credits that will expire.”

This approach will aim to accelerate the permitting, interconnection, financing and contracting processes to allow as many projects as possible to reach construction quickly, according to NYSERDA.

With the passing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, solar projects will be required to start construction by 4 July 2026 – or be operational by the end of 2027 – in order to receive tax credits in a “safe harbour” mechanism. The US Treasury Department released guidance on the new “safe harbour” rules last month, which tightened the definition of “start of construction” for projects to still be eligible for tax credits.

“While the federal government takes us backwards on energy policy, New York will not be thwarted in its commitment to clean energy. By directing our state agencies to move projects across the finish line, we are seizing every opportunity to leverage federal incentives, reduce costs for ratepayers, and build a more resilient, sustainable and reliable energy grid,” Hochul said.

Projects developed in this latest solicitation are expected to deliver more than $5 billion in clean energy investment and create over 2,500 jobs across New York, according to NYSERDA.

This latest RfP is under NYSERDA’s 2024 Tier 1 Renewable Energy Standard solicitation, which seeks to procure 5.6 million Tier 1 eligible Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), with each REC equalling one MWh of electricity generation.

Previous iterations of the solicitation ended up awarding mostly solar PV capacity, with last year awarding 2.2GW out of more than 2.5GW for solar PV, while in 2023, solar accounted for 1.5GW of the combined 2.3GW of large-scale renewable energy contracted.

Sean Casten (D-IL) launched a “cheap energy agenda” aiming to address rising energy bills by restoring tax credits for cheap energy, building out a modernized electricity grid, connecting cheap energy to the grid, developing cheap, clean energy, protecting consumers, and involving communities in energy projects.
Many electricity bills come with a monthly chart showing how much energy costs have risen, making it apparent to voters when costs are high.
“More than a million homes are now at least two months behind on payments.” Electricity prices have increased at a pace almost double that of inflation.
Along with electricity prices, Democrats continue to message on Medicaid following the passage of Trump’s megabill.","“For nine months, we watched this Administration and congressional Republicans do everything to stifle clean energy, and clean energy is the fastest growing and the cheapest source of electricity,” Rep. Mike Levin (D-CA) told the Washington Examiner.

“Republicans are blocking the only sources of energy that can be built fast enough to meet growing demand and cheaply enough to actually keep energy bills in check,” he added, pointing to expiring clean energy tax credits.

Following the passage of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Democrats not only leaned into the cuts to entitlement programs such as Medicaid, but have also highlighted the GOP’s aggressive phasing out of clean energy tax credits from former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

Trump’s multitrillion-dollar spending plan extends the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The massive piece of legislation, passed through a process called reconciliation, not only extends the lower individual tax rates that were part of the 2017 law but also makes them permanent.

The cost of electricity has continued to soar for most Americans and is shaping up to be a campaign issue for the 2025 and 2026 elections. In the New Jersey governor’s election this November, Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) and Republican Jack Ciattarelli have both shifted their focus as electricity bills are at the top of voters’ minds in the state.

“Day One as governor, I’m declaring a state of emergency on utility costs using emergency powers to end these rate hikes and drive down your bills,” said Sherrill in her first TV ad of the general election.

Ciattarelli pledged to “lower electricity bills” in a campaign ad and has worked to tie Sherrill to the current Democratic governor on electricity prices as he looks to an “all of the above approach.”

The New Jersey gubernatorial race is not the only place where energy prices are being made a center point. Just this week, Gov. Wes Moore (D-MD) announced a rebate program for utility bill payments as part of his latest effort to lower energy costs for Marylanders. He’s up for reelection in 2026.

Levin and Rep. Sean Casten (D-IL) launched a “cheap energy agenda” aiming to address rising energy bills by restoring tax credits for cheap energy, building out a modernized electricity grid, connecting cheap energy to the grid, developing cheap, clean energy, protecting consumers, and involving communities in energy projects.

Levin said his legislation is a direct result of concerns brought to him by his constituents.

“I think there’s a great deal of frustration that you have people in my district and districts all across the country who are really struggling to make ends meet, costs are very high across the board, and electricity bills are going up and up and up, and others that want to do energy efficiency upgrades are finding those upgrades to be extremely expensive without these credits,” Levin told the Washington Examiner.

Many electricity bills come with a monthly chart showing how much energy costs have risen, making it apparent to voters when costs are high.

“Americans want lower costs, and rising energy bills will be a regular, unavoidable reminder to voters that House Republicans have failed miserably at fulfilling their central campaign promise,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Viet Shelton told the Washington Examiner. “Broken promises and working families facing bigger and bigger bills because of the Big, Ugly Law — these will be the leading reasons Republicans will lose their majority next year.”

Rep. Josh Riley (D-NY) has also been highlighting high electricity prices. He introduced the Keep the Lights Local Act, which aims to cut costs.

“Utility bills in Upstate New York haven’t been this high in a decade,” Riley wrote on social media. “More than a million homes are now at least two months behind on payments.”

Electricity prices have increased at a pace almost double that of inflation. For the year ending in August, electricity shot up 6.2%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index.

The Trump administration has blamed Biden-era green energy initiatives and the accelerated phaseout of traditional fossil fuels such as coal. Trump called increased reliance on wind and solar energy production “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!”

In an interview with the Washington Examiner in August, Energy Secretary Chris Wright backed up Trump’s assessment.

“If you take a grid or a system and grow the renewables penetration, you will raise the price of it,” Wright said. “The president’s 100% correct in that.”

The National Republican Congressional Committee, which is seeking to hold or flip House seats in New York and California, said higher utility rates are the result of blue state leadership.

“Utility rates in blue states are the direct result of the failed leadership, misplaced priorities, reckless spending, and radical policies of governors like [Gavin] Newsom and [Kathy] Hochul,” NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella told the Washington Examiner. “No false attack changes the fact that liberal wish lists in Albany and Sacramento have driven up prices for their constituents while Republicans are left cleaning up their mess.”

A September analysis by Inside Climate News found the average household price of electricity in the United States rose by 9.5% this year, with the highest spikes found in Missouri (38.3% increase), North Dakota (33.6%), New Jersey (28.6%), Iowa (27.5%), and Montana (25.3%)

The blame game comes as the cost of living is a persistent issue for voters across the nation, specifically, concerns about the rising cost of energy.

According to left-wing think tank Data for Progress, 60% of voters reported paying more for electric bills than last year. A PowerLines poll conducted with Ipsos shows that “three out of four Americans, across party lines, say they are worried about rising utility bills.” The Energy Information Administration estimated that average residential electricity prices in the U.S. will jump from $0.1648 per kilowatt-hour in 2024 to around $0.1790 per kilowatt-hour next year.

HALEY STEVENS TO FILE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST RFK JR.

As prices continue to rise, clean energy advocates insist that renewables are not to blame, arguing that some states with the cheapest electricity have built large amounts of wind and solar power. EIA data compiled by American Clean Power show that the top 10 states with the largest share of renewables in their energy makeup have seen significantly smaller electricity price hikes over the last year than the national average (a roughly 2.5% increase).

Along with electricity prices, Democrats continue to message on Medicaid following the passage of Trump’s megabill. From the onset, Democrats labeled the bill the “big, ugly law,” as they held hundreds of events across the country to say that Medicaid cost savings would kick millions of people off their healthcare. Democrats plan to stick to their plan of slamming the bill, even though the tightening of Medicaid eligibility won’t kick in until after the 2026 elections.

The potential buyer couldn’t immediately be determined, the report said.

Occidental, which is backed by Warren Buffett, has been divesting assets in an effort to reduce debt. The divestment is likely to be announced in the coming weeks, the report said.

The Houston-based firm previously helped drive a consolidation in US oil and gas that includes its takeover of Anadarko Petroleum Corp. in 2019 and the $10.8 billion acquisition of CrownRock LP last year. Occidental has embarked on a divestiture program since the CrownRock transaction.

Shares of energy companies including Occidental, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Diamondback Energy rose last week after President Donald Trump said the US was open to imposing more tariffs on Russia and called on European countries to stop buying Russian oil.

Occidental has a diverse international footprint in oil and gas, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Even so, its onshore assets are still expected to provide most of its profit and free cash flow.

Occidental subsidiary 1PointFive this month formed a 50-50 joint venture with Enbridge Inc. to develop the Pelican Sequestration Hub and related transportation infrastructure in Louisiana.

Among the emerging technologies, lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) batteries are drawing growing attention as a next-generation solution. Forecasts indicate that the LMFP market will expand from USD 1.85 billion in 2025 to USD 6.79 billion by 2034, advancing at a robust CAGR of 15.55 percent. This surge is being fueled by the automotive sector’s demand for high-quality batteries, accelerating investments in battery manufacturing, and government support for energy infrastructure worldwide.

LMFP batteries represent a significant step forward in battery technology. By introducing manganese to the traditional lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry, these batteries achieve improved energy density and extended performance. Available in prismatic, cylindrical, and pouch formats, LMFP batteries are versatile enough to serve passenger and commercial electric vehicles, energy storage systems, consumer electronics, and industrial applications. Their combination of safety, cost-effectiveness, and adaptability is driving adoption across multiple industries.

In 2025, Asia-Pacific dominated the market, reflecting its leadership in both electric vehicle adoption and battery manufacturing. China, in particular, continues to play a decisive role, supported by abundant raw material resources, rapid expansion of lithium mining, and a robust ecosystem of manufacturers including BYD, CALB, and CATL. The region’s influence was highlighted by BYD’s launch of its second-generation LMFP blade battery in 2024, designed to enhance the driving range of light-duty vehicles. Looking ahead, Europe is set to record the fastest growth rate. Countries such as Germany, France, and Italy are ramping up production of commercial EVs and supporting domestic battery manufacturing through major government-backed initiatives. The recent announcement by Verkor to establish a new battery plant in Dunkirk underlines the region’s determination to compete globally.

The automotive sector remains the cornerstone of LMFP battery demand. Electric vehicles account for the largest share of adoption, as carmakers increasingly rely on LMFP chemistry to extend driving range and improve performance without compromising on safety. At the same time, the energy storage sector is rapidly emerging as a major growth driver. Utilities and grid operators are turning to LMFP batteries for backup power and load balancing, recognizing their reliability in managing fluctuating renewable energy supply. This dual role in both mobility and energy infrastructure positions LMFP batteries as a critical enabler of a more sustainable future.

From a technological perspective, the market reflects both tradition and innovation. Conventional cathode synthesis methods continue to dominate due to their scalability and cost efficiency. However, nano-engineered cathodes and advanced coating technologies are quickly gaining traction, offering superior energy density and improved cycle life. These advancements are supported by a wave of partnerships between battery manufacturers and automotive brands, as companies seek to design solutions tailored for next-generation vehicles and heavy-duty applications such as electric buses and trucks.

Form factor is another area of evolution. Prismatic batteries currently lead the market thanks to their space efficiency, long cycle life, and durability. Their use in electric and hybrid vehicles as well as large-scale energy storage systems has cemented their position. Yet pouch batteries are on the rise, especially in consumer electronics and mobility applications, where their lightweight, flexible design and cost-effectiveness make them attractive. With rising investments in new pouch cell manufacturing plants, this segment is expected to accelerate quickly.

Government support remains a critical factor in shaping the industry’s trajectory. Countries across Asia, Europe, and North America are investing billions to strengthen their battery manufacturing capacity, secure raw material supplies, and promote clean energy technologies. For instance, the UK announced a USD 621 million investment in 2025 to bolster its domestic battery sector, while India and China continue to expand incentives for EV adoption and local battery production. These initiatives not only reduce reliance on imports but also ensure that local industries can compete on the global stage.

The distribution landscape reflects this momentum. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) dominate sales channels, as automakers prefer to secure batteries directly from trusted partners, ensuring quality and after-sales support. At the same time, the aftermarket is becoming increasingly important, offering replacement and low-cost solutions for consumers and smaller businesses. The rise of e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Walmart as distributors of LMFP batteries further illustrates how diversified the sales ecosystem has become.

Challenges remain, particularly around scaling up production and balancing costs with performance. Yet the pace of innovation and investment suggests that LMFP batteries are set to move from niche to mainstream far faster than earlier technologies. Their unique blend of safety, affordability, and energy performance positions them as a compelling alternative in a market hungry for solutions that can support both mobility and energy storage needs.

As the world accelerates toward electrification, LMFP batteries are poised to play a defining role. They embody the convergence of science, industry, and policy, standing at the intersection of consumer demand for greener mobility and society’s broader push toward sustainable energy.

Following the submission of the readiness letter on September 2, 2025, and FERC’s subsequent confirmation, this milestone accelerates Argent LNG’s path toward construction and operation, positioning the project to deliver reliable U.S. energy to global markets by 2030.

The FERC pre-filing process, under Docket No. PF25-11, initiates formal collaboration with FERC, federal and state agencies, local regulators, and community stakeholders. This phase enables early environmental reviews, engineering advancements, permitting coordination, and transparent engagement to ensure the project upholds the highest standards of safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility.

“Our acceptance into the FERC pre-filing process under Docket No. PF25-11 is a pivotal step toward realizing Argent LNG’s vision as a premier global LNG supplier,” said Jonathan Bass, Chairman and CEO of Argent LNG. “Designed for speed, efficiency, and performance, this project leverages modular technology and partnerships with industry leaders like Baker Hughes, Honeywell UOP, ABB, and GTT to strengthen U.S. energy security while creating significant economic opportunities for Louisiana.”

Located on a 900-acre site under a 90-year lease at Port Fourchon, the terminal benefits from uncongested deepwater access, proximity to low-nitrogen feed-gas pipelines, and the port’s resilient energy infrastructure. Once operational, Argent LNG will be among North America’s largest and most competitive LNG export facilities, supplying cost-effective American natural gas to key markets in Europe, Africa, South Asia, and South America.

“Port Fourchon is the heart of America’s offshore energy industry, and Argent LNG’s project under Docket No. PF25-11 marks a transformative step forward,” said Chett Chiasson, Executive Director of Port Fourchon. “With our deepwater access, robust infrastructure, and skilled workforce, this project will position Fourchon as a global LNG export hub, driving economic growth and innovation in our region.”

Argent LNG’s hybrid model combines Baker Hughes modular construction with proven technology from Honeywell UOP, ABB and GTT, to minimize timelines, costs, and environmental impacts, setting a new standard for U.S. LNG development.

“Democrats can either vote for a clean, short-term, nonpartisan [continuing resolution] that prioritizes the American people, or they can choose a completely avoidable shutdown that prioritizes politics above all else,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) said in a statement Sunday.

Indeed, failure to land a deal on a stopgap funding measure before Wednesday would force a shutdown with sweeping implications for federal programs.

It would trigger lapses in authorizations for myriad energy and environment programs, halt most agency work, restrict disaster relief during hurricane season and prompt the White House to carry out its threat to permanently lay off thousands of federal workers.

Before last week’s recess, Senate Republicans rejected a Democratic funding proposal that would have extended government funding while adding more than $1 trillion in new health care spending and imposing guardrails on the White House’s spending moves.

Then, Senate Democrats blocked passage of Republicans’ “clean” funding extension, which had already passed out of the House. Democrats balked at the bill because it did not include their priorities and was not the result of bipartisan negotiations.

This week, Congress may look to pick up where the Senate left off. Thune is expected to put the Republican continuing resolution up for a vote again and dare Democrats to oppose it a second time before the funding deadline.

“The president wants to talk with [Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.)] about that and say, ‘Don’t do that,’” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said Sunday.

House and Senate leaders doubled down on their party’s negotiating stances in television interviews Sunday, appearing to leave little room for compromise. Republican and Democratic leaders have been preemptively blaming each other for the potential funding lapse.

While they welcomed the meeting with Trump, Democrats expressed skepticism that it could be fruitful. A similar meeting between Trump and Democratic leaders in 2018 quickly spiraled out of control.

“If the president at this meeting is going to rant and just yell at Democrats and talk about all his alleged grievances and say this, that and the other thing, we won’t get anything done,” Schumer said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “But my hope is it will be a serious negotiation.”

House Republicans are holding a conference-wide call Monday morning, according to POLITICO, and House Democrats have plans to meet on their own Monday evening in Washington. Jeffries has called on Democrats to be on Capitol Hill this week even though Johnson canceled votes.

House GOP leaders have discussed potentially not bringing the House back into session at all this week if there is a shutdown Wednesday, POLITICO reported.

Jeffries said in a “dear colleague” letter last week that “Democrats will be in town and prepared to get the job done.”

Separately, the House and Senate Appropriations committees have been working on advancing three bipartisan fiscal 2026 spending bills: Agriculture-FDA, Legislative Branch and Military Construction-Veterans Affairs.

Knapton H2 Storage is a consortium led by gas distributor Northern Gas Networks and partnered with BGS, Centrica Energy Storage+, Third Energy Onshore and the University of Edinburgh. The consortium has been awarded ‘Discovery’ funding by Ofgem’s Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF) to undertake a new study to evaluate geological storage potential in the Knapton area, North Yorkshire. The Ofgem SIF funding is designed to drive innovation in energy networks as part of the ‘Revenue = incentives + innovation + outputs’ (RIIO-2) price control for gas and electricity networks.

Energy storage and backup power will become increasingly important as the UK increases the amount of renewable energy supplying electricity. This study is the first of its kind in the region and will undertake a feasibility assessment of the area’s geology to host energy storage technologies, allowing for the decarbonisation of adjacent gas-fired peaking power plants (those that only run when there is high demand) such as that at Knapton.

The Knapton, Vale of Pickering and North Yorkshire area hosts a fantastic diversity of geology that may be used for storing hydrogen. The region contains numerous depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs that may have potential for repurposing, alongside other porous rock aquifers, salt deposits and rocks that may support lined rock shafts. The study will generate an understanding of what is possible for hydrogen storage at scale in the local area, supporting the area’s local economy and the UK’s energy security.

Keith Owen, Head of Energy Futures at Northern Gas Networks said: As more renewables come online, energy storage will be critical to UK energy security and to clean power. Understanding the full potential for storing hydrogen at scale through Knapton H2 Storage will give us key insights into how we can deliver technologies to provide clean resilience on the days where the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow.

Chris McClane, Energy Transition Interface Manager at Centrica said: “Centrica’s Knapton site is being redeveloped as a clean energy hub for solar generation, green hydrogen production, and battery storage. We’re also exploring hydrogen storage as it offers a reliable, flexible solution to support the energy system of the future that will require diverse fuel supplies ready for when the sun doesn’t shine and wind doesn’t blow. This project will advance the readiness of hydrogen storage technologies by unlocking a replica model to realise its potential at scale to supply hydrogen-to-power generation.”

Edward Hough, Research lead, Underground Energy Storage at the British Geological Survey said: “The natural geology of the area around Knapton will play an important role in supporting the use of hydrogen in the region. Storing hydrogen gives flexibility to the energy system, allowing excess hydrogen to be stored for use during periods when demand exceeds supply. In this project, BGS will build on its extensive laboratory and mapping programmes to help identify areas of the underground geology that may represent future exploration targets for hydrogen storage in bedrock.”

The federal government had come a long way from the heckuva-job-Brownie days of George W. Bush and Michael Brown, the unqualified head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) who mangled the Hurricane Katrina disaster response in New Orleans and on the Gulf Coast.

Yet 20 years and another unqualified FEMA leader later, despite reforms intended to guard against future agency heads joking (or not) about the hurricane season, America’s disaster response has devolved into something more akin to the pre-FEMA era’s improvisions. After two decades of major disasters in the 1960s and ’70s like the Hilo, Hawaii, tsunami, the Alaska earthquake (the worst in American history), and major hurricanes including Agnes, the National Governors Association called for a reorganization of the country’s decentralized emergency preparedness and disaster response systems in 1977. FEMA debuted two years later.

The Trump administration’s zeal to stamp out a flawed but essential agency has been interrupted by the mind-numbing display of bureaucratic micromanaging: the federal response to the Central Texas flash floods in July that killed 135 people, among them children vacationing in summer camps. “As sad as that is, unfortunately, that is typically what moves the needle in terms of disaster policy throughout history,” says Jeff Schlegelmilch, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. “It’s not the data forecasting what’s going to happen. It’s the lives lost when it does happen—and this happened in a red state.”

The requirement that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sign off on agency expenses above $100,000 compromised FEMA disaster hotline availability and search and rescue missions so severely that FEMA’s head of urban search and rescue resigned in frustration.

None of those facts made it into an August DHS press release that offered an upbeat, wholly unsubstantiated perspective on the agency, declaring that after 200 days, “FEMA is 100% faster in getting boots-on-the-ground to respond to disasters.” Nim Kidd, the head of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, claimed, “I’ve been doing this for more than 30 years, and I can say with confidence that this was the fastest and most effective federal support Texas has ever received.”

Earlier this year, President Trump signed an executive order that “empowers State, local, and individual preparedness and injects common sense into infrastructure prioritization and strategic investments through risk-informed decisions that make our infrastructure, communities, and economy resilient to global and dynamic threats and hazards.” An administration “review council” will consider what comes next for the emasculated agency, with a final report due in November.

Only the federal government can come up with billions of dollars in the direst catastrophes.

But common sense isn’t so common. Only the federal government can come up with the billions of dollars and assets to backstop the 50 states, local governments, territories, and tribal lands in the direst catastrophes. In an era when storms and wildfires are more frequent, stronger, and more expensive to respond to and recover from, shifting more of that burden onto states and localities after a jumble of executive orders, layoffs, firings, and delaying or withholding funds displays an obsession with cost-cutting by any means necessary and no concern with the ability of states to deal with catastrophes.

One long-held fallacy that cratered FEMA’s public image is the misguided belief that the federal government parachutes in with fists full of dollars to backstop local efforts as soon as the rains end or the last embers flicker out. It’s led to “Where’s FEMA?” outbursts by angry, despondent survivors who aren’t aware of officials scrambling, or have been taken in by mis/disinformation that compounds their agonies.

After a disaster, local and state officials are the first ones on the ground in many cases, not FEMA. The amount of financial assistance that a community might receive depends on the scope of devastation. A small storm or fire that affects few properties, with no loss of life, particularly in areas that are susceptible to severe storms and wildfires, is usually handled by municipalities and states.

Even broader damage might still not reach the federal threshold for a disaster declaration. The federal government has been selective in how it responds. The National Emergency Management Association reports that in fiscal year 2023 there were nearly 25,000 disasters in the United States; of those, only 60 received a federal disaster declaration.

Under the 1988 Stafford Act, the president approves major disaster declarations for cataclysmic situations that are beyond the capabilities of local and state officials, and emergency declarations for smaller upheavals where federal assistance can help stave off more serious consequences.

“The issue that it often comes down to is who is going to pay for those resources?” says Samantha Montano, a Massachusetts Maritime Academy associate professor of emergency management. “That’s why that declaration is so important, because it comes with money.”

FEMA has historically paid most of the costs for major disasters. Urging states to improve how they gear up for seasonal upheavals like tornadoes, hurricanes, and wildfires is not new. Having states budget for disasters as they might for education or health care has had support from Democrats and Republicans. One such proposal, a state disaster deductible proposed by Craig Fugate, the FEMA administrator during the Obama years, evaporated under the first Trump administration.

But swerving from dependence on Washington after a catastrophe to deep budget cuts and homegrown self-reliance in just a few months produced the horror show that played out on the ground in Texas Hill Country.

PRESIDENT BIDEN SIGNED A MAJOR DISASTER declaration for North Carolina after Tropical Storm Helene on September 28, 2024. The day before, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont (D) approved the deployment of an eight-member volunteer urban search and rescue team to assist local officials in western North Carolina under the auspices of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC). The mayor of Norwalk agreed to send a volunteer from the city’s fire department, a hazmat command and communications unit, along with a fire department utility truck and an ATV for the mission.

EMAC, a national mutual aid framework overseen by the National Emergency Management Association (NEMA), provides disaster relief in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands, with people and equipment, but not funding. States providing assistance can seek reimbursement or send aid at no cost to a receiving state; but that is not linked to a state’s request for a federal declaration or funding. Connecticut and the other New England states also have reciprocal disaster assistance relationships with Canada’s eastern provinces through the International Emergency Management Assistance Compact.

With fewer natural disasters, Connecticut sends more assistance than it receives. “When we put in a bid to help another state, we up front say this is what it’s going to cost, so we know what resources are going to get reimbursed if we send them,” says William Turner, the state’s emergency management director. “[EMAC] is really the mechanism that allows all of us to respond and recover before we have to get FEMA pulled in. We’ve got that piece pretty well figured out. We just need to understand where FEMA is going to end up when the dust settles.”

In New Orleans, local residents have stepped into the city’s disaster preparedness void.

EMAC isn’t safe from a disintegrating FEMA. The mutual aid system runs exclusively on National Incident Management System funding provided through DHS and FEMA. However, in early September, FEMA failed to sign off on EMAC’s annual $2 million grant. Lynn Budd, NEMA’s president, told the national news outlet NOTUS that the episode “certainly flies in the face of the idea that states need to take on more responsibility.” The system finally received its monies, but this snafu raises critical questions about how EMAC can remain effective and navigate the volatile federal environment.

“EMAC works well, as long as there is trust and security among the states that there is going to be funding to pay for those resources,” Montano says. “Once you lose assurance that there is going to be funding for those resources, that can break apart very quickly, not because other states don’t want to help each other, but because the funding isn’t there to do it.”

Before Helene, North Carolina was fairly well off, with a healthy $5 billion in its reserve fund for disasters. Today, about $1 billion has gone to disaster relief, with that account now down to about $3.5 billion. State officials have estimated the total cost of Helene at $60 billion. The proposed state budget for fiscal year 2026 is nearly $34 billion. FEMA has reimbursed about $1 billion.

Trying to work around bureaucratic inertia can backfire. Henderson County in western North Carolina decided not to wait for FEMA funds for debris removal and spent $20 million up front, thinking that the federal payout would be speedier. Across the border, Tennessee took another tack, setting up a Helene Emergency Assistance Loan Program. The $100 million loan fund provides no-interest loans to eligible counties for hauling debris, as well as water and wastewater infrastructure repairs.

Even wealthy states that see frequent natural disasters don’t have the fiscal wherewithal to absorb the multibillions of a major catastrophe. Florida relies heavily on the federal government for response assistance and dollars. In the wildfire sector, California and Washington have devised budgetary formulas based on past disaster costs to allocate funds to disaster accounts. Montana moves a portion of excess general funds once every two years into a wildfire suppression fund. But though those steps have to be taken, particularly now, they don’t deliver enough money.

For some states, moving from “what if” to the “when” in state disaster budgeting is a radical paradigm shift. Historically less-prepared states have had to step up recovery and resilience programs. After several years of federal disaster declarations, an extreme rainfall event in 2015, and Hurricanes Matthew in 2016 and Florence in 2018, South Carolina created an office of resilience. Focusing on coastal and riverine areas, the state encourages strategies to manage waterways and mitigate flooding across communities, recognizing that if a downstream area has strong building codes, storm plans, and public awareness of risks, those efforts may not matter much if an upstream town doesn’t make comparable investments.

Being proactive is critical, says Peter Muller of the Pew Charitable Trusts’ Managing Fiscal Risks project. “They’re trying to put money aside for costs they know they’re going to have, officially, before it happens, so that you don’t have to go and suddenly scramble and pull money from other priorities when a disaster does happen.”

Local residents also have stepped in to fill disaster preparedness gaps. Imagine Water Works, a New Orleans climate and disaster relief group, set up community power stations in neighborhoods after Hurricane Zeta in 2020, when three hurricanes and two tropical storms hit the state, the most in any calendar year. Residents were able to charge devices at homes and businesses that still had or regained power.

With the pandemic raging, residents were also able to pick up hand sanitizer, masks, and other COVID-19 supplies. The group asked fire stations to host charging stations and help people get oxygen for medical devices. They reached out to the city again the following year, and by the third year New Orleans officials began to duplicate their efforts. Fire stations also offer cooling facilities now.

With a robust network of indigenous and LGBTQ people, the group also has locations in Houma and southwest Louisiana as well as other local groups across the Deep South. “My relationship is very good with government. Folks who work in that space will contact me directly and ask for help spreading messages to folks, and we have a large social media presence, and we’re trusted,” says Klie Kliebert, the group’s executive director.

TO MARK THE KATRINA ANNIVERSARY, a group of past and present FEMA employees demanded that Congress wake up to the threat posed by dumping the agency leadership reforms that came out of the 2005 debacle. Some employees were suspended. Restoring FEMA’s independence has support in Congress, but saving FEMA, much less any of the dozens of vital agencies that have been rocketed into oblivion by the Trump administration, hasn’t prioritized faster action.

President Trump’s assault on disaster assistance has had one unifying effect, ginning up varying degrees of outrage and disbelief from every corner of the country. In the short term at least, there’s been the faintest glimmer of off-camera comity between Texas and California, two of the most disaster-prone states in the country, despite the cold civil war over redistricting: In mid-July, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) sent a three-member human remains detection team to Texas, which boosted urban search and rescue personnel in Texas to 42 people.

Twenty states have sued FEMA and DHS to restore funding that had already been allocated under incentivized mitigation programs like Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC), enacted under the first Trump administration. This second time around, FEMA canceled BRIC. A federal judge ordered the White House to halt any reallocation of $4 billion in BRIC funds.

2025 has been a quiet season on the hurricane front—so far. Escaping the threat posed by Hurricane Erin, which steered off into the open Atlantic away from coasts, appears to have dampened any urgency in Washington surrounding this mess. What happens next will signal whether the states can hang together and demand an end to whims disguised as policy or whether federalism is as moribund as the rest of America’s democratic systems. It may take another massive calamity to field-test that proposition.",https://prospect.org/downloads/23597/download/OCT25%20Gurley.jpg?cb=e58d652a1a0ea9dd369144bbb979e0ec&w=1024,N,,2025-09-29 06:57:55.146929

Bridging the gap with fuel cells Fuel cells provide utilities with a proven, flexible solution to meet growing electricity demand.
By integrating fuel cells into their energy strategy, utilities can capture new growth, retain high-value customers and ensure economic development remains in their regions.","The power industry is at the center of America’s economic growth story. Access to power has become a decisive factor in economic growth. For data centers, manufacturers and other large-load customers, the grid is now a gating factor in site selection for new facilities - and they can’t wait for years for infrastructure to catch up. With interconnection queues stretching upwards of five years in parts of the country, utilities must adopt new and agile strategies that deliver power on accelerated timelines.

Fuel cells offer a flexible and responsive approach to meeting electricity demand that is growing at rates not seen since the 1950s. Their modular design allows for rapid deployment close to the load, helping utilities address immediate capacity needs and support large customers.

By integrating fuel cells into their strategy, utilities can bridge power gaps and position themselves to capture new growth, rather than risk losing business opportunities because new prospective customers have to migrate to regions with more accessible electricity.

Power that keeps pace with demand

For utilities, the challenge isn’t just adding capacity — it’s adding it fast enough to keep pace with customers. Failure to deliver on accelerated timelines can mean losing major customers, and the economic development they bring, to other regions.

“The market has flipped in just a few years,” said Scott Dayer, director of utility and IPP origination at Bloom Energy. “Electrification was already accelerating, and now compute demand is surging on top of that. Together, they’ve turned a system that for years had surplus into one where the real challenge is adding capacity fast enough to keep up with large, hard-to-forecast loads.”

Fuel cells give utilities a way to meet that need without waiting for new transmission lines, substations or conventional generation. They are also a faster alternative to constructing traditional forms of colocated generation like gas engines and turbines, where a customer installs and manages its own onsite power.

Bloom Energy, for example, can deliver up to 50MW in as little as 90 days. With 1 GW of annual production capacity today and 2 GW expected by the end of 2026, Bloom can support utilities in bringing hundreds of MW online in under six months.

For utilities, this capability provides a critical bridge. Fuel cells can serve large-load customers immediately while infrastructure upgrades progress. Plus, unlike gas turbines or reciprocating engines, fuel cells operate quietly, have a smaller footprint and carry a significantly lower emissions profile, making permitting easier and deployments more acceptable to neighboring communities.Crucially, fuel cells deliver firm 24/7 power, ensuring utilities can reliably meet customer demand as projects come online.

Power that scales with demand

Fuel cells offer scalable power that can be deployed at customer sites or at distribution substations, giving utilities maximum flexibility to match load growth over time. For example, Bloom’s skid-mounted “copy-and-paste” modular architecture enables rapid deployment at any scale — from hundreds of kilowatts to hundreds of megawatts — without introducing scaling risk.

This flexibility is especially valuable for large-load customers such as colocation data centers, where demand can expand quickly as new tenants move in after construction is complete. The compact, skid-mounted design of fuel cell systems allows utilities to scale power efficiently. For example, a 20,000-square-foot ground mount can provide 30 MW of power. The same footprint, with a four-unit-tall install configuration, can deliver 100 MW.

Case in Point: AEP Delivers for AWS with Bloom Fuel Cells

American Electric Power (AEP) will be utilizing Bloom Energy Server systems to provide immediate, reliable power to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Cologix data centers in Central Ohio. The fuel cells will enable the customer to begin operations quickly while AEP continues to permit and build out traditional transmission solutions over a multi-year timeline. Under these long-term agreements, the customers cover the full project costs, protecting utility ratepayers and ensuring the region retains economic development that might otherwise migrate elsewhere.

Beyond scaling capacity, fuel cells also provide operational flexibility. They can integrate with microgrids, distributed energy resources (DERs) or other grid assets, allowing utilities to optimize energy delivery, improve resilience and respond to shifting demand patterns in real time.

Power that moves with demand

One of the unique advantages of fuel cells is their mobility. Mounted on skids, crews can relocate them after infrastructure upgrades are complete, allowing utilities to optimize deployment as demand shifts. “Equipment can be redeployed as transmission constraints change, so utilities maintain flexibility and avoid overcommitting to one location or site,” Dayer said.

This modular design enables rapid redeployment to meet evolving load requirements, allowing utilities to position capacity where it’s needed most and respond to changing market dynamics efficiently.

Bridging the gap with fuel cells

Fuel cells provide utilities with a proven, flexible solution to meet growing electricity demand. Bloom Energy’s Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Energy Server® power systems can be deployed behind or in front of the meter, or grid-parallel, in a variety of configurations and contracting models, offering utilities the ability to respond to evolving customer needs with speed and reliability.

With a 17-year record of proven reliability, over 1.5 GW of deployed capacity, Bloom’s modular architecture enables rapid, scalable deployment while delivering high efficiency and firm 24/7 power. By integrating fuel cells into their energy strategy, utilities can capture new growth, retain high-value customers and ensure economic development remains in their regions.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/n1MbtebkFObJvYKXM0nv7ihemeOlTIfWxqBTbOWKRSg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzQwNDEzMjAwLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-29 09:02:02.799757

On President Donald Trump’s first day in office, he issued a memorandum halting approvals, permits, leases and loans for both offshore and onshore wind projects.
“It’s clear that states are taking some of their cues from the federal government,” said Nelson Falkenburg, siting policy manager at Clean Tomorrow and one of the report’s authors.
Of the roughly 300 siting bills introduced in the first half of the year, just under 40 were signed into law.

On President Donald Trump’s first day in office, he issued a memorandum halting approvals, permits, leases and loans for both offshore and onshore wind projects.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which passed in July with exclusively Republican support, accelerated the phaseout of tax credits promised under the Inflation Reduction Act for wind and solar projects. Subsequent guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department further constrained eligibility rules.

And as bipartisan permitting reform takes center stage in Congress, critics have expressed doubt over whether a technology-neutral bill would still benefit renewable energy development under the current administration.

During a House committee hearing for the SPEED Act on Sept. 10, multiple Democrats expressed concern about their ability to engage in good-faith negotiations with Republicans to accelerate permitting amid the GOP’s attacks on wind and solar. Environmental groups, too, have cautioned that federal efforts to reform permitting could offer little benefit for renewables.

According to a report from the think tank Clean Tomorrow, the battle over renewable development has spread beyond Congress and the Trump administration—with siting policy at the state level now serving as one of the primary battlegrounds for those seeking to curtail the deployment of new clean energy projects.

“It’s clear that states are taking some of their cues from the federal government,” said Nelson Falkenburg, siting policy manager at Clean Tomorrow and one of the report’s authors.

The report’s authors assessed the expected impact of more than 300 state-level siting bills based on factors including their effect on permitting timelines, the predictability and uniformity of siting decisions and whether the bill incentivizes development. Falkenburg said they also used criteria from Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, when possible, to determine if a policy is restrictive.

According to Clean Tomorrow’s report, from January through June of this year, 148 siting-related bills were introduced across 47 states, seeking to make siting and permitting more restrictive.

That significantly outnumbers bills that would have a neutral impact (89) and those that would be more permissive (68).

Restrictive policies would hinder the development of renewable energy, while permissive policies would facilitate it. Bills that the authors deemed to have a neutral effect are those whose impact on project deployment was negligible or ambiguous, Falkenburg said.

The pushback against renewables, like recent actions at the federal level, is largely driven by the GOP.

Republican state lawmakers introduced nearly twice as many siting bills as Democrats, with an overwhelming number of those likely to restrict renewable development—nine restrictive bills for every one permissive proposal, according to Clean Tomorrow’s analysis.

“There’s a huge subset of these bills that legislators are introducing because they have constituents who are upset about renewable energy or they’re trying to score political points,” Falkenburg said.

“There are some that are purely messaging, and there are others that have real traction and are advancing quickly through their state legislatures.”

A Republican senator in Illinois, for example, introduced SB 160, which would have given local governments the authority to ban or restrict wind and solar projects. That effort had little chance of passing through the state’s Democrat-controlled legislature.

But other anti-renewable bills across the country advanced further through the legislative process. Arizona’s SB 1150, which included a slew of restrictive measures against wind farms, narrowly passed in the state House before stalling in the Senate.

If that bill had passed, Clean Tomorrow’s report says, it would have been the most restrictive wind development law in the U.S.

Thankfully for the renewable industry, the vast majority of those efforts haven’t been successful. Of the roughly 300 siting bills introduced in the first half of the year, just under 40 were signed into law.

Clean Tomorrow’s analysis found that over half of those are expected to have no meaningful impact on the pace of clean energy deployment, with a balance of wins (10 bills) and losses (7 bills) for the renewable industry in the remainder.

One reason the industry avoided some of the worst attacks, according to Falkenburg, is that there was less uniformity in Republicans’ views on renewable energy at the state level when compared to the federal level.

“There’s plenty of nuance in red states, and differences between folks who … have taken on the message from the federal government that clean energy is bad,” Falkenburg said.

“And then there’s plenty of other Republican legislators who are supportive of the industry—but mostly quietly behind closed doors and working to maintain renewable energy production in their states.”

Oklahoma serves as a prime example of that dynamic. The state’s attorney general, Gentner Drummond, has publicly denounced wind energy as a “Green Energy Scam,” and the Republican-controlled legislature passed three bills that would have had a restrictive impact on the deployment of renewable technologies.

Yet Governor Kevin Stitt, also a Republican, vetoed two of those bills—although the GOP-led legislature overrode one of those vetoes—and has been “unabashedly pro-renewables,” according to Clean Tomorrow’s report.

Stitt also publicly broke with Trump earlier this year on federal efforts to roll back clean energy tax credits, and on the administration’s attacks against wind energy.

Clean Tomorrow’s report also points to unlikely alliances in the private sector and local communities as one of the forces pushing back against some of the more egregious attacks on renewables.

For example, the report highlights the role played by a coalition of the renewable industry, business groups and oil and gas interests in Louisiana in defeating HB 615, which would have dealt a significant blow to the state’s emerging solar industry.

Those efforts were mirrored in other states, such as Texas and Oklahoma, where chambers of commerce partnered with ranchers, and the energy sector joined forces with tech companies to oppose some of the more restrictive bills in those states.

In Falkenburg’s eyes, the wrangling over renewable energy siting is likely to intensify in the coming months, with significant potential for states to use siting and permitting to counter anti-renewable actions at the federal level.

“We’re expecting to see a lot of governors introduce executive orders and emergency actions in the next few months to try to mitigate or blunt the impact of the recent federal actions,” Falkenburg said. “And we expect in the legislature in 2026, more states will use this to reform their siting and permitting processes to deploy more energy, more renewable energy projects.”

Some of those actions are already taking root. In May, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore signed the Renewable Energy Certainty Act into law, which aims to standardize siting requirements for solar farms and energy storage devices, and preempts restrictive local zoning rules that prohibit these projects, according to environmental law firm Beveridge & Diamond.

And in California, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an executive order in late August, fast-tracking the permitting process for energy projects racing to begin construction before federal tax credits expire due to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s rollbacks.

According to Falkenburg, such state-level initiatives are going to become increasingly important in the face of the Trump administration’s growing attacks on wind and solar.

“For the renewable energy industry and climate advocates, the lesson here is really stark,” Falkenburg said. “State-level siting policy is a critical and contentious arena for the clean energy transition.”

“As the federal government abdicates its role in energy policy, the future of America’s clean energy economy depends increasingly on the outcomes of state-by-state political battles over where and how clean energy projects can be built.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2203448622-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 05:59:20.414854

On Friday, Nymex crude, Brent crude, and U.S. natural gas futures rose by 1.1%, 1%, and 0.3%, respectively.","According to Zhitong Finance App, based on the third-quarter regional survey released late last week by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, pessimism among U.S. oil and gas executives regarding the outlook for the traditional energy sector is rising. Many executives expressed growing frustration over the obstacles posed by the chaotic trade policies of the Trump administration upon its return to the White House, as well as frequent changes in regulatory guidelines.

For the North American oil and gas industry, which fully supported 'Trump's MAGA-ism,' Trump’s presidency did not make the 'American oil industry great again' as he had promised. Measured by 'production,' U.S. oil output did reach new highs; however, measured by 'business sentiment/profitability/investment willingness,' the industry did not exhibit the strong expansion that Trump had promised, with executive sentiment remaining subdued.

MAGA, short for 'Make America Great Again,' refers both to the core tone of all policies under the Trump-led U.S. government and is also used by some mainstream media to refer to Trump himself and his fervent supporters among U.S. voters.

Making the American oil industry 'great again' essentially equates to 'high production + strong business sentiment + robust investment.' Currently, it is closer to 'high production, low sentiment'—output is impressive, but the central price of U.S. oil, along with policies/tariffs/uncertainty, is suppressing capital expenditure and sentiment. Overall, the entire U.S. oil industry appears more like 'increasing output while suffering internally,' rather than becoming 'great again.'

The Trump administration’s imposition of high steel and aluminum tariffs globally (up to 50% on steel and aluminum) drove up costs for OCTG (oil country tubular goods), pipelines, fracking equipment, and construction, repeatedly cited in the survey report by oil and gas executives as a source of 'rising costs and policy volatility.' On one hand, traditional U.S. energy companies complain about increased costs due to steel tariffs and policy flip-flopping causing 'chaos'; on the other hand, OPEC+ responded to U.S. calls for lower oil prices by ramping up production, thereby capping price elasticity—a development highly unfavorable for profitability in the U.S. oil industry, particularly in shale oil.

Overall, the rapid, concentrated, and directionally inconsistent policy/rule changes under the Trump administration across key areas such as methane regulation, RFS (Renewable Fuel Standard), offshore and public land development, LNG (liquefied natural gas) approvals, carbon emission standards, NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) procedures, and offshore financial guarantees have made compliance and capital planning difficult to stabilize. These factors collectively fueled collective grievances among executives in the U.S. oil and gas sector—one of Trump’s core constituencies—in the Dallas Fed survey, regarding 'heightened uncertainty and declining investment willingness.'

Collapse of the U.S. shale oil industry

The Dallas Fed's survey, conducted from September 10 to 18, gauged the latest sentiment of 139 oil and gas executives across the most crucial oil and gas regions in the U.S.—Texas, northern Louisiana, and southern New Mexico. The total energy production (primarily oil) from these regions even surpasses that of some of the world’s largest oil-producing nations.

""The U.S. shale sector has already begun to collapse,"" one executive said in the survey. ""Once the most dynamic energy engine in the world, it has now been gutted by political hostility and economic ignorance under the Trump administration.""

""We have entered what might be called the 'shale twilight zone' for this segment of the industry,"" another oil and gas executive commented. ""The U.S. isn't running out of oil, but she (the Statue of Liberty) is certainly running out of oil priced at $60 a barrel.""

""A vibrant oilfield services sector will be critical if the U.S. needs to ramp up production. Right now, we are bleeding,"" an executive from a publicly traded oilfield support services company stated.

Criticism of Trump’s policies is not new, but Wall Street analysts widely noted that the latest commentary represented a significant escalation in tone, with executives describing the U.S. President’s sudden shifts and frequent adjustments on steel tariffs and energy policy as ""kneecapping"" an industry he had promised to support.

The survey also found that executives in the U.S. oil and gas industry now expect West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices to remain significantly lower than previously anticipated, forecasting a price of around $63 per barrel by the end of 2025 and staying within the $60 range through 2027; earlier in the second quarter, these executives had predicted WTI would close the year near $68 per barrel and re-enter the optimistic $70 range within two years.

Crude oil futures surged last week due to ongoing attacks by Ukraine on Russian oil infrastructure, undoubtedly adding a rising geopolitical risk premium for long-term buyers of Russian oil such as India and China, along with potential further sanctions from the EU and the U.S.

The cumulative impact of drone strikes became evident as Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak announced on Thursday that Russia will impose a partial ban on diesel exports until the end of the year while extending its existing ban on gasoline exports. This move represents a significant obstacle to oil and gas trade for the two major economies, India and China.

President Trump has been consistently and cautiously pressuring U.S. allies to reduce any oil imports from Russia to push President Putin to the negotiating table. Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, remarked, ""We may see reductions in Russian imports by India and Turkey.""

NATO's warning against further airspace violations has heightened tensions and increased the likelihood of additional sanctions on Russia's oil industry.

Additionally, according to the national news agency, plans to resume crude oil exports from Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region last Saturday could sustain expectations of oversupply, potentially driving Brent crude prices into a pronounced downward trajectory.

According to reports citing people familiar with the matter, Iraq is in negotiations with one of the most influential giants in the crude oil transportation sector – commodity trading giant Vitol. Once crude oil exports from the country’s Kurdistan region resume after a two-year halt, Vitol will handle the crude sales. This news is evidently negative for the Brent crude price, the international crude benchmark that has been weak for much of this year. The resumption of Kurdish oil exports is expected to intensify expectations of an “oversupplied crude oil market,” potentially pushing the recently rebounding Brent crude price back into a downtrend.

As of last week’s close, the front-month WTI crude contract for November delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) rose +5.3% to $65.72 per barrel, while the front-month Brent crude contract for November on the Intercontinental Exchange rose +5.2% to $70.13 per barrel. This marks the largest weekly gain for both benchmark crude prices since the week of June 13. Meanwhile, the front-month natural gas contract for October on Nymex rose +0.5% to $3.206 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).

On Friday, Nymex crude, Brent crude, and U.S. natural gas futures rose by 1.1%, 1%, and 0.3%, respectively. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE), representing the energy stock benchmark ETF, gained +3.9% last week but has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 index year-to-date.

Goldman Sachs has emerged as a 'big short' on crude oil: the global oversupply situation is set to worsen, with Brent crude possibly falling below $50 per barrel by 2026.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global crude markets are on the verge of significant oversupply due to OPEC's production increases and expectations that North American shale producers will ramp up output under the Trump administration. The return of Kurdish crude will only exacerbate this surplus. Previous reports indicated that pipeline resumption is initially expected to bring about 230,000 barrels per day to the international market, with the potential for this figure to increase further.

If Kurdish pipelines resume operations as planned, it would marginally weigh on Brent crude prices. An estimated ~230,000 barrels per day are expected to enter the market during the initial phase of Kurdish resumption, potentially rising to as much as 1 million barrels per day later. The IEA assesses that supply dynamics already point toward an oversupply situation in 2025, with the surplus likely to widen further in 2026. The return of Kurdish oil will undoubtedly exacerbate this backdrop of market oversupply.

In its latest commodities research report, Goldman Sachs maintained its forecast for Brent crude and WTI crude prices in 2025, while projecting average prices of $56 and $52 per barrel, respectively, for 2026. However, Goldman Sachs noted that due to the negative impact of increasing global crude oil oversupply, there is a probability that Brent crude futures could fall below the $50-per-barrel threshold by the end of 2026.

The U.S.-based financial institution stated that between Q4 2025 and Q4 2026, the global crude oil market is expected to experience an average daily surplus of 1.8 million barrels, leading to a significant buildup of nearly 800 million barrels in global oil inventories during this period. The report specifically highlighted that inventory increases among OECD member countries will account for one-third of the global total, reaching approximately 270 million barrels. Goldman Sachs added that with worsening oversupply and inventory pressures in 2026, Brent crude prices are likely to fall below current futures market expectations.",https://newsfile.futunn.com/news-thumbnail/20240704/public/1720075538223258302092-news-thumbnail/20240704/public/17200755382238178651278.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 08:01:10.352592
,American Energy,2025-09-29 08:18:55+00:00,Canary Media,Did California just screw up the largest virtual power plant in the US? - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/california-dsgs-funding-2025-legislation,"But the last-minute negotiations left one key money-saving measure on the cutting-room floor — continued funding for what might be the world’s largest virtual power plant.
If not, they’ll have to put those customers on hold — and California could lose hundreds of megawatts of cost-effective grid relief.
First, under DSGS, customers can be paid for sending power to the grid from their home batteries that have been charged up by rooftop solar, he said.
Most other VPPs in California only allow homes to reduce their consumption from the grid to zero, not to send power back to the grid.
As Sunrun CEO Mary Powell pointed out in a LinkedIn post, that’s more capacity than many of the state’s fossil-gas power plants provide.","California lawmakers managed to pass a slate of bills aimed at controlling the state’s high and rising electricity costs in the final days of the legislative session this month. But the last-minute negotiations left one key money-saving measure on the cutting-room floor — continued funding for what might be the world’s largest virtual power plant.

Now, companies like Sunrun and Tesla that have enrolled tens of thousands of customers in that VPP program don’t know if they can pay them to participate next year, because it’s unclear if any other state funding can be cobbled together. If not, they’ll have to put those customers on hold — and California could lose hundreds of megawatts of cost-effective grid relief.

Lawmakers ​“are consistently undervaluing what distributed solar and storage can deliver for the system,” said Kate Unger, senior policy advisor for the California Solar and Storage Association, a trade group that supports the program. ​“We find this to be very shortsighted and frustrating, because DSGS is a cost-saving measure.”

DSGS stands for the Demand Side Grid Support program, which pays utility customers to help relieve costly peaks in electricity demand during extreme events like heat waves. They do this by cutting their own power consumption with devices like smart thermostats or by feeding extra power to the grid from backup batteries that have been charged by rooftop solar. Customers have already installed and paid for those systems, so making use of them is cheaper than building new power plants or grid infrastructure to manage those peaks.

DSGS has grown quickly since its 2022 launch to more than 1 gigawatt of grid-relief capacity, Unger said, about 700 megawatts of that from batteries in homes and businesses, which can be deployed rapidly. That’s much bigger than other similar programs in the state.

Backers say that’s because DSGS, which is administered by the California Energy Commission, is far less onerous for participants than VPP programs run by the state’s utilities.

It’s also more cost-effective, according to an August analysis from consultancy The Brattle Group. That report, which was commissioned by Sunrun and Tesla, found that solar-charged batteries in DSGS could deliver between tens of millions and hundreds of millions of dollars in net savings to all California utility customers over the next four years. Those projected savings are predicated on the program nearly doubling its current capacity, which is a credible goal given that California residents are adding backup batteries in increasing numbers.

But instead of expanding its funding to achieve that growth, state lawmakers cut it this year in the face of budget shortfalls, just like they did last year. A provision that lawmakers inserted in August into a bill reauthorizing the state’s greenhouse-gas cap-and-trade program would have provided DSGS with a stable funding stream into the middle of next decade, but it was stripped from the bill that emerged from closed-door negotiations between Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and legislative leaders days before it was passed. That leaves DSGS with a dwindling pool of previously committed funding that is very likely to be depleted this year.

The remaining budget currently stands at about $64 million, according to the program administrator. DSGS would need at least $75 million more to continue operating in 2026, according to a letter sent to California lawmakers in August by dozens of companies, trade groups, and advocacy organizations.

DSGS backers are hoping the program might be able to secure a slice of the $1 billion in reserves to be disbursed annually from the state’s newly reauthorized cap-and-trade program. But Unger warned that competition for that money will be fierce — and lawmakers won’t make decisions on that spending until next year.

Without new funding, companies that have been active in DSGS will likely have to tell their customers they won’t be able to participate in 2026, said Brad Heavner, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association. ​“How do you put your customers in a program if you don’t know they’ll get paid?”

Why DSGS is better than California’s other VPPs

The failure to fund DSGS is particularly frustrating, Heavner said, because it’s the rare example of a successful virtual-power-plant program in the state. Though California has ostensibly prioritized VPPs, it has little else to show for its efforts.

For more than a decade, the state has required its major utilities to incorporate rooftop solar systems, backup batteries, smart thermostats, and other distributed energy resources (DERs) into their grid operations and planning. But utilities have done very little to actually tap these devices beyond launching pilot projects (and terminating many of them), even as the number of DERs in the state has grown dramatically. A June progress report from the California Energy Commission found the state has barely expanded its demand-side capacity over the past two years, and remains far from hitting its goal of 7 gigawatts by 2030.

“California is really excellent at deploying DERs, but really lags in DER utilization,” said Gabriela Olmedo, regulatory affairs specialist at EnergyHub, a company that manages demand-side resources and virtual power plants in the U.S. and Canada. Many of those programs have grown to play a significant role in reducing stress on utility grids during peak demand, she said, including a large-scale initiative in neighboring Arizona. But California’s ​“fractured, overlapping, and confusing load-flexibility programs really preclude scale,” she said.

DSGS, one of many programs created in response to California’s grid emergencies in 2020 and 2022, has broken that pattern, said Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid-edge research for analytics firm Wood Mackenzie and lead author of a recently released report on virtual power plants. In particular, DSGS has avoided the types of problems that have limited customer participation in other VPP programs, he said.

First, under DSGS, customers can be paid for sending power to the grid from their home batteries that have been charged up by rooftop solar, he said. Most other VPPs in California only allow homes to reduce their consumption from the grid to zero, not to send power back to the grid. That’s a legacy of these programs’ genesis as traditional demand-response offerings that reward customers for reducing power use.

DSGS is also superior to the Emergency Load Reduction Program (ELRP), the other large-scale VPP program created as a response to California’s grid emergencies, Heavner said. One of the biggest differences is that ELRP is triggered only during specified grid alerts, warnings, or emergency declarations by the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state’s energy markets. Those emergencies are relatively rare, so participants are idle most of the time.

DSGS, by contrast, is triggered whenever wholesale prices on the state’s transmission grid exceed a threshold of $200 per megawatt-hour, so it plays a more active role in suppressing the price spikes that drive up costs for utilities and customers, Heavner said.

DSGS is also open to customers of all utilities in the state, unlike ELRP and most of the state’s other VPP programs, which are managed separately by each of California’s three large investor-owned utilities. Companies that have participated in both sets of programs say it’s easier to sign up customers and get them paid promptly under DSGS than under utility-managed efforts.

Killing California’s most promising VPP right as it’s getting big

A set of laws passed this year instructs state regulators to develop new VPP plans and programs, which could augment the current limited options. But ​“it will take years to establish that,” Heavner said. Meanwhile, ​“companies that have invested in dynamic grid response are left holding the bag right now.”

California may miss out on big money-saving opportunities as a result, he said. A 2024 analysis from The Brattle Group found that VPPs could shave more than 15% of the state’s peak demand by 2035, saving utility customers about $550 million each year.

The loss of funding for DSGS is particularly galling given the scale it has achieved, Heavner said. In a July test of the DSGS and ELRP programs, California’s three major utilities were able to dispatch about 540 megawatts of power from Sunrun and Tesla batteries, in what utility Pacific Gas & Electric described as ​“the largest test of its kind ever done in California — and maybe the world.”

Most of those batteries were enrolled in the DSGS program. Sunrun batteries alone accounted for at least 360 megawatts of capacity. As Sunrun CEO Mary Powell pointed out in a LinkedIn post, that’s more capacity than many of the state’s fossil-gas power plants provide.

Sunrun had enrolled more than 56,000 customers with solar-battery systems to participate in California VPP programs as of May, the majority of them in DSGS. The company offered participants up to $150 per battery enrolled in the 2025 season.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/solar-ca-homes-neighborhood.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=eff1726590319d11b9d913c0e3c78e9a,N,,2025-09-29 09:02:06.867769

By 2030, blue hydrogen will likely supply 25–30% of clean hydrogen demand worldwide, ensuring industries can decarbonize while green hydrogen scales.","The Global Blue Hydrogen Market has emerged as one of the most promising segments of the clean energy transition, bridging the gap between traditional fossil fuel-based hydrogen and fully renewable green hydrogen. In 2024, the market was valued at USD 2,242.24 million and is projected to reach USD 2,511.31 million in 2025, before expanding further to USD 2,812.67 million in 2026. Long-term forecasts indicate the market could reach USD 6,964.06 million by 2034, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% between 2025 and 2034.

Blue hydrogen is produced using natural gas through steam methane reforming (SMR) or autothermal reforming (ATR) combined with carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). This process significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional “grey” hydrogen, making it a crucial transition fuel on the path to net-zero emissions. Governments and energy companies are increasingly investing in large-scale projects to deploy blue hydrogen at commercial levels, particularly in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.

Demand is being driven by multiple sectors: refineries, ammonia production, steelmaking, long-haul transport, and power generation. For example, global hydrogen demand is expected to exceed 200 million tons annually by 2030, with blue hydrogen positioned to meet a significant portion of that demand due to its cost competitiveness and lower carbon intensity compared to green hydrogen.

Regional insights show that the United States, Canada, Germany, the UK, Japan, and Saudi Arabia are among the frontrunners in developing blue hydrogen infrastructure. Investments from energy giants such as Shell, BP, and Equinor highlight the strategic importance of blue hydrogen in decarbonizing heavy industry and transport.

As the global energy landscape evolves, the blue hydrogen market in 2025 stands at a pivotal stage, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution while paving the way for the long-term adoption of green hydrogen.

What is Blue Hydrogen Companies?

Blue Hydrogen companies are organizations engaged in the production, distribution, and commercialization of hydrogen generated from natural gas, coupled with carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies. Unlike “grey” hydrogen, which emits large amounts of CO₂, blue hydrogen captures up to 90% of the carbon emissions produced during manufacturing, making it a lower-carbon alternative and a vital bridge to a net-zero economy.

In 2025, the global blue hydrogen market is projected to reach USD 2,511.31 million, growing steadily toward USD 6,964.06 million by 2034 at a CAGR of 12%. Blue hydrogen companies form the backbone of this growth, with major players such as Shell, BP, Equinor, and Air Products leading investments in large-scale projects. For instance, Shell’s blue hydrogen facility in the Netherlands is expected to produce 60,000 kg/day of hydrogen by 2025, supporting industrial decarbonization.

The role of these companies extends beyond production. Many are developing value chains that integrate hydrogen transport, storage, and end-use applications in refineries, power plants, and mobility sectors. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that hydrogen could meet 10% of global energy demand by 2050, and blue hydrogen companies are expected to supply a substantial portion of this demand over the next decade.

Geographically, companies in the USA, Canada, Germany, UK, Japan, and Saudi Arabia are investing billions in infrastructure. The U.S. Department of Energy alone has allocated over USD 8 billion for regional clean hydrogen hubs, many of which prioritize blue hydrogen.

USA Growing Blue Hydrogen Market

The United States has rapidly emerged as one of the leading markets for blue hydrogen, driven by strong policy support, abundant natural gas reserves, and accelerated investments in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) infrastructure. In 2025, the U.S. blue hydrogen industry is projected to contribute nearly 30% of global revenues, equivalent to USD 753 million, out of the USD 2,511.31 million global market. This growth is reinforced by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, which provides tax credits of up to USD 3 per kilogram of low-carbon hydrogen, making blue hydrogen financially competitive against both grey and green alternatives.

The Department of Energy’s Hydrogen Shot initiative aims to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen to USD 1 per kilogram by 2031, and blue hydrogen is a critical pathway toward achieving this goal. Large-scale projects in Texas, Louisiana, and California are being developed by companies like Shell, ExxonMobil, and Air Products, with planned production capacities exceeding 1 million tons annually by 2030. For example, Air Products’ Louisiana Blue Hydrogen Plant, valued at USD 4.5 billion, is one of the largest such projects in the world, expected to capture over 5 million tons of CO₂ per year.

Beyond industrial production, the U.S. is integrating blue hydrogen into heavy transport, refineries, and power generation. Hydrogen fueling infrastructure is expanding, with California alone expected to host over 200 hydrogen stations by 2027, many sourcing supply from blue hydrogen.

With robust federal funding, private sector leadership, and natural gas availability, the U.S. blue hydrogen market is positioned for sustained double-digit growth, establishing itself as a global hub in the clean hydrogen economy.

A recent analysis from EnergySage shows how changes in the federal budget could reshape the way many Americans go solar, and leasing might now be the smarter play for some households.

The update comes as the U.S. prepares for the expiration of many Inflation Reduction Act tax credits in 2025, shifting the financial landscape for both purchased and leased rooftop systems.

While outright ownership has traditionally been the go-to, Emily Walker, director of insights at EnergySage, explains that third-party ownership options such as leases and power purchase agreements may become more popular.

If you lease your solar panels instead of buying them, the company that owns the system can still get the 30% tax credit for a couple of more years. That means leased solar projects have until mid-2026 to start or until the end of 2027 to be finished.

""That extra time is consequential for installers,"" Walker said. ""It allows them to continue developing residential projects with the tax credit, even as the credit for purchased systems disappears. For some homeowners, that will make TPO [third-party ownership] the most accessible entry point into solar.""

Going solar remains one of the best ways to cut utility bills and slash the pollution fueling Earth's overheating.

EnergySage makes it simple with free tools to compare quotes and get estimates, helping homeowners see what works best for their budget.

Solar panels don't just clean up the grid. They also put money back into people's pockets over time. With EnergySage's marketplace, the average homeowner can save up to $10,000 on solar installations. Its mapping tool also breaks down the average cost of systems and available incentives by state, so you know exactly what savings might be on the table where you live.

Pairing solar with efficient home appliances such as heat pumps can drive utility bills even lower. EnergySage even has a free comparison tool for heat pumps, making it easier to find the right option and installer for your home.

EnergySage emphasizes that while the policy changes may complicate the math for owned systems, TPO options will still allow families to tap into clean energy.

Whether you buy or lease, going solar sooner rather than later could mean significant savings for your household and a healthier planet.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/solar-leasingimage-rectYAfove5uLJ1pt-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 06:58:08.321890

The EV Infrastructure Deployment Plan’s (EVIDP) approval means the Commonwealth will have allocated nearly $55 million to expand its EV network through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program to-date.

“When Washington makes Kentucky a promise, I’m going to do everything I can to make sure they keep it,” said Gov. Andy Beshear. “I’m glad to see these dollars returned to the commonwealth, and these investments to expand our state’s EV network will help Kentucky continue building on its status as a global automotive leader.”

Last month, Gov. Beshear joined 19 other states and the District of Columbia to challenge the Trump administration’s decision to freeze $32 million in NEVI funding. In total, Kentucky expects to receive nearly $70 million in NEVI funding, the remaining $14.8 million in NEVI funds is anticipated to be available later this year.

Federal approval of Kentucky’s latest (EVIDP) allows new funds to support Phase 2 and Phase 3 of Kentucky’s EV plan, which will expand charging infrastructure along other priority corridors, in communities, and at destination sites statewide.

The plan was developed by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC) in cooperation with the Energy and Environment Cabinet (EEC) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).

Kentucky has awarded 46 fast-charging stations statewide with five stations open and three additional stations under construction. The five active stations are in Berea, Grayson, Hazard, Richmond, and Sparta. All of the awarded stations are expected to open in 2026. They represent an investment of $31.6 million in obligated NEVI federal formula funds.

“Accessible fast-charging stations across the Commonwealth will make a real difference for Kentuckians and visitors alike,” said KYTC Secretary Jim Gray. “We look forward to having nearly 50 NEVI funded fast charging stations up and running in the Commonwealth next year. Kentucky is leading the charge on the EV front.”

Kentucky is a leader in automotive production and is the EV battery production capital of the United States, helping create thousands of high-quality jobs for Kentuckians. Kentucky touts $13.5 billion in EV-related investments in the state with the creation of nearly 10,200 full-time jobs statewide.

The 46 awarded sites are along the state’s interstates and parkways. Each station must have at least four charging ports of 150 kilowatts or more, be accessible to the public 24 hours a day/seven days a week, and work with most EV models.

KYTC does not develop, own, operate or maintain the charging stations. Each developer must fund at least 20% of the construction and operational costs and is required to maintain and operate the charging station for at least five years.

Visit EVCharging.ky.gov for more information about the program.

Donald Trump won the district in 2024 by 2 percent, though Biden carried it by 4 percent in his 2020 victory.
In order to stand out among so many candidates, O’Rourke said she will emphasize affordability and her personal story.
After graduating from Cornell, O’Rourke worked as a Senior Environmental Advisor for the United States Agency for International Development in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, before joining the Virginia Tech faculty in 2013.
While at Cornell, O’Rourke said she and her family utilized the Women, Infants, and Children program, Medicaid and the Headstart program.","In her own words, Cornell alumna and ecologist Megan O’Rourke, Ph.D. ’09 is running for Congress because she “has a backbone.”

A Blairstown, New Jersey native, O’Rourke is emphasizing her working-class background in an effort to contrast her personal story with other candidates in the race. She’s also made affordability and opposition to Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill a centerpiece of her campaign.

O’Rourke has joined a primary field in New Jersey’s 7th district so crowded with competitors that national Republicans have called it a “clown car.”

The district, expected to be one of the most competitive of the 2026 midterms, is currently held by a Republican, Tom Kean Jr., but votes regularly for both parties. Donald Trump won the district in 2024 by 2 percent, though Biden carried it by 4 percent in his 2020 victory.

Candidates for the Democratic primary include fighter pilot Rebecca Bennett, Biden Small Business Administration official Michael Roth and magazine executive Brian Varela, among others.

In order to stand out among so many candidates, O’Rourke said she will emphasize affordability and her personal story.

“Growing up poor, issues with food security were troubles in our family. We often relied on our church's food pantry,” O’Rourke said. Her family’s struggles, along with her love for nature, compelled O’Rourke to pursue an “intersection of environment and food” in her career.

After graduating from Cornell, O’Rourke worked as a Senior Environmental Advisor for the United States Agency for International Development in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, before joining the Virginia Tech faculty in 2013.

Eventually, she decided to work for the federal government once again, this time as a program leader for climate in the Department of Agriculture, where she managed grants on sustainability that the department awarded to universities.

In July, she resigned from her position in protest of the Trump administration’s decisions to cut many of the same grants she had worked on only a year before. Since then, she has been running for Congress full-time.

O’Rourke said her decision to run this August was in part because she believed “there was some weakness” in the field, and that the candidates already in the race didn’t have the “strength” it took to defeat incumbent congressman Kean.

“People don’t have to doubt whether or not I have sacrificed,” O’Rourke said, referring to her decision to leave the Trump administration. “People don’t have to doubt whether or not I have the backbone.”

O’Rourke has lived in Blairstown, New Jersey, since she was born, moving only for college. She attended SUNY Stony Brook University before getting her master’s at Iowa State University and her doctorate in Agricultural Ecology from Cornell in 2009.

Attending graduate school at Cornell while raising a family made O’Rourke “stand out,” she says, especially on a graduate student’s stipend, which she estimated was around $25k.

While at Cornell, O’Rourke said she and her family utilized the Women, Infants, and Children program, Medicaid and the Headstart program. She also started a community garden in Slaterville Springs, where she lived, to make some extra money.

“It was really hard, but we buckled down, because from a young age — for whatever reason — I wanted to do a Ph.D.,” O’Rourke said.

Though O’Rourke’s platform centers around affordability, during an interview with The Sun, she did not outline any specific priorities or policy proposals to combat the cost-of-living crisis that a majority of New Jersey voters say is their top issue. A review of her campaign website found that O’Rourke does not specify any policies to address affordability.

O’Rourke was also noncommittal on her stances regarding accepting corporate PAC money, whether she would vote for Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, sending aid to Ukraine and Taiwan or a position on the Israel-Gaza war.

“We need to look at the conflicts as they come, because [between] right now and 2026, they are going to be completely different,” O’Rourke said. “I’m not going to be pinned down on every controversial vote, but the principles I will bring to the table are that we need to be proactive, we need to take a multilateral approach.”

However, O’Rourke did emphasize a few issues she would take a side on. She expressed support for a Congressional stock trading ban, the reversal of the 2010 Citizens United decision — that led to the rise of large political action committees’ influence in politics — and maintaining a state-and-local tax deduction.

Turning to her Alma Mater, she gave a message to Cornell students.

“My district, New Jersey’s 7th, may not be your home, but you can still pay attention to it, contribute to it,” O’Rourke said. “Don’t be apathetic in this current political situation. You can make a difference.”

By Michele N. Siekerka, NJBIA President and CEO On Sep 29, 2025

A new state law, which NJBIA helped push to the legislative finish line, is making the largest investment in manufacturing in this state’s history.

Manufacturers are the engine that drives New Jersey’s economy – a $58 billion industry that produces everything from pharmaceuticals and chemicals to food products and the advanced technologies that support supply chains and catalyze innovation.

“Made in NJ Manufacturing Day” on Oct. 3, presented by NJBIA’s partners at the New Jersey Manufacturing Extension Program (NJMEP), will showcase these fantastic companies and their products at the largest gathering of its kind in the state. Hundreds of manufacturers, business leaders, students, and elected officials – including the two candidates running in the Nov. 4 election to be New Jersey’s next governor – will be there.

Look for our manufacturers to have an extra spring in their step about their Jersey-made products because a new state law is now making the largest investment in manufacturing in this state’s history. The “Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program,” which NJBIA was proud to help push across the legislative finish line, provides $500 million in tax incentives to spur investments, create jobs, and position our state as a national manufacturing leader.

The tax credits will attract global investment in a wide range of manufacturing activities, including advanced manufacturing, food and beverage production, life sciences, and clean energy component manufacturing, which includes nuclear, solar, geothermal, and green hydrogen. Amid the economic uncertainty caused by federal tariffs and supply challenges, this economic boost couldn’t have come at a better time for New Jersey.

Beyond incentivizing manufacturing investments, the program will also boost workforce development efforts to fill thousands of new positions from the machine operators and assemblers on the factory floors to the engineers and scientists whose cutting-edge research drives innovation in pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and other advanced materials.

The NJEDA’s website has the details about the program, but here are the basics: tax credits for companies that make, acquire or lease investments of $10 million or more at a New Jersey manufacturing facility and successfully create at least 20 new full-time jobs that pay at least 120% of the median salary of manufacturing workers in that county.

Importantly, funding for the program comes from the New Jersey Economic Development Authority’s existing Aspire and Emerge tax credit programs. No new money is involved.

The Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program is the one bright spot for the industry in a FY26 state budget that unfortunately zeroed out the Manufacturing Voucher Program geared toward smaller manufacturers and cut funding for NJMEP in half. Nevertheless, the new tax credits, coupled with the pro-manufacturing tax changes made on the federal level, make this an exciting opportunity to grow manufacturing businesses in New Jersey.

No, not the fear of water, but lab work centered on better battery science.

Hydrophobicity — when materials naturally repel water — has been one of the obstacles to implementing promising, safe, and low-cost water-based batteries that could be more widely used for grid storage and powering electric vehicles, according to the university's news release.

The key components of these batteries are common and not flammable, making them an attractive alternative to the lithium-ion batteries that use expensive and combustible parts. But how to solve the hydrophobicity issue …

The Tohoku researchers have developed an electrode material that works well with a water-based electrolyte, eliminating the problem. They say their new organic redox polymer could also help enable recycling, another long-standing hurdle for batteries of this type.

""By combining high charge storage capacity with recyclability, we can open new directions for sustainable battery research,"" associate professor Kouki Oka said in the release.

Their solution involved combining some components with the right attributes.

P-dihydroxybenzene is an organic molecule that has high charge storage capacity. Through a condensation reaction, the team ""introduced"" the molecule into a polyamine, ""which is water-soluble due to its positive charge,"" according to the release.

The combo tackles the hydrophobicity issue. It can also be broken back down into its component parts in water. A rendering provided with the release shows a circular process, from battery production through use and recycling.

""This study provides a design strategy for making hydrophobic redox molecules compatible with aqueous systems,"" Oka said.

Experts in Korea, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and elsewhere are also developing innovative water-based batteries.

It's important to note that common lithium-ion packs are generally high-performing, safe, and reliable. Gas-powered cars are more likely to catch fire than EVs powered by the existing battery type, according to reports. Recurrent has also reported that Goldman Sachs said battery prices could fall 50% by next year, compared to 2023 prices, due to cheaper chemistries, better performance, and more recycling.

Through August, global 2025 EV sales grew 25% compared to the prior year, though that 12.5 million total includes plug-in hybrids, according to Ars Technica. Sales are growing more slowly in the United States as federal policy changes have nixed up to $7,500 in tax breaks for the cleaner rides beginning Oct. 1. But certain states are continuing to offer their own perks. And EV owners continue to enjoy about $1,500 a year in gas and maintenance savings.

What's more, less-expensive EV options are on the way. Ford is retiring two popular gas-guzzlers in favor of a $30,000 electric pickup set to debut in the coming years, for example.

Each EV that replaces a gas-powered car prevents thousands of pounds of heat-trapping air pollution, per government data. And the tailpipe exhaust is among the gases linked by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to greater risks for the extreme weather that's compromising human health and safety as well as impacting insurance coverage and pricing.

Continuing to improve and diversify EV batteries and grid storage through water-based innovations should only strengthen the global clean energy transition.

The restrictions only apply to renewable energy projects.
While residents aren't keen on new turbines, Oliver said, they're on board with an improved status quo.
Noel wrote in a recent report that about 11,000 megawatts of renewable energy projects were cancelled in 2024.","In Pincher Creek, Alta., wind is king, roaring down the eastern Rockies, delivering power for generations, so much so the municipal district made a windmill part of its corporate logo.

Not anymore.

District Reeve Rick Lemire said the windmill image, which sits alongside other Alberta icons on the logo — a wild rose, wheat, a pumpjack and cattle will soon be erased.

""It's not us anymore,"" Lemire said in an interview.

There are few places where the wind blows as hard and as often as it does in Pincher Creek, Alta., where clusters of windmills tower over farmland, with mountains in the distance.

But in a few short years, new rules and changing attitudes have delivered a sharp pivot away from wind projects.

The biggest push has come from Premier Danielle Smith's government, which put a short-term moratorium on renewable energy projects in 2023 before introducing new rules on where they can go.

Regulations forbid renewable energy developments within a 35-kilometre buffer zone from the Rocky Mountains, which applies to Pincher Creek, mainly on the grounds of preserving jaw-dropping Prairie viewscapes. The restrictions only apply to renewable energy projects.

Rohit Sandhu, spokesperson for Alberta's department of affordability and utilities, said exemptions are available for wind projects currently in the buffer zone and the Alberta Utilities Commission can approve new projects on a case-by-case basis.

The commission declined to comment on the matter.

The district has more than 255 turbines producing nearly 511 megawatts of energy, says a third-party report commissioned last year by the town and district.

The issue is also about money.

Lemire said stopping renewable development means lost revenue down the line if companies can't repower their wind farms once existing ones reach the end of their life.

About 30 per cent of the district's budget relies on revenues from renewable electricity generation, says analysis by the Pembina Institute think tank, and landowners also collect a percentage of revenue generated by each turbine.

Despite the potential profit lost, Lemire said he believes residents are willing to take the hit.

""We're starting to slide,"" he said of the district's renewable energy revenues. ""We're coming down — we understand that. Administration knows that.""

Lemire said residents soured on wind projects years before the moratorium took effect, because they found new transmission lines connecting turbines to the grid to be unsightly.

But he said if the aging turbines are allowed to be replaced by fewer yet more efficient models, everyone wins.

Wayne Oliver, an intergeneration supervisor at TransAlta Corp. and a town councillor in Pincher Creek, agreed. Repowered wind farms, he said, would also likely have fewer turbines that produce the same amount of electricity and continue to provide revenues to the district.

While residents aren't keen on new turbines, Oliver said, they're on board with an improved status quo.

""The people that live around that Castle River wind farm with 60 turbines, when they hear that six or seven turbines can replace that, they get excited,"" he said.

A spokesperson for TransAlta said it's continuously assessing the future of existing facilities but couldn't comment on specific sites.

Regulations 'popped a bubble'

Oliver, a resident of Pincher Creek for over 30 years, said he finds it remarkable how quickly times have changed in a few years.

""It popped a bubble,"" Oliver said of the renewable moratorium. ""It just shows you the power of government policy to change the direction of society.""

Will Noel, a senior analyst at the Pembina Institute, said what the industry needs is certainty. Noel wrote in a recent report that about 11,000 megawatts of renewable energy projects were cancelled in 2024.

He said modernization and consolidation can work.

""This is a great middle ground,"" Noel said. ""We'll get rid of 40 turbines and put up 10 new ones — that's a quarter of the turbines you have to look at, and you're getting the same kind of power.""

Lemire said while you never say never on once again going big on wind, the district's gusty love affair has likely peaked.

Fortescue is owned by Dr Andrew Forrest, one of Australia’s wealthiest people. He made his fortune through the mining industry. Forrest also advocates for the energy transition and has committed his business to achieving ‘real zero’ in a swipe at net zero targets, which he says include “scams” such as carbon credits or carbon offsetting.

Instead, the business aims to eliminate all of its emissions and help build the technologies needed to reach ‘real zero’ worldwide.

Indeed, solar PV, wind and green hydrogen have all been noted as critical technologies in the business’ real zero strategy.

Solar partnership to power mining operations

LONGi will serve as Fortescue’s strategic technology partner, supplying the latest-generation PV products for the company’s iron ore operations in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.

The partnership focuses on leveraging LONGi’s expertise in lowering the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) to ensure the projects remain competitive.

Under the agreement, LONGi will supply solar PV modules and participate in joint venture projects to develop integrated green energy solutions across multiple markets.

The artificial intelligence boom is reshaping global energy demands in profound ways, with data centers at the epicenter of this transformation. As companies race to deploy advanced AI models, the electricity required to power these operations is skyrocketing. According to a recent report from the International Energy Agency, AI could drive a surge in electricity demand from data centers, potentially doubling or tripling current levels by 2030. This isn’t just a minor uptick; it’s a fundamental shift that challenges existing power infrastructures worldwide.

In the United States alone, projections indicate that data centers could consume up to 8% of the nation’s electricity by the end of the decade, up from about 2.5% today. Industry insiders point to the voracious appetite of AI training and inference processes, which require immense computational power. For instance, training a single large language model can consume as much electricity as thousands of households over several months, highlighting the scale of the issue.

Nuclear and Renewable Energy as Potential Solutions

To meet this burgeoning demand, tech giants are exploring unconventional energy sources. Small modular nuclear reactors are gaining traction as a reliable, low-carbon option, with companies like Microsoft partnering with nuclear firms to revive plants and secure dedicated power supplies. A commentary from the IEA notes that while renewables like solar and wind offer promise, their intermittency poses challenges for the always-on needs of data centers.

Grid constraints are exacerbating the problem, particularly in high-demand regions like Northern Virginia, home to a cluster of data centers. Utilities are struggling to keep pace, leading to delays in new connections and rising costs. Posts on X from industry figures, such as investors highlighting AI’s power bottlenecks, underscore a growing consensus that energy scarcity could become the next big hurdle after chip shortages.

Global Implications and Economic Pressures

Internationally, the energy crunch is even more acute. In China, rapid data center expansion is outpacing power generation, prompting massive investments in new capacity. Meanwhile, in Europe, stringent environmental regulations are clashing with AI ambitions, forcing a reevaluation of energy policies. The Dallas News recently detailed how data centers’ insatiable power needs might lead to shortages, with experts warning that there simply may not be enough electricity to go around without significant infrastructure upgrades.

Economic ramifications are already evident. Electricity prices in key U.S. markets have risen by over 30% in the past three years, driven partly by AI-related demand. Bloomberg’s analysis in a recent article suggests creating a market for compute resources, akin to oil futures, to better allocate energy and spur investment.

Innovative Strategies and Future Outlook

Forward-thinking solutions are emerging, including on-site power generation and advanced cooling technologies to reduce consumption. For example, some firms are turning to geothermal and hydroelectric sources for sustainable alternatives, as outlined in reports from RCR Wireless News. Yet, challenges persist, with heatwaves and AI growth pushing global gas demand higher, according to the World Economic Forum.

Looking ahead, the integration of AI into energy management itself could provide relief. Smart grids powered by AI algorithms might optimize distribution and predict demand spikes, transforming the sector. However, without coordinated policy efforts and massive capital inflows—estimated at trillions of dollars—the AI revolution risks stalling amid energy constraints. Industry leaders must navigate this delicate balance to ensure technological progress doesn’t come at the expense of reliable power supplies.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-f4cf9881-0604-416c-9ec1-968ab184d4c2.jpeg,N,,2025-09-28 23:58:45.476449

The EPA is doing everything it can to revitalize the coal sector in the United States

During his first term, Donald Trump stated that he would “drill baby, drill”. At the time, what he meant by that was a mystery. However, once he began his second term, the meaning behind that statement became clearer. Trump wants to revitalize the coal sector, particularly in the United States. His administration, led by his EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, has now stated that they will roll back the coal-ash rules implemented by the Obama administration.

In 2015, the Obama administration finalized long-sought federal rules for disposing of coal ash, which is a byproduct of incineration at coal-fired power plants. That rule aimed to prevent contamination of groundwater and surface water by establishing technical guidelines for power plants’ coal ash disposal. During his first term, the Trump administration did little to enforce those rules, and now plans to remove the regulatory barriers that the rule imposes.

Utility companies were ordered to report coal ash contamination in groundwater to the EPA by February 2026. As well as install groundwater monitoring systems by May 2028. They were also required to begin drafting remediation plans if contamination was found.

The EPA has shifted its stance to allow for more state involvement

On July 19, the Trump-led EPA announced it would extend the deadline for utility companies to address the rules by at least one more year. The EPA stated that it aims to put more power in the different states’ hands, as opposed to keeping the rules tightly wound up by the federal government. Which has not gone down well with environmentalists.

“Trump tried and failed to bail out the coal industry during his first term in office. Given the realities of the market, whatever he tries to do this time should fail as well.… Instead of trying to prop up the fuels of the last century, this administration should be working to build the grid needed for the 21st century.” – Christy Walsh, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council

A court has intervened in the Duke coal-ash cleanup, which only strengthens the stance being championed by the current administration. The EPA released a statement on the matter.

“Due to the receipt of adverse comment, the EPA is withdrawing the direct final rule titled “Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals From Electric Utilities; CCR Management Unit Deadline Extension Rule,” which published on July 22, 2025 (90 FR 34358).” – United States Environmental Protection Agency

Today, energy policy is investment policy, and Indonesia risks being left behind.

Clean energy is no longer just about meeting climate targets. For many companies, it has become a make-or-break factor when deciding where to expand, build and invest.

Companies in sectors like manufacturing, textiles, food processing and technology have set ambitious decarbonization goals, many targeting net-zero emissions before 2050. To meet their goals, they need to power their operations with clean energy. In practice, that means locating in countries where renewable power is available, affordable and accessible through the central grid or via clear purchasing pathways.

Indonesia has taken important steps to expand its renewable energy supply, with 76 percent of new capacity additions within the Rencana Usaha Penyediaan Tenaga Listrik 2025 (RUPTL 2025), or Indonesia’s Electricity Supply Business Plan, coming from renewables.

Nonetheless, corporate buyers are seeking a more diversified menu of procurement options. Unbundled Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are currently the most viable option for corporate procurement in Indonesia. But while useful, RECs do not support the large-scale, long-term investments businesses are planning. Companies are looking for structural solutions to source renewables locally, such as Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPAs) and the joint utilization of transmission and distribution networks, known globally as power wheeling.

A recent paper by Climate Group’s RE100 campaign, Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR) and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) explained how shared use of Indonesia’s transmission and distribution network would allow different stakeholders to deliver electricity from generation sources to load centers. These mechanisms would allow companies to contract clean electricity directly and at scale from renewables-rich areas to business hubs, through state electricity company PLN’s grid.

Other countries in the region are already moving faster – with both Vietnam and Malaysia introducing schemes that allow third parties to supply or buy electricity through the existing grid network. Thailand has enabled eligible customers to purchase both energy and RECs from large renewable energy projects by rolling out the second phase of its Utility Green Tariff (UGT2). These policies give companies flexible and transparent pathways to scale their clean energy use, and they are attracting investment.

Indonesia risks falling behind. While Vietnam sourced over 14 percent of its electricity from solar in 2023, Indonesia’s share of solar and wind remains below 3 percent. An estimated Rp 278 trillion (US$16.64) in annual investment is needed if its targets for added renewable capacity are to be met.

The priority therefore is delivering on this plan. With the country’s sovereign wealth fund Danantara launched earlier this year, Indonesia has a timely opportunity to turn capital, policy alignment and partnerships into renewable energy projects. Fossil fuels still account for a significant share of Indonesia’s capacity, and policymakers have sent mixed signals on coal drawdown. While recent geothermal announcements are promising, Indonesia will need a decisive push to match its renewable commitments with bankable projects that draw the investment that is required.

Other Indonesian business leaders share this sense of urgency. Some 88 percent said they want most of the country’s energy supply sourced from renewables within the next ten years. A majority said they would consider relocating operations and contracting supply chains to other countries if Indonesia cannot deliver adequate renewable supplies.

This should set off alarm bells. Sectors like textiles and light manufacturing are already major employers in Indonesia, and many of these companies are under pressure from their customers to clean up supply chains. Global tech firms looking to build data centers are clear in their message: renewable energy access is a key part of site selection.

There is an economic prize waiting for those moving faster on renewable energy. Research shows that meeting clean energy targets will create jobs, boost wages and improve resilience to global fuel price shocks, as shown in ACEC’s May 2025 publication Asia’s Clean Energy Breakthrough. Renewables also reduce dependence on volatile fossil fuel markets, providing more stable pricing for both industry and consumers.

All of this is especially relevant for Indonesia, which has set a target of eight percent annual gross domestic product growth by 2029. Unlocking clean energy investment can be a key enabler of that growth as it’ll attract capital, lower energy costs, improve energy security and fulfill a government promise to create 19 million jobs.

Indonesia still has time to lead the charge on the regional energy transition, but the window is closing. If the country can move quickly, it will be well positioned to compete with its neighbors on energy, and in every sector of the economy that depends on it.

The companies are ready. The demand is real. It is now time for policy to catch up.

Gonzales resident Connie Thompson, who grew up in Gentilly, said she had always been curious about the seawall’s history. Thompson asked about the seawall’s construction and history, along with the scope of the wall: “I always wonder why the seawall was built around Lake Pontchartrain only on the New Orleans side? The year it was built? Was it to put people to work?”

The northshore has a similar, although smaller, seawall. The Mandeville concrete seawall was built in the 1930s as a Works Progress Administration project. The story of the New Orleans seawall is a bit of a deeper dive.

Kristi Trail, executive director of Pontchartrain Conservancy, reached back into the early days of European settlers and south Louisiana’s alluvial flood plain to begin to describe the seawall’s importance.

A growing city looks outward

After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the city began expanding, looking for ways to grow outward, Trail said. Back then, what is now the Lakeview, Gentilly and City Park neighborhoods were all swamps. By the late 1800s, the Lakefront was in constant use for commerce and recreation. Fishing camps were set up with elevated walkways and structures, but had to maneuver around Lake Pontchartrain’s tidal pattern. The Port Pontchartrain lighthouse, which still stands today, was floating out on the water, unconnected to land, Trail said.

Mechanical engineer Albert Baldwin Wood, whose impact on New Orleans drainage cannot be overstated, opened up new possibilities with his screw pump invention, patent filed in 1913. The screw pump could pump massive amounts of water, allowing for quick drainage of swampland — although this mass draining would eventually cause subsidence issues.

In the 1920s, the Orleans Levee Board began a huge project of reclaiming land from the lake. The lakefront development used clam shells from the lake to mix with sediment dredged from the lake bottom for this new land. In 1930, the Orleans Levee Board started what would be about a 21/2-year project to build an 8-foot-high concrete seawall, according to the Lakefront Management Authority. The seawall was set into place to halt shoreline erosion and offer flood protection for the newly created area.

“The mud they are pumping in from the lake to fill in all that area, from Allen Toussaint to the seawall, it’s just mud, and it’s so soft to build on,” Trail said. “So this is when the clamshell dredging began in the lake.”

Those clams were taken out of the lake to mix in with those soft soils in the neighborhoods, Trail said. “Those neighborhoods are all built on reclaimed land, as a result of the sea wall going in, which allowed those neighborhoods to be built,” she said.

Dredging lake environment

The project indirectly led to Trail’s current job — large-scale clam dredging led to massive environmental lake degradation. In the wake of this degradation, environmental advocacy groups popped up to defend the lake, one of which became the Pontchartrain Conservancy.

Since clamshell dredging was banned in 1990, the lake has started to bounce back. As for the Lake Pontchartrain Seawall, it remains in place, battered but still gamely holding up against the waves of the lake.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","HARRISBURG, Pa., Sept. 28, 2025 (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy"" and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone (a financial company separate from from BlackRock) has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”

Buyers procrastinating the purchase of an electric vehicle are running our of time.

The deadline for a federal tax credit expires on Tuesday.

“As part of the mega-tax bill signed into law in July, the expiration date of the federal clean vehicle tax credit was pushed up to Sept. 30 from its original expiration date of 2032,” according to the Detroit Free Press. “That means the deadline for snagging a tax credit of up to $7,500 on a qualifying new EV, and up to $4,000 on a used EV, is closing in.”

Cars.com released data on Sept. 18 showing that nearly half of consumers considering buying an EV are now accelerating their purchases.

“EV sales just hit a new record in the U.S.: This month, they’re on track to make up 12.2% of new car sales, according to J.D. Power and Associates,” reports Fast Company. “Meanwhile, gas car sales dropped compared to the same month last year.”

The electric vehicle tax credit was created by President George W. Bush, who initiated a tax credit program for fuel-efficient vehicles in 2005 and expanded it in 2008 to include plug-in vehicles with the goals of reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil and lowering emissions.

As of late, the incentives have created some anxiety for dealers, who report that the IRS has been slow to pay for the tax credits since mid-September.

“The delays began in earnest in mid-September, according to accounts shared with CNBC from three dealers in different parts of the country,” according to CNBC. “Auto analysts and two national trade associations also confirmed to CNBC dealership reports of delays. The dealerships say it forces them into a tough choice: carry the cost to keep offering the credit, or pull back and risk losing vehicle sales.”

Some analysts expect EV sales to fall off significantly for the rest of the year.

“Karl Brauer, executive analyst with iSeeCars.com, said once the federal tax credit ends, EV sales are ‘going to crater. It’s going to be quite the whipsaw effect. You’ve got the rush to the dealership to take advantage of these incentives now ... but what’s going to happen in the next three to six months? There’ll be almost no buyers.’” according to the Detroit Free Press.

Brauer said EVs comprise about 8% of the total U.S. new vehicle market share, he expects that to drop to 1% to 3% by year's end and settle in at 4% of total market share by early next year.

But not all analysts agree.

“In a recent survey with Morning Consult, analysts at Cox Automotive found that 65% of respondents who were in the market for a new EV said they would still consider an EV without the tax credit,” according to Fast Company. “Even though the end of the incentive has spurred sales, the tax credit generally hasn’t been the deciding factor for most buyers, says Loren McDonald, who runs an EV data and analysis firm called Chargeonomics.”",https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/dam/cropped/2025/09/28/ev-charger_ipDJ3BJ.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 19:00:35.414802

A shared comprehensive understanding of the landscape needs to be integrated into the green economy transition.","India stands at a crossroads requiring a leap beyond traditional growth models to adopt a greener, more resilient economic future. India’s bioeconomy grew dramatically from $10 billion in 2014 to $165.7 billion in 2024, expanding 16 times over the 10 years and accounting for 4.25% of the country’s GDP. This growth has been bolstered by over 10,000 bio-economy start-ups.

The industrial bioeconomy — comprising biofuels and bioplastics — accounts for the largest share at approximately 47%, followed by pharmaceuticals at 35%, with emerging areas such as research and IT (including clinical trials and bioinformatics) also expanding rapidly. India has also achieved major milestones, with the government ensuring 20% ethanol blending in petrol and the country being the world’s third-largest pharmaceutical producer by volume.

According to the India Bioeconomy Report, the bioeconomy is expected to create 35 million jobs by 2030. The growth in consumer spending in rural India is surpassing that of urban areas, with 9.2% rural per capita spending growth vs 8.3% urban (August 2023 to July 2024), suggesting improving rural purchasing capacity and evolving consumption patterns. Hence, the green economy is no longer distant, utopian, or abstract, but inevitable, imminent, and an undercurrent under way. Given India’s climate vulnerabilities and global market shifts — such as carbon border taxes and rising demand for sustainable goods — the transition is a necessity for sustained jobs, environmental returns, competitiveness, and social wellbeing. As it expands, there is a need for recognition that rural communities vulnerable due to poverty and climate risks are no longer just beneficiaries but climate frontline leaders.

Disruptions and disparity

India’s green economy is under pressure from international economic headwinds, but remains a priority for energy security, job creation, and long-term competitiveness. Although the global economy is expected to slow down at 2.5%, India’s GDP is expected to grow at 5.9%. Climate disruptions also directly impact inflation, further worsening the rural bioeconomy context, especially pressures from losses in agriculture, fluctuations in energy demand, and disrupted supply chains. There is a huge hidden disparity that also needs attention. The BioE3 policy was rolled out in 2024 to promote the bioeconomy, but regulatory frameworks remain fragmented, and it remains a very urban-centric, industrial-scale economy.

Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Gujarat, and Andhra Pradesh contribute more than two-thirds of the total bioeconomy value, while the eastern and northeastern regions together account for less than 6%. Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, which are rich in agriculture, forest biomass, mineral-rich and non-timber forest products, have a huge potential for tribal-led bioeconomy models. In Uttar Pradesh, which is the largest sugarcane producer, opportunities in ethanol, biofuels, and biomass power are emerging in the State. Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, and West Bengal have had a low industrial bioeconomy footprint probably due to discouraged investment by the Freight Equalisation Policy, but they are abundant in agri-waste and forest produce, which needs to be tapped.

Despite a projected addition of 35 million green jobs by 2047, women held only 11% of jobs in India’s rooftop solar sector, even as renewable capacity surged 250% between 2015 and 2021. Women’s representation in key roles remains particularly low: 1% in operations and maintenance, and 3% in construction and commissioning. There is a green economic rural-urban divide where the urban areas attract green investments, EV infrastructure, solar rooftops, and green jobs, whereas the rural regions lack access to clean energy, water-saving irrigation, and sustainable livelihoods, with slower, inequitable technology adoption. A huge digital divide furthers the disparity as tech-driven solutions such as smart grids and measurement, reporting, and verification for carbon markets are not inclusive of landscapes and communities with low digital access. Even in the waste management sector, urban areas account for nearly 75% of the country’s total solid waste, due to higher consumption, packaging, and commercial activity, whereas rural waste is now consuming more, seeing penetration of plastics, e-waste, and so on, along with biowaste, but is unsegregated and often burnt or dumped. With 500 million tonnes of crop residues, 3,500-plus medicinal plant species, largely sourced from forest-fringe rural areas, 7,50,000-plus rural haats and agri-mandis, MGNREGA-supported green infrastructure, the rural is still under-represented in the bioeconomy boom.

Green economy trade-offs

As India strives to balance economic growth, social equity and environmental returns, there are many green economy trade-offs. One of the biggest trade-offs is promoting renewable energy, but also subsidising fossil fuels to up to potentially 40%. Also, while promoting renewable energy solutions such as solar pumps, do we check the promotion of groundwater extraction? Massive industrial expansion in hard-to-decarbonise sectors such as steel, cement, power, and utilities — which together account for 23.2% of India’s GHG emissions —puts significant pressure on the upfront investment in green technologies, with unit costs exceeding those of traditional options by more than four times(10). As much as 85% of global clean energy investment flows to advanced economies, while India and other developing markets receive only 15%.

A rapid green shift — if not carefully managed — can disproportionately affect rural areas, vulnerable groups such as coal sector workers, MSMEs, and small-scale manufacturers reliant on traditional energy. With agriculture supporting 58% of rural livelihoods, seasonal as well as climate variations often impact income stability and over-dependence on public system or markets.

A woman from Belkhedi, Madhya Pradesh, painfully shares how markets do offer economic opportunities, especially during festivals such as Holi, but exploit or even at times disturb local resources by introducing synthetic materials into their ecosystem. A just transition demands targeted skill-building for workforce readiness, reskilling programs, and local bioeconomic diversification to avoid adverse social and environmental impacts.

Road transport dominates the nation’s freight and passenger movement, and food miles now account for nearly 3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent annually, which is a trade-off between emissions and food security. For instance, Bijapur and Sukma in Chhattisgarh still get food transported from more than 400 km away and have one of the highest percentages of malnourished children under five years of age.

Biodiversity underpins India’s economic sectors such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism, directly supporting over 200 million livelihoods and contributing resources worth billions annually. There are competing agendas of crop diversification versus an ecosystem of policy and market incentives, almost like working for the promotion of monocropping, especially for wheat and paddy. India’s aggressive push for ethanol blending has brought the maize trade-off between ethanol and animal feed. There is a need to adopt a deep dive into sector-wise localised approach that takes into consideration the cross-overs of benefits as well as losses between different strategies, conflicting policies, multi-stakeholder collaboration, and a focus on both local realities and global opportunities.

Landscape approach to green economy

What is required is a commitment to a growth model that puts sustainability, climate action, and social inclusion at the heart of development, with measures to address these regional disparities, integration in less-developed, high-potential states, and the need for the creation of robust green economy ecosystems. To navigate through these trade-offs, disruptions, disparities and the pressure on achieving green growth, an assessment of landscapes is crucial. Landscapes are to be viewed as an integrated, interconnected and interactive system of many parameters such as landforms, land cover, water resources, flora-fauna, energy systems, local markets, local institutions and communities together. A shared comprehensive understanding of the landscape needs to be integrated into the green economy transition. This method allows us to assess and improve ecological functions — such as air and water quality, habitat support, and climate regulation— while also boosting human benefits such as health, food and water security, recreation, and livelihoods. These efforts help us stay within the ecological ceiling, ensuring landscapes can continue to regenerate. A defining feature could be the shift to truly participatory pathways of landscape assessment right from nano (village level) to macro (landscape level).

First, leveraging the 2.5 lakh Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), 12 million women-led institutions, and 0 million local authorities at every stage, from design to monitoring of this transition. Promotion of circularity, green energy and bioeconomy, with gender mainstreaming through targeted policies for leadership and technical roles for women, inclusive governance, stakeholder collaboration, and investments in green infrastructure and nature-based solutions generate multiple returns over time.

For instance, a woman from Kulgaon village in Chhattisgarh aspires to start an enterprise of cold-pressed oil extraction from Tori seeds for supplying to her village for better health, better availability of raw materials, promoting local production and local consumption. A supportive ecosystem for such aspirations can be co-created with shift in the metrics from not just decreased poverty and job creation, but also to improved social and environmental returns. Landscape-driven planning, ownership and clarity, integrating ecosystem valuation into policy and economic strategies, will help in setting the right direction and course. Many low-hanging fruits can be targeted with pivots such as green budgeting, clearer enforcement roles, targeted fiscal incentives, green government procurement, deeper involvement of gram panchayats, local authorities and CBOs, prioritising skills, gender inclusion, and local capacity building in greening all sectors.

Addressing the bottlenecks, such as improved waste management at all levels with SOPs for enforcement, financing cum O&M ecosystem for decentralised renewables, policy coordination between departments for responding to aspirations of communities, and greening the R&D spend, will also ensure a push for many sectors with bio-economy potential. With such models, India can not only achieve its climate and sustainable development goals but also unlock new engines of growth, resilience, and wellbeing for its landscapes and all its citizens.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/9uahbn/article70106598.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_Govt-tightens-n_G1LE_2_1_64EN9606.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 17:59:46.852102

The criticism followed a recent study that gave the local utility a ""C"" grade, which is a major jump from the company's 2021 ""F"" score.

The Sierra Club, America's largest grassroots environmental organization, released on Monday, September 22, its annual Dirty Truth report, which evaluates and scores utilities for their plans to transition to clean energy. The Dirty Truth report focuses on three metrics to gauge impacts on affordability and public health due to fossil fuel pollution: Utility efforts to retire coal plants by 2030; not build new gas plants through 2035; and build clean energy to replace fossil generation and serve new load by 2035.

CPS Energy's ranking

According to the report, CPS Energy scored a ""C"" due to the company making some investments in additional solar and battery storage and its closure of one coal unit. However, the Sierra Club noted the company is doubling down on gas as part of its current and future portfolio. Over the years, the Dirty Truth has given CPS Energy the following grades: ""C"" in 2025, 2024 and 2023; ""D"" in 2022 and ""F"" in 2021.

Public Citizen, an American non-profit, progressive consumer rights advocacy group, reviewed the Dirty Truth report and demanded that CPS Energy ""make better plans and additional investments in clean energy rather than continuing its reliance on fossil fuels to meet increasing customer demand.""

""CPS Energy should prioritize its customers' pocketbooks at a time when so many San Antonians are enduring an affordability crisis,"" DeeDee Belmares, who is based in San Antonio as a clean energy advocate for the Texas office of Public Citizen, stated in a release. ""Embracing wind, solar and battery storage can offer the savings and reliability residents need. The old way of doing things - burning gas and coal - delivers higher costs and dirty air.""

Belmares commended CPS Energy for approving a plan in 2023 to phase out and shut down a coal plant by 2028. But, Belmares added, the company took a step backward after it acquired four power plant facilities in Southeast Texas. CPS Energy acquired Missouri-based PROENERGY natural gas plants in Harris, Brazoria and Galveston counties.

All four facilities are in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas network. Together, the plants provide an electric capacity of approximately 1,632 megawatts, which can power approximately 325,000 to 408,000 average homes per year, depending on the time of day and energy use.

CPS Energy responds to the report

CPS Energy told MySA the company remains ""committed to delivering reliable, affordable energy that keeps pace with San Antonio's growth, while investing in resources that reduce emissions and strengthen long-term sustainability.""

""As we phase out coal, we continue to expand wind and solar resources and add more energy storage to our portfolio,"" CPS Energy stated. ""Natural gas remains an essential part of our generation mix as it is cost-effective, produces fewer carbon emissions than coal, and helps us transition away from older and less efficient units while maintaining reliability and affordability for our customers. Our upcoming generation plan refresh will take into account how our community can continue to benefit from a diverse and sustainable energy portfolio.""

Texas utilities deliver mixed results

Other Texas utilities were scored in the Dirt Truth report. The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) got another ""F,"" the lowest score of all utilities in Texas. LCRA has received an ""F"" score for years due to the company keeping the Fayette coal plant open east of Austin, near La Grange, and planning for zero investment in affordable renewables, according to the Sierra Club. LCRA sells its power wholesale to 29 cities and four rural electric cooperatives across Texas.

Xcel Texas has maintained its ""B"" grade, largely due to ""forward-looking plans to retire the expensive, dirty, and water-guzzling Tolk coal plant in the Panhandle as the Ogallala Aquifer continues to dwindle,"" the Sierra Club stated.

Starting Sept. 30, drivers of electric and alternative fuel vehicles will no longer be allowed to drive alone in HOV lanes or drive toll-free in the express lanes on Interstate 85 in Gwinnett County.

The exemption for these vehicles expires at 11:59 p.m. Sept. 29, meaning these drivers must pay tolls in the express lanes unless they have two or more people in the car.

“You pay extra for the EV decal on the vehicle, so you kind of want some sort of benefit to it,” Seyat Nuriyeva, a Tesla driver affected by the change, said.

“Now that they’re taking it away, it’s kind of like, well, what’s the point in paying extra for the plate now?” she said.

These express lanes on I-85 through Gwinnett County were once HOV lanes. However, since becoming toll lanes, the state allowed drivers of electric and alternative fuel cars to use them free of charge.

The state tollway authority reports that nearly 40,000 trips are made daily on I-85’s express lanes, and nearly 17,000 on the express lane extension, with roughly 20% of those trips being toll-exempt.

The change is likely to put more electric and alternative fuel vehicles in the main travel lanes, potentially causing greater congestion.

Startup NatPower reported that it is investing more than $1.1 billion into a giant 32-acre battery energy storage facility near Middlesbrough that will store renewable energy for later use, allowing more clean power to supplement the grid.

The Teesside Gigapark will be located at the energy and utility service Sembcorp Utilities' site. It will be the largest and longest-duration storage facility of its kind once completed in 2028, Interesting Engineering and NatPower reported.

""The Teesside Gigapark is more than a storage project. It combines large-scale batteries with industrial electrification … setting a new standard for the U.K. energy sector,"" IE's Sujita Sinha wrote.

NatPower touts the privately funded project as a money-saving grid support that could conserve $4.1 billion in efficiencies annually by saving typically wasted renewable energy. It will use lithium-ion batteries that can store electricity for four hours, per IE.

Holding the cleaner power is crucial for using it during peak demand times, such as early evening hours when the sun goes down, but power use remains high. NatPower plans for the Teesside facility to eventually be able to provide electricity over an impressive eight hours, IE's report added.

Battery storage is being developed in the United States, too. In Texas, Tesla Megapacks are key grid contributors. A nearly 5,000-acre solar panel/battery storage facility is operational near Las Vegas.

It's a concept that can be realized at home, as well. Rooftop solar panels combined with batteries can generate and store free solar energy that can reduce or eliminate your utility bill. EnergySage is a free resource that can help you secure tax incentives while they last, compare quotes, and find a timely professional installer. It's advice that can save you up to $10,000 if you buy the panels before rebates expire at the end of the year due to federal policy changes.

The cleaner energy, at homes and at larger facilities, also limits planet-warming pollution produced when dirty fuels are burned to generate power. Air pollution impacts nearly everyone on the planet, according to the World Health Organization. And Earth's overheating is even hurting academic performance, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

At Teesside, NatPower officials have some interesting plans for the battery project. Around 200 construction jobs will be created. Looking forward, officials intend to work with colleges and environmental groups on training programs for future clean-energy jobs. A focus of the project will be powering ships at a nearby port, allowing the vessels to turn off dirty diesel engines, all according to IE.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tYpVk4nl0kLnJ9EZ_XvLvg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02ODM7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/b2819a6d614aa2d36f8e4b9e95dc7438,N,,2025-09-28 17:59:52.180475

Leaders discussed how renewable energy and electrification will serve as the foundation for prosperity, productivity, and competitiveness in the years ahead.
For households and communities, the shift to renewable energy will mean lower electricity bills, greater energy independence, and new job opportunities.","A diverse group of government leaders, private sector executives, financiers, and civil society representatives came together in New York for the High-Level Session on Renewable Energy Abundance, one of the flagship events of Climate Week NYC and the official opening of the Global Renewables Summit. The session was held at a pivotal moment in the global energy transition, just days ahead of the UN Climate Summit, where countries are expected to present their updated national climate action plans (NDCs).

The gathering highlighted the collective commitment of governments and industry to accelerate the development of zero-emissions infrastructure, which will reshape economies and societies worldwide. Participants stressed that renewable energy technologies are no longer a distant vision but are already reducing costs for businesses and communities while creating opportunities for innovation, competitiveness, and long-term resilience.

Key leaders who addressed the event included Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission; William Ruto, President of Kenya; Philip Davis, Prime Minister of the Bahamas; Chris Bowen, Australia’s Minister for Climate Change and Energy; Andrew Forrest, Founder and Executive Chairman of Fortescue; Bruce Douglas, CEO and Founder of the Global Renewables Alliance; and Mike Rann, Chair of the Board of Climate Group.

Ursula von der Leyen noted that 2024 saw nearly two trillion dollars invested in clean energy, with spending on renewables now outpacing fossil fuels by a factor of two to one. She underlined that while the economic case for renewables is strong, momentum alone is insufficient, and decisive action is required. She called on governments to create enabling regulatory environments and on businesses and investors to commit their capital, innovation, and technology to areas where the impact would be greatest. According to her, renewable energy is not only about climate mitigation but also about energy security and economic prosperity.

Prime Minister Philip Davis of the Bahamas emphasised the need to frame renewable energy as a driver of prosperity rather than sacrifice. He argued that the narrative around clean energy should highlight opportunities, not constraints, and stressed that every solar panel installed, every regulation reformed, and every upgraded grid contributes to a more abundant and secure energy future. He urged global leaders to focus on progress over perfection, noting that collaboration strengthens the chances of success.

The session also explored how the global economy is shifting from an era of energy scarcity to one defined by abundance. Leaders discussed how renewable energy and electrification will serve as the foundation for prosperity, productivity, and competitiveness in the years ahead. They agreed that a clean energy system can simultaneously deliver affordability, security, and sustainability, creating widespread economic and social benefits.

Francesco La Camera, Director-General of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), noted that investments in renewables have grown steadily by 14 percent annually since 2018 despite global challenges such as pandemics and inflation. However, he pointed out that emerging markets and developing economies still receive less than 10 percent of energy transition financing, despite accounting for a third of global GDP. He urged global leaders to place equity and inclusivity at the core of the transition as the world moves toward the target of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030, as agreed under the UAE Consensus.

Bruce Douglas, CEO of the Global Renewables Alliance, reinforced that phasing out fossil fuels while building renewable energy abundance is the only path to long-term prosperity, stability, and security. He urged immediate collective action to accelerate this transformation. Similarly, Ambassador André Corrêa do Lago, President-Designate of COP30, highlighted the growing integration of renewables with broader agendas such as energy justice, independence, and affordability, stressing how simpler technologies and scalable infrastructure can drive economic growth.

For households and communities, the shift to renewable energy will mean lower electricity bills, greater energy independence, and new job opportunities. For industries, it offers a platform to power innovation in areas such as advanced manufacturing and artificial intelligence, supported by abundant clean energy resources. The High-Level Session, jointly organised by Climate Group, Fortescue, and the Global Renewables Alliance, reinforced the message that renewable energy abundance is not just an environmental goal but a central driver of economic transformation and global prosperity.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GRS-high-level-opening-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 22:58:27.368912

The Department of Energy still has an Office of Fusion Energy Science, but the Chinese equivalent is out-spending it at a ratio of 2:1.
The Chinese government has made fusion power a national priority and last month launched the state-owned China Fusion Energy Co (CFEC) with $US2.1 billion in capital.
So he's hardly likely to back fusion energy to replace coal and oil and help stop global warming.
If China beats the US to fusion energy, its supremacy will be assured.","Late last week, US President Donald Trump used separate social media posts to announce several new tariffs, described later as the ""bonfire of the bathroom vanities.""

That's because there's a new 50 per cent tariff on imports of kitchen and bathroom cabinets, plus 100 per cent on pharmaceuticals, 30 per cent on upholstered furniture, and 25 per cent on heavy trucks.

In truth, it's the bonfire of the 80-year-old global trading and financial system and America's leadership of it, along with global economics, technology and science.

A monumental deal

On the same day as Trump took aim at America's foot with those new tariffs, something else happened that was potentially much more momentous for global geopolitics: the Italian energy giant, Eni, agreed to buy $1 billion worth of electricity generated from nuclear fusion by the US company Commonwealth Fusions Systems (CFS).

Eni — not an American power company — will take electricity from the Commonwealth's Virginia-based ""Arc"" facility, which is due to start construction in 2027 or 2028 and deliver grid electricity in the early 2030s.

This is the first commercial fusion-power deal and marks the beginning of what will be the next great energy transition.

Fusion happens when two atomic nuclei, usually the hydrogen isotope deuterium, join together and form a heavier element, releasing a lot more energy than the current form of nuclear power, fission, which involves breaking atoms apart.

Like fission power generation, fusion is free of greenhouse gas emissions, but unlike fission, it's completely safe, creates little waste, and the fuel is much more plentiful than uranium.

Deuterium is found in water, and there is enough of it in the world's oceans to power the world for millions of years.

And fusion energy looks to be another way in which America is yielding global supremacy to China.

Loading

CFS was spun out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Plasma Science and Fusion Center in 2018, which was set up in 1976 with funding from the US Department of Energy.

It's been a 50-year scientific journey so far. By comparison, it took 16 years to get from the discovery of nuclear fission to the first nuclear power plant (in the USSR). Fusion is much harder to do than fission.

Trump's 2026 budget slashes funding for science and universities, and while no specific cutbacks have been announced for MIT's fusion and plasma research, it is clearly at risk, along with all basic scientific research in the US.

The Department of Energy still has an Office of Fusion Energy Science, but the Chinese equivalent is out-spending it at a ratio of 2:1.

The Chinese government has made fusion power a national priority and last month launched the state-owned China Fusion Energy Co (CFEC) with $US2.1 billion in capital.

There is now a race between China's CFEC and America's CFS to generate fusion electricity, and both are talking about 2027 as the year they enter the final lap. But with the Trump administration cutting back science funding and China increasing it, you'd be brave to back America in this race.

Meanwhile, in a speech to the United Nations earlier last week, Trump doubled down on his opposition to renewable energy, calling climate change the ""greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion"", and added that he had signed executive orders to hunt for oil because ""we have the most of any nation in the world"".

""And if you add coal, we have the most of any nation in the world,"" he said.

""I call it clean, beautiful coal.""

So he's hardly likely to back fusion energy to replace coal and oil and help stop global warming.

Elsewhere in that speech, he said that everyone thought Russia would win the war in Ukraine in three days, ""but it didn't work out that way"".

That's true, and one reason for that is drones, which have now become the key weapon of war and evened up the battlefield between the bullied and the bully.

From ANZUS to AUKUS

In World War I, coal-powered trains were the key to military success, getting troops and supplies to the front. In World War II, it was oil-powered tanks and planes. Now it's cheap, electric battery-powered drones.

In June, the French Institute for International Relations published a paper that said: ""… the Russian invasion of Ukraine has become the theatre of a massive drone-driven transformation of military operations. This phenomenon is unprecedented, both in quantitative terms — with several million drones now produced and destroyed each year —and in its influence on the dynamics of operations and the structure of forces.""

American supremacy in the second half of the 20th century rested on having built global leadership in three things that it did while World War II was still going: harnessing nuclear fission with the Manhattan Project in 1942, making an alliance and oil deal with Saudi Arabia in 1943, and hosting the Bretton Woods conference in New Hampshire in 1944 that established the post-war financial system with the US dollar and free trade at its centre.

So, when Australian prime minister Sir Robert Menzies retired in 1966, he said, justifiably: ""If I were asked which was the best single step that had been taken in the time of my government, I think I would say the ANZUS Treaty.""

But now ANZUS, signed in 1951 and entrenched and expanded by AUKUS in 2021 (if the Americans don't bail), is the proverbial old generals fighting the last war — the submarines it is supposed to provide will be useless against drones, including underwater ones.

More broadly, for the next few years at least, the US is an autocracy that is unreliable and unfocused, in what might be called the set-up phase.

At least Trump's authoritarianism is out in the open; China's is cloaked in fine-sounding rhetoric, but it is mature and very focused.

China's weak climate target

Chinese President Xi Jinping also addressed the UN last week, saying: ""This year marks the 80th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War and the founding of the United Nations. Eighty years later, while the historical trends of peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit remain unchanged, the Cold War mentality, hegemonism and protectionism continue to haunt the world.""

He announced China's emissions reduction targets for 2035, contrasting his approach with Trump by talking about how China is at the forefront of the energy transition, that it would increase solar, wind and hydropower to run more than 30 per cent of its power system over the next decade and said in China, ""new energy vehicles are the mainstream in the sales of new vehicles"".

But then he came out with about the world's weakest 2035 target (apart from America's non-existent one, of course): 7 to 10 per cent down from the peak, whatever that was.

Experts were baffled and unhappy, but I suspect it's simply because China is more focused on electrifying its economy than reducing carbon emissions, so it's building every type of generation, as fast as possible, including both coal and fusion.

That's because it's not just warfare that is becoming electrified through drones, but the new technology that is revolutionising civilian life: artificial intelligence.

On Friday, the chief executive of Walmart, Doug McMillon, said: ""It's very clear that AI is going to change literally every job.""

The military industrial complex on which American power has been based is morphing into the ""electro tech stack"".

China is driving hard to supplant the US in this new military industrial complex, and has already achieved leadership in electric vehicles, batteries, drones, renewable energy and is working on semiconductors and AI.

Someday, nuclear reactors the size of shipping containers could power your hometown, but a huge number of regulatory hurdles will have to be cleared before nuclear power starts popping up in your backyard – and public buy-in will be critical.

After decades of relatively little change in nuclear power technology, there is currently a flurry of nuclear energy innovation taking place around the world. Scientists are looking into how to make nuclear power production more efficient, cost-effective, safe, and streamlined in response to an ever-growing need for reliable and carbon-free energy production. Like renewable energies, nuclear power is carbon-free, but unlike solar and wind power, the production potential of nuclear power is steady and constant, making it an attractive option for energy security in the decarbonization era.

Some of the potential new nuclear technologies garnering investor attention are small reactors and microreactors. In recent years nuclear energy development has been trending toward much smaller models in the interest of lowering up-front development costs and making new nuclear projects more easily deployable.

Most of the excitement and investment has been geared toward small modular reactors (SMRs), which many advocates believe could be the backbone of a nuclear renaissance in the United States and other countries that have begun to move away from nuclear power production. These modular models can be mass-produced in a factory setting and installed on-site alone or in clusters to create utility-scale nuclear power plants more quickly and cheaply than traditional large-scale models.

Microreactors, which have so far received less attention and funding support than SMRs, are much smaller. While a full-scale nuclear power plant would produce, on average, upward of 700 megawatts, and an individual SMR would produce about 300 megawatts, a microreactor’s output would be around 10 megawatts.

While microreactors are much smaller, they could be used to power entire towns for a relatively low up-front cost, and they have unique selling points compared to SMRs and traditional nuclear power plants. They’re safer than larger models, and they’re so small that they could be brought in on a truck or barge, hugely easing the installation process. Plus, microreactors do not require any on-site workers for their operation and maintenance, and can be operated remotely and autonomously.

“Microreactors have the ability to provide clean energy and have passive safety features, which decrease the risk of radioactive releases,” Euro News reported earlier this year. “They are also much cheaper than bigger plants as they are factory-built and then installed where they are needed in modules.”

All of these benefits mean that microreactors could be enormously useful in a wide range of contexts. A recent article in The Conversation touts their utility, saying that “this technology could benefit college campuses, remote communities in Alaska primarily powered by oil and diesel, tech companies looking for reliable electricity for AI data centers, companies in need of high-temperature heat for manufacturing and industrial processes, mining operations that need a clean energy source and even military bases in search of a secure source of energy.”

The problem is that while the microreactors themselves would be relatively low-cost, building the facilities to construct these microreactors would be a massive and expensive undertaking. And so far no one has been willing to take that risk. Investors want guaranteed orders before they build such a factory, and potential buyers want to see the technology built, tested, and proven before they place an order. “It’s a catch-22,” says The Conversation’s Aditi Verma.

There’s another considerable downside to widespread deployment of microreactors and small modular reactors – surprisingly large amounts of nuclear waste. A Stanford study found that “most small modular reactor designs will actually increase the volume of nuclear waste in need of management and disposal, by factors of 2 to 30,” said lead author Lindsay Krall. “These findings stand in sharp contrast to the cost and waste reduction benefits that advocates have claimed for advanced nuclear technologies.”

Community buy-in is essential to get microreactors off the ground, but those communities need to seriously consider the cost of managing all that nuclear waste. The many benefits of microreactors may still be worth it, but nuclear waste is a major cost to taxpayers that should not be overlooked.

Despite Tesla's EV struggles, the strength of its competitors indicates that the overall EV marketplace has remained relatively strong. Further, consumers now have more EV choices than ever before, with options ranging from sporty coupes to powerful pickups and everything in between.

In addition to producing less planet-heating pollution per mile than gas-powered vehicles, EVs can save owners thousands of dollars per year in fuel costs, according to the Department of Energy.

To take the environmental benefits and cost savings of driving an EV even further, you can pair an electric vehicle with a home solar system. Charging an EV from home solar is cheaper than doing so from the electrical grid or at a public charging station, plus you get the added benefit of knowing that your vehicle is powered by cleaner, renewable energy from the sun.

EnergySage makes it easy to find the home solar option that is right for you with free online tools that allow you to compare quotes from pre-screened local installers and easily identify available rebates and other incentives in your area, saving customers up to $10,000.

However, with federal tax credits on electric vehicles set to end Sept. 30, 2025, and tax credits for home solar sunsetting Dec. 31, the time to act is now if you want to take advantage of thousands of dollars in potential savings.

By Aidan Hughes for Inside Climate News

The energy and natural resource sector has spent hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying the federal government so far this year, according to data compiled by the nonprofit OpenSecrets.

That spending comes amid a wave of policy wins for fossil fuel interests—and significant setbacks for environmental and green energy groups.

Nearly $240 million poured in during the first and second quarters of 2025, with about 2,200 lobbyists representing the sector—nearly half of whom are former government employees themselves. That spending puts the sector slightly ahead of last year’s pace, when its yearly total reached $435 million.

This year’s expenditures make energy and natural resources the fifth-largest lobbying sector that OpenSecrets tracked over this period—ahead of transportation, defense and labor.

Electric utilities represented the largest share of those expenditures, totaling nearly $75 million.

That’s more than half of what it spent in all of 2024 combined—the industry’s biggest year in over a decade.

And with about $71 million already spent on lobbying this year, the oil and gas industry continues to significantly outpace the renewable industry’s lobbying expenditures of roughly $40 million.

The totals for oil and gas so far this year put the industry slightly below the pace of last year’s expenditures, which totaled over $150 million—its highest since 2009.

However, watchdog organizations say the industry’s steady funding is actually the result of its existing influence within the federal government.

“When you’ve got a White House that has made clear that they’re going to do whatever you want, you don’t have to spend as much money to get results,” said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program. “They had to spend more when you had bipartisan, shared control over government, and you didn’t have a rubber stamp in the Oval Office. Now they do.”

Since President Donald Trump took office, his administration and Republicans in Congress have pushed through a slew of regulatory and legislative measures fulfilling the priorities of fossil fuel interests, often at the expense of renewables.

The party’s signature legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, has been criticized as a handout to the fossil fuel industry that increases lease sales for drilling and mandates that millions of acres of federal lands be made available for mining.

Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, told CNBC at the time that the bill “includes almost all of our priorities.”

The administration has also granted Clean Air Act exemptions to dozens of fossil fuel-burning power plants, delaying their need to reduce emissions of mercury and other air toxins.

And the EPA’s announcement that it intends to rescind its “endangerment finding” for greenhouse gases would remove the basis for its ability to regulate emissions from motor vehicles, power plants and oil and gas operations.

These moves have come amid a reversal of government support for renewable energy projects. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act included a phaseout of tax credits for wind and solar that critics say runs counter to the administration’s goal of achieving “energy dominance.”

Wind energy, in particular, has been singled out as a target by the administration. Trump issued a presidential memorandum on his first day in office halting approvals, permits, leases and loans for both offshore and onshore wind projects. The administration later took the unusual step of issuing stop-work orders for some offshore wind projects that were already under construction.

Multiple watchdog organizations told Inside Climate News that the real source of the fossil fuel industry’s current influence stems in part from industry insiders who have been strategically placed into key government positions. That list includes Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas executive, and a range of political appointees with ties to the industry within the EPA.

In an emailed statement, a White House spokesperson did not directly address concerns about administration officials’ ties to fossil fuel interests, but said that “President Trump has kept his Day One promise to unleash American energy, protecting our national security and lowering costs for families and businesses.”

According to Robert Maguire, vice president for research and data at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, those ties have meant that the fossil fuel industry hasn’t had to increase spending on lobbying to secure key wins.

“This has been a hallmark of both [of] Trump’s terms, where essentially he fills his administration with lobbyists and industry officials who, in many cases, have no government experience,” Maguire said. “Their only qualifications for the jobs that he’s putting them in is the fact that they want to do the industry’s bidding within the government.”

A source within the oil and gas industry, however, downplayed the effect of the “revolving door” of industry insiders gaining positions within the government, and instead emphasized that Trump came into office with an already-friendly attitude toward oil and gas.

The source, who requested anonymity to speak freely on the topic, said that industry lobbyists have had conversations with people in government who are “more engaged or more willing to talk for any number of reasons,” saying that there is “expertise” within the current administration on matters tied to the oil and gas industry that didn’t exist during the Biden administration.

Although the source emphasized that the industry has still fought difficult policy battles this year, including over tax credits for clean hydrogen projects, they said that this expertise has meant that industry lobbyists haven’t needed to spend as much effort educating lawmakers or officials on key issues.

Utilities, meanwhile, continue to have a “massive” amount of influence in D.C., according to David Pomerantz, executive director of the watchdog Energy and Policy Institute.

But he noted that far fewer utility insiders have been appointed to positions within the federal government during Trump’s second term.

And unlike the oil and gas industry, the agendas of various utility companies are more complex, and sometimes reveal significant differences between what utilities want and what the Trump administration wants.

“Where the utilities are lobbying for policies or regulatory changes that will allow them to burn more coal and gas, they’re successful,” Pomerantz said.

“The EPA basically said, ‘If you want waivers so that you do not have to comply with pollution limits, all you have to do is send us an email.’”

Still, Pomerantz said that not all utility companies sought out those exemptions—and that some utilities have also lobbied unsuccessfully against some of the Trump administration’s anti-renewables policies.

“Even [with] their considerable political power notwithstanding, the utilities have tried … to prevent some of the worst attacks on wind and solar,” Pomerantz said, “and they’ve basically failed at every turn.”

Although the renewable energy industry continues to lag behind oil and gas, its spending so far of roughly $40 million puts it on pace to eclipse last year’s record of $63.7 million.

This year’s spikes are driven in part by massive increases from the renewable industry’s top spender—the American Clean Power Association (ACP).

ACP’s expenditures in the second quarter of 2025 alone, which reached $3.8 million, were nearly twice the amount the trade association spent in all of 2024 combined.

The $4.3 million it has spent so far this year places it ahead of any of the oil and gas industry’s trade associations. The American Petroleum Institute, by comparison, spent just under $4 million, while American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers spent less than $3 million

But Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program, suggested that ACP’s efforts have been unsuccessful.

“The American Clean Power Association sort of is on the outside looking in, and I’m not sure that any amount of money is going to be able to overcome this,” he said.

Slocum also said that the association had “badly misjudged their strategy” by assuming they could appeal to both Democrats and Republicans.

“They thought that they could build a bipartisan appeal for renewable energy, and you see that with a few senators like [Chuck] Grassley and [Lisa] Murkowski, but for the most part, you know, mainstream Republicans just do not want to challenge Trump publicly,” Slocum said.

In an emailed statement, ACP suggested that its efforts on Capitol Hill helped the renewable energy industry avert even worse outcomes—and defended the association’s attempts to build bridges with key Republican legislators.

“The ability to successfully remove the destructive excise tax [from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act] and secure a more reasonable phase out of clean energy tax credits required a sophisticated response to underscore the impact of these policies on consumers and the communities we represent,” said Jason Grumet, the CEO of ACP.

“Despite the highly polarized environment, a group of Republican senators came forward to support the core interests of the clean energy industry,” Grumet said. “Securing this support for provisions that the entire Republican caucus originally voted against is an important accomplishment.”",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1442146/story_image/AP25140741660616.jpg?1749501029,N,,2025-09-28 15:01:58.636131

“When Democrats had one-party rule in Washington, you saw them appropriating tens of billions of dollars to go through their well-connected left-wing environmentalist NGO friends, former Biden and Obama officials, and Democratic donors,” Zeldin said on Newsmax’s “Sunday Report,” referring to nongovernmental organizations.

He added that President Donald Trump often talks about ending the Democrats’ Green New Deal “scam” and that the administration has been dismantling it all year long, saying it has been “abusing the wallets of Americans.”

Zeldin said voters made clear last November that they wanted a new direction, sending Trump back to the White House. He argued that the final years of the Biden administration were marked by regulatory decisions aimed at “suffocating out of existence entire sectors of our economy.”

Looking ahead, he said the Trump team is focused on unleashing U.S. energy dominance, lowering costs, and fostering innovation. “We need to make America the AI capital of the world,” he said. “We need to be able to better afford energy costs to ramp up energy production.”

The Trump administration last week announced it was canceling nearly $680 million in federal funding for 12 offshore wind projects, including the first terminal on the Pacific coast. California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office criticized the cuts as an attack on clean energy and jobs.

Zeldin countered that private investors are eager to build new energy projects without taxpayer money, but offshore wind only survives with massive subsidies.

“We need to be massively ramping up baseload power in this country,” he said. “People and companies want to invest. They’re not asking for money to get them to build these projects. They’re looking for the government to just get out of the way.”

He added that offshore wind economics don’t add up.

“These projects would not exist without government subsidy,” Zeldin said. “On the one hand, we can massively, efficiently ramp up baseload power without having to subsidize it with federal dollars,” he said. “On the other hand, we could be pursuing these other energy sources, really lying to ourselves and the country as if it is a substitute for baseload power … The president is looking at the economics, and it’s a no-brainer for him.”

Zeldin also pointed to earlier federally backed projects that faltered, including California’s Ivanpah solar facility, which will close in 2026 after receiving more than $1.5 billion in federal loan guarantees during the Obama administration.

“You’re talking about a project into the billions, not millions,” he said. Farmers and landowners across the country, he added, don’t want to see vast amounts of land taken up by solar panels that wear out prematurely. “And then what? Now you have all of these solar panels just sitting around. You might have these wind projects just sitting around.”

He said the debate over renewables also ignores the cost of battery storage needed to back up intermittent sources like wind and solar.

“Those battery storage sites cost a whole lot of money, and they then catch on fire,” Zeldin said. “Local municipalities, fire departments, they’re not prepared for those massive fires … That should be part of the discussion as well. And unfortunately, it hasn’t been.”

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is moving forward with a deal that would allow the U.S. government to take a small equity stake in a Canadian company that is developing one of the world's largest lithium mines in northern Nevada, an official said.

The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of President Donald Trump's administration intervening directly in private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

A White House official declined to specify the size of the U.S. stake in Lithium Americas, but said it would be “very small” — less than 10% — and serve as “a cash buffer” for the company. Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.

“We support the project moving forward,'' said the White House official, who was granted anonymity in order to talk about a deal that is not yet completed.

“Critical minerals like lithium are very important' to boost the U.S. economy and restore domestic manufacturing,"" the official said, adding: “We're trying to do this in a way that is fair to the taxpayers. We don't believe in free money.”

A spokesman for Lithium Americas declined to comment, but the company said in a statement that it is in discussions with DOE and General Motors regarding the DOE loan.

“The topics of these discussions include certain conditions precedent to draw on the DOE Loan and associated loan specifics, as well as incremental requests from the DOE for potential further conditions” to gain access to the loan, the statement said.

Jim Cain, a GM spokesman, said Friday the company remains “confident in the project” but declined to comment on ongoing negotiations.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial to building a domestic supply chain to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics. It also represents a rare point of agreement between Trump and former President Joe Biden. Both Republicans and Democrats support the mine project as a way to boost American critical minerals production and cut reliance on China, the world’s largest lithium processor.

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

Environmental groups and leaders of three tribes spent years fighting the mine, which they say borders the sacred site of a massacre of more than two dozen Native Americans in 1865.

The DOE under Biden backed the project as a way to help mitigate climate change by speeding the shift away from fossil fuels.

Trump has aggressively moved away from confronting climate change, labeling it “ the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world ” in a speech this week at the United Nations. “If you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump told world leaders on Tuesday.

The bid to boost the lithium project comes as the pace of U.S. electric vehicle sales has slowed as the industry struggles to attract mainstream buyers who remain concerned about charging infrastructure and affordability.

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption. The massive tax law approved this summer phases out federal incentives for new and used EV purchases, effective at the end of the month.

Consumers rushed to dealer lots this quarter to take advantage of the credits before the phase-out takes effect. The credits have saved car buyers up to $7,500 off the cost of their EV.

Without the incentives, many automakers will struggle to make sales.

Besides batteries for cars, cell phones and other electronics, lithium is also used in the manufacture of glass, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Lithium batteries are also used to store wind and solar power.

That’s a scary world.” Also at the roundtable, Barron shared his desire to encourage the revival of nuclear energy in Weld County at the Colorado House of Representatives this fall, now that nuclear energy was deemed a clean energy source by Colorado lawmakers.
Jared Polis signed a bill into law reclassifying clean energy as energy with little to no carbon emissions.","U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans and other Colorado Republicans have set their sights on reducing environmental regulations in an effort to increase oil and gas production and revive nuclear power in Weld County.

Evans and State Reps. Carlos Barron and Scott Slaugh, who was recently appointed to District 64 after Ryan Armagost resigned, visited Aims Community College on Monday for a workforce roundtable. Evans’ message to the students and faculty who attended was clear: if we don’t improve our energy production, then Colorado will suffer.

Evans discussed China and its innovations in artificial intelligence and drone technology. For every 100,000 drones made in the U.S., China makes a million, he said. Evans praised AI for lessening workloads and promoting more “long-term strategic planning,” but the technology requires a lot of energy, he noted.

“Energy security is national security,” Evans said. “Energy security fuels our economy, which fuels our ability to manufacture and make things. That fuels our position as the global leader in a lot of these technologies and a lot of other technologies that require energy.”

Colorado remains the fourth-largest oil-producing state, accounting for 4% of the U.S. total crude oil output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Weld County is responsible for 80% of the state’s production.

In 2024, Colorado produced five times as much oil as it did 10 years earlier. Between 2024 and 2025, the total number of permits in effect in Weld County increased by 42%, resulting in the construction of 3,124 oil and gas wells within the county.

Evans believes the state needs to continue invest in oil and gas to better support the country’s energy security. At the roundtable, he blamed Colorado lawmakers for working against federal interests and implementing further regulations that support renewable energy while restricting oil and gas.

If the regulatory burden were reduced by consolidating the various regulatory forms required by the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act into a single regulation, Evans said, the permitting process could be sped up by several years. Evans said this would lead to a boost in the local economy, creating more jobs for people across the state as more oil and gas wells could be constructed.

“The problem that I’ve seen in the workforce, in both private and public, is people worrying about the stability of their job with respect to the decisions from the people above them,” said Thomas Hall, a student from Aims and a former intern at the Greeley Water Department. “It can be scary when there are doubts about whether or not their job will be funded this year. This is a trend that I’ve seen at every place that I’ve worked for.”

State lawmakers have cited environmental concerns such as air quality and safety as they’ve continued to push for regulations on the energy industry.

As of Monday, Weld County approved its own regulations on oil and gas, adding stricter regulations regarding pipeline placement. These regulations also emphasized the need for more in-depth emergency action plans to ensure that accidents are properly addressed and that the sites are safer for workers and residents, according to Weld County Oil and Gas Director Brett Cavanaugh.

Weld County Air Policy Analyst Annareli Morales said though more oil and gas wells would result in more air pollution, they would not necessarily be enough to cause problems with air quality. The effect of additional wells depends on how many more there are and where they are located, she said.

“Logically speaking, if you had more wells, you would have more emissions, even if they are cleaner,” Morales said. “But it’s the context of, relatively speaking, how much more is emitted with these additional permits compared to what vehicles emit during rush hour per day? Is it comparable? Is it less?”

According to a state report from October 2024, 60% of Colorado’s air pollution originates from the oil and gas industry, with 45% of that coming from Weld County alone.

Evans dismissed the concern, saying that 70% of the detected emissions in Weld County originate from outside Colorado, specifically Canada and China. Though Morales was hesitant to confirm this percentage, she did say more than half of ozone pollution is attributed to the base quality of the atmosphere as a whole.

“The latest data we have, which is very old, tells us that a significant amount of the total ozone is out of our local control,” Morales said. “There’s a very small portion that is human-caused. And then within that, there is an even smaller portion that the state actually has jurisdiction over to do something about.”

According to Morales, however, the current regulations in place, even if they are lessened to streamline the permitting process, would still be more stringent than those in other states. She backs Evans’ claim that unless Colorado reduces its regulations surrounding oil and gas, developers will go elsewhere, where they don’t have to deal with the regulatory burden.

“If we can’t build it here, China will happily build it for us, and we can lose our position of global leadership,” Evans said. “If we don’t do it, China’s going to do it, and if you think the world is a scary place now, wait until China’s the global leader on AI. That’s a scary world.”

Also at the roundtable, Barron shared his desire to encourage the revival of nuclear energy in Weld County at the Colorado House of Representatives this fall, now that nuclear energy was deemed a clean energy source by Colorado lawmakers. In March, Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill into law reclassifying clean energy as energy with little to no carbon emissions.

“It is the cleanest, safest, most reliable form of energy produced. Period,” said Weld County Commissioner Scott James, a proponent of “everything and anything energy related.”

“Now, granted, there is nuclear waste, but under the newer forms of reactors, they can take that spent fuel and get even more fuel out of it. The technology has so dramatically increased around nuclear power generation that the amount of radioactive material has dramatically decreased.”

Its this jump in technology surrounding nuclear energy over the past 40 years that Evans says will be critical to bringing nuclear power back to Colorado. In the effort to promote reusability, Barron suggested that Fort St. Vrain, an old nuclear plant in Platteville that was shut down in 1989, could be converted into a modular nuclear plant — a smaller-than-average plant with a reduced environmental footprint —and utilize the used fuel that is still stored there.

“It’s laughable that we are a growing economy that has a massive demand for electricity as we move from an agricultural to an industrial economy, as we transition from an industrial economy to a data economy,” James said. “We have to have that conversation about nuclear power. I think we’re foolish for not doing so.”

First, they undermine the development benefits sought by multilateral development bank projects.

This change is being prompted in part by the new U.S. administration and is also supported by developing country experts.

Yet, the reality remains that fossil fuel emissions, and specifically the climate change they induce, can severely undermine multilateral development bank projects and overall developing country growth prospects.

Most emissions, however, come from richer big economies, not poorer developing ones. Given the negative effects of these emissions, multilateral development banks need to push richer economies away from fossil fuels, even as they consider softening restrictions on lending for fossil fuel projects in poorer countries.

Last decade, multilateral development banks began restricting funding for fossil fuel projects due to concerns about emissions, but also under pressure from the U.S., European and other key stakeholders.

For example, the World Bank announced in 2017 it would largely stop funding gas drilling and extracting projects. Other multilateral development banks followed suit.

Many have noted the economic benefits being denied to poor countries by these restrictions, such as export revenues and power plants fueled by domestic gas reserves. Sub-Saharan Africa and South America have contributed little to historical global emissions — 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively, a trend projected to continue.

As the International Energy Agency consistently highlights in its climate scenarios, the emissions reduction needed to avoid dangerous levels of climate change must come, unsurprisingly, from the world’s biggest economies. This includes China, with 33 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in 2022, followed by the U.S. with 13 percent, the European Union taken as a block, Russia and then Japan. Together, these countries generate 60 percent of the global total. India is also a large emitter, but its level is driven more by a massive population than wealth.

These emissions, and specifically the climate change they drive, present two significant risks for multilateral development banks. First, they undermine the development benefits sought by multilateral development bank projects. Second, they create financial risks for these banks by potentially weakening the capacity of developing country borrowers to repay their loans.

The massive 2022 flooding in Pakistan illustrates the potentially devastating economic impact of climate change, as the country suffered over $30 billion in losses — nearly 10 percent of its GDP. This degree of devastation is not feasible to plan for or adapt to. It needs to be avoided.

Unfortunately, various factors stunt a proper appreciation of climate change’s potential destructive impact. First, there is the inability to see the future. Looking back or even to the present does not provide a full sense of the future potential destructive impact of climate change.

Second, climate change’s impact grows over time, producing more destruction in a more distant future. Its small impact on today’s stock market contrasts significantly with its potentially large-scale economic damage 15 to 20 years from now as climate change worsens.

That longer period is particularly relevant to multilateral development banks, whose projects often take years to mature, and whose corresponding loans extend beyond 15 years.

Third, this sense of uncertainty is being exploited by climate minimizers to play down the long-term perils of emissions relative to the shorter-term benefits of fossil fuel projects.

As a result, multilateral development banks are caught in a tricky dynamic: responding to pressures from key shareholders — notably the U.S. — to loosen restrictions on financing for fossil fuels while working to limit greenhouse gas emissions that negatively affect development.

Earlier this year, the World Bank’s president proposed an “all of the above” shift in approach, with more natural gas development projects, as well as nuclear power and other alternatives. Although this proposal was welcomed by some, the World Bank’s board in June deferred a decision on natural gas, even as it approved nuclear power.

The writing is on the wall as the U.S. pushes multilateral development banks to fund more fossil fuel projects. This debate will continue, including at the upcoming World Bank Annual Meetings next month.

In order to reduce the risks climate change poses for multilateral development banks, these organizations should launch an initiative to encourage the largest greenhouse gas violators to reduce their emissions.

Although these countries aren’t susceptible to influence by multilateral development bank lending policies, they are all leading shareholders and active on multilateral development bank boards. This involvement provides an avenue for multilateral development banks to engage with these countries.

The initiative for change could be built around analytic work, convenings and outreach regarding the negative development impact of wealthy country emissions. It could even be launched at October’s annual meetings.

""The Ivanpah plant was a financial boondoggle and environmental disaster,"" she said, via AP.","A multibillion-dollar solar plant is set to close down next year because it's supposedly not 'serving its purpose', which has left everyone saying the same thing.

An eye-watering $2.2 billion was reportedly spent on the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, a solar thermal plant based in the Mojave Desert in California.

The plant, made up of three 459-foot towers and nearly 174,000 computer-controlled mirrors called heliostats, opened in 2014, but it will be switched off for good next year after failing to meet its energy targets despite hopes it was going to make America 'a world leader in solar energy'.

Next year's closure comes 13 years earlier than planned. The likes of Pacific Gas & Electric and NRG Energy Inc. were supposed to have contracts that lasted until 2039, Associated Press reported, but news broke back in January that they were ending their respective agreements early.

""PG&E determined that ending the agreements at this time will save customers money,"" the company said in a statement on its website at the time.

Meanwhile NRG dubbed the project 'successful' but that it unable to compete with rival photovoltaic solar technology.

Plans for the planet were approved back in 2010, and a year later, former President Barack Obama’s Department of Energy issued $1.6 billion in three federal loan guarantees.

With this in mind, Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System's upcoming closure has left a lot of Americans saying the same thing: that the whole debacle was a waste of taxpayers' money and government funding.

""Both a waste of money and an environmental disaster that will take decades to clean up,"" somebody said on Twitter, as another fumed: ""Yet another left-wing taxpayer-funded boondoggle turns out to be a useless waste of money.""

A third added: ""Another total failure and waste of taxpayer dollars by Gavin Newsom. Guy fails at everything he does.""

As another person insisted that the solar power plant 'was always a boondoggle'.

Julia Dowell of environmental organization The Sierra Club echoed similar sentiments earlier this year.

""The Ivanpah plant was a financial boondoggle and environmental disaster,"" she said, via AP. ""Along with killing thousands of birds and tortoises, the project’s construction destroyed irreplaceable pristine desert habitat along with numerous rare plant species.

Dowell continued: ""While the Sierra Club strongly supports innovative clean energy solutions and recognizes the urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels, Ivanpah demonstrated that not all renewable technologies are created equal.""

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
Big players on both sides The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the US, where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.","HARRISBURG, Pennsylvania, Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence (AI) race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants, and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the work

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9 percent stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible October 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a date center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the US and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the US, and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10 percent returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the US, where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19 percent premium — to affect electric rates.",https://cdn4.premiumread.com/?url=https://www.manilatimes.net/theme_manilatimes/images/TMT_1920x1008.jpg&w=1920&q=100&f=webp&v=1,N,,2025-09-28 15:01:50.001446

Gonzales resident Connie Thompson, who grew up in Gentilly, said she had always been curious about the seawall’s history. Thompson asked about the seawall’s construction and history, along with the scope of the wall: “I always wonder why the seawall was built around Lake Pontchartrain only on the New Orleans side? The year it was built? Was it to put people to work?”

The northshore has a similar, although smaller, seawall. The Mandeville concrete seawall was built in the 1930s as a Works Progress Administration project. The story of the New Orleans seawall is a bit of a deeper dive.

Kristi Trail, executive director of Pontchartrain Conservancy, reached back into the early days of European settlers and south Louisiana’s alluvial flood plain to begin to describe the seawall’s importance.

A growing city looks outward

After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the city began expanding, looking for ways to grow outward, Trail said. Back then, what is now the Lakeview, Gentilly and City Park neighborhoods were all swamps. By the late 1800s, the Lakefront was in constant use for commerce and recreation. Fishing camps were set up with elevated walkways and structures, but had to maneuver around Lake Pontchartrain’s tidal pattern. The Port Pontchartrain lighthouse, which still stands today, was floating out on the water, unconnected to land, Trail said.

Mechanical engineer Albert Baldwin Wood, whose impact on New Orleans drainage cannot be overstated, opened up new possibilities with his screw pump invention, patent filed in 1913. The screw pump could pump massive amounts of water, allowing for quick drainage of swampland — although this mass draining would eventually cause subsidence issues.

In the 1920s, the Orleans Levee Board began a huge project of reclaiming land from the lake. The lakefront development used clam shells from the lake to mix with sediment dredged from the lake bottom for this new land. In 1930, the Orleans Levee Board started what would be about a 2½-year project to build an 8-foot-high concrete seawall, according to the Lakefront Management Authority. The seawall was set into place to halt shoreline erosion and offer flood protection for the newly created area.

“The mud they are pumping in from the lake to fill in all that area, from Allen Toussaint to the seawall, it's just mud, and it's so soft to build on,” Trail said. “So this is when the clamshell dredging began in the lake.""

Those clams were taken out of the lake to mix in with those soft soils in the neighborhoods, Trail said. ""Those neighborhoods are all built on reclaimed land, as a result of the sea wall going in, which allowed those neighborhoods to be built,"" she said.

Dredging harmed lake environment

The project indirectly led to Trail’s current job — large-scale clam dredging led to massive environmental lake degradation. In the wake of this degradation, environmental advocacy groups popped up to defend the lake, one of which became the Pontchartrain Conservancy.

Since clamshell dredging was banned in 1990, the lake has started to bounce back. As for the Lake Pontchartrain Seawall, it remains in place, battered but still gamely holding up against the waves of the lake.

“It's solid concrete installation techniques. …I would bet it's probably sunk a pretty good bit over time, but I don't have the data on that,” Trail said. “We're out there every day, we see it. It's still there. It's still doing its job.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/8a/38a3d1ff-b52d-5ab6-a50e-1f66b7f2c0c6/66301c56851bb.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-28 18:00:28.636547

The company announced that it has secured $9 million in seed funding. Eclipse led this significant investment round.

The funding will significantly accelerate the deployment of Anode’s mobile battery energy storage system, or mBESS, technology. This will involve working closely with their initial customers and forging strong partnerships with strategic collaborators, allowing their innovative solutions to reach a broader market and address critical energy needs.

Anode’s mBESS technology, along with their comprehensive microgrid solutions, presents a distinctly superior alternative to traditional power rental services. These older services typically depend heavily on noisy, polluting generators and the logistical complexities of fuel delivery. Anode operates with a vertically integrated business model, meaning it manages every aspect of its offering. This includes developing purpose-built hardware specifically designed for their systems, crafting proprietary software that powers their operations, and providing AI-powered services that optimize performance and efficiency.

Through this integrated approach, Anode can deliver highly flexible and remarkably high-performance solutions. These solutions are tailored to meet the demands of some of the largest entities that frequently rely on temporary power, including essential utilities, rapidly expanding data center owners, general contractors overseeing large-scale projects, and operators of growing electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle fleets.

There has been a profound and ever-increasing demand for electricity, a trend largely fueled by the exponential growth of AI data centers, the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, and the ongoing expansion of industrial automation. This escalating demand is placing immense strain on an electrical grid that is already showing its age and struggling to keep up.

The pervasive effects of climate change are only magnifying the risks of significant business disruption for an economy that is becoming increasingly reliant on electrification. Historically, the temporary power industry has attempted to offer a stopgap solution through the use of traditional generators and mobile refueling services. But these analog solutions are deeply problematic; they are environmentally polluting, notoriously inefficient, and often prohibitively expensive, failing to meet modern demands for sustainable and cost-effective power.

Anode’s innovative technology and forward-thinking business model are together creating a completely new paradigm in the energy sector. They are introducing the concept of mobile batteries and on-demand energy delivery, transforming how temporary power is accessed and utilized.

By intelligently capitalizing on the continuously declining costs of battery technology and the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, Anode is uniquely positioned to deliver energy at prices that are not only competitive with traditional grid electricity but also a mere fraction of the cost associated with older fossil-fuel-powered solutions. This makes their offering economically attractive and environmentally responsible.

The team at Anode is built for substantial scale and impactful growth. The company’s founding members bring together a rich and diverse range of expertise. Their backgrounds include extensive experience in the complex field of autonomous vehicle development, specialized knowledge in electric vehicle powertrain engineering, critical insights from battery manufacturing processes, and a solid understanding of renewable energy project finance.

KEY QUOTES:

“U.S. electricity consumption is growing 5 times faster than recent historical averages, and our electric grid is struggling to keep up. The rapid electrification of our economy is creating transmission bottlenecks and electricity shortfalls, increasing demands for flexible, cost-competitive, grid-independent power. Anode’s AI-orchestrated microgrid solutions create a new model for large electricity users who can’t wait on the grid or be held back by legacy technologies to scale their operations.”

Paul Huelskamp, co-founder and CEO of Anode

“Anode is solving one of the most urgent challenges in the energy transition: Access to reliable, clean, and on-demand power. Their vertically integrated model and world-class team enable them to scale rapidly and electrify some of the most critical industries of the future. Anode is uniquely positioned to bridge the gaps in existing electrical infrastructure by delivering scalable energy solutions that will unlock growth across transportation, manufacturing, and beyond.”",https://cdn.pulse2.com/cdn/2025/09/Anode-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 14:00:00.570581

While political shifts in the United States are pulling the emergency break on clean energy policy mechanisms, the international energy sector is plowing full-steam ahead. “This is no longer a distant promise: it is happening now, at a pace and scale that was unthinkable even five years ago,” writes Reuters, “and it is being driven not just by advanced economies but increasingly by developing ones.”

As clean energy becomes cheaper, more reliable, and more decentralized, increasing adoption of renewable and clean energy technologies is a no-brainer for many countries. It’s not even about clean energy policy anymore – it’s basic economics. Take Pakistan – one of the world’s largest new adopters of solar power, at what may be the fastest rate in history. The nation’s traditional energy model based on fossil fuel imports has led to rolling blackouts and punishing energy prices for locals. As a result, citizens are increasingly turning to rooftop solar with attached battery systems to power their homes more affordably and reliably.

And Pakistan is just one example of many emerging economies that are turning to clean energy technologies to provide energy affordably, reliably, and locally. “The new generation of wind and solar power, batteries, and electric vehicles are on the verge of, or have already achieved, escape velocity, breaking free from the gravity of political capriciousness,” reads a recent article from Vox. “In a lot of places, especially in power generation, the cleanest option is also the fastest, the cheapest, and the one most likely to turn a profit. That’s true whether or not you care about the climate.”

A recent analysis from Ember shows that roughly two-thirds of the world’s emerging and developing economies are now leapfrogging the United States and Europe in their shift to clean energy. And it's clear why – the Ember report also calculates that 91 percent of new solar and wind developments are even cheaper than the cheapest fossil fuel plants when accounting for fuel cost. As a result, last year a whopping 87 percent of energy generation investment in emerging economies and China went to clean energy projects.

China has been instrumental in bringing clean energy to emerging economies around the globe. Through their ambitious Belt and Road international infrastructure project and well-established trade relationships, China has established itself as the central player of the global clean energy market. “Since 2018, Kenya, Yemen, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania have imported an amount of Chinese solar equal to roughly half the capacity of their entire power grid,” reads a recent report from Yale Environment 360. Recent United States policy has only served to solidify those trade relationships and incentivise closer ties between China and many emerging economies who have been targeted by steep tariffs.

However, developing nations still need a leg up in terms of climate financing if global targets are to be met. A coalition of rich and poor governments around the globe has prepared an open letter for this week’s U.N. General Assembly in New York this week urging global leaders to act swiftly in what is to be a ""decisive decade"" for the climate.

""Stark disparities in access to energy and investment remain,"" the statement warns. “Much more needs to be done to ensure the transition not only advances globally but also benefits the people and economies that need it most."" Africa, which has some of the greatest clean energy production potential in the world, has received only a fraction of global climate financing, despite the fact that its people are already suffering the impacts of climate change brought on by emissions from the Global North.

While the clean energy transition makes good economic sense, and has reached “escape velocity” in some contexts, scientists say that it needs to be significantly hastened to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. While clean energy projects are ramping up internationally, so too are fossil fuel developments.

The United States is facing an uphill battle in the wind sector thanks to several measures being championed by the current administration that aim to roll back the progress in the sector made during the Biden administration. The CVOW has the potential to completely transform the region and deliver short-term employment during the construction phase, as well as long-term jobs for Virginians.

The Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is the largest of its kind in the United States

Wind power remains a crucial part of the energy sector in the United States, as it should. One would struggle to argue with the advantages that wind power presents to the energy sector. Wind is free, and as such, the inevitable costs that Virginians will need to fork out are exceedingly low. The project is located a mere 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach in federal waters.

Those federal waters may pose a risk to the completion of the project, as Donald Trump aims to prevent wind projects from making any progress during his administration. Which we must remember is only in year one of four. In August of this year, the project reported that over 130 turbine foundations have been installed.

Couple that with the fact that all undersea transmission cables are in place, and specialized U.S.-built installation vessels are being deployed from Virginia’s shores, and the construction progress is well on track to reach its 2026 completion date. Once that happens, the 176 Siemens Gamesa turbines will produce roughly 2.6 gigawatts of electricity, or enough to power up to 660,000 Virginia homes.

Dominion Energy reports that the project is approximately 60 percent complete

Dominion Energy has reported that the major components are on track for full deployment by the end of 2026. Which will provide crucial employment for local residents in the short and long term. Once operational, the site is expected to generate more than $210 million in annual economic output. Roughly 900 jobs have been created during the construction phase, with another 1,100 long-term jobs being created in the final phases.

According to Dominion Energy filings with the State Corporation Commission, the project is expected to reduce fuel costs by more than $3 billion over the first decade of operation. The project will have an environmental impact as well. Once operational, the project will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by a staggering 2 million metric tons.

The project plays a crucial role in the Virginia Clean Economy Act

The Virginia Clean Economy Act aims to mandate 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050, as well as set a target of 5.2 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2035. The economic and environmental impact on the Virginia region will be substantial, to say the least. Despite the stance of the current administration, the project is on track to achieve its lofty goals and deliver crucial energy for the residents of Virginia, as well as deliver employment to thousands.

The longer summers have given these native bloodsuckers an extra three weeks on average to find a host.
It can make all the difference.” Advertisement REASON TO HOPE Maine scientists believe that people can help the environment adapt to the changing climate.
In certain areas, when the conditions are just right, they may be able to create new cold spots, she said.
“We can’t stop our rivers from warming, but we can slow down how fast it is happening,” Ouellet said.","When she looks at the Narraguagus River, Valerie Ouellet sees what others can’t: a thermal mosaic that explains why it’s one of the last places in America where wild Atlantic salmon come to spawn.

This 55-mile-long waterway in Downeast Maine is a hodgepodge of cold-water pockets hidden within the warmer river where adult salmon can find refuge from the state’s increasingly hot summers.

Atlantic salmon do their best growing and spawning in 68-degree water. Any higher and they stop eating; they lay fewer, smaller eggs. At 73 degrees, they swim erratically. If they don’t find cold water created by shade trees, spring-fed tributaries or groundwater seepage, some will die.

Ouellet is an ecologist with the Atlantic Salmon Federation and is part of a state and federal research team that has spent two years documenting the river’s temperature and flow to explore how close, how big and how cold these spots must be for salmon to survive.

Her research suggests cold water spots are shrinking or disappearing, especially during drought years. The Narraguagus now spends a lot of July and August above 73 degrees, according to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service monitoring data. On July 17, 2023, a legendary salmon pool in the Cherryfield section topped 83 degrees.

“Wild salmon are an indicator of ecosystem health,” Ouellet said. “If they go away because the water is too warm or not clean enough, what, or should I say who, do you think is in trouble next? That’s us.”

“If we lose them,” she said, “that means we’ve failed ourselves, too.”

The salmon’s struggle — which is shared by alewife and brook trout — is part of a much larger story unfolding across Maine. Projected to heat up by as much as 10 degrees by the year 2100, the state’s landscape is changing in ways that scientists are only just starting to understand, from its deepest waters to its highest peaks.

There is already a phenological disconnect in some areas — the dwarf bilberry shrub, for example, is flowering before the bumblebee and flies are ready to pollinate it. Experts say these are powerful indicators of a biological rhythm thrown out of sync by rising temperatures.

The Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram spoke to two dozen experts this summer about the ways increasing heat is affecting Maine’s environment, ranging from the short-term impacts of heat waves on bats and birds to the long-term effects of warming lakes, forests and oceans.

A FOREST IN FLUX

Maine’s evergreen cloak is beginning to show strain.

The state’s iconic spruce and fir populations are declining and heat-tolerant hickories and oaks are taking their place. Even the tree line is changing, inching up the warming mountainsides by about a foot a year, putting the squeeze on the plants and animals that had adapted to the harsh conditions at the top.

This is perhaps nowhere more visible than at Acadia National Park, where the red spruce’s prickly yellow-green needles scent the trails like orange rind when crushed by hikers’ boots. It is where the boreal and temperate forests meet. Many trees there are at the edge of their range.

With summer temperatures projected to warm by as much as 8 degrees, the amount of suitable red spruce habitat at Acadia is expected to drop by 50% by 2100, according to a 2022 U.S. Forest Service report that outlined how a warming climate would change the park.

“Acadia National Park is experiencing unprecedented change,” Laura Gibson, who runs a climate adaptation program at Friends of Acadia, said at a lecture this month about finding new ways to protect Acadia’s forests. “Thinking about the future can certainly be daunting at times.”

The red spruce provides winter cover for American marten and white-tailed deer and food for grouse, snowshoe hare and white-winged crossbill, whose twisted bill is designed to pry open spruce cones to get at its seeds.

As Acadia’s forest changes, the songbirds that make up its soundtrack could disappear. The Maine Audubon, a statewide wildlife and habitat conservation group, predicts that as many as 60 bird species will leave the park by 2150.

The husky call of the boreal chickadee will be replaced by the cardinal’s telltale pew-pew-pew or the red-bellied woodpecker’s shrill churr.

“Nature is clearly trying to tell us something, but we’re not listening,” said Sally Stockwell, the director of conservation at Maine Audubon. “We’re watching one species after another decline. … I never thought I’d see such dramatic changes right here in Maine.”

WILDLIFE FEEL THE HEAT

Moose can be quite vocal. During the fall mating season, males make deep grunts while females will use a long, nasally call to attract a mate. Calves often call out to their mothers. Both sexes will use snorts or roars when they are in danger, in distress or in a fight.

Then there is another, manmade sound — a kind of digital death rattle — that comes when Maine moose die. It is the notification tone Lee Kantar, the only state-appointed moose biologist in the country, hears come from his phone when a tracking collar has not moved for six hours.

It almost always means a moose is dead, he said, and it’s nearly always climate change, or more specifically the winter tick, that is to blame. The longer summers have given these native bloodsuckers an extra three weeks on average to find a host.

And once one latches on, it and tens of thousands of its friends will cling to that single host from fall through spring, slowly bleeding the moose to death. Kantar and others say it has turned the animal, which once numbered more than 100,000, from a symbol of Maine into one of climate change.

“As a scientist, I try to be objective, and maintain an emotional distance, but it can be difficult,” Kantar said in an interview this month after the debut of the film “Guardian of the Giants,” which highlights his work.

“With our changing climate, and what that means for winter ticks, I end up dealing with a lot of death,” he said.

The rising heat is also taking a direct toll on endangered bats, rare turtles and various species of birds that fall from their nests or are hit by cars when roused from dormancy too early.

At the Center for Wildlife in York, director Kristen Lamb sees the consequences. The nonprofit rehabilitation facility treats about 500 sick, injured or orphaned wild animals a year. During heat waves, chimney swifts are admitted with broken wings after the spit they use to hold their homes together dissolves in the heat, causing whole nests to drop to the ground.

The center often treats bats, already stressed from deadly white nose syndrome, that are injured after falling from exhaustion during a heat wave when the caves they use for roosting become dangerously hot, and the tiny creatures, unable to cool down, simply fall, Lamb said.

Extreme heat also confuses some animals, throwing their natural instincts out of sync. Normally dormant in summer, turtles are waking up in response to the warm ground. They begin to move across roads in search of food and water, only to be hit and injured or killed by cars.

“Every single wild animal that comes into our clinic tells a story,” Lamb said. “Many of the stories serve as a warning for humans. Because what we do to wildlife, well, we are also doing that to ourselves. Their problems will be our problems.”

WARMING WATERS

The average surface water temperature of Maine’s 100 biggest lakes has risen by 5.5 degrees between 1980 and 2020, according to monitoring data collected by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. That’s faster than Maine’s air and its oceans.

Those changes can result in a bumper crop of algae and invasive plants, according to researchers at Lakes Environmental Association and Lake Stewards of Maine. Algal blooms, once a rare occurrence, are becoming more frequent in shallower lakes and ponds as temperatures climb. These blooms can be toxic, posing a risk to human health and wildlife.

Consider Lake Auburn, a critical reservoir for the Lewiston-Auburn area. Historically, its deep, cold waters have been remarkably resilient. Now, longer, hotter summers have increased stratification — where oxygen levels in the deeper layers are dropping, impacting aquatic life and water quality, research from the Lake Auburn Watershed Protection Commission shows.

Rising lake temperatures also allow harmful bacteria and pathogens, such as E. coli, to survive longer, said Ben Peierls, research director for Lakes Environmental Association. This risk is compounded on hot days when more people visit lakes to cool off, which can increase the spread of these bacteria.

That exposure can sicken people, but it can also harm fish, Peierls said, causing infections, weakened immune systems and growth and reproduction problems.

At the same time, the Gulf of Maine is one of the fastest-warming bodies of water on the planet, and its transformation is sending ripples through the aquatic food chain, down to a tiny zooplankton called Calanus finmarchicus.

This minuscule crustacean is a temperature-sensitive species whose decline impacts a broad array of other marine wildlife and shows how interconnected they can be, said Kathy Mills, a senior scientist at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute.

As the zooplankton moved out of the Gulf of Maine, past the Bay of Fundy and into a new habitat in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, both the herring and the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale followed, according to a separate studies on the species.

But the habitat switch brought new dangers. According to the National Marine Fisheries Service, 12 right whales out of 450 died in the Gulf of St. Lawrence from ship strikes or fishing gear entanglement in 2017, leading to regulatory changes that reshaped lobstering on both sides of the border.

A warmer Gulf of Maine is also less suitable for herring, the fish that puffin, a beloved symbol of Maine’s coast, likes to eat and feed its chicks, said Don Lyons, the director of conservation science at the Maine-based Audubon Seabird Institute.

During marine heat waves, they’ll often fall back on Atlantic butterfish, a less heat-sensitive species, but its round body can be too large and oddly shaped for puffin chicks to swallow, Lyons said.

“We’ve found butterfish piled up outside of burrows with dead chicks inside,” he said. “It’s not that there was no food at all, but it wasn’t the right food. A few degrees warmer, a different fish supply. It can make all the difference.”

REASON TO HOPE

Maine scientists believe that people can help the environment adapt to the changing climate.

Researchers at the Appalachian Mountain Club are investigating whether alpine plants that grow atop southern New England mountains — which may have evolved with a higher heat tolerance — could be transplanted to Katahdin, the Whites and even Acadia National Park.

Maine’s puffin colonies had a successful nesting season this summer thanks to a break from the year-on-year heat waves that have dominated the Gulf of Maine over the last decade. Scientists counted 672 active puffin burrows at the Seal Island National Wildlife Refuge, about 100 more than the previous census five years earlier.

Some chicks drowned at Eastern Egg Rock and Hog Island, the two sites monitored by Audubon Seabird Institute, when storms in May and August flooded the low-lying burrows, but those that survived the storms had plenty of bite-sized fatty fish to eat, Lyons said.

This summer, Ouellet, the salmon researcher, is focused on the indirect impact of a warming climate — drought, which leads to lower water levels and reduces the ability of rivers to absorb and dissipate heat, making them more susceptible to warming, and thus more harmful to salmon and other aquatic life.

“It’s not looking good for Atlantic salmon this year,” Ouellet said.

She and the research team conducting thermal mapping of the Narraguagus are still processing their data, trying to determine the farthest a salmon will swim between cold spots, but they have already started sharing some with conservation groups.

In certain areas, when the conditions are just right, they may be able to create new cold spots, she said. If the thermal maps identify a warm pond spilling into a tributary, that’s fixable, Ouellet said. If too many trees have been cut back, they can plant more. A drainage ditch dumping warm water into a stream can be rerouted.

“We can’t stop our rivers from warming, but we can slow down how fast it is happening,” Ouellet said. “We created this problem, so we have a responsibility to fix it when we can.”

Although it remains unclear whether air pollution is directly linked to breast cancer, research in this field is expanding.","On a tree-lined street in a quiet suburb known by some as “Arbor City”, Eileen Miranda often watched her grandson race around the yard, trusting – like most – that the air they were breathing was clean. But data from an air quality sensor she recently installed outside her home showed otherwise. Now she wonders if it was the air that contributed to her eldest son’s childhood struggle with asthma.

“It overwhelmed me,” Miranda said. “I thought the numbers would be low. This community is nice, but lo and behold”

At 66, the grandmother of eight, who lives in La Mirada, a suburb south-east of Los Angeles, began noticing in her everyday life the cars idling on congested streets and the dizzying pace of heavy-duty diesel trucks coming in and out of an industrial hub a mile from her home.

“These are the things that got me thinking this cannot be good for the air,” she said.

Eileen is one of a growing number of Latinos across the US who, motivated by rising pollution concerns, have installed air quality sensors outside their homes, businesses and churches to better understand the air they’re breathing and advocate for change in their communities.

The grassroots monitoring comes as Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) moves to scrap almost all pollution regulations by rescinding a key 16-year-old legal finding, alongside a barrage of other rollbacks of life-saving rules.

Although more than half of the US population resides in areas with unhealthy air quality, communities of color are disproportionately affected, comprising 50% of those breathing in toxic air pollutants, despite representing just 41% of the US population, according to a recent analysis by the American Lung Association. Latinos are nearly three times more likely than white individuals to live in communities with poor air quality.

Although agencies such as the EPA collect air quality data, researchers note that this information may not present the complete picture since some sensors are primarily located in wealthier, predominantly white neighborhoods. Meanwhile, companies can bypass air quality rules by using data from monitors located farther from pollution sources, where the air is cleaner, or by not collecting data at all, as a recent Guardian analysis found.

Sensors in specific neighborhoods can help people better understand the air quality where they live, while also helping to fill data gaps. This local data can then be published for the public and shared with government agencies to inform where regulations and enforcement are needed.

In Miranda’s case, the air quality sensor is provided by the Hispanic Access Foundation, a national non-profit organization. Through a three-year grant funded by the Biden administration, the group aims to engage communities most affected by measuring air pollution in 12 areas with significant Latino populations.

The locations have some of the highest air pollution rates in the US, and all but one have asthma rates higher than the national average among adults.

Using PurpleAir monitors, everyday citizens and community leaders, known as “site managers”, gather data and track levels of harmful air pollutants, especially the type scientists call PM2.5 – particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers.

While not visible on its own, PM2.5 in large amounts – such as from car exhausts, coal-fired power plants and other industrial sources – can cause serious health problems for humans. Particulate matter has been linked to respiratory diseases such as asthma as well as neurological disorders, cardiovascular disease and other health issues.

A 2021 study found people of color faced higher exposure to PM2.5 pollution regardless of region or location. The study’s authors note that because of a legacy of housing policy and other factors, racial-ethnic exposure disparities continue to persist even with a decrease in the overall exposure.

PM2.5 levels are also worsened by heatwaves and wildfires, both of which are becoming more intense and widespread due to human-made global heating.

“When it comes to climate, everything is really interconnected. The wildfire smoke we’re seeing in California, we’re seeing that in other parts of the world,” said Hilda Berganza, the Hispanic Access Foundation’s climate manager, overseeing the project called El Aire Que Respiramos (The Air We Breathe).

In southern Idaho, Cecy Ruano, 50, and her family host one of the 12 air monitors in Caldwell, a small city surrounded by acres of farmland that is 38% Latino.

In 1989, many laborers migrated to Caldwell in search of employment in the agricultural industry. Likewise, Ruano migrated as a young child with her parents, harvesting and packing beets and onions in the fields, and she eventually stayed to raise a family of her own. Driven by her faith and family, she actively works to educate others and nurture a caring relationship with the environment.

“My mother suffers from asthma, and my great-grandmother also had breathing problems, so for me it’s very important, and not just for my mom but for the people in my church,” Ruano said. “I’ve got to take care of them; I need to make sure they’re OK.”

Located in a valley with Oregon to the west and Boise to the east, Caldwell faces wildfire winds from both directions from May to October. Worsening drought conditions across Idaho, along with extreme heat, are increasing wildfire risks in the area and lengthening the wildfire season.

Ruano’s mother, Maria A Espinoza, 66, her voice soft and raspy, gets winded easily and tries to stay indoors during those months.

Just eight miles south of Caldwell, at the Deer Flat national wildlife refuge, Cecy’s daughter Aimee Benitez and her husband, Bryan Benitez, both 29, informed residents in English and Spanish about the latest air quality data from their Caldwell sensor and how they can reduce exposure when the air quality is poor.

The project aims to compare three years of data with EPA data, enabling the sharing of this information with local officials and giving them a fuller picture of potential exposures.

“It’s just the start of what we can do,” said Benitez.

Down the road from Eileen in Commerce, California, a line of freight trucks idles as they prepare to enter the freeway next to Iglesia Bautista La Resurrección, where Pastor William Carcamo, 69, had an air quality sensor installed through the Hispanic Access Foundation as part of his commitment to serving the community.

“We Hispanic people worry about paying the rent, paying off the car and having money to sustain ourselves. But I tell my congregants, what’s the point of having a nice car if our air is polluted?” Carcamo said in Spanish.

The city of Commerce faces significant air quality challenges due to its location between the 710 freeway and a major rail yard that transports international goods to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.

California is widely known for some of the worst air pollution in the country, yet significant challenges persist when it comes to implementing and enforcing regulations.

In January, California rolled back a law aimed at curbing air pollution by requiring trucks to run cleaner by 2035. The law would have phased out diesel trucks at the ports of LA and Long Beach to a hydrogen and electric future. The rule was withdrawn from EPA approval just ahead of the return to office of Trump, who had previously threatened to revoke California’s clean air standards.

Since taking office, Trump has issued multiple executive orders rescinding previous efforts by previous administrations to tackle environmental injustice. So far, the EPA has cut more than 600 grants aimed at addressing the climate crisis and environmental justice because of what it considers unnecessary spending. These rollbacks come in response to the rapid growth of community data-collection projects over the last several years.

Democrats are accusing the EPA of illegally canceling billions of dollars in congressionally appropriated funds.

When asked whether current EPA monitoring networks adequately reflect air quality realities in communities of color, the agency clarified that although it provides technical and financial support, most monitoring stations are operated by state, local and tribal air agencies. It stated that the largest networks, which measure PM2.5 and ozone, are typically located in urban and rural areas chosen to represent broader regions or neighborhood-scale zones. The EPA did not address whether support would be renewed for expiring grants related to air quality monitoring.

“The Trump EPA is committed to enhancing our ability to deliver clean air, water, and land for ALL Americans regardless of race, gender, creed, and background,” the agency said.

The Hispanic Access Foundation was among 127 projects in 37 states that received grants from the EPA under the Biden administration in 2022 to monitor air quality in communities with environmental and health disparities stemming from pollution and the Covid-19 pandemic. Its grant remains in place through September 2026.

Industrial facilities foul nearby neighborhoods

In the historically Latino and working-class neighborhoods of Barrio Logan and Logan Heights in San Diego, California, industrial development near homes has led to increased health risks for residents and fueled decades of activism for cleaner air.

The neighborhoods face disproportionately high levels of air pollution that come from nearby industrial facilities, a naval base, a freeway and marine terminal operations, which have also limited access to the waterfront. The contrast is stark when compared with the wealthy community across the Coronado Bridge, where residential areas are kept separate from industry.

“You don’t need to live here to help us advocate, just caring is enough. It’s not right to have these negative statistics.” said Maritza Garcia, 33, a second-generation resident whose mom has breathing issues and led her to get involved with Environmental Health Coalition, a non-profit that has been working to reduce pollution and improve health since the 1980s.

While they’ve seen some success, such as advocating for a policy with the port of San Diego that would require a transition from diesel trucks to electric trucks by 2030, they still face uncertainty about what these policies will truly deliver and how effectively they will be enforced.

Recently, the Environmental Health Coalition faced a funding setback to its clean air project when one of its grants was cut by the EPA in May. While the remaining funds will allow it to continue its work for now, the organization is now seeking alternative sources of support to sustain its efforts.

“This is not a position against industry,” said José Franco García, executive director of the Environmental Health Coalition, “It really gets frustrating to hear the way environmental justice is being attacked as if it were a luxury or something that people are trying to take advantage of for funding, when in reality, it’s people who have been taken advantage of for years and have been suffering.”

At a South Bronx Unite (SBU) community meeting in May, about 20 residents packed into a small room in the Bronx, while others joined online to discuss data from 65 air monitors tracking particle pollution across the borough.

Much of that pollution comes from heavy truck traffic, industrial sites such as waste transfer stations, and local power plants. The Bronx is 55% Latino and 29% Black and has some of the highest rates of asthma in the country.

One of those 65 sensors is mounted on the concrete facade of the building where Grace Gonzalez, 56, lives. A lifelong Bronx resident, she lives less than half a mile from the Bruckner Expressway, a major truck route, and just a mile from the industrial waterfront.

Grace has lived in the building for 56 years and has asthma that has worsened with age, now limiting her ability to go on walks and jog like she used to.

“I try to live a normal life as much as I can,” she said. Every day, she climbs the five flights of stairs, taking breaks in between, to get to her apartment. For the past three years, she’s been having to use a nebulizer when her asthma flares up. “I call her nebu,” Grace chuckled.

She remains in good spirits and has become known in her building as a sort of messenger, making an effort to share information about air quality and updates from the SBU meetings with her neighbors and family.

Her daughter Gracie, 35, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2021, despite having no family history of the disease. Grace’s asthma, her daughter’s diagnosis and those of five other women in the building led the mother and daughter to question the air they were breathing – and what it might be doing to their health.

“I’m not going to be a statistic on a paper,” said Gracie, a patient care navigator at a care management agency. She trusted her instincts, advocated for herself and pushed for answers until she received a diagnosis. Gracie underwent chemotherapy and radiation, and now stays on top with regular follow-ups.

Although it remains unclear whether air pollution is directly linked to breast cancer, research in this field is expanding.

With two younger daughters, Gracie hopes more can be done to improve quality of life for Bronx residents. She loves her neighborhood and doesn’t want to leave. “We’re kind of the overlooked borough,” she said.

Even before Trump’s second term, nearly 73 million people lived in counties where neither ozone nor PM2.5 are monitored, according to a recent study by the American Lung Association, creating a gap in public health data likely to worsen as funding is cut.

“People need to know what’s in the air they’re breathing,” said Diana Van Vleet from the American Lung Association. “Stepping up and using these more localized air monitors and even filling in some of the gaps with satellite information is more useful and helpful than ever, especially as we’re seeing more areas impacted by wildfire smoke.”

Efforts to block community air monitoring projects have also gained traction. In May 2024, Louisiana passed a law that effectively bans community groups from using their own air pollution monitoring equipment and publishing the results, imposing fines for violations. In response, a coalition of environmental and community organizations filed a federal lawsuit in May challenging the law, arguing it violates their first amendment rights by restricting the publication of collected data.

Meanwhile, the Hispanic Access Foundation’s attempts to expand its air quality project were blocked when two subsequent grant proposals submitted to the EPA were rejected. The proposals aimed to grow the project to 20 additional sites, stretching from New Mexico to Florida.

Despite these challenges, experts believe it’s essential to continue the data collection to track trends over time.

“Latino communities are, on average, dealing with higher levels of air pollution, so nationwide this is definitely a trend,” said Dr Christopher Hennigan, from the University of Maryland, who’s been doing data analysis for the Hispanic Access Foundation project. “Is it fair for people to be exposed to higher levels of air pollution because of their ethnicity?”

Hennigan said that raising awareness and education remain the primary focus as the project’s future is uncertain.

Back in California, Eileen Miranda has been working to educate both her family and her community.

“Climate change is happening,” she said. “We made this problem; now we have to fix it. We have the tools to fix this.”

Miranda says she looks forward to presenting the data to local elected officials and remains undeterred by recent federal funding cuts.

“Now that I know, my eyes are open,” she said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3128555c71f544a37dde1c37491d392d8d70a0e/0_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b5bc826a17fee993d4f4f6f555e7184e",N,,2025-09-28 10:59:27.727063

Westchester County’s trusted clean energy nonprofit makes it easy for residents to take action, with vetted programs, local contractors, and free energy advising

September 16, 2025 – With federal clean energy tax credits set to expire, many homeowners are asking: “Is it still worth upgrading my furnace, boiler, or AC system in Westchester?” The answer is yes.

Through its relaunched EnergySmart Homes campaign, Sustainable Westchester is making it simple for residents to make the switch to clean, efficient home energy systems that make homes more modern, cost-efficient, comfortable, and ready for the future.

“Now is the time for Westchester homeowners to take action,” said Noam Bramson, Executive Director of Sustainable Westchester. “EnergySmart Homes makes the process simple, connects residents with trusted contractors, and ensures they benefit from the best available rebates. Our role is to help homeowners navigate options and move forward with confidence, so they don’t miss out.”

This relaunch comes at a pivotal moment: as federal incentives wind down, energy costs rise, and many households are confronting the high costs of keeping outdated furnaces, boilers, and AC units running. With winter approaching, it’s an ideal time for homeowners to schedule free energy assessments and “button up” their homes with insulation and air sealings to improve comfort and lower bills. As a trusted local nonprofit and municipal partner, Sustainable Westchester provides clear, unbiased guidance to help homeowners make smart energy choices without the guesswork.

What is EnergySmart Homes?

EnergySmart Homes is Sustainable Westchester’s free program that guides homeowners step-by-step through upgrading outdated systems—such as old furnaces, boilers, and air conditioners—with modern clean-energy systems such as:

Air source heat pumps

Geothermal heat pumps

Energy efficient insulation and air sealing

Heat pump water heaters

“This campaign is about setting a new standard of efficiency and comfort in Westchester homes,” said Lauren Brois, Director, EnergySmart Homes, Sustainable Westchester. “A modern home feels comfortable year-round, runs efficiently, and uses clean technology instead of outdated fossil-fuel systems. Whether it’s better insulation, air sealing, or upgrading to a heat pump, EnergySmart Homes guides homeowners toward solutions that fit their homes, budgets, and long-term goals.”

Are Clean Energy Rebates Still Available?

With federal tax credits sunsetting, homeowners can still tap into statewide programs like NYSERDA’s Comfort Home and EmPower+, which provide rebates for insulation and weatherization. Utilities such as Con Edison and NYSEG also offer incentives for heat pumps via the Clean Heat Program and offer equipment upgrades and smart thermostats. And with electricity rates rising and technology costs falling, clean energy upgrades often make economic sense even without incentives.

“Westchester residents are hearing mixed messages when it comes to federal incentives,” said Lauren Brois, Director, EnergySmart Homes at Sustainable Westchester. “The truth is: support is still available, the process is simple, and homeowners don’t have to figure it out alone. We guide families step by step, from understanding rebates and improvements to choosing the right contractor.”

Key Benefits of Energy-Smart Upgrades:

Lower bills: More efficient systems often result in lower utility bills. For example, adding insulation and sealing air leaks can save homeowners an average of 15% on heating and cooling costs. (1)

Greater comfort: Consistent year-round temperatures, gain air conditioning in the summer, and less drafty homes in winter.

Health & safety: Cleaner and safer living conditions at home and fewer greenhouse gas emissions in the environment.

Community resilience: Recent analysis in Westchester County found that pairing insulation with heat pumps can reduce peak summer demand by up to 8% and cut outage times by more than 60%, strengthening neighborhoods during extreme weather events. (2)

How Does the EnergySmart Homes Process Work?:

Sign Up – Residents connect with Sustainable Westchester’s Energy Smart Homes team to get started.

Assess – A vetted local installer completes a home energy / site assessment and provides a detailed report.

Review – Homeowners choose improvements and financing options that fit their needs.

Upgrade – Contractors install the technologies, delivering greater comfort and reduced emissions.

A Westchester Family’s Story

Mike Beilstein and Amy Kwan wanted their 105-year-old Pelham home to be the perfect place to raise their two children — but without air conditioning, poor insulation, and an oil-fired heating system, comfort was hard to come by.

After connecting with Sustainable Westchester’s EnergySmart Homes team, the family installed a geothermal heating and cooling system, a heat pump hot water heater, new insulation, and replacement windows.

“Our home finally feels comfortable in every season,” said Kwan. “The upgrades made a huge difference for our family — and having Sustainable Westchester’s guidance took the stress and guesswork out of the process.”

The discussion took place on Reddit's r/heatpumps subreddit, where a Canadian homeowner shared their experience with three local HVAC contractors. The homeowner wanted to replace their furnace with a heat pump, but each contractor suggested one that would be far too small to heat their 2,400-square-foot home.

""Is it because gas is so cheap that they just assume everyone will switch to gas [at sub-freezing temperatures]?"" the homeowner wondered.

Commenters quickly chimed in, saying the contractors likely did expect the homeowner to continue using gas-powered heat during the cold Canadian winters, but that burning dirty fuels wouldn't be necessary.

""What you are seeing is the dinosaurs of the industry showing their age,"" one commenter wrote. ""You can meet all your heating needs with a heat pump.""

By capturing heat from the ambient air, heat pumps don't need to burn dirty energy sources to keep a house warm. This makes them not only better for the environment but also more energy-efficient.

That efficiency results in lower monthly energy bills, and thanks to available tax credits and rebates, the upfront cost may also be lower than you'd expect. With EnergySage's Heat Pump Marketplace, you can see exactly what that cost is.

This free tool from EnergySage allows homeowners to get estimates from several local, verified HVAC installers, letting you quickly compare quotes to find the right heat pump — and right installation company — for your home and budget.

""Your home will be comfortable year-round with only a heat pump,"" one Reddit commenter wrote. ""No question whatsoever.""

To really amp up the savings on an electric heat pump, savvy homeowners could pair it with rooftop solar panels. Even in cold or cloudy climates, solar panels can generate enough power to bring monthly electricity bills down to nearly nothing.

Even better, EnergySage can help out with solar shopping, too. Thanks to their free tools, homeowners can compare solar-installation quotes — and according to EnergySage, the average homeowner can save up to $10,000.

Several eco-friendly credits and rebates, including the federal solar tax credit, will expire at the end of this year. Fortunately, several Inflation Reduction Act credits will remain for appliance upgrades, such as a heat pump, allowing homeowners to save thousands of dollars.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heat-pumpimage-recY8M2nYqIl7c9l3.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 10:59:36.454917

For those who were eyeing the most affordable version of the Tesla Cybertruck, the most recent news must feel like a rug being pulled out from under them. The company decided to pull the plug on its most affordable base model, the rear-wheel-drive Cybertruck.

What's happening?

According to a report from Quartz, Tesla decided to discontinue the RWD version of the Cybertruck only five months after the vehicle's launch. This model was billed as the most affordable, with a relatively low price tag of about $61,000, and was released this year. But now, the cheapest option available will be the all-wheel drive model, which starts at about $80,000, a $19,000 difference that represents a significant financial hurdle for many prospective buyers who have already placed reservations.

Why is this concerning?

This isn't just about one truck model. It's about accessibility. When the most affordable version of a high-profile electric vehicle disappears, it shrinks the pool of potential buyers and can slow down the transition to cleaner cars. Fewer EVs on the road have a real impact on community health by keeping more polluting gas-powered cars in circulation.

The decision also adds to a list of recent challenges for the company. While Tesla has seen sales growth in key markets such as China, its sales have recently plummeted across several major European countries. Adding to the concern is the shocking trend of preowned Cybertrucks losing their value much faster than expected, making it a tougher investment for buyers.

What can I do to help?

If you're thinking about buying your first electric vehicle, remembering the reason is important. Electric vehicles are far better for the environment, your family's health, and can save you a ton of money on repairs and gas. They are a win-win for everyone.

While you can't force an automaker to sell a specific model, you can still make informed choices. The good news is the EV market is bigger than just one truck, and there's plenty of information out there for those considering making their next car electric. Exploring all the options is the best way to find a vehicle that fits your budget and lifestyle.

Buying new isn't the only path, either. As the EV market matures, more affordable preowned options are becoming available. Some automakers are even expanding leasing programs for their used vehicles, creating another avenue for drivers to get into an electric car without the high upfront cost.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/x0l.GuQxHbRKqsubC6HGFw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/5e6aeb983c58513ecb78ea855583f383,N,,2025-09-28 10:59:44.212482

The federal EV (electric vehicle) tax credit is ending on September 30. The program, which allows EV buyers to claim a tax credit of up to $7,500 on a new vehicle and up to $4,000 on a used vehicle, was originally slated to last until 2032, but President Donald Trump’s ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" is bringing it to a close years earlier.

According to an analysis from the Detroit Free Press using data collected from Cars.com, approximately half of buyers considering an EV purchase are accelerating their purchases to try to get them in before the deadline.

The website told the outlet that demand for new EVs on its site are up by 33 percent when compared to a year ago, and up 22 percent for used EVs over the same time period.

Jeremy Lardeau of Cascale outlines why outdoor brands must collaborate and align with this shift to stay competitive and climate-resilient.

China’s rise as a low-carbon production leader

China is rapidly evolving into a hub for low-carbon, circular, and technology-driven production. China built nearly twice as much utility-scale wind and solar capacity as the rest of the world combined in 2024 and 2025, and with national initiatives pushing for textile recycling by 2025, the country is making measurable strides toward sustainability in its textile and apparel sector. Just this week, China announced its goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 7 and 10 percent by 2035, solidifying its commitment to renewables.

As Cascale’s recent analysis shows, many Chinese textile manufacturers are no longer just meeting compliance standards; they’re turning sustainability into a competitive advantage. Factories that adopt renewable energy and improve efficiency to offer “low-carbon apparel” are changing the conversation for brands.

However, ongoing US-China trade tensions are prompting some American importers to rethink sourcing strategies. While not all apparel categories are equally affected, unpredictability adds complexity to long-term planning.

Action points for outdoor brands

So, what does this mean for the outdoor industry?

First, outdoor brands should initiate discussions with their Chinese suppliers about their climate goals, greenhouse gas emissions and energy sources. Tools, like Cascale’s Higg Facility Environment Module (Higg FEM), enable this dialogue between brands and suppliers, by reporting and validating sustainability performance. The Higg FEM is a key tool for the industry value chain, striking a balance between reporting and benchmarking.

Second, collaboration in a pre-competitive environment is key to progress. Although it is promising to see many outdoor brands individually moving towards decarbonization, brands often source from the same facilities. This means some initiatives may force manufacturers and suppliers to work to different standards and specifications. Instead, outdoor brands should collaborate to develop aligned plans in partnership with each other and their supply chains, helping to build trust and transparency in the process.

From sourcing to strategy

Finally, outdoor brands must take a considered approach to their sourcing practices. To reach the industry’s sustainability ambitions, companies need to evolve the buyer-supplier engagement to foster long-term collaboration, climate investment, and shared accountability. There can be no meaningful progress towards deep, complex, and capital-intensive decarbonization efforts without a true commercial partnership between buyers and suppliers. Tools like the Better Buying Purchasing Practices Index can help brands understand the impact of their current purchasing practices and provide a blueprint for improvement.

Our recent Cascale Annual Meeting, which brought together over 700 stakeholders, underscored a critical truth: collective action is no longer optional. It’s the only way forward. For the outdoor industry, the path is clear. Sustainability isn’t just an added value; it’s an ingrained strategy. China’s evolving manufacturing landscape is a call to action we can’t afford to ignore.",https://sustonmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cascale-Hero-WEB.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 10:59:18.673104

Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) is one of the biggest regulated utility companies in the US. Its bread and butter is Electric Utilities & Infrastructure—serving 8.6 million electric customers across the Carolinas, Florida, Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky, with a hefty 55,100 megawatts of generation capacity. Its Gas Utilities & Infrastructure arm delivers natural gas to 1.7 million customers in five states. A smaller Renewables & Other unit dabbles in wind, solar, and storage, but regulated operations still make up over 90% of the company’s revenues. In short: most of Duke’s money comes from stable, rate-based businesses where profits are closely tied to the capital it invests and the tariffs regulators approve. Duke’s in a business with big walls—think regulated monopolies and high costs to compete—giving it a defensive moat and cash flows that are about as reliable as you’ll find. Its closest rivals by size? NextEra Energy, Southern Company, Constellation Energy, and American Electric Power. Like its peers, Duke’s growth depends as much on regulators agreeing to raise rates as it does on its own investment plans.

Recent Performance

Duke’s stock returned about 4.9% in the past year, lagging well behind the S&P 500’s 15.1% gain. Rising interest rates and a stubbornly hawkish Federal Reserve dented utility valuations, while tech stocks and cyclical sectors pulled the overall market higher. On top of that, storm costs and Duke’s relentless investment in new infrastructure have taken their toll on near-term earnings clarity.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

Duke’s rolling out a hefty five-year, $87 billion capital plan to cover grid improvements, cleaner energy, and growing demand from things like data centers. Management is calling for earnings per share to grow at a 5–7% annual clip through 2029, mostly thanks to steady rate case approvals and the returns on all that new investment. Still, near-term sales growth is running at 5.08%—behind the overall market’s 8.72%—and remains heavily dependent on how quickly regulators sign off and whether demand from industrial customers keeps rising.

Quality & Moat

Duke’s operating margins are solid at 29.00%—firmer than its five-year average of 23.36% and higher than the market’s 18.71%. That’s the benefit of having pricing power and scale on its side. Return on invested capital has risen to 5.46% from 4.47% over five years, though that’s still less than half the market average of 11.14%—a reminder that this is a capital-heavy industry. Duke’s free cash flow yield is finally positive at 0.58% (up from a negative five-year average of –0.21%), but the market beats it at 1.91%. The bottom line: Duke’s seasoned management and its regulated franchise keep profits consistent, but the moat is more practical than spectacular.

Valuation

Duke trades at 21.5 times forward earnings—cheaper than the market’s 25.9 times—so investors are getting a bit of a discount for that stability and dividend focus. But its EV/Sales of 6.11 stands above both its own five-year average (5.60) and the broader market (4.69). In other words: the market’s paying up for reliability, even if top-line growth is slow. That disconnect—lower earnings multiple but richer sales valuation—highlights the tug-of-war between Duke’s defensive cash flows and its limited growth.

Market Sentiment

With a beta of just 0.18, Duke’s stock barely budges when the wider market swings. The 50-day trend is up by 0.20, and volatility at 11.7% is half that of the S&P 500’s 23.1%. These numbers add up to a classic defensive play. Most analysts see Duke as a hold, institutional investors own a chunky share, and there’s little short interest—so sentiment’s generally steady as she goes. Recent moves—like selling a 19.7% stake in Duke Energy Florida to Brookfield—have been well-received because they tidy up the balance sheet.

Key Risks

Regulatory Approval: Duke’s growth relies on promptly securing new rate approvals and a friendly regulatory climate. Red tape or unfavorable decisions could crimp returns and slow down earnings.

Leverage and Interest Rates: Net debt to EBITDA stands at 5.41 times, far above the market’s 1.37 times. That makes Duke vulnerable if borrowing costs climb or if the credit rating comes under pressure.

Weather and Climate: Severe weather events and hurricanes hit utilities hard, racking up restoration costs and making it longer for Duke to get repaid, squeezing short-term cash flow.

Capital Intensity: That $87 billion in planned capital spending? It might mean more share sales, diluting existing investors, and could strain how much spare cash Duke generates.

Bull Case

Regulated Rate Base Growth: The $87 billion capex plan is set to grow Duke’s rate base and earnings for years—assuming regulators play along.

Defensive Cash Flows: Duke’s monopolistic businesses throw off reliable cash flows and strong margins, backing up those regular dividends.

Valuation Buffer: Trading at a forward P/E below the market gives some cushion, and there’s room for the stock to move up if investor sentiment shifts.

Low Volatility: With a beta of 0.18 and much lower volatility than the average stock, DUK suits risk-averse investors who still want some equity exposure.

Bear Case

High Leverage: Net debt to EBITDA at 5.4 times means more financial risk—especially in a world where rates could climb higher still.

Slow Organic Growth: Sales growth lags the market, and if regulators become more stingy on allowed profits, the returns on all that spending could disappoint.

Regulatory Uncertainty: Future investment could hit a wall if rate cases drag out, are denied, or if regulators clamp down on how much Duke can earn.

Weather-Related Costs: Restoration costs from storm damage are unpredictable and can put a dent in both cash flows and returns.

On Our Radar

Q3 2025 Earnings: Results due in early November 2025. Expect updates on how Duke is managing its spending plan, regulatory battles, and storm-recovery costs.

Carolina Utilities Merger: Regulators are reviewing the planned January 1, 2027 tie-up between Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, designed to deliver $1 billion in customer savings by 2038.

Brookfield Stake Closing: Brookfield expects to make an initial $2.8 billion payment for a piece of Duke’s Florida operations in early 2026, which should shore up Duke’s balance sheet.

Investment Conclusion

Duke Energy is a classic defensive utility: stable cash flows, a healthy dividend, and trading at a bit of a discount compared to the broader market. But it comes with baggage: high leverage, constant need for new investment, and the risk that regulators might not always see eye to eye. For long-term, income-focused investors, Duke could offer a reliable way to get equity exposure with less drama. Value investors might also like the below-market P/E, but should be comfortable with the capital-hungry business model and the realities of regulatory risk.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-09-28 13:02:24.461521

The Solar Energy Industries Association trade group is working to collect and share information about companies that recycle solar panels.
These efforts are important steps toward addressing the growing need for solar panel recycling and promoting a more sustainable solar industry.","It’s hard work soaking up sunlight to generate clean electricity. After about 25 to 30 years, solar panels wear out. Over the years, heating and cooling cycles stress the materials. Small cracks develop, precipitation corrodes the frame and layers of materials can start to peel apart.

In 2023, about 90% of old or faulty solar panels in the U.S. ended up in landfills. Millions of panels have been installed worldwide over the past few decades – and by about 2030, so many will be ready to retire that they could cover about 3,000 football fields.

As an electrical engineer who has studied many aspects of renewable energy, recycling solar panels seems like a smart idea, but it’s complicated. Built to withstand years of wind and weather, solar panels are designed for strength and are not easy to break down.

The cost conundrum

Sending a solar panel to a landfill costs between $1 and $5 in the U.S. But recycling it can cost three to four times as much, around $18. And the valuable materials inside solar panels, such as silver and copper, are in small amounts, so they’re worth about $10 to $12 – which makes recycling a money-losing prospect. Improvements in the recycling process may change the economics.

But for now, it’s even hard to reclaim the glass in solar panels. Many layers are glued together and need to be separated before they can be melted down for reuse. And if the separation is not precise enough, the glass that is recovered won’t be of high enough quality to use in making other solar panels or windows. It will be suitable only for lower-quality uses such as fill material in construction projects.

Other panels, usually older ones, may contain small amounts of toxic metals such as lead or cadmium. It can be difficult to tell whether toxic materials are present, though. Even experts have trouble, in part because current tests, such as the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure, can give inaccurate results. Therefore, many companies that own large numbers of solar panels just assume their panels are hazardous waste, which increases costs for both disposal and recycling. Clearer labels would help people know what a solar panel contains and how to handle it.

If someone wants to recycle a solar panel, and is willing to bear the cost, there aren’t many places in the U.S. that are willing to do it and are equipped to be safe about it.

Designing for a new life

Despite the Trump administration’s cuts to subsidies for solar projects, millions of solar panels are already in use in the U.S., and millions more are expected to be installed worldwide in the coming years. As a result, the solar industry is working on ways to minimize waste and repeatedly reuse materials.

Some ideas include sending used solar panels that still work at least a bit to developing nations, or even reusing them within the U.S. But there are not clear rules or processes for connecting reused panels to the power grid, so reuse tends to happen in less common, off-grid situations rather than becoming widespread.

Future solar panels could also be designed for easier recycling, using different construction methods and materials, and improved processing systems.

Making panels last longer – perhaps as long as 50 years – using more durable materials, weather-resistant components, real-time monitoring of panel performance and predictive maintenance to replace parts before they wear out would reduce waste significantly.

Building solar panels that are more easily disassembled into separate components made of different materials could also speed recycling. Components that fit together like Lego bricks – instead of using glue – or dissolvable sealants and adhesives could be parts of these designs.

Improved recycling methods could also help. Right now, panels are often simply ground up, mixing all of their components’ materials together and requiring a complicated process to separate them out again for reuse. More advanced approaches can extract individual materials with high purity. For example, a process called salt etching can recover over 99% of silver and 98% of silicon, at purity levels that are appropriate for high-end reuse, potentially even in new solar panels, without using toxic acids. That method can also recover significant quantities of copper and lead for use in new products.

A shared journey

Increasing the practice of recycling solar panels has more than just environmental benefits.

Over the long term, recovering and reusing valuable materials may prove more cost-effective than continually buying new raw materials on the open market. That could lower costs for future solar panel installations. If they are fully reused, the value of these recoverable materials could reach over $15 billion globally by 2050.

In addition, recycling panels and components reduces American reliance on materials imported from overseas, making solar power projects less vulnerable to global disruptions.

Recycling also keeps toxic materials out of landfills. That can help ensure a shift to clean energy doesn’t create new or bigger environmental problems. Also, recycling solar panels emits far less carbon dioxide than manufacturing panels from raw materials.

There are already some efforts underway to boost solar panel recycling. The Solar Energy Industries Association trade group is working to collect and share information about companies that recycle solar panels.

Governments can provide tax breaks or other financial incentives for using recycled materials, or ban disposing of solar panels in landfills. California, Washington, New Jersey and North Carolina have enacted laws or are studying ways to manage solar panel waste, with some even requiring recycling or reuse.

These efforts are important steps toward addressing the growing need for solar panel recycling and promoting a more sustainable solar industry.

With mounting energy demands from coastal urban areas and new data centers, offshore wind advocates still insist there can still be a future for U.S. offshore wind.
Meanwhile wind power opponents keep pressuring the Trump administration to do even more to foreclose on surviving projects.","The U.S. Justice department intervened Sept. 27 in a lawsuit brought by New Jersey opponents of offshore wind power, with a motion asking the federal court to remand previous approvals for the already-stalled Atlantic Shores project.

“This filing means federal agencies are going back to the drawing board,” said Bob Stern, president of the local activist group Save LBI, in an email to supporters Saturday. The group, a coalition of seaside homeowners, businesses and commercial fishermen, had filed their lawsuit July 11 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and has won allies in the Trump administration’s drive to shut down offshore wind development.

Earlier this year Save LBI successfully petitioned the administration and federal Environmental Protection Agency to suspend the Clean Air Act permit issued for Atlantic Shores construction. The latest move in the group’s larger federal lawsuit would completely reverse the construction and operations plan and record of decision issued by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management a year ago, among a flurry of wind power plans approved in the last year of the Biden administration.

“This is a significant admission by the federal agencies that the Atlantic Shores approvals cannot withstand legal scrutiny in their current form,” said Thomas Stavola Jr., a lawyer for Save LBI. Over years of local organizing and fundraising the activists mounted what they call “a comprehensive, multi-statute challenge to the Atlantic Shores project, citing data deficiencies, injurious impacts to marine mammals, tourism, economy, and electric rates and failures to assess cumulative impacts across the broader offshore wind buildout.”

Atlantic Shores, a joint venture of EDF Renewables and Shell, had been planned as 197 turbines as close as 8.7 miles off Long Beach Island, in an array rated for potential power up to 2,800 megawatts. The proposal faced fierce resistance from residents of beachfront communities who feared effects on tourism and property values, commercial fishermen and some environmental activists resisting what they see as a future industrialization of waters in the New York Bight.

Like another ill-fated New Jersey project,Ørsted’s Ocean Wind,Atlantic Shore’s financial prospects deteriorated with global inflation following the covid-19 pandemic, war in Ukraine and supply chain problems. Atlantic Shores’ backers had hope to submit an updated bid for future power production to New Jersey energy planners, but in June asked the state Board of Public Utilities to cancel its original bid.

Partner Shell withdrew from the venture and wrote down a $1 billion loss on U.S. offshore wind investment after the Trump administration moved aggressively against the industry. Those attacks continue, with mixed results. A federal court allowed Ørsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind project off southern New England, already almost 80 percent complete when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued a temporary stop-work order.

An earlier administration order to shutter the 810-MW Empire Wind project off New York was reversed in mid-May after negotiations between the Trump administration and state officials. With mounting energy demands from coastal urban areas and new data centers, offshore wind advocates still insist there can still be a future for U.S. offshore wind.

Meanwhile wind power opponents keep pressuring the Trump administration to do even more to foreclose on surviving projects.

In a Sept. 25 letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-NJ, argued that wind projects pose “long-term effects and impacts…on national security and the radar used for marine vessels and military and commercial aircraft.”

Van Drew singled out Equinor’s Empire Wind project, reportedly reprieved after Tump administration and New York State officials agreed to reconsider proposed natural gas pipeline links to supply Northeast states.

Interior Secretary “Doug Burgum and his team at the Department of Interior have already identified significant insufficiencies in several projects approved under the prior administrations,” Van Drew wrote.

He asserted “the prior administration also downplayed the threats to our national security posed by the large scale offshore wind industrialization including radar used for missile defense, air traffic, marine traffic, as well as sonar impacts from electromagnetic interference, the impact on training grounds off the northeast coast, and potential hazards posed by these structures during a time of conflict.""",https://s3.divcom.com/www.workboat.com/images/Atlantic shores crop.png.medium.800x800.png,N,,2025-09-28 10:59:31.461580

These investors aren’t just backing flashy data centers anymore. They’re going after local utilities that deliver power to everyday people and the massive servers running AI models like ChatGPT.

According to reporting from the Associated Press, billions of dollars from firms like Blackstone and BlackRock are now flowing into electric companies in New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.

These utilities supply power to more than 150 million people across millions of miles of power lines, and the profit potential is turning heads fast.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a finance professor at the University of North Carolina who studies private equity and hedge funds.

Greg said investors are now stacking up power plants, data centers, and energy services, all thanks to the surge in demand since the late 2022 launch of ChatGPT.

Blackstone targets utilities while Minnesota fight escalates

Blackstone is pushing regulators to approve its purchase of both Public Service Company of New Mexico and Texas New Mexico Power, based in Albuquerque and Lewisville. Wisconsin has already cleared the sale of Superior Water, Light and Power, and last year, Northern Indiana Public Service Company sold a 19.9% stake to Blackstone.

But in Minnesota, things are far messier. A major fight is unfolding over whether BlackRock, through one of its subsidiaries, can team up with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to take over Allete, the parent company of Minnesota Power. That utility provides electricity to 150,000 customers and runs a mix of coal, gas, wind, and solar power.

This isn’t just another transaction. Google might be building a data center in the area, and whoever controls Minnesota Power stands to make serious money from feeding power to it. The proposed $6.2 billion deal offers $67 per share, a 19% premium to Allete’s stockholders.

Allete claims this deal helps them hit Minnesota’s 2040 law requiring utilities to use 100% carbon-free power. They estimate needing $4.3 billion for grid and clean energy projects in the next five years. They also argue that BlackRock isn’t under short-term stock market pressure and can take a more “patient” approach.

Opposition slams deal as profit play on ratepayers

Not everyone’s on board. Critics say the whole thing is just a profit scheme. Karlee Weinmann, a policy advocate at the Energy and Policy Institute, said, “Private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice.”

Mark Ellis, a former utility exec turned consumer advocate, testified against the deal. Mark said he’s personally talked to private equity firms looking to jump into utility ownership. “It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” he said. He added these companies don’t come up for sale often, but when they do, they’re golden.

Utilities generate about 10% returns, not by selling power, but by spending money. The more they invest in substations, poles, and wires, the more they can charge customers under rules set by regulators. That’s where critics say the danger lies, the incentive is to overspend so investors can overcharge.

This fight over Minnesota Power mirrors battles in other parts of America, where people are pushing back against having data centers built near their homes. In this case, Gov. Tim Walz and building trades unions support the buyout.

But the Minnesota Attorney General’s office and large industrial power buyers (like U.S. Steel, Enbridge, and pulp and paper mills) are pushing against it. These industrial players use two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity.

In its filing, Allete insisted that BlackRock’s ownership wouldn’t change its operations or strategy, and promised the deal wouldn’t raise rates. But filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show Allete already said it was “well positioned” to meet its funding needs without new owners.

Things got even worse for BlackRock in July, when Administrative Law Judge Megan McKenzie told regulators to block the deal. She said the record showed the buyers plan to do what private equity always does — “pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

With the 30% federal home solar tax credit set to expire at the end of this year, homeowners everywhere are showing mixed reactions. And, in the case of nearly 30% of our readers, a sense of urgency. Nearly four in ten (38.7%) of our solar survey responders said that they were “deeply concerned” about the credit ending, and moving up plans to install a home solar system before the credit is gone.

That response suggests the industry could see a meaningful surge of demand in the final quarter of the year as households look to lock in tax benefits while they still can.

Another 19.2% said they were aware of the credit, but it wasn’t a major factor in their solar plans one way or the other (if you’re curious, I fall into this second category).

Meanwhile, 16.4% of Electrek survey respondents admitted they had no idea there even was a 30% federal solar credit. That fact, while frustrating, serves to highlight the need for better public awareness around both clean energy incentives, and the potential benefits to adding solar power to your home.

Interesting, but does it matter?

That said, it’s important to consider the source here. Electrek readers tend to be more educated in general than the American public at large to begin with (check out our Partner Program page for some of that demographic data), and you’re certainly more educated and informed about things like EVs, home battery backups, and – of course – solar power.

The general public? The people who don’t read Electrek, don’t follow the cimate tech blogs, and generally have no idea what’s going on in the world of clean energy incentives? Getting rid of a tax credit they don’t even know exists may not move the market one way or the other. And, frankly, I don’t think it will.

What do you guys think? Is the march towards more universal home solar system deployment already too far along to stop, or do you think eliminating the tax incentive will turn off enough people to do the industry in for good? Head to the comments and let us know.

Kevin Rabinovitch, global VP of sustainability at Mars, said the agreement ""lets us bring demand for all the electricity used in our value chain to the clean energy market in a highly efficient manner.""","As demand for energy soars around the world, so does the pollution that comes from the burning of coal, oil, and gas. That is why it is so refreshing to hear large corporations are actively trying to use clean energy sources to reduce their carbon footprint.

With that in mind, the food and snack corporation Mars just signed a massive new energy deal with a company called Enel North America. According to Electrek, Mars has agreed to purchase all the energy produced by three large Texas solar farms. The amount of energy is equivalent to the power necessary for 150,000 homes annually.

Large-scale community solar farm projects like the ones involved in this Mars deal are great for everyone because they lower energy costs, provide more stability for the electrical grid, promote energy independence, and create new jobs. And they help provide a cleaner and cooler future for all because solar energy does not release toxic emissions into the atmosphere.

And this is only the latest good news on the solar front. A massive solar farm in Illinois called Double Black Diamond is set to provide 800 megawatts to the grid. And another large solar project developed in California will be able to power up to 14,000 homes.

Of course, for individuals, installing solar panels is the ultimate home energy hack because it can bring your monthly energy costs to at or near $0. And it is now easier than ever thanks to a company called EnergySage. It offers a free online tool that allows potential customers to compare quotes from vetted contractors. It can also save customers up to $10,000.

Another way for individuals to save energy and money with their solar panels is to install appliances such as heat pumps. Mitsubishi can help customers find the right, affordable heat pump to fit their needs.

The leaders behind the massive agreement were understandably excited about the future it offers.

Michele Di Murro, CEO of Enel North America, said, per Electrek, ""Through these agreements, we're adding clean capacity to the Texas grid while supporting a leading manufacturer's sustainability goals.""

Waaree Energies affirmed its US investment plans, including the Texas facility expansion and exploring US solar cell manufacturing, are unaffected by a US tariff evasion investigation. The company is cooperating with customs officials, asserting no material duty exposure or operational disruption. Waaree views the US as a strategic, high-growth market for continued clean energy investment.

A US investigation into potential solar tariff evasion will not impact Waaree Energies' investment plans, including the expansion of its Texas facility and exploration of setting up a solar cell manufacturing capability in the high-growth, strategic US market, the company said Sunday.

Waaree is one of the largest vertically integrated companies in the manufacturing of solar modules, which convert sun rays into electricity. It has an operational capacity of 13.3 GW in India.

It commenced operations at its US solar module manufacturing plant in Houston, Texas, in January this year with an initial installed capacity of 1.6 GW. The Texas facility is being scaled to 3.2GW by FY27.

US customs officials last week launched an investigation into whether Waaree bypassed tariffs on Chinese-made solar cells and panels by falsely labelling them as manufactured in India.

""The investigation has no impact on our investment plans. The Texas plant expansion from 1.6 GW to 3.2 GW is already underway,"" the firm said.

Live Events

""Our recent acquisition of US-based Meyer Burger assets further strengthens its long-term manufacturing footprint in the country. The United States is a high-growth, strategic market for Waaree, and it continues to invest in local jobs, technology, and capacity.""

""Waaree Energies will continue to operate with integrity, and we reaffirm our strong commitment to the US market - both as a clean energy partner and as a growing localised manufacturer,"" the firm said in a written Q&A to PTI.

The firm said it is providing all required information to the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in its ongoing inquiry.

""As a responsible corporate citizen, we have consistently complied with all applicable local laws and regulations,"" the company said.

""Our internal assessment indicates no material duty exposure, and we continue to engage transparently with CBP throughout this process.""

Importantly, there has been no operational disruption, and the US manufacturing operations and customer deliveries continue as planned.

""Based on our current assessment, we do not expect any material financial impact from this inquiry.""

The demand in the US solar market, it said, remains extremely strong and is growing rapidly, making it one of the most lucrative clean-energy markets globally.

""Our diversified global supply chain and our domestic US production provide natural insulation from geopolitical or policy shocks, ensuring business continuity.""

Asked about manufacturing solar cells as well in the US, Waaree said backward integration was a key strategic priority for the company.

""In India, we have already built significant solar cell manufacturing capability and are exploring similar opportunities in the United States,"" it said.

""We are evaluating options for US cell manufacturing in line with policy incentives and market demand, and any future investments will support our goal of becoming a holistic clean-energy transition company serving US customers end-to-end.""

Waaree Solar Americas primarily serves the US market through its Texas manufacturing facility, which currently operates at 1.6 GW with expansion underway to 3.2 GW, thereby reducing reliance on imports.

""Where imports are required, we maintain a diversified supply chain across multiple countries to avoid any single-source dependence, and all such imports strictly comply with US trade regulations, including AD/CVD rules and rules of origin. Our long-term strategy is to progressively localise more production within the United States to further reduce import needs, and detailed country-wise volumes are provided to regulators as required, though not disclosed publicly for competitive reasons.""

He said one of the programs that will expire on Dec. 31 incentivizes residents to invest in high-efficiency appliances.
Carsner said another program, which provides tax credits for electric vehicle purchases, will expire at the end of September.
Q: How can Iowans take advantage of these programs before they go away at the end of the year?
Q: With your role with the Iowa City Sierra Club, I'm curious, what has the Iowa City community said about this?","In his role with the Sierra Club’s Iowa City Chapter, Tom Carsner has spent a lot of time in recent months thinking and talking about the ways the federal government incentivizes energy efficiency.

Tax incentives intended to encourage Americans to invest in energy-efficient appliances and renewable energy, like solar panels, were part of the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022, under the Biden administration.

But the Big Beautiful Bill Act — which Carsner refers to as the “Big Bad Bill” — that was passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump this summer, rolls back those incentives. Many are scheduled to end Dec. 31.

As political director for the Sierra Club’s Iowa City Chapter — a position he’s held for eight years — Carsner has followed the legislation that will end these incentives. He said one of the programs that will expire on Dec. 31 incentivizes residents to invest in high-efficiency appliances.

The Home Electrification and Appliance Rebate program, or “HEARS,” provides rebates to low- and moderate-income households when they purchase high-efficiency electric appliances like heat pumps, electric stoves and dryers, as well as for electrical upgrades to their homes, like installing solar panels.

Carsner said another program, which provides tax credits for electric vehicle purchases, will expire at the end of September.

The Gazette spoke with Carsner about these programs and how they might affect the state and its residents.

This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.

Q: How can Iowans take advantage of these programs before they go away at the end of the year?

A: It's just contacting your appliance dealer, whether it is for a heat pump or water heater, Iowans should contact their dealers directly. That hasn't changed; you have to contact a registered or qualified contractor to make an appointment and get set up with them.

Some things with solar panels are tightening up partially because you don't know what the weather is going to be. It may be slower in November and December to put them in since it is outdoors. But these other ones like an electric stove, a heat pump, water heater, and other things like that can be done year-round since it's not really weather dependent.

Q: What makes this program important, and what will the loss look like for Iowans when this program does cease at the end of the year?

A: Every wind turbine you see in the State of Iowa has been subsidized by taxpayers, to some degree, because those are all built with tax rebates. The problem is that it will make all of those attempts to build the utility-scale wind farms or solar farms that much more expensive for the companies putting them up. If it's more expensive for them, it's going to be more expensive for the utility as well. So, electric rates are bound to go up as well on that large utility scale basis.

There are all sorts of estimates that show many of the rebates are in the 30 percent range. It's not necessarily a one-to-one ratio but there's no doubt that having those large-scale rebate programs taken away, it will increase electric costs across the board for all people who use utilities, which is pretty much everybody.

Q: From your perspective, what makes programs like this such a partisan issue?

A: It's the fossil fuel industry. Many Republicans in today's world rely on fossil fuel campaign financing and when they vote to take away subsidies for non-fossil fuel or renewable energy type of programs, they are doing the bidding of the fossil fuel industry, so they get more campaign contributions. That's the real problem.

Now, they also turn a blind-eye to the fact that fossil fuel industries have, for a century, gotten tax credits, and tax favoritism through the Internal Revenue Service, but they conveniently ignore that. It's quite disingenuous for Republicans to vote for the “Big Bad Bill” that just passed, and then to still claim they support renewable energy. The two just don't go together.

Q: What will the direct impact of this look like for Iowa? Will it be more significant in Iowa, rather than other Midwest states or across the country?

A: Iowa is already producing over 60 percent from clean, renewable energy, which is mostly wind, with a little bit of solar. For the consumer, the real problem is that they will end up consuming more gas when it comes to heating and cooling their home, making electricity more expensive for the consumer.

But a secondary issue is every one of these solar panels, heat pumps or water heaters are distributed by a local appliance dealer. When the rebates go away, it's going to drive their sales down to some degree. It's hard to predict how much, but if you think of an appliance store in a medium-sized Iowa town, and it sounds good to be able to get a rebate on an efficient hot water heater, they'll buy it. But if rebates go away, they're going to be less inclined to purchase the new hot water heater that's more electrically efficient.

Q: With your role with the Iowa City Sierra Club, I'm curious, what has the Iowa City community said about this? What have you been hearing from the public?

A: I don't think you'd have to stretch very deep to find a solar panel company who would tell you there's a rush right now to finish projects before the end of the year. But I'm not sure how many people truly understand that this was part of the “Big, Bad Bill” of things going away at the end of the year. People might be surprised by this. When I talked to people about it, some were aware, and some were not.

Q: For those who are not as aware about this issue or this deadline that's coming up, what have you been recommending they do?

A: They should call their dealer as soon as they can because, especially solar panel installation, it is getting increasingly busy as the end of the year comes. Appliance dealers are probably the same. It's just a race to get a project started or get a contract signed at least by Dec. 31.

Q: Looking forward, are there opportunities for programs like these to come back for Iowans to use?

A: There's still uncertainty. There is a state version of some of these programs. The money is less, but there's still $120 million for a state-run program, where you can get it deducted immediately from your bill. I don't know how much it was or wasn't affected by the “Big, Bad Bill,” but it would soften the blow. It wasn't created to be a replacement by any means, but it would soften the blow somewhat.

The French state wants much more offshore wind by 2035 and 2050.","France awarded the Centre Manche 2 offshore wind tender to a team led by TotalEnergies with RWE. The wind farm will have 1.5 GW of capacity and sit more than 40 km off the Normandy coast. It’s now the country’s largest renewable energy project.

The power price is fixed by the tender at €66/MWh. Expected output is about 6 TWh each year, enough for over one million homes. The plan calls for a final investment decision by early 2029 and first power in 2033.

RWE Signals an Exit

RWE has said it wishes to exit the consortium after a strategic review. This step needs approval from French authorities. TotalEnergies plans to proceed as operator and may invite a new partner later.

Why This Project Matters

Scale: 1.5 GW, France’s largest offshore wind award so far.

Location: More than 40 km off Normandy, near Calvados.

Output: ~6 TWh/year, powering 1M+ homes.

Price: €66/MWh as set by the tender.

Timeline: FID by early 2029; generation from 2033.

Money, Jobs, and Local Plans

TotalEnergies says the project will require about €4.5 billion in investment. It’s the company’s largest investment in France in three decades. The firm plans to favor European suppliers, especially for turbines and cables.

Construction could employ up to 2,500 people over three years. Local factories and ports should see steady work. The operator also plans crowdfunding so residents and authorities can invest.

Community and nature funds are part of the plan. There’s a €10 million territorial fund for training, education, and culture. Another €45 million is for environmental measures, and €15 million for a biodiversity fund in Normandy.

At a Glance: Key Facts

Company View and Strategy

TotalEnergies’ CEO called the award a major step in the firm’s shift to low-carbon power. The company says the project proves its long-term commitment to France. It also points to competitive prices for French customers after startup.

The French state wants much more offshore wind by 2035 and 2050. This award supports that plan and sends a clear signal to suppliers. The project also helps build a skilled workforce in Normandy.

What Comes Next

The operator will continue studies, permits, and supplier work. Grid timing is linked to the national plan, so design must stay aligned. A new partner could join once approvals are in place.

There’s still risk, of course. Offshore wind faces supply chain tightness and changing rates. But early planning, local sourcing, and fixed pricing can help. The project’s funds for nature and training also build community trust.

Quick List: What Readers Should Know

Biggest yet: Centre Manche 2 is France’s largest renewable project.

Set price: Power will sell at €66/MWh under the tender.

Local stake: Crowdfunding and a €10 million territorial fund are planned.

Nature focus: €45 million for environmental steps and €15 million for biodiversity.

Silver is important to solar energy photovoltaic systems to convert sunlight into electricity. Platinum is a key to autocatalysts used to recycle other precious metals and in automobile catalytic converters which help sustain clean air.

The Chinese have pledged to cut emissions, reduce greenhouse gases, increase solar energy use, and move to alternative fuel vehicles. These new moves toward environmental protection are seen as a positive sign for precious metals futures. Analysts hope that U.S. policy will match the Chinese efforts.

Fall Harvest Has Bean Stressful So Far

With China looking to Brazil and now Argentina for their soybeans, American farmers continue to look for ways to profit from their large bean harvests. With this year’s U.S. crop half harvested,Taiwan has signed a $6.4 billion deal with Indiana to buy beans and corn to ease some of the farm pain. Last year, China spent $12.6 billion on U.S. beans, but the number stands at zero dollars as of now due to tariff disagreements between the two countries. China has basically admitted to withholding purchases of U.S. soybeans as a tariff protest.Hopes for a tariff agreement were high after a recent U.S. — China TikTok accord, but no further deals come forth.

The American Soybean Association has called upon the current administration to resolve the tariff issues. Meanwhile the government will use other tariff dollars to ease losses sustained by the bean farmers. However, farmers are looking for long term solutions that will allow them to earn their incomes directly from crops. With bumper crops and few options to sell their harvest, farmers are running short on storage facilities to hold the corn and beans as bulls hope the Chinese will come to American markets by winter.

Late Week Copper Droppers

Global demand had kept copper prices up through Thursday. However, a decision to exempt the 50% tariff on the raw material, fears of recession, and a slowdown of Chinese factory work caused a sell-off late in the week. Copper’s use in electric vehicles as well as in AI infrastructure adds to its versatility.

Each edition will feature high-level keynotes, policy roundtables, thought-provoking panels, and a dynamic exhibition floor showcasing next-gen climate and energy solutions.

The series kicked off with the CARE Dialogues on 24 June 2025 — an invite-only session in Dubai under the theme ""Green Finance and Beyond: Driving ESG Across Sectors."" Powered by Emtribe, the event convened senior leaders from finance, policy, and technology to explore practical strategies for embedding ESG into business models.

""As a partner of CARE, we're proud to back a platform that focuses on what really matters — getting the right people in the room and driving honest, outcome-focused conversations,"" said Mohammed Saleem, Founder of Emtribe. ""There's a lot of talk in this space. CARE stands out by pushing for action that's practical, collaborative, and needed.""

Regional Energy Transformation

Across the MENA region, renewable energy adoption is accelerating. Installed solar capacity reached 24 GWAC in 2024 — a 25% year-on-year increase, with projections indicating a surge past 180 GW by 2030. Over the next five years, MENA is set to add 62 GW of new renewable capacity, with countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt investing heavily in solar, wind, and green hydrogen. Expanding renewable energy to 30% of the power mix could create up to 1.2 million jobs by 2050.

In Saudi Arabia, the energy transition is a cornerstone of Vision 2030, with over $266 billion committed to renewable energy and sustainable development. The Kingdom aims to achieve 50% renewable electricity by 2030, powered by giga-projects like NEOM, expansive solar parks, and pioneering green hydrogen initiatives. CARE KSA will unite innovators and stakeholders to accelerate projects, finance mechanisms, and climate-tech solutions aligned with this bold vision.

We’re going to get your energy prices down by 50%,” Trump repeated in Pennsylvania just a few days later.
Over nine months into his second presidency, there is no sign that electricity prices will be lower anytime soon.
In fact, electricity prices have only risen, outpacing the rate of broader inflation.
For PJM Interconnection alone, wholesale electricity costs are set to jump by 22%.","Simultaneously, however, the Trump administration has stymied the development of solar and wind — some of the fastest energy sources to connect to the grid — and has yet to implement the reforms necessary to upgrade transmission to allow new power sources to supply homes, factories, and more.

Meanwhile, energy demand is only expected to grow.

Trump’s promise

Throughout his campaign, Trump vowed to cut the cost of energy and electricity for consumers dramatically.

“Under my administration, we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months, at a maximum 18 months,” he said during an August campaign rally in North Carolina.

“We’re going to get your energy prices down. We’re going to get your energy prices down by 50%,” Trump repeated in Pennsylvania just a few days later.

Over nine months into his second presidency, there is no sign that electricity prices will be lower anytime soon. In fact, electricity prices have only risen, outpacing the rate of broader inflation.

In the latest Consumer Price Index report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, electricity prices rose by 6.2% for the year ending in August. This is more than double the rate of inflation, which increased slightly to 2.9% for the year.

Brendan Pierpont, director of electricity modeling at climate and energy research firm Energy Innovation, told the Washington Examiner that this has resulted in some households spending 10% or more on their utility bills compared to this time last year.

While officials like Energy Secretary Chris Wright have affirmed the administration still hopes to bring these costs down, even some Republicans are not convinced they will be successful.

“I don’t see prices going down, hopefully, the increases can be slowed,” Steve Milloy, a senior legal fellow with the Energy and Environment Legal Institute and former Trump Environmental Protection Agency transition team member, told the Washington Examiner.

Milloy said he was confident that the Trump administration’s policies are still addressing the energy demand in the right way by focusing on extending coal and building out more natural gas. Like Trump, Milloy has blamed higher prices on the accelerated integration of renewables such as wind and solar.

“The system has been loaded up with all this green crap,” Milloy said. “Prices have been going up for some time because of all the green stuff. And you know … prices would have continued to — would have exploded with the demand and the failure of green to keep track of it to supply the power.”

What is driving higher prices?

The Trump administration has increasingly blamed renewable energy efforts for higher prices, but evidence suggests that the underlying cause of higher electricity prices is not that simple.

There are several factors driving costs, including the replacement and maintenance of transmission lines and their distribution infrastructure, Pierpont said. Utilities also face increased wildfire risk and more extreme weather, which require them to spend more money on risk mitigation. Plus, older legacy generation plants are experiencing rising costs related to maintenance and operation, he said.

“We at Energy Innovation took a look at the coal fleet in the U.S., and between 2021 and 2024, the average coal plant costs rose by 28%, outpacing the rate of inflation,” Pierpont said.

The growth in artificial intelligence and data centers, which are highly energy-intensive, has been linked to the rising energy demand. The Center for Strategic and International Studies forecasts that by 2030, AI data centers in the United States will consume nearly 84 gigawatts, compared to only 4 gigawatts consumed by data centers last year.

Grid operators have moved to significantly increase their capacity prices due to the growing need for power. For PJM Interconnection alone, wholesale electricity costs are set to jump by 22%. When the rates take effect in the summer of 2026, consumers in the PJM region are expected to see a 1.5% to 5% increase in energy bills.

That’s not to say renewable energy doesn’t play a role.

As many analysts point to the need for additional transmission infrastructure, critics have blasted utilities for failing to plan necessary upgrades and grid expansions properly.

Republicans have often accused utilities of prioritizing building new green energy projects instead of making these upgrades while removing traditional baseload energy, like coal, from the grid.

As these renewable projects have integrated more slowly into the grid than demand calls for, some suggest that this has forced grid operators and utilities to raise their prices.

“They don’t make any money from keeping a coal plant or an old coal plant or an old gas plant,” Milloy said. “They make money from a new wind farm or a new solar farm. So it’s that sort of corruption that has led to where we are now, which is, for electricity, skyrocketing prices.”

Who is to blame?

The Trump administration has repeatedly pointed fingers at former President Joe Biden and his administration for the electricity price hikes, blaming their accelerated phase-out of fossil fuels and focus on renewables.

At the same time, some energy experts dispute the idea that Trump has done much to lower costs.

“Whatever he promised, there’s no action in the direction of reducing electricity prices,” James Sweeney, emeritus professor of management science and engineering at Stanford University, told the Washington Examiner.

Sweeney argued that the administration’s efforts to boost fossil fuels, limit renewable energy, and impose sweeping tariffs have not contributed to lowering power costs.

He said that wind and solar power have been the primary sources of new electricity generation in recent years, were previously supported by federal subsidies, and often offered cheaper energy than traditional sources. However, he noted that the administration’s actions to restrict energy development have led utilities to pay more for green energy, which is now reflected in higher electricity prices.

Additionally, Trump’s tariffs on materials such as steel and aluminum, key components in energy infrastructure, have increased construction costs for various energy projects.

“I have not seen anything he’s done that would reduce electricity prices,” Sweeney said.

Frank Macchiarola, chief advocacy officer of American Clean Power, also told the Washington Examiner that it is important to examine the Biden administration’s policies aimed at restricting oil production.

Macchiarola explained that the Trump administration appears to be pursuing a similar strategy with renewable energy sources, the fastest-growing source of electricity in the U.S.

“It would only be natural that energy prices would increase at a time when the American consumer is facing inflation concerns about the economy, and this has exacerbated it,” he said.

“This is an administration that has really kind of stressed the importance of American energy dominance, and what we’ve seen from President Trump is American energy weakness,” Macchiarola added.

As electricity prices rise, Democrats have placed the blame on Republicans.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said earlier this week on a conference call at Climate Week that “Trump and Republicans are doing what the American people hate most, and that is raise costs.”

“You may remember the biggest issue they had against Biden is raising costs,” Schumer said. “They’re making it much worse, and the American people are realizing it.”

Where should the focus be?

Still, some experts caution against placing any blame too quickly, as the energy system is highly complex.

David Hill, executive vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Energy Program, explained that the federal government has limited influence over power prices and that the electricity system is “very complicated.”

“I would say to the policymakers who are trying to point fingers of blame: There’s a lot of blame to go around,” he told the Washington Examiner. “Instead of trying to figure out how the finger of blame can be pointed, it’s, ‘How do we actually address this going forward?'”

To curb electricity price hikes and meet growing energy demands, Hill said the U.S. needs to focus on utilizing energy from all sources and reform permitting to accelerate the construction of transmission infrastructure and new generation.

Passing permitting reform has become a top priority for both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, with discussions currently revolving around reforming lengthy environmental reviews.

Earlier this month, the House also passed legislation that would expedite the interconnection process for dispatchable and baseload energy projects, allowing traditional power sources to connect to the grid more quickly. This bill, known as the Guaranteeing Reliability through the Interconnection of Dispatchable Power Act, passed with bipartisan support and is now with the Senate for consideration.

ELECTRICITY PRICES ROSE FURTHER IN AUGUST AS TRUMP BLAMES RENEWABLES

Hill said the administration’s emphasis on energy reliability is essential, adding that Americans want an energy system that is “reliable, affordable, and clean.” This puts the country in a unique position to move forward in a bipartisan manner, he said.

“The fact that affordability and reliability are concerns right now do allow for some bipartisan agreement on some important changes that need to be made that help us meet the challenge,” he said.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-collage-lxulk5m1r-1758916796616-e1758922777303.jpg?1758908372&resize=1024,683",N,,2025-09-28 07:59:25.018773

Opinion: How Western North Carolina can turn Helene disaster into opportunity Opinion: Who will care for our public lands?","As we mark the one-year anniversary of Helene, the images of floodwaters tearing through Western North Carolina are still vivid. Lives, homes, and livelihoods were lost. Roads and trails were washed out. Families were displaced. Yet what stays with me most is not only the devastation. It is what came after: the unmistakable truth that we are in this together.

Storms like Helene don’t just wash away roads and homes. They compromise every layer of community life: infrastructure, from bridges to water systems; economy, as businesses close and jobs disappear; health and safety, when hospitals are stretched and families face trauma; and communications, as power outages and downed networks leave people cut off. In those first days, it felt like the very systems we depend on had collapsed.

First responders worked around the clock to save lives. Nonprofits mobilized food, clothing, and emergency support. Conservation groups began the hard work of restoring rivers and repairing damaged landscapes. Volunteers cleared debris, ran supply lines, and checked on neighbors. Local governments stepped up with the tools they had. Every sector of our community did its part. The work was not perfect, but it was shared.

I saw a sign written by a child offering some of their stuffed animals to children who had lost theirs in the flood. That simple act of kindness said as much about recovery as any truckload of supplies. I remember churches opening as shelters and staging grounds. Volunteers carried food, water, and essentials into areas where roads had washed out, moving them by foot, mule, and ATV. That is what recovery looked like in real life.

Meanwhile, so much of the daily news seems determined to divide us. We are told that we are red or blue, rural or urban, us or them. But Helene told us a different story. When the waters rose, those lines blurred. Neighbors showed up with bottled water, hot meals, chainsaws, or simply their presence. Not once did anyone offering aid ask me about my politics, what god I worshiped, or whether I was a citizen. What mattered was that someone needed help, and someone else was there to give it. Volunteers came from around the country to stand with us. That too is community — people answering the call to care for one another in a time of need.

Helene also changed how we prepare. I still keep cases of bottled water and MREs stacked in my home. Others have stocked generators, radios, or emergency kits. But the most important preparation is not physical. It is relational. The real safety net is not only what is stored in our basements, but the strength of the connections we build with one another.

The question now is whether we will carry those lessons forward. We do not need to wait for another storm to practice the kind of community that got us through Helene. I joined volunteers for a day in Marshall as the town dug itself out. The effort was strategically organized, yet 100 percent citizen-led. That kind of initiative is what keeps communities alive. We can support the local businesses that reopen against the odds. We can strengthen the nonprofits that mobilize in every crisis, from food banks to conservation groups. And we can stay engaged with local governments that keep essential services running when everything feels uncertain. These choices matter. They strengthen the networks that will hold us together when the next storm comes, whatever form it takes.

In that sense, Helene is a metaphor for our larger moment. We are living through an era of change, uncertainty, and anxiety from climate disaster to economic strain to bitter polarization. The forces around us may try to pit neighbor against neighbor, but when the storms come, whether literal or figurative, we only have one another.

That may sound romantic to some. But the truth is practical: communities survive because we need one another. Alone, no household could have faced what Helene brought. Together, we found not just resilience, but abundance in compassion, shared labor, and the will to keep going.

At the end of the day, we do not just share roads and rivers. We share a future. And if Helene taught us anything, it is this: we are in this together, and we will need to lean into one another even more than before. Institutions may falter, but Helene showed us who we truly are: neighbors helping neighbors. That is the America I want to live in.

Ten years after Volvo Cars launched its first North American manufacturing plant in Ridgeville, executives are working on an aggressive timeline to make the most of its $1.3 billion investment that has struggled to meet capacity.

The plant has an annual output of about 26,000 cars. But with the Sept. 23 announcement of an all-new hybrid vehicle to be made in the U.S. in 2030, the production line should finally hit the 150,000 vehicles a year it was built for.

Tariffs have accelerated the increased production plans,

CEO Håkan Samuelsson said while visiting stateside for Volvo’s 10-year anniversary celebration.

“To have faster deliveries, we need to build where we sell,” he said. Currently, cars imported to the U.S. from Sweden and the European Union face 15 percent tariffs.

By 2030, the original equipment manufacturer will add a still-unnamed hybrid vehicle to production — the fourth car on its Ridgeville line. The boost is expected to double its workforce to 4,000.

While few specifics have been confirmed about the hybrid under design in Sweden, Volvo has held clinics with American consumers to determine the present market needs. Samuelsson confirmed it will be a second-generation hybrid and “more of an electric car with a backup engine.”

First-generations are more derivative of a combustion car, he said, but the new vehicle will have “very fast acceleration,” be agile and quiet, and have an onboard charger.

“Many places in America are still not ready for full electric cars,” Samuelsson said. “Then this will be a very good solution.”

The future hybrid will accommodate the specific demands of the U.S. market, with its larger size with “room for big families and luggage and everything they bring along,” specific colors and even how it's marketed, Samuelsson said.

It will join Ridgeville's existing lineup that includes the fully electric Volvo EX90 SUV and the Polestar 3. In July, the company announced it would bring production of its XC60 to South Carolina from its plant in Gothenburg, Sweden. The midsize SUV is one of the manufacturer’s key U.S. products and is set to roll off the local assembly line in 2026.

Volvo sold more 27,000 XC60s in the U.S. between January and August 2025, an increase of almost 20 percent year over year.

With U.S. production, the vehicle should bring the Ridgeville plant to about 50-60 percent capacity, while the new hybrid will take it to 100 percent within the next decade, said Francesca Gamboni, chief industrial operations officer of Volvo Cars.

“This plant should be used for production for the American customers, which means bringing the cars that are closer, that are more adapt, suited for the American customers, and then build them locally,” Gamboni said.

She joined Samuelsson at the Ridgeville event, along with Luis Rezende, president of Americas for Volvo; David Stenstrom, vice president of manufacturing for the U.S.; and Sweden’s ambassador to the U.S., Urban Ahlin. Gov. Henry McMaster and U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, R-Charleston, also attended.

While Volvo’s goal has been to go fully electric by 2040, the U.S. still lacks infrastructure, incentives and affordable options that encourage people to buy EVs.

The Biden administration had previously set ambitious goals for automakers to electrify more of their fleets and reduce emissions by 2032, but current leaders have pushed back of late.

Aiko Toyoda, the chairman for Toyota and former CEO for 13 years, told Forbes last year that customers, not regulations or politics, should drive production and that battery electric vehicles will most likely never gain majority market sales, “no matter how much progress the BEVs make.”

President Donald Trump has further voiced skepticism of EVs, including at a 2023 rally when he criticized, “They don’t go far. They cost a fortune.”

Ramping up more jobs in Ridgeville

With increased production in the U.S., Gamboni wants to localize the majority of Volvo’s suppliers to make the plant “more resilient” and “quicker to respond to the demand.”

“We have done a good job with it on the EX90, I think so far,” she said. “We have 60 percent … of suppliers who are in the Americas and 11 percent within the state of South Carolina.”

With the expansion news Sept. 23, Volvo’s stock trading in Sweden jumped over 3 percent.

Volvo also operates three auto production plants in China, as well as one in Belgium.

Here in South Carolina, the carmaker employs a staff of 2,000 with plans to grow to 4,000 with the increased output of the XC90 and the on-deck hybrid.

Stenstrom said ReadySC, the workforce training arm of Trident Technical College, has been instrumental to helping fill those roles in the last 10 years and the company will look to them again.

Kelly Steinhilper, vice president of communications with the SC Technical College System, said as of now, they haven’t been asked to support the future ramp-up.

Starting salaries begin at $23 an hour with raises every six months based on hourly output, staff said.

Gamboni reiterated the jobs would not be automated. Currently, any robotics are “complementary” to support human output and make jobs more efficient.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/8e/08ebb4f0-0435-4e20-8231-af6c8fe25096/68d2f9c090f90.image.jpg?crop=1768%2C928%2C0%2C0&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-28 10:59:55.118236

The study, titled “Reshoring Solar Module Manufacturing to Europe,” provides a detailed cost gap analysis and policy impact simulation, offering strategies to accelerate domestic solar manufacturing while building a resilient and innovative solar industry.

Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO of SolarPower Europe, emphasized that Europe has the potential to deliver up to 30 gigawatts of solar manufacturing by 2030, creating thousands of local jobs and retaining economic value within the region. She stressed the need for urgent action from the EU and its Member States, warning that without targeted policy interventions, Europe risks losing remaining industrial and technological capabilities in solar manufacturing.

The report shows that producing a solar module in Europe using EU-made solar cells currently costs around 10.3 €ct/Wp more than producing the same module in China. This cost difference is driven by higher expenses in equipment, building and facilities, labor, and materials, with labor costs alone being 280 percent higher in Europe. For utility-scale solar installations, the total cost amounts to approximately 60.8 €ct/Wp for European-made modules, compared to 50.0 €ct/Wp for Chinese modules, resulting in a Levelised Cost of Electricity that is 14.5 percent higher for European production.

Despite these higher costs, European-made modules already fall within the 15 percent additional cost limit set under the Net-Zero Industry Act auction rules, suggesting that competitiveness is achievable with the right support. However, the report also identifies a cost difference of 2.2 to 5.8 €ct/Wp between NZIA-compliant EU-made and non-EU-made modules. While the NZIA’s resilience criteria can help diversify module supply chains and boost imports from other regions, reshoring production to Europe will require additional policy measures.

The analysis suggests that combining CAPEX and OPEX support for both manufacturers and project developers, along with output-based incentives similar to those used in the United States and India, could reduce the cost gap to below 10 percent, especially if solar factories reach 3–5 GW capacity. The report estimates that achieving the 30 GW target for European solar manufacturing by 2030 would require annual industry support of between €1.4 billion and €5.2 billion. Up to 39 percent of these costs could be recovered through macroeconomic benefits, including the creation of 2,700 jobs and up to €66.4 million in annual tax and social contributions per gigawatt-peak of installed capacity.

The report recommends establishing an EU-level output-based support scheme for solar manufacturing, combining grants, loans, and de-risking instruments to cover both CAPEX and OPEX. It also calls for the implementation of NZIA policy schemes across Member States, including “Made-in-EU” bonus points in rooftop support programs and public procurement initiatives. The Net-Zero Industry Act, adopted in June 2024 with secondary legislation in May 2025, sets out rules for Member States on incorporating non-price criteria in renewable energy auctions. Under the act, at least 30 percent of auctioned volumes, or six gigawatts annually, must apply non-price criteria, which account for 15 to 30 percent of overall evaluation metrics.

Resilience under Article 26 is defined as sourcing from non-dominant suppliers, and Member States are required to implement these provisions from January 2026 onward. The act provides a historic opportunity for reshoring clean technology manufacturing in Europe, but its success will depend on how effectively Member States apply the non-price criteria in their auctions. The report concludes that with targeted policy support, Europe can successfully build a competitive solar manufacturing sector, enhance supply chain resilience, retain economic value domestically, and contribute significantly to the region’s broader climate and energy transition goals.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/4-3.png,N,,2025-09-28 05:58:49.338055

But at salvage auctions across Australia, a new type of buyer is emerging, and they are interested in one thing: the high-powered batteries inside electric vehicles.

The demand for secondhand EV batteries is surging, with buyers repurposing them for everything from solar storage units to off-grid energy systems that can replace diesel generators.

Brendon Green, the general manager of automotive solutions at Pickles, says the auction house is selling about 100 salvaged EVs every month, and interest is surging.

“It’s only very early days, but they are certainly in strong demand,” says Green.

“We’ve got this new element of second-life battery startups. That industry really didn’t exist 18 months ago.”

Battery hunters

Salvage auction houses started regularly seeing salvage EVs in early 2024, most of which were Teslas, the first mass market electric vehicle on Australian roads.

Battery hunters are now also seeing alternatives, such as BYDs and MGs, in line with the growing number of different makes on the market. Many of the wrecked vehicles are two-to-three years old, and include a mix of complete write-offs and those that are repairable.

The appeal for EV batteries is obvious, given they are about five times as powerful as a typical home energy storage unit.

Andrew Chadwick, a lithium battery repair specialist, says even ageing EV batteries have plenty of life in them for other purposes.

“The output requirements for a solar battery are a lot less than what you need for an electric vehicle,” says Chadwick, from Second Life Battery Sales.

“Even if they are no longer good for an electric vehicle, with a little finessing, they’re perfect for a solar system.”

Consider an EV battery that is down to 70% capacity. While this will considerably reduce the range of the vehicle, making the car undesirable, it still holds plenty of charge for less-intensive uses.

You could even put a trailer load of second-hand EV batteries together, and power an entire music festival.

A music event in Queensland’s Sunshine Coast was postponed in June over council concerns its power usage would disrupt nearby businesses. The punk and indie-alternative festival went ahead in early September, powered by repurposed EV batteries.

“Our trailers powered the whole event for the day, including speakers, food trucks, everything, and had plenty of power left over,” says John Myler, co-founder of MyNu Energy.

“People really like them as an alternative to a diesel generator. If you’ve got sound equipment or food trucks, having a noisy, smelly diesel generator probably isn’t the atmosphere you’re looking for, whereas these batteries are silent, pollution free, and hold huge amounts of power.”

After the event, the trailers were recharged using solar, ready for their next deployment.

Life extension

At Pickles auctions, the demand for EV batteries is evident.

Financial year sales of salvage EVs increased 200% over the prior year, with the wrecked vehicles now boasting much higher price tags than combustion engine cars.

Buyers know that EVs contain some of the world’s most advanced battery technology, ready to be deployed.

About one in 10 new car sales in Australia are battery-powered, with the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 and the BYD Seal and Atto the most popular models in 2024, according to the EV Council.

After a comparably slow roll out in Australia marked by political headwinds, motoring experts believe EV sales will surge as prices become more competitive and charging infrastructure catches up.

Currently, many batteries are shredded, with the material then separated into components ready to be rebuilt into new batteries, with the process often including multiple facilities in different countries.

A repurposed battery can reduce this process, with some second-hand buyers believing they can get about 20 years of usage from them.

Myler says repurposed EV batteries are part of the solution to Australia’s intensifying energy needs.

“We need a huge amount of short term energy storage to help us transition to sustainable energy solutions,” he says.

“As a country, we need every bit of storage we can get our hands on.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ca30e0a113e6b14984e1c8ca49a5919bc681343/338_0_4551_3640/master/4551.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5726f1cd121240f0d12d34d2028cacab",N,,2025-09-28 05:59:08.665348

Leaving the tight-knit community his family had called home for five generations along the Louisiana coast was one of the hardest things Chris Brunet has had to do.

But three years ago, he felt he had no other choice.

The Gulf of Mexico’s swelling waters were gradually consuming Isle de Jean Charles—the narrow strip of land in Terrebonne Parish that has been the homeland for the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians since the 1830s.

“This is where I was awakened to my Native American identity,” Brunet says on a sticky late afternoon in August as he sits in his wheelchair, gazing upon the tattered remains of his family’s island home. “I would want to be here if I had any choice in the world.”

In 2016, Louisiana received $48.3 million in federal Community Development Block Grant money to relocate 37 residents or families of Isle de Jean Charles as climate-charged hurricanes and sea-level rise made the once thriving fishing community uninhabitable. The plan was the first relocation of an entire community that was fully funded by the federal government.

The island used to encompass more than 22,000 acres but has shrunk to about 320 acres due to erosion, land loss caused by severe storms, manmade canals and sea level rise spurred by climate change.

Isle de Jean Charles is a shell of a place once filled with life. The remaining strip is now dotted with the dilapidated homes of those who fled; a few properties are used as recreational camps by their owners.

Brunet says it’s hard to watch his beloved Louisiana coast wash away.

“I never expected that relocation was going to happen in my lifetime,” Brunet said. “Now that I see that it has happened, it’s not a celebration.”

This new chapter for former island residents is no fairy tale. They say their new homes are substandard, with rainwater seeping through doorways, malfunctioning appliances and flooded yards causing costly repairs.

“I just wish they would have given themselves a little bit more time to try to prevent so many of the issues that we had over here,” Brunet said. “Some things that immediately just broke down right away—whether it be electrical, whether it be plumbing, whether it be exterior, interior.”

And ironically, their new community—dubbed New Isle—could literally become an island surrounded by water if predictions of accelerating coastal land loss and inland flooding come to pass.

What was supposed to be a model for how the government could get people out of harm’s way along the country’s steadily eroding coastlines has instead become a cautionary tale for the estimated 2.5 million Americans who could be forced to relocate away from the coast over the next 25 years.

Louisiana is the state projected to have the most land impacted by coastal flooding caused by rising sea levels and severe storms in the United States. But leaders there have rejected a controversial nearly $3 billion plan—paid primarily by BP to compensate for a massive 2010 oil spill—designed to shore up the coastline.

And Louisiana has no further plans to help residents and businesses move away as rising water, hurricanes, storm surges and flooding eat away at the land underneath them.

In fact, the U.S. Government Accountability Office found the United States has no national strategy for relocating coastal communities from harm’s way—and “limited” funds to do so.

Some of that money is being targeted for elimination by the Trump administration, which is seeking to defund the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which has provided $4.5 billion to mitigate harm from natural disasters and climate change. Trump also has cut about 10 percent of the Federal Emergency Management Agency staff, arguing states should be in charge of their own disaster relief.

In Alaska, more than 30 indigenous villages face imminent relocation due to flooding, land erosion, permafrost thaw or combinations of all the above because of climate change. But thus far, only one village, Newtok, has made successful strides in that direction—and even that took nearly two decades and about $60 million in federal funds.

Relocation Causes Rift

Brunet and the other 37 residents living on the island packed up their lives to move to a new community in Gray, Louisiana, 9 miles north of Houma and 40 miles north of their old homes. They are now dealing with substandard housing, and they accuse state leaders of ignoring their input in a rushed attempt to build their new community.

“It made us angry,” said Chief Deme Naquin, the leader of Jean Charles Choctaw Nation. “We thought we were going to have a community and we were going to be able to own and run it as a tribe. Once that (money) was awarded, then we were pretty much pushed away.”

It was Naquin’s uncle who devised the original plan, seeing it as a way to reunite the tribe in a safer community after some had already fled the storm-ravaged island. But after the chief of another tribe, Citizens of the United Houma Nation, learned of the relocation funding, he lobbied for his members living on the island to be included.

The conflict led state officials to determine that any residents still living on Isle de Jean Charles or those whose homes had been disrupted by a 2012 hurricane would be eligible to relocate. That ended the original intent of the relocation and sparked a rift between the Choctaw Nation and the state.

Mathew Sanders was the point person for Louisiana’s Office of Community Development on the relocation. He says island residents had a “significant voice” in the process, but the state had to balance individuals’ goals with those of the tribal leaders.

“One of the things that we heard very early on in the project from the residents was that they didn’t really want either of the tribes to represent their interests,” Sanders said. “We wanted to do what the community was telling us they wanted to do. So, I would push back on the notion from either tribe saying they didn’t have a say.”

But looking back, he acknowledges that Louisiana officials—despite their experience with coastal planning and gauging flood risk—“were not prepared to really take on this type of effort.” In fact, no other state had ever attempted such a move, notes Sanders, who now works on disaster planning at the nonprofit Pew Charitable Trusts.

Marvin McGraw, spokesman for state’s OCD, wouldn’t say whether the agency considers the relocation a success. He said in a prepared statement that honoring the wishes and needs of “Old Isle” residents was the highest priority but “stakeholder wishes did not always align with federal laws and regulations governing the use of funds.”

McGraw pointed out that the Isle de Jean Charles relocation project was designed to relocate the community, not just certain tribal members.

“While most residents are Native American, some identify with one tribe, others with multiple tribes, and some with no tribal affiliation,” he wrote. “Federal guidelines prohibit determining eligibility for housing in the new community based on tribal affiliation.”

Louisiana: Leader in Severe Flood Risk

Louisiana tops an analysis by the nonprofit Climate Central when it comes to the amount of land projected to experience severe coastal flooding—approximately 9,200 square miles—over the next 25 years.

Those projections, released in April, were based on the assumption that the United States will honor its greenhouse gas emission goals. That means the outcome could be worse given the Trump administration’s systematic kneecapping of the climate-focused initiatives of the previous administration.

Louisiana’s coast contains 40 percent of the nation’s wetlands, which serve as an important protective barrier from severe storms.

For the past 20 years, Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) has led the state’s efforts to address its shrinking coastline through a master plan the agency updates every six years. That plan is essentially an unfunded wishlist of projects and science-backed initiatives designed to reduce rapid coastal land loss.

But in July, the agency cancelled the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project, the nearly $3 billion centerpiece of the effort. Officials said the controversial project had become too costly and was stalled by permitting issues and ongoing litigation. The project also faced criticism from Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who said it would negatively impact the coastline instead of helping it.

The project broke ground in 2023. It was designed to reintroduce freshwater and sediment from the Mississippi River into the basin, rebuilding up to 30,000 acres of coastal wetlands over 50 years. It was funded by the $8 billion-plus settlement Louisiana got from oil giant BP following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

Advocates with Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a coalition of national and local conservation groups, said the state was “throwing away more than $618 million” that had already been spent on the project.

Gordon “Gordy” Dove, chair of the CPRA, said the state will honor its “commitment to coastal restoration” by investing in a less costly and smaller sediment diversion project in the same area.

But Emily Guidry Schatzel, spokeswoman for Restore the Mississippi River Delta and the National Wildlife Federation’s Gulf Restoration Program, called that project “outdated.” She noted the CPRA had discarded it from earlier master plans because it “failed to meet science-backed benchmarks” and couldn’t “deliver the scale or speed of land-building required to keep up with the coast’s rapid collapse.”

CPRA acknowledges the need for flood mitigation to protect businesses and people living along the coast, suggesting an organized retreat from the shoreline would be needed. But the agency says any such actions should be left to “community members and their local elected officials.”

Owners Report Leaking Doors, Broken Appliances

The original plan for The New Isle settlement included more than 100 homes, walking trails, a community center, commercial and retail development and other amenities.

“We knew the money that was awarded wasn’t going to be enough,” Naquin said about the relocation project. “But we had opportunities for more funding.”

According to the OCD, the homes in New Isle would be energy efficient, able to withstand 150 mile-per-hour winds, have insulation in the walls, ceiling and under floors; certified energy-efficient appliances and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Brunet grew up loving the marsh, the sound of boats slicing through swamp waters, the quiet stillness and wildlife encounters that came with living along the coast. He knew living in the suburbs would bring unforeseen challenges.

One thing he didn’t anticipate was their new homes breaking down.

Brunet’s neighbor, Kristi Naquin, says the handles on her front door leak from rainwater. During strong downpours and hurricanes, they put down towels to keep the water out. The shower also leaks onto the floor, she said. And the dishwasher and air conditioner have malfunctioned.

And Naquin says it feels like the house is leaning and there’s no insulation. She and her husband, Simon, Chief Deme Naquin’s brother, have had to pay for repairs.

“I’m honestly pissed,” Naquin said. “We should not have this many complaints. We should not have this many problems. It should have been (built) better than what it was.”

She added: “To come to a house that is falling apart, and we got no help, no help at all. They just washed their hands of us.”

Sanders had already left his position with the Louisiana development agency by the time construction began. But he says there was a sense of urgency to get New Isle developed because the state had a deadline of 2021 to use the federal money or risk losing it.

“You know, that’s a very short timeline to build out a 500-acre development,” he said, noting the COVID-19 pandemic slowed construction. “I mean, that’s almost impossible.”

In response to the complaints about the quality of the homes in New Isle, McGraw says all items that were under warranty were timely handled by the building contractors. After the warranty period on items had expired, he said, “responsibility for repairs shifted to the residents.”

Community-Driven Relocation Touted

University of New Orleans urban planning Professor Marla Nelson and Traci Birch, director of the Coastal Ecosystem Design Studio at Louisiana State University, recently wrote about the pitfalls of relocation initiatives in that state. The best approach, they say, is to deeply involve the people who need to move away from the coast.

“It’s about the individuals and communities coming to the decision that, ‘Hey, you know, this isn’t viable to live here anymore,’ and what can be done to help expand people’s options,” Nelson said. “How do we empower individuals and communities who want to move, or need to move, to move?”

Renia Ehrenfeucht, professor of community and regional planning at the University of New Mexico, was a co-author on the piece. In 2018 and 2019, the three interviewed nearly 60 former residents who lived on the Louisiana coast and more than two dozen coastal planning professionals to understand the factors contributing to household decisions about relocating or adapting to sea level rise.

They concluded that even though residents living along the Gulf Coast recognized the need to relocate, the loss of historical ties, family bonds and cultural connections made them hesitant to leave. Local elected officials perceived the loss of tax revenue from property buyouts as “politically unacceptable.” And without funding or policies to relocate entire communities, many people decided to “focus on today’s problems” instead of the “problems of the future.”

Although Louisiana officials have no specific relocation plans for coastal residents, they have developed strategies, dubbed Louisiana’s Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments (LA SAFE), for moving away from the shifting shoreline:

Unless there is a “clear and present risk to life,” all relocation initiatives must be community-driven and voluntary.

If possible, resettled communities should retain access to abandoned lands for cultural, social or economic reasons.

All relocation efforts must lead to a demonstrable reduction in risk.

All resettlements should entail total residential abandonment of the original community.

While that state has acknowledged the need for relocation since 2005, the researchers wrote that no agency in Louisiana has developed the funding or infrastructure to do so.

“True management would mean we’re thinking through the process from beginning to end,” Birch said. “There’s kind of ‘Do nothing.’ And then on the other end of the spectrum is, ‘We’re going to move everybody all at once.’ But the reality is, most of life happens somewhere in the middle.”

“This Conversation Is Hardly Happening”

Cultural anthropologist Maida Owens along with Shana Walton, coordinator of the Bayou Culture Collaborative, have spent the past few years leading workshops discussing environmental adaptation, climate migration and relocation planning.

When asked if cities are ready for the shifts in population that climate-driven relocation will cause, Owens replied, “The simple answer is ‘no.’ ”

“It’s hard to get people to prepare for storms and hurricanes. It’s even harder for them to think about all this,” Owens said. “It’s hard because our brain is ‘Get fed today.’ I need food for today, and I’ll worry about tomorrow, tomorrow. And that’s just as true for government officials.”

Owens, a Baton Rouge native, grew up enduring major hurricanes. But it was rain and floods in 2016 and 2017 that sent Owens and Walton into the climate preparation business. Owens said it was the flooding in 2016 that swamped most of the Baton Rouge metro area and damaged or destroyed over 100,000 homes.

For Walton, “What really tipped my boat was a heavy precipitation event in 2017 where I watched my car float away down the street in New Orleans … and this is just rain!”

Now they run relocation workshops aimed at the public and state and local officials.

There are many challenges government leaders need to consider: Is their infrastructure sufficient to withstand climate impacts? Is there housing for relocatees? Are there jobs for the people once they arrive?

“It just gets immensely complicated, really quickly,” Owens said. “Within (Louisiana) state government, this conversation is hardly happening.”

At the federal level, then-President Joe Biden’s administration tried to start the conversation about a national relocation effort. It published two reports identifying next steps federal agencies could take toward community-driven relocation and existing federal resources to get started.

But all traces of those reports were scrubbed shortly after Trump took office.

Floodlight made multiple inquiries to the federal Office of Community Development about those reports and the question of coastal relocation but never received a response.

“I think states and local governments need to lean in on the idea that they’re going to have to be engaged in relocation activities before they think they need to,” said Sanders, formerly of the Louisiana Office of Community Development. “They need to really take this seriously before it becomes a dire sort of emergent situation like it was in Isle de Jean Charles.”

High Insurance Costs Driving Coastal Retreat

And even if the water is not wiping out homeowners—yet—the cost of insurance might be.

U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, said sharply rising property insurance premiums caused by climate-fueled disasters are already prompting people to move away from the coasts. And the cost of insuring homes there is convincing the companies themselves to pull out.

“(Insurance companies) are a pretty good witness of what’s coming at us and they’re saying, ‘Hey, coastal areas, wildfire adjacent areas, we’re outta here’,” Whitehouse told reporters in July during an interview hosted by Covering Climate Now.

Whitehouse, one of the loudest voices on Capitol Hill when it comes to climate change-related issues, says historically when coastal areas were hit by hurricanes and floods, the federal government would swoop in to help people rebuild. But that doesn’t mean they can—or should—stay.

“The fact that it’s going to continue to happen and continue to get worse and worse and worse, this isn’t like a one off thing where you come in and rebuild the house and everything’s back to normal,” Whitehouse said. “This is a continually degrading situation.”

Scientist Joshua Elliot argues the federal government must step in to subsidize insurance programs tied to flooding if they want coastal areas to remain habitable.

“At what point does the cost of inaction then become so great that it overcomes the political will for inaction?” said Elliot, chief scientist for Renaissance Philanthropy, a nonprofit that works on climate mitigation, including “advanced research for climate emergencies.”

“There are things that can be done,” Elliot said. “And there are things that are being done. Although, we need to do a whole lot more if we actually want to get ahead of this problem and not end up instead in the position of having to play catch up when it’s too late.”

Bolstering Wright’s argument is the fact that – despite its recent growth spurt – solar power generates less than 3% of global energy, according to Energy Department data.
“One of the big problems with solar and wind is they only produce electricity,” Wright said.
Solar power could approach that milestone as soon as 2050, according to the Energy Department’s latest International Energy Outlook report.
Free-market conservatives have cheered Trump’s moves to roll back Biden-era subsidies for solar power.","The Trump administration has a dim view of the sun.

Solar panels provided most of the electricity capacity added to the U.S. power grid last year, and they will account for most new power built in America for the rest of President Donald Trump’s term, according to Energy Department data. But Trump and his Cabinet secretaries have argued this form of energy is so unreliable and expensive that it’s unlikely to play an important role in powering the world.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said solar panels are “just a parasite” on the grid that couldn’t power the planet even if they blanketed the entire surface of the Earth. The Energy Department’s X account – which once cheered solar projects during the Biden administration – now says solar panels are “essentially worthless when it is dark outside.”

In a speech to the U.N. on Tuesday, Trump told world leaders “the high cost of so-called green renewable energy is destroying a large part of the free world and a large part of our planet.”

The administration has used these arguments to justify policies that slow solar development while promoting fossil fuels – particularly natural gas, the industry where Wright made his fortune before becoming energy secretary. In an interview with the Washington Post, Wright stood by his criticism of solar power and his prediction that it would always play a minor role in global energy.

“If solar continued to grow at its current (rate) it could theoretically catch up to gas, but I don’t think that’s likely,” Wright said.

Bolstering Wright’s argument is the fact that – despite its recent growth spurt – solar power generates less than 3% of global energy, according to Energy Department data. The vast majority of the global economy runs on oil, gas and coal.

Switching to solar isn’t as simple as replacing fossil fuel power plants with solar farms, either: Roughly 80% of global energy consumption comes from cars, trucks, planes, ships, factories and furnaces that directly burn fossil fuels. They aren’t designed to run on electricity, so they’d have to be replaced with electric versions or burn expensive fuels made using electricity.

“One of the big problems with solar and wind is they only produce electricity,” Wright said. “We’ve been talking about ‘electrify everything’ for a while. Today, 15% of energy in manufacturing comes from electricity, same as it was 25 years ago.”

Despite the long-term challenges of powering the world with renewable electricity, many countries are investing in generating more electricity from solar and wind, which don’t cause as much planet-warming pollution and are often cheaper than fossil fuels. In the meantime, electric vehicle sales have surged in China and Europe, and electric heat pumps have started to replace fuel-burning furnaces. Both trends have gradually raised the share of global energy that comes from electricity.

“One hundred fifty years ago, zero percent of our energy consumption was coming from electricity, roughly,” said Josiah Neeley, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute, a center-right think tank. “A lot of [energy] consumption that isn’t electricity-based right now could move over to being electricity-based.”

The Trump administration’s solar policy makes the United States “an outlier” among world governments, according to Robert Stavins, a professor of energy and economic development at Harvard University.

“The European Union is going forward. China is going forward. India has not changed its position. Brazil is moving forward. So, the U.S. is really an exception,” Stavins said.

The Trump administration’s solar stance also puts it at odds with some right-leaning think tanks and political figures within the U.S., including Elon Musk, the former head of the U.S. DOGE Service, who posted on X, “Solar power is so obviously the future for anyone who can do elementary math.”

In a chippy exchange with the libertarian-leaning venture capitalists who host the “All-In” podcast, Wright said Musk “has a wildly exaggerated view of where solar and batteries will go.”

“If we could make a bet 50 years out, I’ll make a bet solar never gets to 10 percent of global energy,” Wright said.

Solar power could approach that milestone as soon as 2050, according to the Energy Department’s latest International Energy Outlook report.

When the report was released in 2023, the department estimated the world was on track to get about 8 percent of its energy from solar power by mid-century – potentially as high as 10 percent if costs keep falling or as low as 6 percent if the technology does not get cheaper. But the modelers wrote that big, unforeseen energy policy changes could “dramatically shift the course of energy system development.”

Two years later, Trump took office and wound down tax credits for solar power, restricted solar development on federal land and raised tariffs to block imports from China and other big solar manufacturers in Southeast Asia.

Solar installations in the U.S. may be 18 percent lower over the next five years in response to Trump administration policies, according to a September analysis from the energy research firm Wood Mackenzie.

Free-market conservatives have cheered Trump’s moves to roll back Biden-era subsidies for solar power.

“I agree with the Trump’s stance on solar, which is to repeal subsidies for solar so that energy sources can have a fair, level playing field,” said Austin Gae, a research associate at the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Energy, Climate, and Environment.

They’ve been less thrilled with his vow to block permits for solar projects.

“If Secretary Wright has confidence that fossil or thermal is the answer and that solar power is not going to succeed, then you don’t have to try and support fossil and place restrictions on solar,” said Neeley, the R Street Institute fellow. “Just let them compete and that’s what will happen.”

But Travis Fisher, director of energy and environmental policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, argued that the Trump administration’s meddling in the energy market is a mirror image of the Biden administration’s moves to block fossil fuel projects.

“The pearl clutching has been ironic to me because it’s like, ‘Hey guys, this has been the ballgame from the left for decades now,’” Fisher said. “So, the fact that it’s now the ballgame from the right – I’m not wild about it, but there’s a sense of irony that comes with it.”

Energy experts, meanwhile, say Trump’s policies are kneecapping the fastest-growing source of electricity in a country that is running out of power.

“What they’re doing right now is making it much, much, much harder than necessary to build economically competitive wind and solar resources across the U.S., while going out and saying all kinds of things in public that just aren’t true about them,” said Jesse Jenkins, an energy systems engineer at Princeton University.

Even without government support, most experts think solar will continue to grow.

“I think it’ll find its place, and it’s probably going to be less than the solar maximalist bros are talking about, and it’s probably going to be more than Trump is talking about,” Fisher said. “But the only way to know for sure is to see where it lands in the market.”

STATE HOUSE and BEYOND

Only about two weeks into the Trump administration, House Speaker Ron Mariano declared in February that Massachusetts had ""lost our federal partner."" That was long before July's final passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, the landmark law that President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans believe will put the nation on a path of progress and prosperity. Local analysts have a dimmer view, asserting that the law will set back social welfare programs and health care efforts that were carefully cultivated over many years by draining a range of federal supports, including clean energy incentives, that are central to the state economy. Now, as the calendar turns to October, there's a possibility that the federal government may shut down due to the inability of Republicans and Democrats in Washington to find common ground on spending plans. State finance officials this week called on executive branch agencies to consider contingency plans and ways to protect residents and meet payrolls if a shutdown occurs on Wednesday. The shutdown threat comes as executive and legislative branch leaders hold an invite-only public session Tuesday to discuss the economy and shifting federal policies. A report is due by week's end on potentially pivotal September tax collections. And inside the Healey administration, the governor still doesn't have an official answer from the Legislature about her request for expanded budget cutting authority, should she need to exercise it. Calculations within the Executive Office for Administration and Finance must also consider the import of Oct. 15, the statutory deadline for the executive branch to deliver any recalibration of available budgeted revenues, taking into account tax collections, probable economic growth, anticipated federal fund receipts, and expected growth in wages and salaries.

Storylines in Progress

... State transportation officials say they are moving forward after the company awarded a highway service plaza overhaul contract walked away from lease talks on Tuesday. The officials just are not saying how they are moving forward ... Education officials visit Arlington on Monday to release the 2025 school and district MCAS results and accountability designations, and the Elementary and Secondary Education board will get to dig into the results at a meeting Tuesday ... Tuesday will also see state budget managers huddle with outside experts to assess the budget and state finance outlook for fiscal year 2026 in the face of federal shifts ... A slew of lawmakers and administration officials will be in Devens on Wednesday for the Mass. Budget and Policy Center's inaugural policy conference, and former Vice President Mike Pence will be in Boston that afternoon ... The House and Senate are expected to meet in informal sessions Thursday ... Supporters of a bill raising taxes on multinational corporations who do business in Massachusetts say they have most lawmakers on their side, and will try to convince the Revenue Committee on Friday to pass their legislation ...

A Sen. Rush bill (S 1622) looks to establish a working group focused on establishing and operating an acute care hospital in Norwood; Steward had abandoned the under-construction facility during bankruptcy proceedings. A proposal from Rep. Sabadosa (H 2532) would create a pilot program for nonprofit therapeutic centers that offer psilocybin treatment for ""mental and physical health needs."" Massachusetts voters last year rejected a ballot question that would have legalized certain psychedelic substances, including psilocybin. (Monday, 9 a.m., Room A-2 |Agenda and Livestream)

According to Environment Texas, while Texas ranks third in the country for solar power, it's only ""20th for per capita small-scale solar.""
Environment Texas Executive Director Luke Metzger said, ""When it comes to Texas's solar energy potential, the sky's the limit.""
The new legislation is a win for residents because installing solar panels can save them up to $3,000 a year on energy bills, depending on how big their system is.
In addition to saving you money, solar panels are more environmentally friendly because they don't run on dirty energy sources that warm the planet and intensify extreme weather events like hurricanes and droughts.","A new law in Texas is making it easier and faster for its residents to install solar panels on their homes. According to Environment Texas, while Texas ranks third in the country for solar power, it's only ""20th for per capita small-scale solar."" That's due to a lack of incentives.

The Senate Bill 1202 allows for faster permitting, enabling third-party professionals to conduct reviews to avoid delays. Once a third party submits the approvals, construction can begin right away. Standards, laws, and rules must be posted for transparency. Additionally, the reviewers are the ones who are accountable for negligence, not the government.

If you're looking for installers in your area, EnergySage has a handy tool you can use to search for them, like you do flight deals and compare prices.

Environment Texas highlighted an analysis done by Brown University's Climate Solutions Lab, which shows that having third parties use permitting software ""could reduce the cost of rooftop solar systems in the state by $2,100 in 2030 and $4,900 by 2040.""

Environment Texas Executive Director Luke Metzger said, ""When it comes to Texas's solar energy potential, the sky's the limit.""

He added, ""Our state's energy security and independence can grow to new heights.""

The new legislation is a win for residents because installing solar panels can save them up to $3,000 a year on energy bills, depending on how big their system is.

EnergySage is also an excellent resource for tapping into these savings by making the process easy. The energy company can also help you save up to $10,000 on installation costs.

Additionally, EnergySage has a helpful mapping tool that shows what solar costs in each state, and the incentives that are available in your area.

To really lower your utility bills, you can install heat pumps with your solar.

A White House official declined to specify the size of the U.S. stake in Lithium Americas, but said it would be “very small” — less than 10% — and serve as “a cash buffer” for the company.
Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.
A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption.","WASHINGTON D.C., DC — The White House is moving forward with a deal that would allow the U.S. government to take a small equity stake in a Canadian company that is developing one of the world's largest lithium mines in northern Nevada, an official said.

The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of President Donald Trump's administration intervening directly in private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

A White House official declined to specify the size of the U.S. stake in Lithium Americas, but said it would be “very small” — less than 10% — and serve as “a cash buffer” for the company. Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.

“We support the project moving forward,'' said the White House official, who was granted anonymity in order to talk about a deal that is not yet completed.

“Critical minerals like lithium are very important' to boost the U.S. economy and restore domestic manufacturing,"" the official said, adding: “We're trying to do this in a way that is fair to the taxpayers. We don't believe in free money.”

A spokesman for Lithium Americas declined to comment, but the company said in a statement that it is in discussions with DOE and General Motors regarding the DOE loan.

“The topics of these discussions include certain conditions precedent to draw on the DOE Loan and associated loan specifics, as well as incremental requests from the DOE for potential further conditions” to gain access to the loan, the statement said.

Jim Cain, a GM spokesman, said Friday the company remains “confident in the project” but declined to comment on ongoing negotiations.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial to building a domestic supply chain to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics. It also represents a rare point of agreement between Trump and former President Joe Biden. Both Republicans and Democrats support the mine project as a way to boost American critical minerals production and cut reliance on China, the world’s largest lithium processor.

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

Environmental groups and leaders of three tribes spent years fighting the mine, which they say borders the sacred site of a massacre of more than two dozen Native Americans in 1865.

The DOE under Biden backed the project as a way to help mitigate climate change by speeding the shift away from fossil fuels.

Trump has aggressively moved away from confronting climate change, labeling it “ the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world ” in a speech this week at the United Nations. “If you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump told world leaders on Tuesday.

The bid to boost the lithium project comes as the pace of U.S. electric vehicle sales has slowed as the industry struggles to attract mainstream buyers who remain concerned about charging infrastructure and affordability.

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption. The massive tax law approved this summer phases out federal incentives for new and used EV purchases, effective at the end of the month.

Consumers rushed to dealer lots this quarter to take advantage of the credits before the phase-out takes effect. The credits have saved car buyers up to $7,500 off the cost of their EV.

Without the incentives, many automakers will struggle to make sales.

Besides batteries for cars, cell phones and other electronics, lithium is also used in the manufacture of glass, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Lithium batteries are also used to store wind and solar power.

The Pumphouse property is reportedly owned by Xcel, and a Colorado Parks & Wildlife spokesperson said CPW owns the parking lot and boat ramp.
Aside from the eventual transfer of the three assets, the county commissioners remain opposed to the current financial compensation package proposed in the Just Transition Solicitation.
“We have serious concerns that the outcome will fall short of meeting the needs of Routt County residents,” Macys said.
The PUC recently completed deliberations for the first phase of the Xcel Energy Just Transition Solicitation Electric Resource Plan Phase 1 that included a proposal for how much energy Xcel will need to build or acquire to serve its customers through the next five years.","The Colorado Public Utilities Commission has verbally ordered Xcel Energy to eventually transfer ownership of three physical assets to Routt County governments, according to a statement from county commissioners.

“While we are disappointed with the PUC’s approach to several key aspects of the transition, we do expect the final order to include some positive outcomes,” stated Sonja Macys, chair of the county commissioners. “These include the preservation and dedication of assets that benefit the broader community, such as the rail spur, water rights and the Pumphouse property, an important access point for residents and visitors to the Yampa River.”

The rail spur that leads to the Hayden Generating Station — stopping and looping through Xcel property — would be transferred after it is no longer in use by Xcel, Hayden Town Manager Mathew Mendisco said. The town manager discussed the status of the Just Transition program, designed to support communities where coal plants are retiring, during a Sept. 4 Hayden Town Council meeting with county commissioners Macys and Tim Redmond in attendance.

The Pumphouse property is reportedly owned by Xcel, and a Colorado Parks & Wildlife spokesperson said CPW owns the parking lot and boat ramp.

The water rights transfer is expected to happen after 2050. That timing is due to a change in state law approved in May 2024. While current Colorado law stipulates that a water right can be considered abandoned after 10 years of nonuse, Senate Bill 24-197 changed the law in the specific case of electric utilities that own a water right in state water Division 6, including the Hayden Station, to allow the plant to keep its water rights through 2050.

“The conditional water right may be used to support a specific project or potential future generation technologies or concepts that have the potential to advance progress toward Colorado’s clean energy and greenhouse gas emission reduction goals,” according to SB 24-197.

Aside from the eventual transfer of the three assets, the county commissioners remain opposed to the current financial compensation package proposed in the Just Transition Solicitation. Xcel Energy previously agreed during an Electric Resource Plan process conducted in 2021 to six years of property tax replacement after coal operations are retired, while Routt County and Hayden leaders in April asked for a larger contribution of 10 years of financial support calculated at $89 million.

“We are extremely disappointed that the PUC did not seriously consider the request that we made for 10 years of replacement property tax revenue,” Macys said in an email Friday.

Coal-fired operations at Hayden Station are set to retire by the end of 2028, and discussions continue as to what type of energy generation may happen on the site after 2028.

Mendisco said the PUC maintaining the six years of property-tax financial compensation agreement was “really, really unfortunate news.”

“If the PUC sticks to the six years with no economic adjustments as proposed by Routt County governments, we plan to file an official appeal to the PUC to ask them to re-look at the issues,” Mendisco said Wednesday.

Mendisco said taxing districts in western Routt County for fire, library, school and cemetery services “will be the most impacted by this poor decision the PUC has contemplated making.”

“West Routt County has roughly a population of 2,800 people if you include everyone in Hayden and the unincorporated areas,” Mendisco said. “The PUC seems to think that other communities around the state, such as Pueblo and Craig, should receive 10 years of property-tax backfill, except the smallest area in the state that has the fewest resources to transition, which is Hayden/West Routt County.”

“The Just Transition Office, Colorado Energy Office and Consumer Advocacy Office all testified that Hayden/Routt County should be treated equally; indications from the PUC would say otherwise,” Mendisco said. “The town of Hayden feels the PUC was directed by the state through the Just Transition legislation to make this a fair and just process. Anything that is short of what others around the state are receiving is simply wrong, and certainly not ‘just.'”

Mendisco said the town “will continue to strive to mitigate the loss of Hayden Station through economic development efforts.”

PUC Spokesperson Megan Castle said the final written decision is expected “in the coming weeks now that deliberations are complete.” Castle said interested individuals can listen to the state commission deliberations on the Just Transition Solicitation process on the PUC YouTube page at https://tinyurl.com/daac5vz7 .

“We have serious concerns that the outcome will fall short of meeting the needs of Routt County residents,” Macys said. “We believe this limited focus does not adequately reflect the intent, or potentially the mandate, outlined by the state legislature in 19-1314, which established a ‘moral commitment to assist the workers and communities that have powered Colorado for generations’ by supporting ‘a just and inclusive transition’ away from coal.”

The county commissioners’ statement this week reiterated that the current level of funding offered “would have significant negative consequences for Routt County, the town of Hayden and numerous special districts, including fire protection, school districts, libraries and cemeteries.”

“We will continue to review and assess the final order once issued and remain committed to advocating for a truly just transition that fully supports our community, local governments and special districts during this critical period of economic transformation,” according to the county commissioners’ statement.

The PUC recently completed deliberations for the first phase of the Xcel Energy Just Transition Solicitation Electric Resource Plan Phase 1 that included a proposal for how much energy Xcel will need to build or acquire to serve its customers through the next five years. The commission approved a plan that may result in the acquisition of more than 6,000 MW of new generation, a level that would make it the largest acquisition ever approved by the commission, according to a PUC media release.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/10/2025/09/25213736/Coal-train-B-may-1-2025-between-hayden-and-Steamboat-scaled-1-1024x623.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 05:58:54.617912

What's happening?

In September 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a notice to Volkswagen for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act.

The EPA accused Volkswagen of intentionally installing software in models manufactured between 2009 and 2015, ""defeat devices"" designed to conceal emissions of nitrous oxides ""up to 40 times"" above existing federal standards.

Ultimately, Volkswagen and the EPA reached a settlement that required the automaker to create a $2.7 billion mitigation trust fund. Florida received $166 million, funds invested in electric buses for schools and public transit.

The Miami Herald reported that $41 million of those funds had yet to be spent, and that an August draft proposal from the FDEP indicated the agency intended to divert tens of millions to ""'new diesel' and compressed natural gas.""

Citing ""equipment supply challenges"" and ""shifts in federal incentive structures"" among other factors, the FDEP proposed a cessation in funding electric vehicle charging infrastructure (EVCI) in favor of investing in ""new clean diesel and compressed natural gas replacements.""

Why are energy experts objecting to the proposal?

Anne Blair, the Electrification Coalition's vice president of policy and freight, talked to the Herald about what the FDEP's proposal entailed.

Blair cut to the chase, explaining that the ""alternative fuels"" outlined in the draft ""aren't nearly as clean as electrification."" She acknowledged they could reduce emissions to a degree, but unlike electric vehicles, the proposed alternatives weren't ""emissions-free.""

Energy sciences expert Kevin Lofgren works with biofuels, and he emphasized that biodiesel and renewable diesel are not interchangeable, as they have different qualities and impacts.

Lofgren explained that the production of renewable diesel can result in carbon dioxide emissions, and he referred to the process as ""energy-exhaustive."" Lofgren characterized renewable diesel as a form of greenwashing.

""Renewable diesel is a little bit of a greenwash scam. It's great for business, not necessarily great for the environment. The temperatures and the pressures it takes to make this stuff is really extreme,"" Lofgren said.

""As much as I wish that these things were just God's gift to mankind, they aren't, and they do have their downsides,"" he lamented.

Florida's swift turn away from clean energy wasn't entirely surprising: In March, the Tampa Bay Times speculated that the federal government might ""claw back"" the state's mitigation funds.

What can be done about it?

As the Miami Herald noted, the FDEP's plan was a draft proposal.

The outlet indicated that a public comment window closed on September 19, before the article was published.

The cleaner the cloud, the greener the vehicle.","As the auto industry accelerates towards electrification and software-defined vehicles (SDVs), a new sustainability dilemma is emerging: the hidden energy footprint of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

From the sprawling data centres powering connected mobility to the chips embedded inside vehicles, AI is fast becoming the next climate paradox. Are automakers truly steering towards sustainability, or is the horsepower of AI quietly heating the planet?

Cloud dependency and energy demand

Today, much of the AI mobility stack from connected services to data-driven R&D relies heavily on external cloud and data centre infrastructure. High-volume model training, fleet management and large-scale data ingestion often take place off-vehicle.

Advt

“Core tasks like deep learning model training, simulation, HD map updates and remote diagnostics are typically performed in remote cloud/data centres rather than solely on vehicles or at the edge,” explains Jay Shah, Global COE Head - Data Science, Tata Technologies.

Shifting intelligence to the edge

To mitigate this footprint, he says both automakers and their cloud partners are increasingly sourcing 100% renewable energy for data centres. Edge computing, too, is gaining traction, shifting more analytics and inference tasks directly into the vehicle.

Processing data locally reduces latency and carbon footprint, while cutting down energy-intensive round-trips to the cloud. Moreover, OEMs are deploying AI-based systems that use sensor arrays and predictive algorithms to dynamically adjust cooling intensity based on real-time thermal loads, driving style, and weather conditions.

The efficiency paradox

Still, the paradox persists. “AI and autonomous technologies inherently increase energy consumption, especially due to large-scale data processing and connectivity requirements,” says Rajeev Ralhan, Partner and Leader, Decarbonisation, PwC India.

Yet, they also unlock profound capabilities for efficiency, optimisation, and emission reduction throughout the value chain. “AI, when incorporated into vehicle platforms, manufacturing processes, and grid management, can substantially reduce wasted energy and enhance resource use,” he adds.

Ralhan explains how state-of-the-art AI applications from predictive energy management to real-time carbon tracking and dynamic load balancing enable precise allocation of energy and curtail unnecessary consumption. This often results in significant operational cost savings and energy reductions in manufacturing scenarios.

Advt

According to him, AI-enabled manufacturing achieves significant reductions in energy consumption, substantial decreases in waste, and improved resource use across the supply chain, directly reducing the carbon footprint of automotive operations.

“Digital twins help optimise designs and manufacturing workflows for minimal material and energy use, enabling lifecycle assessments, recycling potential, and circular economy innovations through every stage,” he says.

Research flags rising energy use

A study by the University of Michigan suggests that connected and autonomous vehicles may increase primary energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by 3–20 per cent compared to conventional vehicles. This rise is attributed mainly to the energy demands of AI systems, sensors, and data networks.

“To counterbalance these impacts, drivetrains must transition to electric — given their superior energy efficiency compared to internal combustion engines — and that the electricity powering them increasingly comes from clean, renewable sources,” says Charith Konda, Energy Specialist, IEEFA (Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis).

He adds that tech-infused driving assistance systems, available in connected and electric vehicles, can facilitate eco-driving and reduce energy consumption. In his view, regulators are primarily focused on ensuring human safety and cybersecurity in the context of connected and autonomous mobility. The good news is that the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles is accelerating across many regions, which should help alleviate concerns about rising energy use to some extent.

Regulations are catching-up

Emerging regulations like the EU AI Act already mandate environmental impact assessments for AI systems, requiring transparency and risk management throughout AI lifecycles. Future frameworks will likely require companies to measure and report carbon emissions, pushing responsible AI development, efficient algorithms, and renewable energy use in data centres and vehicles.

This will mirror current automotive standards for emissions and safety, thereby ensuring sustainable AI innovation in mobility. “Regulators are expected to increasingly scrutinise AI’s environmental footprint in mobility, similar to emissions and safety,” says Shah.

Beyond data centres: The ESG challenge

For automakers, that means sustainability will soon be measured not just at the tailpipe, but also in the cloud. “It is still early, but regulators are beginning to recognise AI’s indirect environmental costs like energy-hungry data centres and compute requirements,” adds Ankita Sabharwal, Head of Data Privacy, Chadha and Chadha.

“We may not see rules as structured as emissions and safety standards right away, it is realistic to expect disclosures, reporting requirements, or sustainability guidelines around AI in mobility within the next few years, especially as governments push broader climate goals,” she says.

Studies show that high-intensity AI activities, such as those required for autonomous vehicles, connected mobility, and smart city applications, are associated with significant added CO₂ emissions. Concerns about the “hidden” footprint from rare earth minerals in chips to upstream energy use for cloud-based AI modelling are prompting calls for regulation similar to existing standards on vehicle emissions and safety.

According to Ralhan, the pace of AI adoption in transport could amplify these impacts unless monitored and balanced with sustainability targets. Governments and organisations are putting environmental practices of tech and automotive companies under closer inspection.

“ESG frameworks now increasingly call for transparent reporting not just of tailpipe or manufacturing emissions, but technology-enabled footprints - including data centre usage and AI-driven operational impacts,” he points out.

The future impact of AI on the environment hinges on robust strategies integrating AI with clean energy, hardware innovation, carbon accounting, and regulatory frameworks. With conscious design, AI will drive transformative sustainability, outweigh its own environmental footprint and catalyse the automotive sector’s transition to net zero.

The road ahead is clear. The cleaner the cloud, the greener the vehicle.

On Sept. 9, the Hernando County Board of County Commissioners discussed several projects to submit to seek state funding for during the next legislative session.

Request: Fire Station to Serve Weeki Wachee Area

Public Information Officer Dominique Holmes began her presentation with a proposed request for a new fire station along US 19 at Atlanta Avenue. Population density in the Weeki Wachee area has increased and additional home construction warrants a need for a fire station that will meet the needs of the community without reducing the effectiveness or response time of existing fire and EMS locations. The proposed funding is $8 million, and Hernando County would pay $3 million of that cost.

Commissioner Champion challenged the $8 million cost as being too cost-prohibitive when the state is trying to be fiscally responsible.

Request: Public Safety Training Center

The second proposal was a training center for the county’s public safety departments, not just fire safety and EMS personnel, but the sheriff’s office as well. A similar request has been made annually since 2012.

The cost for just the first phase of the facility is approximately $8 million, with Hernando County providing just over $1 million for the project. With 60 acres available, a local training center would resolve several issues: personnel could remain available for emergency situations, reduce the current scheduling conflicts that occur between multiple agencies and counties, and would provide sufficient and varied training environments.

Though located in Hernando County, this training center would be available for use by agencies across the state as well. A critical aspect is the benefit of providing continuing education, increasing the requisite skills for these departments’ effectiveness during emergencies or critical situations such as natural disasters.

Commissioner Champion said Governor DeSantis vetoed this request during last year’s legislative session. He also reminded the board that the item is being put on a referendum.

Request: Waterways/Multi-Agency Building

Ms. Holmes addressed the third item: a building to accommodate the three agencies which need access to Hernando County’s marine waterways. The beneficiaries of an updated building are the Waterways Division of the Parks and Recreation Department, Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, and the HCSO Marine Unit.

While the county has such a building, it was built 65 years ago. Two recent storms revealed how susceptible it was to natural disasters. It sustained significant but repairable damage from Hurricane Idalia in 2023. In 2024, however, Hurricane Helene’s 5-foot storm surge damaged the concrete block structure, an out-building and fencing beyond repair. Everything must be demolished on that property, and on the adjacent property the county purchased with BOCC approval.

Floodplain maps have changed since the original building was erected and any new building(s) at that site must adhere to the Flood Insurance Rate Maps and current building codes. The proposed office building at the original site will be elevated and ADA accessible. The 4,340 sq. ft.-space will be jointly used by FWC, HCSO’s Marine Unit and the Waterways Division, with maintenance and storage for boats and equipment below the office, at ground level. It will include parking areas for the agencies’ staff and visitors.

Repairing and/or upgrading the existing docks and adding a new dock for the HCSO’s Fire Rescue boat are also part of the proposed project. An additional building for boat storage and unknown future needs is included. New infrastructure will be added for both properties.

The primary beneficiary of the new facilities is the public using the waterways. Emergency services will be able to reach them faster, navigation aids can be repaired quickly, and in the case of severe weather, provide safe harbor.

The cost for this funding request is $3.5 million. The county’s matching portion is approximately $725,000.

Commissioner Champion stated concern that this would not be approved due to the proposed cost.

Request: Taxiway and Infrastructure Project at Brooksville-Tampa Bay Regional Airport

Both Economic Development Director Valerie Pianta and Ms. Holmes discussed this proposal. Mrs. Pianta requested board approval to submit a grant application for funds to construct/resurface a new taxiway from an inactive runway at the Brooksville-Tampa Bay Regional Airport. Current water and sewer infrastructure would be extended across the infield area. Opening hundreds of unused acres is designed to attract additional industry in both aviation and non-aviation fields.

Pem-Air Turbine Engin Services, LLC and Judah 1, Inc. have pledged to both provide funding and create new jobs by either expanding their existing facilities or constructing additional ones. Combined, their financial contributions will be significant. The higher-wage jobs the companies will provide are even more beneficial.

The project cost is estimated at $17 million. Between the EDA Disaster Supplemental Grant funds and FDOT Aviation Grant Program funds total of $13.6 million, the county match would be $1.6 million. Ms. Holmes stated the county could request $1 million from the state’s legislature, reducing the county’s matching funds to just $600,000.

Request: Hermosa Lift Station Upgrade

There are six wastewater lift stations that feed into the Hermosa lift station, which forwards the wastewater to the Hernando County Airport Water Reclamation Facility. The Hernando Beach area continues to see growth and the Hermosa lift station was not engineered to handle the amount of wastewater that flows through it.

The lift station is older and the control system as well as the electrical system are at risk due to equipment stress, potential overflows and other issues. An engineering analysis also recommended the lift’s electrical panels should be elevated.

There are several factors being considered such as public health hazards from overflows or flooding, potential system failures and future wastewater needs. Protecting Weeki Wachee Springs by preventing nitrogen seepage to the aquifer is also of serious concern.

The design phase is still in progress, Ms. Holmes said. The funding request is $3.4 million, with the county match of $850,000.

Request: Septic-to-Sewer Conversion – District A Phase 2

The Weeki Wachee Springs area is under the protection of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP). One reason water quality is impaired is high nitrate levels from wastewater and agricultural runoff. This can cause algal growth, reduce water clarity and damage the springs ecosystem.

Hernando County participates in a Basin Management Action Plan (BMAP) to help improve water quality by reducing the amount of nitrogen that enters the groundwater. One way to do this is to convert homes from using septic systems and connecting them to the sewer system. Phase 1 conversion is in progress.

Phase 2 builds on this and will include approximately 350 properties. The property locations are even closer to the Springs than Phase 1. The goal is to improve the Springs water quality by reducing even more nitrogen in the water. A secondary benefit is having more reclaimed water.

The funding request for Phase 2 is $26 million. The county’s cost would be $1.8 million.",https://www.hernandosun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/tingey-injury-law-firm-yCdPU73kGSc-unsplash-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 05:59:03.386467

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., visited Woodstock Soapstone to raise awareness about those impacted by tariffs.
The cost increases aren’t life-threatening for Woodstock Soapstone, which has no debt and owns its property, tools and supplies, Morrissey said.","WEST LEBANON — As the burden of tariffs and expiring tax credits begins to weigh on the only woodstove manufacturer in New Hampshire, the company has begun downsizing.

“What you do if you’re in business and you’re dealing with tremendous uncertainty is that you contract,” said Tom Morrissey, the president of Woodstock Soapstove in Lebanon.

Five of the firm’s 25 manufacturing positions have been left unfilled in recent months, said Morrissey, who has been with the company for all of its 47 years.

The company is also reducing inventory, decreasing the number of models in production and increasing lines of credit, General Manager Lorin Day said.

The stove manufacturer recently had to pay $40,000 in tariffs on a shipment of material for which they would have paid just a couple hundred dollars in the past, Morrissey said.

“We’re just like a little acorn in this hurricane,” Morrissey said.

Any steel and aluminum materials coming from outside the U.S. are now tariffed at 50%, including the steel and cast iron that Woodstock Soapstone uses to make its stoves.

The company at one point got its cast iron from Randolph-based Vermont Castings, which stopped supplying it to Woodstock Soapstone’s specifications. Their cast iron now comes from a foundry in Spain.

And while most of its steel is North American, some of it comes from Canada, which is subject to tariffs, Morrissey said.

There’s also uncertainty about whether the soapstone — a naturally occurring rock — will be tariffed, as it comes from Canada, but isn’t produced in the U.S., Morrissey said.

Morrissey said he expects the tariffs to raise retail prices of his stoves by around 12% to 15%. This will begin in the next seven to 10 days, Day said.

As a small business that sells directly to “working class” customers mostly, Woodstock Soapstone is at a disadvantage to larger manufacturers that have more leeway on prices, Morrissey said.

And while the increase will have to happen soon, the company has been holding it off, Morrissey said. It hasn’t started shipping products built from the tariffed goods, using more of their reserve supplies as they try to “put off the pain as long as (they) can,” Morrissey said.

“It’s essentially an unexpected unilateral tax on materials that we buy from outside the United States — that we can’t get from the United States,” Morrissey said.

The manufacturer requires a certain grade and format of metal that is not available in the United States, Day said.

For example, the business buys some steel from China, which is not produced well domestically, for a specialty part that reburns smoke.

“I can show you what you can get in the United States, but you’d be disgusted,” Morrissey said.

In addition to the raised tariffs, the federal tax credit on wood heaters is set to expire at the end of December, instead of 2032, as previously set. This credit reduces the price of woodstoves approved by the Environmental Protection Agency by 30%.

Morrissey said he expects the surge in orders to increase as more people learn that the credits are ending. This will help in the near future, but hurt sales long term.

It will also strain the company’s ability to build enough stoves on time, he said.

The strain is worsened by bureaucratic red tape. For example, Woodstock Soapstone has been awaiting the EPA’s approval of a new stove model since April.

There are currently $300,000 to $400,000 in orders that can’t be fulfilled because of the lack of approval, Morrissey said.

In the past, a phone call to EPA administrators could have resolved the issue in a matter of days, Morrissey said. But he hasn’t been able to reach anyone in the agency for the last five months, he said.

A spokesperson for the EPA wrote in an email that the processing time for new certifications have been “longer than usual” due to “resource issues and the need to prioritize renewals of expiring certifications.”

The spokesperson also wrote that Woodstock Soapstone’s new model is scheduled for a detailed review starting on Sep. 29.

But at a certain point, Morrissey has to tell customers that he’s “not sure I’ll be able to fulfill their orders,” he said.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., visited Woodstock Soapstone to raise awareness about those impacted by tariffs.

“The only thing that’s going to move this administration is when they hear from businesses (and) consumers that they’re being hit by these tariffs in a way that makes it hard to do business,” she said.

In January, Shaheen introduced Senate Bill 151, which seeks to deny tariffs imposed through the act that the Trump administration used on metal imports. The bill was blocked by Republican senators, but she has continued to push the issue.

“We need to continue to bang that drum so that people make the connection between the tariffs and what they’re seeing in their pocketbooks – and what small businesses, in particular — are seeing with the impact of tariffs,” she said.

The cost increases aren’t life-threatening for Woodstock Soapstone, which has no debt and owns its property, tools and supplies, Morrissey said.

But as Woodstock Soapstone braces for the near future, it is beginning to look into other markets that aren’t regulated by the government, such as furniture — which can be built in their shop, Morrissey said.",https://i0.wp.com/vnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250924-vn-shaheen-jmp-177-copy.jpg?fit=2400%2C1602&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-28 02:58:16.509028

For example, the report cites a blog post that DOE report author Roy Spencer wrote about “faulty” climate models.
The DOE report amplifies supposed conflicts among climate scientists — even when there isn’t any.
When EPA asserted that hurricanes, floods and wildfires have not gotten worse, it cited the DOE report.
When it argued that climate models erroneously predicted warming trends, drought and melting ice, it cited the DOE report.","Wright, who rose to prominence and wealth as a fossil fuel executive, has pushed the idea that dissenting views are unwelcome in climate science.

""We want to have a real debate and discussion about climate change, and get away from the cancel culture,” he said on CNN after the report was released.

So when Wright was looking for authors to write the report, he made a list of 12 “honest, true scientists,” he told The Wall Street Journal.

The DOE report, written by a small group of high-profile climate contrarians, stands in stark contrast to decades of assessments published by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s preeminent authority on research into the planet’s warming.

The DOE launched its science review in March and published the findings just four months later, after a secretive process that drew a sharp rebuke from a federal judge. DOE disbanded the group, but the authors pledged to advance their work outside of government. At the IPCC, scientists are nominated and vetted for their expertise and spend years reviewing hundreds of studies to evaluate their strengths and look for trends. One section of the IPCC report alone, on climate impacts, adaptation and vulnerabilities, had more than 270 reviewers, 34,000 citations and received more than 62,000 comments.

Contrary to Wright’s assertions that divergent voices are pushed out of the scientific process, experts said, scientific papers that disagree often receive more attention and discussion from reviewers.

Wright’s claim that dissenting views are silenced is “at best preposterous and arrogant and at worst a deliberate ruse to undermine decades of rigorous science,” said Camille Parmesan, an ecologist at the National Scientific Research Institute of France who served as a coordinating author for the IPCC.

“I personally believe this is a deliberate attempt to sabotage real science and replace it with unfounded and dangerous ideology,” Parmesan wrote in an email.

Some of the discrepancies are semantic. Climate scientists are reluctant to declare a trend, for instance, unless they have decades of data to back it up.

In the case of hurricanes, the best data extends only to around 1980, when satellites began comprehensively tracking storms as they crossed oceans. Curry, one of the DOE report authors, says that timeline is “not good enough to discern a meaningful trend.”

But a large majority of scientists disagree, arguing that the data shows rising dangers.

The percentage of intense hurricanes has likely grown compared to the overall share of storms, said Jim Kossin, a prominent hurricane researcher and a retired NOAA atmospheric scientist who served as a lead author for the IPCC.

He said the DOE report “is clearly designed to mislead the audience into believing that there are no trends.”

There’s another problem: Scientists have not predicted that climate change would lead to more hurricanes, as DOE suggests. Instead, they have found that hurricanes are intensifying and dropping more rain.

The lack of discussion in the DOE report about water — not wind speed — being the biggest danger from hurricanes is “a dead giveaway” that the report authors had downplayed the climate risks, said Kerry Emanuel, a hurricane expert and professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The DOE report’s focus on the hottest daytime summer temperatures is misleading. The 1930s were unusual because of the Dust Bowl, a period of intense drought and high heat across parts of the central and southern U.S., exacerbated by severe soil erosion caused by unsustainable farming practices of the time. Many temperature records at locations in the region did topple nearly a century ago — but most scientists say it was a statistical outlier that skewed heat trends for decades afterward.

“It was hot in the 1930s, yes! But that does not undermine the rising trend in extreme heat over the past few decades and the associated societal consequences,” said Deepti Singh, a climate scientist at Washington State University Vancouver.

It’s true that some areas of the central and southern U.S. haven’t seen an increase in daytime summer temperatures, a pattern known as the “U.S. warming hole.” Scientists believe many factors are at play, including the Dust Bowl’s statistical legacy. But outside the warming hole, the U.S. is seeing increases in extreme summer heat.

All kinds of other highs are also rising in the U.S., including maximum temperatures over the entire year, winter temperatures, and nighttime summer temperatures.

Researchers are aware that not all regions of the country are warming evenly. But there’s a clear upward pattern. One regional anomaly doesn’t change that fact.

The DOE report relies on studies or reports that have sometimes been amplified by the fossil fuel industry, or are connected to conservative groups that oppose government efforts to address climate change.

For example, the report cites a blog post that DOE report author Roy Spencer wrote about “faulty” climate models. He wrote the post for the Heritage Foundation, the same organization that produced the Project 2025 playbook that called for jettisoning climate policy and defunding science.

Spencer argued in his writing that climate models are biased and show no meaningful warming trends. He urged policymakers to “proceed cautiously and not allow themselves to be influenced by exaggerated claims based on demonstrably faulty climate models.”

But his assertions about the models’ track record are false. Climate models in the 1970s accurately predicted current global warming. And peer-reviewed assessments of models since then have shown that they generally performed well.

“This notion that there's a fundamental disconnect between simulations and observations is incorrect,” said Ben Santer, a former climate scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. “The DOE report also cherry picks in terms of which model simulations and which observations they show.”

The Heritage piece is one example of some of the DOE authors’ current and past affiliations with conservative groups that have tried for years to undermine climate regulations placed on polluting industries.

“Any current or past affiliations with other organizations do not define any of our perspectives on climate science,” said Curry, a climatologist and professor emeritus at the Georgia Institute of Technology. She added, “The policy preferences of these organizations are not relevant in any way to our perspectives on the science.”

Other than Koonin, who worked as chief scientist for BP, the authors’ actual research has not been directly funded by the fossil fuel industry. But some of them have been paid by industry groups and conservative think tanks to opine on how their findings raise questions about mainstream science.

Spencer, a researcher at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, has held roles at the Heritage Foundation and the Heartland Institute. Both groups promote climate misinformation and have pushed to eliminate fossil fuel regulations. They have received funding from foundations linked to Exxon Mobil and Shell, and the Koch brothers network.

Koonin is a fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution, whose scholars have downplayed climate science and argued against regulations.

McKitrick, an economist at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, is also listed as a senior fellow at the Fraser Institute, a right-wing think tank in Canada that is critical of climate policy. Fraser has received funding from the Koch brothers network, Exxon and foundations that oppose regulations.

The DOE report amplifies supposed conflicts among climate scientists — even when there isn’t any.

For example, it’s not true that there is “substantial debate” within climate science over whether the sun could be a primary driver of global warming.

But the DOE report makes that claim nevertheless. The idea has been pushed for years by Willie Soon, a researcher favored by industry groups and promoted by Republican lawmakers.

There’s no dispute among scientists that the sun affects the Earth’s climate. But the idea that it’s responsible for the warming observed over the last 50 years is “considered scientifically invalid,” said Theodosios Chatzistergos, an astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany.

Curry said the DOE authors were planning to “modify some of the text” because the group did not have time to review all the references on the topic.

The DOE report was released on the same day in July that the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rescinding the so-called endangerment finding, which gives the agency its legal authority to reduce climate pollution from sources like power plants and cars.

EPA pointed to the DOE report as evidence that climate risks have been overblown. When EPA asserted that hurricanes, floods and wildfires have not gotten worse, it cited the DOE report. When it argued that climate models erroneously predicted warming trends, drought and melting ice, it cited the DOE report. And when it claimed it’s overly difficult to attribute rising temperatures to human activity, it cited the DOE report.

It was a clear example of how the Trump administration will use the findings of a few researchers to cast doubt on the vast scientific consensus that rising temperatures pose a danger to humans — a determination that has led many governments around the world to impose measures for confronting the peril.

Curry said it was the authors’ hope that the report would be published on its own, but DOE and EPA instead “elected to publish this at the same time as the filing on the Endangerment issue.”

Altogether, EPA pointed to the report 16 times in its bid to roll back climate regulations — a move that drew criticism from a federal judge in Massachusetts. The judge allowed the citations to stand but rebuked DOE for describing the report as a scientific exercise, when he said it was overtly political.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock’s ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete’s suggestion that it’ll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn’t been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie’s concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power’s parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”

Duke Energy is preparing thousands of line and tree workers that can easily be shifted ahead of the storm or after the storm has passed.

“With this particular storm, even if it doesn’t make landfall the significant amount of rain along with the wind gusts could definitely create outage scenarios at least in our coastal areas potentially inland,” Brooks said.

The pressure to reduce emissions has not decreased, and the new network could be an essential component of the United States’ energy portfolio in the future.

Turning ambitious plans into reality as the vision for clean energy takes shape

The plan is bold yet simple. Establish hydrogen stations that pump globally: this will create a network of hubs established with highways, ports, factories, etc. Not only concerns powering trucks, but also the aim is to ensure that hydrogen becomes a clean, flexible fuel for industries that are hard to electrify.

Financial assistance and incentives in promoting the development of this gas are provided by the government. Efforts like the Clean Hydrogen Hubs of the Department of Energy aim at having areas cooperate, helping make sure the necessary infrastructure is established, and more clean hydrogen is produced to be consumed in the nation.

Building a low-emission future one hydrogen hub at a time

The significant hydrogen hub is being installed and is part of a $7 billion program taking roughly $1 billion. States like Texas, California, the Midwest, and the Gulf Coast will have an advantage. The investment will be used to aid in producing, storing, delivering, and fueling this natural gas to trucks and to the general public transportation system.

The ARCHES project, being located in California, receives up to $1.2 1.2billion of federal funds, along with community and individual investments, to construct clean hydrogen infrastructure in the state. It aims at making hydrogen a viable transportation and industrial fuel with no emissions.

Understanding the project’s plans, schedule, and important checkpoints

Officials want to shift the hydrogen hub locations from the planning phase to the construction phase. The success will be measured in terms of the number of fueling stations constructed, the amount of gas generated, emissions minimized, expenses controlled, and employment opportunities generated, just like this unexpected underground discovery changing everything we’ve known.

Several hubs have already entered into preliminary deals, and production and distribution will grow in a slow process.

Overcoming obstacles and concerns as the project moves toward its goals

The manufacture of clean hydrogen is expensive. Green and blue hydrogen have challenges in terms of finances and scale. Construction of pipelines, storage facilities, and fueling stations is attended to with permits and safety checks, and it is feared that the network can always serve the long-haul routes. The activists of environmental justice require more openness and improved security. Other projects involve natural gas mixed with carbon capture, and opponents do not note that this would leave fossil fuel infrastructure alive.

The people in the local communities are concerned about the emissions, the risks to their health, and whether these projects will have fair benefits for them. The proponents argue that hydrogen expansion will create thousands of new jobs and clean the air in the industrial regions, as well as enhance U.S. opportunities to achieve the 2030 and 2050 climate objectives.

These are advantages that point to economic and environmental benefits. With this project, it will not only be fueling stations, but also a new energy highway. It will only succeed as an expensive experiment or become an essential component of a low-carbon future of America if it is carefully planned and implemented.",https://www.eldiario24.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1001350099.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 01:59:47.163801

Pacific Fusion will build a state-of-the-art research and manufacturing facility, housing its Demonstration System, which is designed to achieve net facility gain—producing more energy from a fusion reaction than the total energy used – by 2030. Reaching this milestone would mark a historic breakthrough toward commercial fusion power. future,” Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller said. “Today is proof of the assertion that we have passed a turning point—that our city is not only on the map, but can define the next chapter of clean-energy innovation.”

Pacific Fusion was founded in 2023 to deliver affordable fusion energy. Its technology builds on New Mexico’s legacy of applied physics and clean-energy innovation, including decades of research at Sandia National Laboratories, home to some of the world’s leading fusion experiments. In addition to its historic leadership in applied physics and energy innovation, New Mexico offers a growing clean-tech ecosystem and a workforce that aligns with Pacific Fusion’s future hiring needs.

“We’re excited to expand our operations to New Mexico for many reasons, chief among them the close partnership we’ve developed with state and local leadership, who have made this project possible,” said Keith LeChien, co-founder and chief technology officer of Pacific Fusion. “Working alongside the Governor’s office, the Economic Development Department, the City of Albuquerque, key legislators from both parties, and the national labs, we’ve built true partnerships over the past several months. That collaboration gives us confidence that together we’ll be able to move quickly to deliver on the promise of low-cost fusion power.”

Upon finalization, the project will bring more than 200 long-term jobs to the state, along with hundreds more construction jobs, workforce development programs, and regional economic activity. It is an anchor investment for a broader fusion ecosystem in New Mexico. “This is a groundbreaking project that puts New Mexico at the forefront of fusion energy,” said Economic Development Department Cabinet Secretary Rob Black. “Welcoming a world-class company like this into our state opens the door to an entirely new era of clean energy innovation. It means thousands of potential future jobs, a new supply chain, and the opportunity to cement our state’s leadership in clean technology for decades to come.”

Pacific Fusion has raised more than $900 million in private capital from General Catalyst, Lowercarbon Capital, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, DCVC, UP.Partners and other leading investors. The New Mexico State Investment Council’s commitments to investing in key sectors and VC firms actively sourcing New Mexico opportunities played a pivotal role in Pacific Fusion’s choice to make New Mexico the home for its next major facility.",https://losalamosreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/seal_of_the_governor_of_new_mexico-1-1-1.png,N,,2025-09-27 23:58:31.303428

In response, Larry Behrens from Power the Future told The Center Square that “by returning $13 billion, the Department of Energy under President Trump is showing respect for taxpayers and a willingness to end funding for programs that don’t work.”

Power the Future is a nonprofit dedicated to Americans who work in reliable energy sources.

Behrens told The Center Square that the Department of Energy’s action “is a welcome step toward restoring accountability and letting free markets – not bureaucrats – determine our energy future.”

“The American people made it crystal clear at the ballot box that they don’t want another taxpayer dollar wastefully spent on green scam pet projects,” Behrens said.

Diana Furchtgott-Roth of the Heritage Foundation told The Center Square that with the return of $13 billion, “the deficit will be lower than otherwise.”

When asked what other actions the Department of Energy should take to end wasteful spending, Furchtgott-Roth said that “the Department should comb through its budget and see what projects can be accomplished by the private sector, then end those projects.”

“The Department should also look through its regulations and see which ones impose costs on businesses and families,” Furchtgott-Roth said.

“For instance, the Department should eliminate appliance regulations that prevent companies from producing the gas stoves, boilers, or water heaters that people want to buy,” Furchtgott Roth said.

The Department of Energy announced Wednesday its “intention to return more than $13 billion in unobligated funds initially appropriated to advance the previous Administration’s wasteful Green New Scam agenda.”

The department said its announcement reflects “the [Trump] Administration’s commitment to halt wasteful spending and refocus the department to its core mission.”

For instance, Trump signed the Working Families Tax Cut into law earlier this year, the release said, which “directed the Energy Department to rein in bloated federal spending and expedite the return of unobligated funds to the U.S. Treasury to support hardworking Americans.”

“The Department of Energy is working to advance its critical mission of unleashing affordable, reliable and secure energy for all Americans while increasing efficiency and promoting better stewardship of taxpayer dollars,” the release said.

The Department of Energy has not yet responded to The Center Square’s request for comment.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in the news release: “The American people elected President Trump largely because of the last administration’s reckless spending on climate policies that fed inflation and failed to provide any real benefit to the American people.”

“Thanks to President Trump and Congress, those days are over,” Wright said.

Renewable energy group American Council on Renewable Energy has not yet responded to The Center Square’s two requests for comment.

Behrens told The Center Square, “keep in mind it was Biden’s DOE that funneled billions to an electric vehicle charging program that failed to deliver results.”

“Over $6 billion in EV charging funding has now been flagged as wasteful,” Behrens said.

Behrens also referred The Center Square to a White House document entitled “Ending the Green New Scam.”

Furchtgott-Roth informed The Center Square that “in general, states with the most expensive electricity require renewables (with the exception of Alaska), and states with the least expensive electricity do not require renewables.”

“States should prioritize affordable, resilient, reliable energy,” Furchtgott-Roth said.

“This means getting rid of requirements that a share of electricity be produced with renewables,” Furchtgott-Rott said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/2e/12e92fc9-5d82-4dd4-9e40-615fb416e680/68b21418b8d6b.image.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 02:58:26.764426

LIMBONG: How does President Trump's hostility to climate action impact momentum on the world stage?
LIMBONG: So how do you bring the whole world along when the U.S. isn't playing ball?
LIMBONG: Climate action isn't a light switch, right?
LIMBONG: Wopke Hoekstra is the European Union climate commissioner.","ANDREW LIMBONG, HOST:

At the United Nations this week, more than a hundred countries met to discuss commitments to cut pollution by 2035 as part of a global effort to counter climate change. Also at the U.N. this week, President Trump called climate change, quote, the ""greatest con job"" ever perpetrated on the world, and he called green policies a scam. And he said he was worried about Europe. We're joined now by the climate commissioner for the European Union, Wopke Hoekstra. Hi, Commissioner. Welcome.

WOPKE HOEKSTRA: Thank you very much for having me on the show.

LIMBONG: So let's start with some of the new commitments announced earlier this week to cut pollution levels, to address global warming. What stands out to you?

HOEKSTRA: First of all, it is hugely important that the world continues to make this effort because, frankly speaking, this problem is getting worse before it gets better, right? So if you just look at the sheer impact on our economies, on geopolitics, on the ecosystem we live in, the damage simply is huge. It is imperative that the global community, the world together also tries to fix this.

LIMBONG: And so what have you heard this week?

HOEKSTRA: We learned, for example, about the Chinese example, which, in my view, is a step, but at the same time, disappointing in where they land. They're not going to do much more than some 10% reduction by 2035. And given that they are the largest emitter on the planet, responsible for roughly 30% of global emissions, it would have been hugely important for them to take more responsibility, more leadership and do more.

LIMBONG: So Commissioner, help us understand, what are the EU's commitments for 2035?

HOEKSTRA: So our commitment is a range between 66.3- and 72.5% and...

LIMBONG: To reduce emissions.

HOEKSTRA: Of reduced emissions compared to '99, which was our peak here. You always take the peak and then, you know, the percentage that you managed to drive down by 2035. If you were to put into perspective - because I can fully understand that it's hard to assess, is this is good? Is this mediocre? Is this bad? - this will put us at the top or very near the top of the most ambitious. Great Britain is probably going to have a target that is even higher, but we will come as a close second, I think.

LIMBONG: How does President Trump's hostility to climate action impact momentum on the world stage?

HOEKSTRA: I think it is diplomatic to basically refrain from trying to be a pundit and analyze his specific speech. But if I zoom out, what I can tell you is that American leadership matters, and frankly speaking, all matters that we have, whether it's geopolitics, whether it's the economy or whether it's climate, the U.S. simply is the most formidable player across the globe. You are the No. 1 economy, and you are the second largest emitter. So the fact that the U.S. is no longer being part of these conversations is a major blow to international efforts. That's just a reality.

LIMBONG: So how do you bring the whole world along when the U.S. isn't playing ball?

HOEKSTRA: It makes it more complicated, and it makes conversations with China also more complicated. And with all the other large emitters, all the large industrial nations, which we typically call the G20, together responsible for roughly 85% of global emissions, it does do something with the dynamics. At the same time, the problem is not going to go away, right? The ecosystem, the planet doesn't give a damn whether this is easy or difficult. It's simply warming up. And the impact in terms of droughts, wildfires is basically continuing, and that will have increasingly a very, very significant economic cost. So forget about all the lingo about saving the planet. This is an economic reality we need to face.

LIMBONG: Climate action isn't a light switch, right? It's not particularly nimble. Like, businesses have invested, and there are new market realities, but how do you face the big challenges when you have these big swings in American policy?

HOEKSTRA: So the interesting thing is, when I talk to businesses, whether they're from the U.S. or from Europe or wherever, it is crystal clear to them that the future will be decarbonized and that if you don't expose yourself to that economy, you will have a very bad chance of surviving as a company, not in the very short run, but in the longer run for sure. So that is why, in so many industries, CEOs are making sure that they do go into change mode. They might not always use that anymore under the header of climate or of clean, but for many of them, it simply makes business sense to step up.

And the numbers show that they are right. Just to give you one number that I've always found absolutely spectacular, if you look at what happened to the price of solar, that dropped by roughly 95% in terms of cost just in this decade or in this century, so in these 25 years, alone. And the costs are ever further going down. So it is just attractive from a commercial perspective to have exposure to that.

LIMBONG: The EU has made progress in its clean energy transition, but it still imports Russian gas. And I think that reliance is problematic for the bloc's climate and broader policy goals. So how are you working to reconcile this?

HOEKSTRA: We're trying to eradicate that as quickly as we can, Andrew. I just - no doubt about it. We have made a severe mistake years ago to believe that, you know, this dependency was actually OK and that it was with a trustworthy partner. And then the Ukrainians turned out to be at the receiving end of an absolutely illegal, horrible war the Russians have forced upon them. And immediately, when we then started to side with the Ukrainians, the effect was that the Russians were trying to threaten us with this dependency. So never again. The good news is, we have actually eradicated this dependency already for 90%. The last 10% is the most difficult, but you're absolutely right. We should step up and make sure that we get rid of that.

LIMBONG: Often, you know, regular people get lost in these conversations, right? So what stories do you hear from people about what is changing their lives? And what can people concerned about climate do themselves?

HOEKSTRA: I fully understand that people, on the one hand, are saying, look, I'm worried about all the news I'm getting and what this will mean for my life or for the life of my kids, and at the same time, wonder about how measures governments are taking might impact our lives. If you're working in the coal industry and the plant is going to close, well, you might intellectually agree that that is good for climate, but of course you wonder about how you're going to feed your kids. And then it matters whether there are actually jobs available in new industries and whether there's training available to make sure you get skilled in a way that gives you a decent chance for a great job in that new industry. But it is important to make sure that we facilitate these type of things, in my view.

LIMBONG: Wopke Hoekstra is the European Union climate commissioner. Commissioner, thank you so much for joining us.

HOEKSTRA: Thank you very much for having me. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",https://www.wunc.org/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-28 07:59:50.460628

The logic seems impeccable: eliminate the need for paper production, which involves deforestation, energy-intensive manufacturing, and transportation, and replace it with digital storage in efficient data centers. Yet, recent scrutiny reveals this transition might not be the environmental panacea it’s often portrayed as. According to a report in FE Week, the idea of going paperless via the cloud is more “pie-in-the-sky” than practical, with hidden energy costs undermining the purported CO2 savings.

The FE Week analysis highlights how data centers, the backbone of cloud services, consume vast amounts of electricity—often from non-renewable sources—leading to emissions that can rival or exceed those from traditional paper use. For instance, storing and accessing digital files requires constant power for servers, cooling systems, and network infrastructure, which globally accounts for about 1-2% of total electricity use, per estimates from the International Energy Agency.

The Hidden Energy Appetite of the Cloud

This energy hunger is escalating with the rise of AI and big data, where cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure report surging carbon footprints despite green pledges. A 2024 study in Carbone4 notes that major cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud saw emissions spikes of up to 20% in recent years, driven by data center expansions. While proponents argue that cloud efficiency aggregates resources better than on-premises servers—potentially cutting emissions by a billion metric tons over four years, as forecasted by IDC in 2021—the reality for paper replacement is more nuanced.

Paper’s lifecycle emissions, from tree harvesting to recycling, are indeed significant, but digitization doesn’t eliminate them entirely. Employees still print documents for reviews or legal requirements, and the cloud’s always-on nature means idle servers burn energy around the clock. Posts on X from users like environmental researchers emphasize this, with one noting that a single data center can guzzle electricity equivalent to 50,000 homes, rivaling the airline industry’s carbon footprint, drawing from MIT Press insights.

Weighing Real-World Trade-Offs

Industry insiders point to case studies where the switch has backfired. In education sectors, as detailed in FE Week, schools aiming for paperless operations via cloud tools like Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 found that device charging and data syncing added unexpected emissions, often offsetting paper savings. A 2023 analysis in ScienceDirect on cloud computing’s carbon reduction potential suggests that while technology innovations like carbon trading could help, the industry’s growth trajectory—projected to consume 13% of global electricity by 2030, per Xomnia estimates—demands more than just migration.

Moreover, not all clouds are created equal. Providers using renewable energy, such as Google’s carbon-free data centers, offer better outcomes, but widespread adoption lags. A recent X post from AMD highlighted a packaging firm’s 10% emissions drop by optimizing cloud instances, yet this requires sophisticated strategies beyond simple paper replacement.

Policy and Innovation Imperatives

For true CO2 reductions, experts advocate hybrid approaches: combining cloud efficiencies with reduced printing through better workflows. The MIT Press Reader’s ethnographic work on server farms underscores the ecological toll, from water usage for cooling to e-waste from outdated hardware. Current news on X reveals growing sentiment for “green coding” practices, like using efficient languages such as Rust to minimize computational waste, as noted in discussions around sustainable software.

Regulatory pressures are mounting too. With the EU’s Green Deal pushing for digital sustainability reporting, companies must audit their cloud footprints. A 2025 post on X from AI at Meta discussed carbon-driven AI models reducing emissions by 9%, hinting at future tech solutions.

Brendon Green, the general manager of automotive solutions at Pickles, says the auction house is selling about 100 salvaged EVs every month, and interest is surging.

“It’s only very early days, but they are certainly in strong demand,” says Green.

“We’ve got this new element of second-life battery startups. That industry really didn’t exist 18 months ago.”

Battery hunters

Salvage auction houses started regularly seeing salvage EVs in early 2024, most of which were Teslas, the first mass market electric vehicle on Australian roads.

Battery hunters are now also seeing alternatives, such as BYDs and MGs, in line with the growing number of different makes on the market. Many of the wrecked vehicles are two-to-three years old, and include a mix of complete write-offs and those that are repairable.

The appeal for EV batteries is obvious, given they are about five times as powerful as a typical home energy storage unit.

Andrew Chadwick, a lithium battery repair specialist, says even ageing EV batteries have plenty of life in them for other purposes.

“The output requirements for a solar battery are a lot less than what you need for an electric vehicle,” says Chadwick, from Second Life Battery Sales.

“Even if they are no longer good for an electric vehicle, with a little finessing, they’re perfect for a solar system.”

Consider an EV battery that is down to 70% capacity. While this will considerably reduce the range of the vehicle, making the car undesirable, it still holds plenty of charge for less-intensive uses.

You could even put a trailer load of second-hand EV batteries together, and power an entire music festival.

A music event in Queensland’s Sunshine Coast was postponed in June over council concerns its power usage would disrupt nearby businesses. The punk and indie-alternative festival went ahead in early September, powered by repurposed EV batteries.

“Our trailers powered the whole event for the day, including speakers, food trucks, everything, and had plenty of power left over,” says John Myler, co-founder of MyNu Energy.

“People really like them as an alternative to a diesel generator. If you’ve got sound equipment or food trucks, having a noisy, smelly diesel generator probably isn’t the atmosphere you’re looking for, whereas these batteries are silent, pollution free, and hold huge amounts of power.”

After the event, the trailers were recharged using solar, ready for their next deployment.

Life extension

At Pickles auctions, the demand for EV batteries is evident.

Financial year sales of salvage EVs increased 200% over the prior year, with the wrecked vehicles now boasting much higher price tags than combustion engine cars.

Buyers know that EVs contain some of the world’s most advanced battery technology, ready to be deployed.

About one in 10 new car sales in Australia are battery-powered, with the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 and the BYD Seal and Atto the most popular models in 2024, according to the EV Council.

After a comparably slow roll out in Australia marked by political headwinds, motoring experts believe EV sales will surge as prices become more competitive and charging infrastructure catches up.

Currently, many batteries are shredded, with the material then separated into components ready to be rebuilt into new batteries, with the process often including multiple facilities in different countries.

Myler says repurposed EV batteries are part of the solution to Australia’s intensifying energy needs.

Shifting global dynamics India’s role as a growing solar module exporter is gaining significance as the global clean energy transition accelerates.","Indian solar panel manufacturer Waaree Energies has said it will fully cooperate with United States authorities following the launch of a formal investigation into its solar exports. The probe, initiated by the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), focuses on whether the company misclassified Chinese-made solar cells and modules as Indian-origin products to bypass import tariffs.

According to official communication, CBP stated that it has “reasonable suspicion” that certain imports linked to Waaree were not properly labelled to reflect long-standing antidumping and countervailing duties applied to Chinese and other Asian solar products. As part of the interim measures, the agency has asked Waaree to place cash deposits while the inquiry is underway.

Company response and US expansion

In a public statement, Waaree reiterated its commitment to compliance, highlighting that it has always cooperated with US regulatory processes and will continue to do so. The company emphasised that the US remains a core market in its international expansion strategy.

Waaree Solar Americas, its US subsidiary, currently operates a 1.6 GW module manufacturing facility in Texas, with plans to scale capacity to 3.2 GW. The subsidiary recently acquired assets of Meyer Burger US to strengthen its domestic production footprint. Waaree underlined that these investments reflect its long-term goal of building a sustainable manufacturing base in the US market.

“We are a responsible corporate citizen in every country we operate in and abide by all applicable laws and regulations,” the company said in its statement.

Why the scrutiny matters

The investigation follows a petition from the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, a coalition representing US-based solar producers including First Solar and Qcells. The group has argued that some Indian solar products benefit from cost advantages by using Chinese cells without paying the required US duties.

Over the last two years, US imports of Indian solar panels have risen sharply, especially after tariffs were imposed on solar imports from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. India’s exports now account for nearly 8% of US solar module imports, positioning it as one of the top suppliers outside Southeast Asia.

Market and financial implications

News of the investigation has already impacted Waaree’s market performance. On Friday, shares of Waaree Energies fell 6.76% on the Bombay Stock Exchange, closing at Rs 3,213.35 per share.

The inquiry also comes at a time when the US Department of Commerce has begun a separate investigation into solar photovoltaic cells and module imports from India, Indonesia, and Laos. Analysts say these probes could shape the trade environment for Indian solar exporters in the medium term.

Shifting global dynamics

India’s role as a growing solar module exporter is gaining significance as the global clean energy transition accelerates. In 2024 alone, the US imported 54 GW worth of solar modules, with India contributing 4.4 GW. While this has boosted India’s visibility in the renewable energy supply chain, regulatory hurdles such as the ongoing US probe underline the challenges of competing in tightly scrutinised international markets.

For Waaree, the outcome of the investigation will be crucial in determining not just its US strategy but also its standing in global solar trade. As the company expands its manufacturing base in the United States, compliance with trade rules will remain central to sustaining growth in one of the world’s most competitive renewable energy markets.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/08/01/waaree.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 22:58:58.259322

In states with robust incentives, such as California, used EV buyers can still claim up to $4,000 in rebates, amplifying affordability.","In the rapidly evolving market for electric vehicles, used EVs are hitting record-low prices, narrowing the cost gap with their gasoline counterparts to an unprecedented $900 on average. This shift, driven by a surge in supply from early adopters trading up and aggressive manufacturer incentives, is making battery-powered cars more accessible than ever. Yet, for buyers eyeing these deals, the question looms: Does the lower upfront cost translate to long-term value, or are there hidden pitfalls in maintenance, resale, and infrastructure?

Data from recent analyses shows that the average price of a used EV now hovers around $28,000, compared to about $28,900 for a comparable used gas vehicle. This parity marks a dramatic reversal from just a few years ago when EVs commanded premiums of 20% or more. Factors like the expiration of federal tax credits for new models are pushing more inventory into the secondary market, flooding dealership lots and online platforms with options from Tesla, Nissan, and Chevrolet.

The Economics of Ownership

Beyond the sticker price, operating costs remain a strong selling point for used EVs. Charging at home equates to roughly $1.41 per gallon equivalent in fuel savings, as highlighted in reports from energy think tanks. Maintenance is often simpler too, with fewer moving parts—no oil changes or transmission repairs—potentially saving owners thousands over a vehicle’s life. However, these advantages hinge on access to reliable charging; in rural areas or apartment complexes without dedicated spots, the convenience factor diminishes sharply.

Battery degradation emerges as a critical concern for used EV shoppers. Models like the older Nissan Leaf can lose up to 30% of range after five years, according to reliability studies, which might necessitate costly replacements exceeding $5,000. Buyers are advised to scrutinize vehicle history reports and opt for certified pre-owned programs that include battery warranties, often extending coverage to 100,000 miles.

Market Dynamics and Buyer Profiles

The influx of used EVs stems partly from lease returns and fleet disposals, with companies like Hertz offloading thousands of Tesla Model 3s at steep discounts after high-profile rental challenges. This has created bargains, such as a 2021 Chevy Bolt for under $20,000, but it also underscores volatility—resale values for EVs have plummeted 25% in the past year amid broader economic pressures.

For industry insiders, the real calculus involves total cost of ownership. A study by the nonprofit publication Grist emphasizes that while the $900 price gap favors EVs, variables like insurance premiums (often 10-15% higher due to repair complexities) and regional electricity rates can tip the scales. In states with robust incentives, such as California, used EV buyers can still claim up to $4,000 in rebates, amplifying affordability.

Risks and Opportunities Ahead

Skeptics point to infrastructure gaps: Only about 50,000 public fast-chargers exist nationwide, far short of demand, leading to “range anxiety” for long-haul drivers. Moreover, emerging technologies like solid-state batteries could render current models obsolete, depressing future resale values further. Analysts from Hacker News discussions note that early adopters might face depreciation hits if autonomous features or longer-range packs become standard.

On the flip side, environmental benefits and policy tailwinds position used EVs as a smart bet for urban commuters. With global pushes toward net-zero emissions, demand is projected to surge, potentially stabilizing prices. Publications like LAist, republishing insights from Grist, argue that for budget-conscious buyers with short commutes, these vehicles offer unmatched efficiency—up to 100 miles per gallon equivalent—outweighing drawbacks.

Strategic Considerations for Buyers

Industry experts recommend thorough due diligence: Test drives should include highway speeds to assess real-world range, and third-party inspections for battery health are non-negotiable. Financing options have improved, with lenders offering EV-specific loans at competitive rates, sometimes bundled with home charger installations.

Ultimately, whether a used EV represents a good deal boils down to individual circumstances. For tech-savvy millennials in electrified cities, the savings and eco-credentials shine. But for those in colder climates where battery performance dips, or with unpredictable travel needs, traditional hybrids might edge out. As the market matures, informed decisions will separate savvy investors from those caught in the hype.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-f9b1fe2c-2781-4834-9acc-7459f07ea522.jpeg,N,,2025-09-27 22:00:07.258301

Rachel Carson, a biologist and nature writer from Pennsylvania, authored the book to expose the hidden costs of widespread pesticide use, particularly focusing on their devastating effects on birds, insects, and the broader natural environment.

Carson focused especially on the pesticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and warned . that pesticides don’t stay where we put them; they get into the soil, our water-ways, wildlife and even inside us. They move through the food chain (whether absorbed by crops or consumed by animals) exposing people, even those living far from farms, to harmful chemicals.

Many of these substances are linked to serious health risks, including respiratory problems, neurological disorders, reproductive health issues, and increased cancer risk. Decades after Silent Spring, we are still discovering just how far these chemicals can travel and how deeply they affect human health and wildlife. Carson knew that something needed to change.

Pen to Paper Activism

Carson started a whole movement without a single marth – just her written word. Before Silent Spring, she had already achieved acclaim, her books The Sea Around Us and Under the Sea Wind, introduced millions to the importance and beauty of oceans and coastal ecosystems, even impacting the opinions of those who might never be able to sea the ocean. Her writing combined poetic language with rigorous science; making the truth of human impact on the environment digestible and impactful.

What gave Silent Spring the unique ability to motivate action was its urgency. Carson’s words were not just celebratory of nature and all its beauty, but cautionary of the risk of losing it. She warned that if humanity did not change course, we could one day experience a spring without birdsong. That DDT and other pesticides would eventually kill all the birds, leaving behind a silence that would signal not peace, but deep loss and absence. The early mornings, once filled with chirping and fluttering life, would be still.

Corporate Foes Failed

Carson faced fierce opposition. Chemical companies attacked her credibility. She was dismissed as “hysterical,” and accused of being a Communist whose agricultural methods would just reduce the food supply.

At the time, she was also battling breast cancer, which she kept a secret so she could not be accused of blaming the pesticide industry for her ill health. Along with her penmanship, she testified on the dangers of these toxic chemicals before Congress, insisting that the government had the duty to protect its citizens from contaminants. Sadly, she did not live to see the full impact of her work, but the rest of the world did.

Carson ignited an environmental consciousness in the United States and the world with her urgent message laying out the intellectual and moral groundwork for what would become the modern environmental movement. Her work created the climate that made the first Earth Day, held in April 1970, possible and mobilizing 20 million Americans in a national call for clean air and water for all. This pressure directly led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency later that year, and paved the way for landmark legislation including the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.

In the years that followed, Carson’s warnings proved prophetic. The bald eagle, America’s national symbol, teetered on the edge of extinction. DDT caused eggshell thinning in these majestic birds. This thinning led to fragile eggs that often cracked under the weight of incubation, resulting in widespread reproductive failure. The pesticide accumulated up the food chain, affecting eagles who consumed contaminated fish and prey. Public outrage grew and by 1972, the U.S. banned DDT for agricultural use. The recovery of the bald eagle is now one of the most celebrated conservation success stories in American history.

Where Are We Now?

Rachel Carson’s legacy doesn’t belong to any single organization or policy. It belongs to anyone who listens to a bird’s song and understands that its presence is not guaranteed. It belongs to those who believe that science should serve life, not only profit. And it belongs to those who still care enough to fight for a future where springs are full of sound.

The battle against pesticides has not gone away. In her honor, help us speak out and oppose Section 453 of the Interior Appropriations Bill, which would grant pesticide manufacturers broad legal immunity, even when their products cause harm.",https://www.earthday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250927_article_silentspring.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 02:58:19.673176

The event, held on the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement, featured the launch of the 2025 Global Carbon Neutrality Annual Progress Report, a comprehensive study on the world's climate transition.

Framed around the theme ""Global Progress and China's Practice,"" the forum opened with a dialogue featuring Liu Yang, Deputy Director General, Department of Climate Change, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, China, who outlined China's latest progress toward its ""dual carbon"" goals and its newly announced NDC. Her remarks were followed by international perspectives, including a call to action from Patricia Espinosa Cantellano, former UNFCCC Executive Secretary.

For the first time, the report is guided by a 13-member international Advisory Committee, co-chaired by He Kebin of Tsinghua and Erik Solheim, former UNEP Executive Director, underscoring its mix of Chinese leadership and global perspective.

This year's report identifies a ""profound structural imbalance"": while ambition and innovation are driving progress, they are being severely undermined by bottlenecks in climate finance and international cooperation. This has created a critical ""implementation gap"" between stated goals and tangible results.

The report's rigorous methodology has earned praise from international climate leaders. ""This is the type of research into climate that reinforces our sense of purpose and our sense of hope,"" said Patricia Espinosa Cantellano. She added, ""What stands out is the four-part framework — target, policy, action, effectiveness — a game-changer for tracking climate progress.""

The findings and dialogues from the forum are intended to provide a scientific basis for shaping stronger NDCs and informing the critical discussions at the upcoming COP30 in Brazil. By highlighting both the irreversible momentum of the green transition and the urgent need to close the implementation gap, the event concluded with a strong call for renewed international efforts to translate commitments into concrete action.",https://www.prnewswire.com/content/dam/prnewswire/icons/2019-Q4-PRN-Icon-32-32.png,N,,2025-09-27 19:02:00.023761

""We are proud to build batteries at our Kentucky 1 facility that will power next-generation electric vehicles,"" BlueOval SK CEO Michael Adams said in a press release.

""The start of production is a significant milestone that strengthens our position in the electric vehicle battery market.""

The U.S. Department of Energy announced a record $9.63 billion loan to BlueOval SK for the construction of three battery manufacturing plants in the country, which was finalized in 2024.

Once the three locations are up and running, with one in Tennessee and two in Kentucky, they're expected to deliver more than 120 gigawatt-hours of battery production each year.

This move will strengthen the domestic supply in the U.S. and was estimated to add 5,000 construction jobs and 7,500 operations jobs across the facilities, according to the DOE at the time of the announcement.

Bolstering the development of more sustainable transportation technologies is key to achieving our clean energy goals and reducing the proliferation of gas-powered vehicles that spew planet-warming tailpipe pollution and run on dirty fuels.

InsideEVs also reported that this investment is being made while Ford faces pressure from local rival General Motors and tough competition from other automakers like Hyundai and Kia.

Additionally, the outlet noted that Ford's EV sales have declined in the first half of the year, with F-150 Lightning sales dipping 17%, and E-Transit sales down 34%.

Still, the Ford F-150 Lightning beat out Tesla's Cybertruck in sales numbers for the second quarter in a row, proving that it's headed in the right direction.

It doesn't help that the Trump administration's actions to cut environmentally friendly programs, credits, and rebates — reversing course from the previous administration's push to support them — are having a negative impact on EV sales in the country.

GM, which claims to be the largest OEM battery cell producer in North America, has its own joint venture in Tennessee with LG Energy Solution under the name Ultium Cells.

In fact, both Ford and GM are developing more affordable lithium-iron-phosphate battery cells, which Reuters notes are gaining traction in the industry.

Notably, both companies are partnering with Redwood Materials for recycling efforts to build up the circular economy in the U.S. and diversify the supply chain.

The company claims it has been able to recover lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper with a rate of above 95% efficiency.

Ford's CEO Jim Farley shared that the company aims to retool its Louisville Assembly Plant to deliver a next-generation electric truck to replace the aging Escape and Lincoln Corsair crossover models in what it's calling a Model T moment.

The company's new midsize electric truck will be built on a Universal EV Platform and is expected to debut in 2027 with an MSRP of around $30,000, proving that its EV plan is still moving forward with vigor.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BlueOval-SKimage-recghhCJGrfcLipds.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 19:01:44.916347

The numbers are huge: the report estimates that 6.3 to 9.5 million job years of new construction work will be from now to 2050. This is equivalent to an average of 235,000 to 350,000 ongoing new construction jobs over then next quarter-century – a 20-30% step increase in overall construction employment in Canada.

The report estimated the construction job-creation spurred by three big categories of investment:

Non-emitting energy production and transmission (including hydro, wind, solar, nuclear, and geothermal).

Energy-efficient industrial and commercial building construction and retrofits, and construction of district energy systems.

Sustainable transportation infrastructure (including urban transit, inter-urban high=speed rail, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure).

About half of the new jobs would arise in commercial and industrial building activity, including new construction, deep-energy-saving retrofits, and construction of high-tech district energy systems (which integrate heating and cooling systems with new geothermal, battery, and other technologies to achieve huge gains in energy efficiency).

The job-creation estimates do not include indirect jobs created in the supply chains that feed these investment projects, nor the downstream or induced jobs that would result from additional employment and consumer spending by hundreds of thousands of construction workers. In short, these huge investments will stimulate an unprecedented boom in demand for construction labour.

Sean Strickland, President of the CBTU, concluded these investments are an enormous opportunity for building trades workers:

“This report makes it clear: Canada’s transition to a cleaner economy represents one of the most significant job creation opportunities in our country’s history. Skilled trades workers will be indispensable to delivering the energy infrastructure, retrofits, and clean technology projects that this transition demands.

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption.","WASHINGTON D.C., DC — The White House is moving forward with a deal that would allow the U.S. government to take a small equity stake in a Canadian company that is developing one of the world's largest lithium mines in northern Nevada, an official said.

The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of President Donald Trump's administration intervening directly in private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

A White House official declined to specify the size of the U.S. stake in Lithium Americas, but said it would be “very small” — less than 10% — and serve as “a cash buffer” for the company. Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.

“We support the project moving forward,'' said the White House official, who was granted anonymity in order to talk about a deal that is not yet completed.

“Critical minerals like lithium are very important' to boost the U.S. economy and restore domestic manufacturing,"" the official said, adding: “We're trying to do this in a way that is fair to the taxpayers. We don't believe in free money.”

A spokesman for Lithium Americas declined to comment, but the company said in a statement that it is in discussions with DOE and General Motors regarding the DOE loan.

“The topics of these discussions include certain conditions precedent to draw on the DOE Loan and associated loan specifics, as well as incremental requests from the DOE for potential further conditions” to gain access to the loan, the statement said.

Jim Cain, a GM spokesman, said Friday the company remains “confident in the project” but declined to comment on ongoing negotiations.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial to building a domestic supply chain to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics. It also represents a rare point of agreement between Trump and former President Joe Biden. Both Republicans and Democrats support the mine project as a way to boost American critical minerals production and cut reliance on China, the world’s largest lithium processor.

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

Environmental groups and leaders of three tribes spent years fighting the mine, which they say borders the sacred site of a massacre of more than two dozen Native Americans in 1865.

The DOE under Biden backed the project as a way to help mitigate climate change by speeding the shift away from fossil fuels.

Trump has aggressively moved away from confronting climate change, labeling it “ the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world ” in a speech this week at the United Nations. “If you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump told world leaders on Tuesday.

The bid to boost the lithium project comes as the pace of U.S. electric vehicle sales has slowed as the industry struggles to attract mainstream buyers who remain concerned about charging infrastructure and affordability.

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption. The massive tax law approved this summer phases out federal incentives for new and used EV purchases, effective at the end of the month.

Consumers rushed to dealer lots this quarter to take advantage of the credits before the phase-out takes effect. The credits have saved car buyers up to $7,500 off the cost of their EV.

Without the incentives, many automakers will struggle to make sales.

Besides batteries for cars, cell phones and other electronics, lithium is also used in the manufacture of glass, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Lithium batteries are also used to store wind and solar power.

Tapping into solar power at an individual level can just as easily contribute to avoiding those outcomes while saving yourself a few bucks.","Ampion has announced an impressive advancement in its community solar power service, according to Solar Power World.

The company runs a community solar credit business, where customers pay for a portion of a large-scale solar plant's output and receive a proportional credit on their utility bill in return. This allows residents to benefit from the savings of solar power without using solar power directly. Ampion generally guarantees at least 10% savings with this scheme. It says it's possible to cover an entire utility bill with these solar energy credits.

Traditionally, this plan has required homeowners to be in the same state as the solar energy farm, but Ampion has just announced its ability to start participating across state lines.

Ampion's model hinges heavily on government policy to exist. Local jurisdictions have to mandate that utility providers accept solar energy credits and attach them to specific subscriber accounts.

By that token, this new Synthetic Community Solar program is made possible by a federal credit targeting low-income homes. Ampion hopes that this credit will incentivize the creation of more solar energy generation to plug into its system, since it will be easier to sell credits.

Utility-scale solar is the cheapest energy source available, making its efficient transmission an important bottleneck. Providing creative means for residents to support solar through credits like Ampion's can not only save people money, but it also helps to displace dirty energy sources on the grid.

Fossil fuels, such as gas and coal, are among the primary drivers of increasingly destructive weather events, including floods and droughts. These disasters have massive housing and agricultural costs.

Tapping into solar power at an individual level can just as easily contribute to avoiding those outcomes while saving yourself a few bucks. EnergySage has a free online tool that can connect homeowners to vetted local installers. These experts can save up to $10,000 on installation costs thanks to rebates and credits.

Ampion was excited about the potential of its new Synthetic Solar Credit program.

""We're grateful to offer a solution that helps developers navigate the complexities of community solar across different state programs while providing additional savings to low-income subscribers. This initiative directly supports our mission of making renewable energy accessible everywhere, for everyone,"" said Ampion CEO Nate Owen.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EFaLTOmaxKn2m0XlveeqzQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/5d329219f10fccd5e33593a44831dbb9,N,,2025-09-27 19:02:09.117845

Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.
Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.
Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
""For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,"" the staff wrote.","Private investment firms that are helping finance America's artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

""The reason is very simple: because there's a lot of money to be made,"" said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is ""at the beginning of a golden age.""

""We believe that there's a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy"" and energy, Fink said.

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

""It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don't have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,"" said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech's data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

""It's just a matter of what's the price and will the regulator approve it,"" Ellis said. ""The challenge is they're not going to come up for sale very often.""

That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don't want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general's office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota's law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is ""well positioned"" to meet its financing needs.

It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's ""intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.""

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

""For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,"" the staff wrote. ""For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity 'wins' and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.""

Electricity is bought from generators – wind farms, power plants – in “merit order”: cheapest first.
In theory, the green part of “policy costs” comprises under 10% of our electricity bills.
But its long-term plan is to take gas largely out of the electricity system: to reach “grid net zero” (95% carbon-free electricity) by 2030.
Vast amounts will need to be invested – which will come, ultimately, from Britain’s electricity bills.","British electricity prices, which were among the lowest in Europe in the early 2000s, are now very high by global standards.

Only Denmark, Germany and Ireland have more expensive domestic electricity, while industry pays at least 50% more for electricity in the UK than it does in most of the rest of Europe – and over three times more than in the US. Although this is bad for everyone, particularly poorer households, arguably the real crisis is in industry.

Energy-intensive manufacturers have been hit hard, leading to the closure of factories such as the CF Fertilisers plant in Billingham, and the Ineos oil refinery in Grangemouth; the steel industry is on its knees. Lowering energy bills is one of the current Government’s core “missions”, but the short-term outlook isn’t great, with the typical domestic bill set to be 44% higher this winter than four years ago.

Why are British prices so high?

The short-term cause is the Ukraine War. The average household “duel-fuel” bill (of which electricity makes up a bit more than half) went from around £1,200 per year in 2020 to £3,549 in October 2022, then down again, before creeping up to £1,720 now. The underlying causes are complex: they include an ageing national grid; high network operating costs; a lack of storage; and the practicalities of being on an island (in Europe, electricity can be transmitted to where it’s needed more easily). Finally, there are “policy costs”: levies to support green energy and vulnerable customers. Of a typical electricity bill, under Ofgem’s price cap (the highest tariff providers can charge), about 20% consists of network costs; 15% is the energy supplier’s costs; 11% is policy costs; 5% is VAT; and suppliers’ profits are 2.4%. But the biggest chunk, around 45% of a bill, is the wholesale cost of energy, which is largely dictated by the price of natural gas, which is both high and volatile, for reasons beyond government control.

Why is it underpinned by the price of gas?

UK non-fossil fuel sources – wind, solar, hydroelectricity, bioenergy and nuclear – generated around 58% of the UK’s electricity last year, with wind alone providing around a third of the country’s power since 2023. And wind and solar are, in theory, very cheap. However, much electricity for the grid is bought short-term, with an auction for every half-hour period, and the price is determined by the most expensive provider for that moment. Electricity is bought from generators – wind farms, power plants – in “merit order”: cheapest first. But the price for all is set by the last or “marginal” generator needed; and in the UK that’s almost invariably a gas-powered turbine. This is known as “marginal pricing”.

Why on earth use this system?

Electrical grids must be exactly balanced between supply and demand. In the UK, gas-powered plants are the only practical means of topping up the grid during a sudden shortage. Nuclear reactors can’t quickly be switched on and off; wind and solar are intermittent, and we can’t yet store enough of their output. For now, the only way to be sure of keeping the lights on when there’s a surge in demand involves gas. As a matter of economics, many, from Boris Johnson to the energy supplier Octopus, have questioned marginal pricing. But both Labour and Tory governments have concluded that it is the most efficient system; it is used across most of Europe and the US.

So how much do renewables cost?

In theory, the green part of “policy costs” comprises under 10% of our electricity bills. But the true price is much higher. Connecting the grid to wind and solar farms is expensive, as is back-up and grid-balancing. In 2024/25, about £2.7bn was spent balancing the grid – for instance, paying wind farms to “curtail” generation when the system was overloaded. Besides, high gas-derived prices often govern real renewable prices anyway. The UK relies heavily on gas, because it got rid of coal-fired stations. Marginal pricing means gas set the price of electricity 98% of the time in Britain in 2023, compared with the European average of 58% (in France, prices are mostly set by cheaper nuclear, and in Poland, by coal).

What is the Government’s solution?

To help industry, Labour is exempting around 7,000 companies from some levies, with extra support for those in energy-intensive sectors such as chemicals, steel and glass. But its long-term plan is to take gas largely out of the electricity system: to reach “grid net zero” (95% carbon-free electricity) by 2030. The UK will need about twice the generating capacity as it did pre-renewables, and a much more complex, dispersed grid. It is investing several billion pounds in renewables, aiming to double onshore wind capacity, triple solar and quadruple offshore wind by 2030; it is also investing heavily in nuclear, in projects such as Sizewell C in Suffolk. At the same time, it aims to improve network capacity and boost grid storage, with vast batteries and pumped hydropower. The hope is that, in the future, the marginal price will seldom be set by gas – greatly driving down UK energy costs, cutting emissions and creating high-quality green jobs.

Is this realistic?

Many are sceptical. Dieter Helm, the Oxford energy economist, doubts that renewables will reduce bills long-term. Decarbonising the grid by 2030 would be a massive undertaking. Big British infrastructure projects usually run hugely over budget and schedule. Mechanisms for balancing a mostly renewable grid are untested, and will be expensive. Vast amounts will need to be invested – which will come, ultimately, from Britain’s electricity bills. Manufacturing is likely to be lost to nations with cheaper power. Although reducing emissions is a worthy aim, if those emissions only go abroad, it won’t help the climate. Helm thinks it would be better to move more slowly, and to be cautious about phasing out fossil fuels.

Marginal pricing: the alternatives

The present Government has looked into having a “split market” – separate pricing systems for renewables and the rest. A linked idea, which has been pushed and fought against by opposing armies of lobbyists, is “zonal pricing”: replacing a single national price for electricity with different prices for different zones, lower in areas with cheap generation nearby.

Industrial areas such as Teesside and Grangemouth that are near offshore wind farms could, with lower prices, attract energy intensive industries such as steel, fertilisers, or data centres. Wind farms would no longer need to be paid to be turned off. Octopus Energy CEO Greg Jackson thinks the scheme would bring costs down by £5bn a year. The Government rejected zonal pricing in July. It was deemed too politically difficult: it would risk creating a “postcode lottery”, with customers in some regions paying more than others. Ministers also concluded that it would be too difficult to implement. Marginal pricing is a fiendishly complex issue, but it was thought to be the best method of setting prices in a way that incentivises investors and generators, and ensures a reliable supply. Ministers are nervous of anything that might interfere with security of supply.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v8EJn4Xg9jEsWfhUYiLzyV.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 22:00:14.258379

Ever wonder if life is really different in a blue or red state? Recently, u/ftwclem asked, ""If you moved from a red state to a blue state, did it actually get better?"" They admitted to staying in Texas for family reasons but regularly daydreaming about what life might be like somewhere more politically aligned with their values. Is the grass really greener — or does everything feel just as hopeless, no matter where you live? Here's what 19 people who made the move had to say:

1. ""I moved from Texas to California in 2015 as a poor single mother with two elementary-aged children. Life improved so much that it is hard to quantify or describe all the ways. There are so many social safety nets in California, where there were almost none in Texas. Community college is free, and I was able to go all the way through and get my master’s degree thanks to state-funded programs. My children and I now live comfortably without assistance. The quality of life, the people, the beauty, and culture that we're surrounded by in California are priceless. You could not pay me enough to live in a red state again.""

2. ""Though the political makeup of the city I moved from and the city I moved to are roughly the same, Ohio's state-level policies threatened me in a way Illinois's absolutely do not. And since I can handle the increased cost of living, it's worth it to me (though feasibly one could move to an inexpensive part of Illinois, if you're not as concerned about day-to-day interactions).""

Published September 26, 2025 at 10:14 AM CDT

A company cofounded by Bill Gates will explore building a reactor in Kansas. It would generate power without emissions, but environmental groups have concerns.

One of the companies leading the charge to deploy safer, smaller, faster-to-build nuclear reactors is hoping to find a site for one in Kansas.

TerraPower, cofounded by former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, began construction last month on its first power plant of this kind in southwest Wyoming as a $4 billion demonstration project cofunded by the U.S. Department of Energy.

Now it is interested in building one in Kansas to generate power in utility company Evergy’s service area.

TerraPower, Evergy and state officials announced this week that they have signed a memorandum of understanding to explore the prospects. They issued a news release featuring enthusiastic quotes from Democratic Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and both of the state’s Republican U.S. senators.

“We need to explore all available sources to power the future of our great state,” Kelly said.

“Nuclear energy is the way of the future,” U.S. Senator Roger Marshall said.

But the reaction from clean energy advocates in Kansas is mixed. The news sparked some interest in emissions-free power generation, but also concern about the price tag and whether the project would attract more data centers to the region with significant needs for electricity and water. Kansas faces water sustainability challenges.

“ We want to make sure that the plans we’re making for the clean energy future are affordable,” said Dorothy Barnett, executive director of the Climate + Energy Project. “ I am increasingly concerned for our friends and neighbors who are struggling to pay their utility bills.”

Kansas regulators signed off on $128 million in rate hikes for Evergy this week.

The Sierra Club said Kansas has financially smarter options for powering its economy.

“We’ve got plenty of roofs here in Kansas,” said Zack Pistora, state director for the Sierra Club in Kansas. “Or backyards that could say, ‘Hey, we’ll be glad to lease our roof or our land for solar, Evergy. You can pay us instead of paying this out-of-state company.’”

Looking for potential sites in Kansas

An official with the Kansas Department of Commerce said regional power demand is projected to more than double over the next decade. That’s according to the regional grid operator, the Southwest Power Pool.

“We need to be ready for this,” said Paul Hughes, the department’s lead on matters involving megaprojects. “And I’m not saying it has to be this (nuclear) project, but we do need to act in ensuring that Kansas isn’t effectively blocked out of future opportunities because of the availability or unavailability of power in the state.”

Asked why TerraPower is specifically considering Kansas, Hughes noted that Evergy already has experience with nuclear energy. It owns Wolf Creek Nuclear Generating Station 60 miles south of Topeka, the state’s only nuclear plant. By contrast, some states don’t have nuclear power and some have restrictions or outright bans.

This fall Kansas State University launched a nuclear engineering program.

It’s not yet clear where in Kansas TerraPower would want to build a nuclear reactor. The company will need to consider proximity to transmission lines and to a workforce. It will also need to find communities interested in the project, and will need to ensure that any potential sites have stable underground geology.

Hughes said the state commerce department will help facilitate the discussions.

“We can help communities articulate their interest in the project or disinterest in the project,” he said.

Communities that aren’t interested will be passed over for consideration, he said.

“These (projects) just don’t go well when you try to force feed them into a community — and all parties to this agreement understand that,” Hughes said.

Advanced nuclear reactors and TerraPower

For decades, logistics and expenses have held nuclear energy back. Conventional nuclear plants not only have high price tags but also a propensity to greatly exceed their budgets and to take longer than expected to build.

Modular advanced nuclear designs are smaller than conventional plants and represent a potential industry turning point that is decades in the making. The companies developing them say they will be safer and faster to build.

However, none of the designs like TerraPower’s are yet in commercial operation in the U.S.

The Trump administration has thrown its weight behind advanced nuclear power, drawing a mix of praise and criticism. This spring it unveiled executive orders and plans to reconsider some regulations, press for approval of projects, and use the controversial Department of Government Efficiency to overhaul the nation’s independent regulator of nuclear energy.

Kansas officials said they’re aware of the development.

“ It is on our radar,” Hughes said. “We want to make sure that (Kansas is) doing this safely and that’s what we’ll do.”

TerraPower expects its Wyoming project to come online this decade. The company says that the project will create 1,600 jobs during peak construction, after which about 250 jobs will remain at the site for day-to-day operations.

The company’s design, the Natrium reactor, uses liquid sodium rather than water to envelop uranium fuel. This liquid has a far higher boiling point – 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit – which the company says adds to the reactor’s safety.

The reactor heats the liquid sodium, which in turn heats pipes full of molten salt. The pipes carry the molten salt to a storage tank that serves as a power battery. The salt heats tubes of water, creating pressurized steam. The steam turns a turbine to generate electricity. The salt then cycles back to the reactor area to be heated up again.

The battery represents a key departure from a conventional plant such as Evergy’s Wolf Creek. The facility would store the heated molten salt in a tank and draw upon it as needed to meet demand.

Wolf Creek can’t adjust its output to the ebb and flow of electricity demand or to account for sunny and windy weather generating more from solar and wind farms.

What do clean energy advocates think?

Barnett, from the Climate + Energy Project, wants to hear more details.

Generating electricity without pumping out greenhouse gases is “one of the most important things as we think about our climate future,” she said.

Additionally, her organization wants power plants to pair well with renewable energy and is interested in the efforts of advanced nuclear designs to do that.

But she’s skeptical because many people already struggle to pay their utility bills and Evergy not only got the greenlight this week from Kansas regulators for $128 million in rate hikes, it also got permission this summer to build and co-own two new natural gas-burning power plants.

“ At what point is it just too expensive for us to just keep having Evergy build and build?” Barnett said.

The Wyoming project suggests that an advanced nuclear facility would cost billions.

Also, she has questions about potential indirect effects. For example, even if the reactor doesn’t require much water because it uses liquid sodium as a coolant, data centers do. This means the reactor’s impact on water use in Kansas could depend on how the power gets used.

Pistora, with the Sierra Club in Kansas, said Evergy and TerraPower will need to answer a slew of pressing questions.

“Does this make economic sense from a cost and benefit standpoint?” he asked. “What about the water use? What about the (nuclear) waste disposal? … Where are we going to get this nuclear material and where’s it going to be mined?”

A few utility-scale battery projects have been proposed in Kansas, Pistora said, which could help store energy from renewable sources or existing fossil fuel plants for when the power is needed.

Like Barnett, he pointed to the recent approval of Evergy’s requests to hike its rates and to build new natural gas power plants.

“ Now we’re hearing about nuclear, which is the most expensive power out there,” he said. “Why are we going for these big-ticket, capital-intensive, expensive energy projects?”

Adding to the already impressive 12 gigawatts that energy developers brought to the grid this year, the additional 21 GW planned for the rest of the year would set a record for capacity additions if all 64 GW come online this year.

The Energy Information Agency revealed that wind, solar, and battery storage have become more prevalent options for new capacity in modern-day America. Booyed by the embrace of alternative energy solutions in Texas. About 27% (3.2 GW) of the solar capacity added so far in 2025 is in Texas.

In 2024, Texas surpassed California as the state with the most utility-scale solar capacity. Pointing to the change in the type of energy being developed in the United States over the past two decades.

Coal-fired power plants face an uncertain future in the United States energy sector

While the Trump administration has implemented the new executive orders aimed at keeping the lights on for the coal sector in the United States, it’s hard to argue with facts. And the evidence suggests that the American public is wary of coal power and instead favors the safe and reliable energy creation that solar, wind, and battery storage present.

More than 3.6 GW of coal-powered energy has now been delayed or canceled, including plans to retire the coal-fired Units 1 and 2 of Brandon Shore. Which only adds to the importance of the solar sector in the United States.

The US Energy Information Agency has stated that “If current retirement intentions are realized, coal-fired power plants will account for 71% of the retired capacity this year, followed by natural gas (19%).”

“There is considerable downside risk for the solar industry if the federal permitting environment creates more constraints for solar projects. The solar industry is already navigating dramatic policy changes as a result of HR1. Further uncertainty from federal policy actions is making the business environment for the solar industry incredibly challenging.” – Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie

The SEIA wrote to DOI Secretary Doug Burgum last month, raising its concerns

The Solar Energy Industries Association wrote a letter to the Department of the Interior Secretary, Doug Burgum, who is a Trump appointee, regarding their concerns over the current administration’s policies.

“Solar and storage are the backbone of America’s energy future, delivering the majority of new power to the grid at the lowest cost to families and businesses. Instead of unleashing this American economic engine, the Trump administration is deliberately stifling investment, which is raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardizing the reliability of our electric grid. But no matter what policies this administration releases, the solar and storage industry will continue to grow, because the market is demanding what we’re delivering: reliable, affordable, American-made energy.” – SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper.

Despite the Trump administration’s best efforts, solar remains a crucial part of the American energy sector",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Depositphotos_144002683_XL-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 15:00:39.289808

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently released data indicating that total U.S. CO2 emissions fell by 20% over the period, even as population rose by 14%.
The result is a 30% decrease in per capita CO2 emissions.
The reductions by state range from 49% in Maryland down to 1% in Mississippi.
Transportation is generally the biggest factor on the east and west costs, with electric power the primary source in 18 states.","There is some very good news on the climate front. Every U.S. state reduced per capita carbon dioxide emissions from primary energy consumption between 2005 and 2023. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently released data indicating that total U.S. CO2 emissions fell by 20% over the period, even as population rose by 14%. The result is a 30% decrease in per capita CO2 emissions.

The reductions by state range from 49% in Maryland down to 1% in Mississippi. Texas had 24% lower per capita CO2 emissions in 2023 than in 2005, a remarkable amount given that the state experienced 77% growth in real output, a 34% increase in population, and an eight-fold surge in oil and gas production. States at or near the same or smaller levels of reduction include California, Vermont, New York, Washington, Oregon, North Dakota, Rhode Island, and several others. These areas exhibit wide differences in climate policy, geographic size, industrial base, rate of economic development, and virtually every other measure, indicating the diversity of approaches available to address this critical issue.

In Maryland, the key to the decrease was reducing coal from 56% of its input fuel for electric generation in 2005 to only 5% in 2023; natural gas increased from 4% to 41% over the period, and some wind and solar came online. Similar coal retirement and replacement went on in all of the states with the largest reductions.

Transportation is generally the biggest factor on the east and west costs, with electric power the primary source in 18 states. Texas is one of only four states where the industrial sector (which includes manufacturing and agriculture) is the largest source of CO2, another underlying indicator of economic vitality.

While the sheer size and economic strength of the state results in a high level of overall emissions, the reductions indicate genuine and meaningful gains. In fact, Texas has improved dramatically in terms of far lower emissions on both a per capita and a per million dollars in gross product basis than in the past. These reductions take on even greater significance in light of recent scientific research at MIT which reveals that declines in carbon concentrations can be a catalyst to climate regeneration.

A key factor in the improvement in U.S. emissions has been increased electricity generation from natural gas, which releases about half the CO2 per unit of energy as coal, as well as gains in wind and solar. Significant reductions in carbon dioxide released even as business activity has flourished is good news indeed, especially when coupled with credible analysis indicating that such efforts can move the needle on crucial climate issues. Much remains to be done, but the success is notable. Stay safe!",https://www.oaoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ray-Perryman-24.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 15:00:53.148435
,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-09-27 17:55:58+00:00,News From The States,"Northwest Native Nations could lose hundreds of millions in federal funding, report says",News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/northwest-native-nations-could-lose-hundreds-millions-federal-funding-report-says,"A new report from Portland State University found that budget cuts under President Donald Trump’s new spending bill threaten nearly half of federal funding allocated to federally recognized Native American and Alaska Native nations last year.
Fast Horse says there are serious concerns among Northwest tribes about further cuts to vital programs ranging from health and wellness to early childhood education.
Federal dollars to help Northwest tribes bolster their infrastructure against the increasing threats from wildfire, drought and sea-level rise could also be slashed.
In 2024, Clean Air Act related funds were used to fund 15 projects for 12 Northwest tribes.
In 2024, Native American tribes received just 1.7% of federal energy and environment spending, despite Native people making up 2.9% of the U.S. population.","A new report from Portland State University found that budget cuts under President Donald Trump’s new spending bill threaten nearly half of federal funding allocated to federally recognized Native American and Alaska Native nations last year.

Roughly $530 million of the $1.19 billion allocated to Northwest tribal nations in fiscal year 2024 — used to fulfill the federal government’s trust and treaty obligations to Native American and Alaska Native tribes — is at risk of being cut. The congressionally allocated funds serve myriad functions for tribes in the Northwest, including providing clean drinking water, affordable housing, schools, transit and land management. Funding is decided by Congress on a yearly basis and can be disbursed over a period of time that exceeds the calendar year it is allocated.

“All across the board tribes are worried about the funding cuts that are happening right now,” said Serina Fast Horse, who is Lakota and Blackfeet and serves as the co-director of the Northwest Environmental Justice Center, which provides grant application assistance and advising to Indigenous communities in the Northwest.

Fast Horse says there are serious concerns among Northwest tribes about further cuts to vital programs ranging from health and wellness to early childhood education. The report warns of vulnerabilities to programs and grants that tribes rely on for resilience in the face of climate change, like improving home weatherization, managing forestland and renovating aging homes. Federal dollars to help Northwest tribes bolster their infrastructure against the increasing threats from wildfire, drought and sea-level rise could also be slashed.

The Portland State report found millions in Clean Air Act funding could also go away — the Environmental Protection Agency earmarked nearly $2 million in 2024 for Northwest tribes in a series of grants for monitoring air quality and pollution. Much of the congressionally allocated funding has yet to be distributed to tribes and is now at risk of being cut altogether.

The report demonstrates how proposed major reductions across the federal government, including at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Interior and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, could reverberate across Indian Country.

Tribal officials shared concerns that drastic cuts could cause the federal government to fall short of trust and treaty obligations that mandate the federal government support tribal services, uphold tribal sovereignty and protect tribal treaty resources — responsibilities that courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have repeatedly upheld.

“All the funding reductions addressing clean water, air and dealing with climate change have impacts on the Tribes’ culture and treaty protected resources,” said William E. Ray Jr., chair of the Klamath Tribes.

Researchers declined to disclose specific projects at risk of elimination for fear of retaliation, and a number of tribes and tribal organizations declined to comment to InvestigateWest, citing similar concerns.

“Trump and Congressional Republicans are wreaking havoc on Tribal communities with their ‘Big, Ugly BETRAYAL’ of a law that arbitrarily cuts many programs supporting folks in Indian Country, where chronic underfunding is already impacting services and exacerbating disparities,” said Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat.

He added that the federal government plays an outsized role in funding essential services to tribal communities, including health care, education and public safety, and that the Inflation Reduction Act took important steps in advancing funding for water infrastructure and environmental programs for tribes.

In 2024, Clean Air Act related funds were used to fund 15 projects for 12 Northwest tribes. The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, and the Tulalip Tribes are some of the Native American nations set to receive research grants for improving air quality and pollution monitoring. Among 12 tribes selected for funding, several of them focus on minimizing exposure to poor air quality and harmful pollutants to their elderly and medically vulnerable residents. Other tribes intend to study impacts of pollutants on important first foods — culturally significant staple foods consumed before colonization — that officials say are critical to improving health outcomes for their citizens.

Researchers at PSU examined 469 programs impacted by President Trump’s reversal of former President Joe Biden’s Executive Order 14008, which sought to address climate change and created a number of environmental justice initiatives. Sixty of the programs identified by researchers were specifically named in the Republican-led spending bill for cuts, and 17 of those provided funding directly to tribes. The programs accounted for roughly 35% of all federal investments in tribes in 2024. The report says not all of the funding will be cut, but a significant portion of it could be.

The cuts come at a time when Native Americans and Alaska Natives already have limited access to federal services and funds, according to a December 2024 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog. It found when tribes had to compete with other entities for federal funding, they may receive a small portion of the total amount, and that limited access to federal services and funds contributes to known disparities for Native Americans and Alaska Natives compared to other Americans.

Of the $20.15 billion in federal funding that went to tribes between 2010 and 2024, tribes within the boundaries of Idaho received a total of $304.56 million, Washington tribes $1.81 billion, Oregon tribes $690.76 million, and Alaska Native tribes received $2.35 billion.

Other programs at risk of being cut include the EPA’s embattled Environmental Justice Government-to-Government Program, which funded initiatives by states, tribes and local governments to support activities that lead to measurable environmental or public health impacts.

Under that program, in 2023, the EPA awarded the Tulalip Tribes $977,000 to work in conjunction with the Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakama Nation to create a tool to detect which homes are at greatest risk from wildfire smoke infiltration and dangerously hot weather, which are growing issues affecting both communities.

While the federal government has repeatedly affirmed its obligations to tribes, actual allocations remain disproportionately small compared to population figures. In 2024, Native American tribes received just 1.7% of federal energy and environment spending, despite Native people making up 2.9% of the U.S. population.

Between 2010 and 2024, tribes within the bounds of Idaho, Washington and Oregon received roughly $2.81 billion in federal investments in energy and environmental infrastructure, which represents roughly 14% of the $20 billion in allocations made to tribes nationwide.

The researchers determined that programs funded under the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s 2022 climate, health and tax law, are at particular risk of being eliminated. The funding allocated to tribes under the IRA represented a historic investment in infrastructure in Indian Country, more than doubling energy and infrastructure investment from $1.51 billion nationwide to $3.94 billion in 2024, around .04% of total federal grant spending obligations for 2024.

“When you put them in the context of how much money the federal government actually spends on certain things, it’s pennies on the dollar,” said Sophie Lalande, a co-author of the PSU report.

Soon after taking office and without consulting Congress, the Trump administration suspended some grants that tribal communities used heavily, such as community change grants, distributed by the EPA’s Offices of Environmental Justice and of External Civil Rights Compliance during the Biden administration, to support climate resilience and clean energy. Distributed as a part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the grants were suspended as part of the Trump administration’s anti-diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.

The grants helped tribal communities in the Northwest tremendously, according to Fast Horse.

“They were providing hundreds of thousands of dollars to communities for infrastructure improvements, like access to clean drinking water and climate resilience hubs, just really essential pieces of community development for health and safety of communities,” she said.

The report stresses a multiplier effect from investments made in tribal communities. Infrastructure dollars invested on tribal lands often serve as anchors for broader local development, since tribal lands often share regional infrastructure like power grids, roads or water systems with non-Native communities, with the power of dollars rippling outward into surrounding rural towns and cities.

Bobby Cochran, a researcher with Portland State University and senior project manager at the National Policy Consensus Center, co-authored the report.

“We just haven’t made a major investment in infrastructure since the ’60s or ’70s, so this wasn’t fluffy,” he said. “It’s really important stuff that was just trying to play catch-up.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-95/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_2130-1024x6831758978260.jpeg?h=199d8c1f&itok=1VtCohkB,N,,2025-09-27 17:00:49.774909

UK new trade measures with emerging economies

On 10 July, the UK Government announced new measures to simplify imports from emerging economies and make it easier for businesses to trade with the UK. Goods from countries such as Nigeria, Sri Lanka and the Philippines will enter tariff free. Bangladesh and Cambodia will continue to benefit from zero tariffs on clothing and electronics. The measures are facilitated via the ‘Developing Countries Trading Scheme’. They aim to build resilience into supply chains and open up new opportunities. The updated rules are part of the UK’s Trade for Development offer. This is designed to boost partner countries’ economies and provide UK businesses and consumers with access to quality, affordable goods.

Impact: The announcement could help businesses secure existing supply chains, particularly in clothing and electronics. It could also provide new supply routes and opportunities with emerging markets.

UK-France industrial strategy partnership

On 11 July, the UK and France announced a new Industrial Strategy Partnership, the first initiative of its kind in Europe. It is intended to enhance economic cooperation and attract significant investment. Over £1 billion in confirmed investment deals were secured, which are expected to generate thousands of highly skilled jobs within the UK. This initiative aligns with the UK’s Modern Industrial Strategy, the ten-year plan designed to foster a resilient, high-skilled economy.

The partnership will prioritise key growth sectors such as technology, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing. Advancing the green and digital transition and reinforce economic resilience.

Impact: A key component of the partnership is strengthening co-operation to secure supply chains around critical minerals. This is expected to increase methodologies for supply chain analysis and mapping in shared priority sectors of interest. For businesses using critical minerals in their products, this partnership could be a welcome development.

UK-India trade deal signed

On 24 July, the UK and India signed a trade deal, first announced on 6 May. It aims to create trading opportunities between the countries. The deal strives for job creation as a result of Indian investment, export wins, and liberalised tariffs. Commitments have also been made for closer collaboration in the fields of defence, education, climate, technology and innovation. Alongside cooperating on matters of national security and organised crime.

Impact: Indian businesses could benefit from greater access to UK markets, particularly in competitive sectors such as textiles and food processing. The deal could provide new opportunities in global supply chains. The UK Government states that in the long term the deal is expected to increase bilateral trade by £25.5 billion, UK GDP by £4.8 billion and wages by £2.2 billion each year.

EU-US trade deal

On 27 July, the European Commission and US Administration agreed a new EU-US trade deal.

A 15% US tariff ceiling will apply to nearly all EU exports currently subject to reciprocal tariffs. Where the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff exceeds 15%, the MFN rate will apply.

Strategic EU products like aircraft and aircraft parts, certain chemicals, certain drug generics or natural resources will benefit from reduced tariffs to pre-2025 levels. Pharmaceuticals and semiconductors are temporarily subject to MFN tariffs pending the outcome of US Section 232 investigations. Alcohol tariffs remain unresolved.

The EU plans to spend $750 billion over three years on US LNG, oil, and nuclear energy to replace Russian supplies. It also plans to buy €40 billion in US AI chips to safeguard its technological leadership. EU companies have expressed intentions of $600 billion in additional investment in US sectors by 2029, alongside commitments to purchase US military equipment.

Impact: EU carmakers could benefit from a 15% US tariff cap, down from 25%, boosting supply chain stability. In pharmaceuticals, 15% US tariff may potentially raise costs. This is estimated to be between $13 billion and $19 billion. US tariffs on EU steel and aluminium imports will remain at 50%. Steel, aluminium, and copper sectors could be protected through joint tariff rate quotas and fair competition measures. Non-tariff barriers may be reduced via cooperation on mutual recognition of assessments in various industrial sectors. US agricultural producers gain €7.5 billion in improved EU access, while EU farmers retain protections for sensitive products. Enhanced cooperation on LNG and renewables could strengthen EU energy security.

For more insight on what businesses need to know see our EU–US Trade Deal briefing.

EU mutual recognition agreement with Canada

On 1 August, the EU-Canada AEO Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) officially entered into force, aiming to enhance trade security.

The agreement enables mutual recognition of the EU’s Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) and Canada’s Partners in Protection (PIP) programmes. With the intention of streamlining customs procedures for compliant businesses.

Impact: Businesses could benefit from faster customs clearance, and simplified compliance.

Automated data exchange improves supply chain transparency and reduces delays. The agreement may also enhance business continuity during disruptions, allowing priority clearance for certified operators in emergencies.

UK-EU deal to reduce border checks

On 18 August, the UK Government announced the suspension of extra border checks on live animal imports from the EU and specific animal and plant products from Ireland / Northern Ireland.

This comes ahead of a new sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) deal with the EU (first unveiled at the UK-EU summit in May). It will establish a UK-EU SPS zone and aims to make the trading of food both cheaper and easier. This could strengthen food supply chains.

A risk-based approach is being adopted to manage biosecurity and the position will be reviewable.

This suspension follows from the announcement in June that checks on medium risk fruit and vegetables from the EU would not be brought into force in July 2025 but suspended until end of January 2027.

Impact: The precise terms of the SPS agreement are still to be finalised. Businesses involved in food and agricultural supply could ultimately benefit from reduced costs.

US-Japan trade agreement implemented

On 5 September President Trump signed an Executive Order implementing a US-Japan trade framework. It confirms that a 15% tariff rate will apply to most imported Japanese goods. Where higher rate tariffs already apply they will continue to apply, with some sector-specific exceptions including for automotive and aerospace sectors. The order also makes generic pharmaceuticals, including ingredients and chemical precursors eligible for zero rate tariffs. Also detailed in the Executive Order are commitments made by Japan to invest $550 billion in critical industries the United States.

Impact: Exemptions to the new baseline tariffs aim to address supply chain vulnerabilities in key industries. Businesses in the automotive sector will benefit from the new baseline rate, as Japanese automobiles and auto-parts were previously subject to 25% tariffs.

Asia

China: First national standard for hazardous chemicals in electrical products

On 22 August, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) announced a new mandatory national standard. Requirements for the Restriction of the Use of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Products will be effective 1 August 2027. The standard restricts four heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium) and six persistent organic pollutants (including polybrominated biphenyls, diphenyl ethers, and four phthalates). Requirements cover labelling, disclosure, and traceability of hazardous substances.

MIIT’s stated aims include promotion of green supply chains, consumer health protection and encouraging digital labelling. The standard will form part of China’s broader Restriction of Hazardous Substances framework and aims to align with international standards.

Impact: Businesses that manufacture, import, or sell electrical and electronic products in China should take advantage of the transition period until August 2027. They may consider reviewing supply chains to ensure compliant materials, substance testing, and maintenance of detailed technical documentation. Failure to comply may result in exclusion from the market.

China: New guidelines for strengthening financial support for industrialization issued

On 5 August 2025, the People’s Bank of China and six other authorities published guidelines to strengthen financial support for new industrialization. The stated aim is to establish a financial system tailored to support the development of the advanced manufacturing sector by 2027. Support measures focus on industry innovation, developing modern industry systems, balanced regional growth, and improving financial institutions. The guidelines call for optimized financial tools to support emerging industries such as connected vehicles, semiconductors and advanced manufacturing. Upgrading of traditional industries, and financing of supply chains is also addressed.

Impact: The guidelines are intended to encourage and accelerate investment. Critical and emerging industries may benefit from strengthened measures to support supply chains. Businesses in traditional industries may be able to access increased financial support to develop their strategies in digitalization and sustainable operations.

China: Battery technology export restrictions amended

On 15 July, the Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Technology (MOFCOM) updated the Catalogue of Technologies Subject to Export Prohibitions and Restrictions. Now included are key technologies related to:

battery cathode materials, including lithium iron phosphate (LFP)

lithium extraction and processing

non-ferrous metal smelting and rolling technologies, including gallium extraction technologies

These technologies are critical to the clean energy, electric vehicle (EV), and semiconductor industries. LFP cathode materials technology is central to the production of cost-effective and high-performance EV batteries. Gallium extraction technologies are used to produce a critical material used in semiconductors.

MOFCOM’s stated aim is to balance technological development of technologies used in sensitive sectors with national economic security.

Impact: Since 15 July 2025, manufacturers exporting these technologies are required to obtain a government licence. Businesses that engage in joint ventures, licensing, or technical services agreements may also require licences. There are several steps to gaining approval for exporting restricted technologies, with applications potentially subject to multiple reviews.

Europe

EU: Safety of products online – first sweep to check compliance

On 18 July, EU Consumer Safety Network published the results of its first product safety sweep under the General Product Safety Regulation (GPSR). This focussed on childcare articles (such as baby carriers, bottles, soothers and highchairs). It covered online marketplaces’ compliance with obligations under the GPSR. It focussed on the very large online platforms (under the Digital Services Act) in addition to smaller providers and assessed them against the criteria of:

display of minimum product safety information and traceability

enforcement activities of the market surveillance authorities

registration with the Safety Gate Portal

Impact: As these sweeps commence, now could be a good time for businesses to check compliance with the requirements of the GPSR. Any supply chain issues identified with third party suppliers could help avoid potential regulatory action and reputational damage.

EU: Strategies for stockpiling and medical countermeasures

On 9 July 2025, the European Commission unveiled its first-ever EU strategies for stockpiling and medical countermeasures. The plan calls for building and coordinating reserves of essential items for crises like pandemics, natural disasters, or military threats. It includes doubling funding for the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) to €200 million by 2027 and creating a Medical Countermeasures Accelerator.

Impact: This strategy could prompt businesses to reassess supply chain resilience and inventory management. Demand for medical and safety supplies may raise. Businesses working in logistics and warehousing could see demand rise for specialist storage and distribution. Collaboration between civil and defence sectors may open new procurement avenues. UK

EU: 18th package of sanctions against Russia adopted

On 18 July, the EU adopted its 18th package of sanctions against Russia. It expands restrictions on finance, energy, and trade in advanced military and industrial goods. New measures aim to prevent circumvention via third countries, introducing a ‘catch-all’ authorisation for certain exports if they might end up in Russia. Bans on “Economically Critical Goods” used in construction and transport are extended, and new designations include third-country entities involved in supplying military goods to Russia. Similar restrictions now apply to Belarus, with additional sanctions designations targeting its military sector. These changes are designed to disrupt Russia’s military-industrial complex and increase the overall effectiveness of EU sanctions.

Impact: It is anticipated that there will be an increasing focus on ensuring the effectiveness of the sanctions imposed against Russia, and therefore greater emphasis on extraterritorial measures. Accordingly, businesses will need to be even more mindful of potential stakeholder risks, and step up compliance measures across all stages of the supply chain. Businesses should also look out for the 19th package of sanctions – its presentation is currently delayed due to negotiations between EU Member States as to how be to respond to the Trump administration’s demand that the EU be more proactive in depriving Russia of energy revenues.

For a more detailed overview of the 18th package, please see our briefing here.

EU: Updates to EU Dual-Use Export Control List

On 8 September, the European Commission announced updates to the EU Dual-Use List (as set out in Annex I of Regulation 2021/821).

The 2025 amendments include a number of new entries to the EU Dual-Use List, including:

quantum technology (including quantum computers, cryogenic components, parametric signal amplifiers, cryogenic cooling systems and cryogenic wafer probes)

semiconductor equipment (including manufacturing, testing equipment and materials)

advanced computing components

high-temperature application coatings

peptide synthesisers (that are automated and capable of generating peptides at a system synthesis scale of 1mmol or greater)

The new controls will enter into force following the usual two-month scrutiny period for the European Council and European Parliament, allowing stakeholders to assess the impact and prepare for compliance.

Impact: Exporters across the EU should review the updated list to determine whether their products now fall under the revised controls. This is particularly relevant for companies operating in quantum computing, semiconductor manufacturing and biotechnology fields. It is important to emphasize that some of the new control entries represent unilateral controls by the EU on items, including certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment, which are not currently subject to UK export controls. This misalignment may reflect a broader shift away from streamlining controls across jurisdictions to unilateral and protectionist measures impacting emerging technologies. For businesses trading globally and impacted by these new entries, it will be important to identify the differences between the relevant control lists and to obtain appropriate licences to continue cross-border trade.

EU: New guidance on “best efforts obligations”

In August, the EU Sanctions Helpdesk published an article, ‘The “Best Efforts” Rule under sanctions targeting Russia and Belarus’, providing new guidance on the obligation that EU parents to undertake ‘best efforts’ to ensure that its non-EU subsidiaries do not undermine EU sanctions targeting Russia and Belarus. This requirement was introduced in June 2024.

Importantly, it encourages EU parents to apply the ‘best efforts’ obligation to all EU sanctions, even if the legal requirement only applies to EU sanctions on Russia and Belarus. It also clarifies:

the act of ‘undermining’ sanctions refers to actions that weaken the effectiveness of sanctions without (in)directly violating them, which is different to a breach or circumvention of sanctions

‘best efforts’ involves a higher standard than ‘reasonable efforts’, and comprises all actions that are necessary and feasible in the context of the particular situation and business.

Impact: Businesses should review this guidance carefully to understand its obligations under EU law. Businesses are encouraged to plan ahead – the ‘best efforts’ obligation may only apply to EU sanctions on Russia and Belarus, but sanctions compliance programmes should prepare for the event that this is extended to all EU sanctions.

EU: New import rules apply from 1st September 2025

As of 1st September 2025, the Import Control System 2 (ICS2) is fully deployed across all transport modes, including road and rail. ICS2 is the EU system for collecting cargo details on all goods entering or passing through its borders.

ICS2 demands detailed cargo data before arrival, replacing the former system to improve risk analysis and border security. Timely and accurate Entry Summary Declarations (ENS) are now mandatory. Some Member States and Northern Ireland requested temporary derogations to ease transition for small businesses.

Impact: All businesses shipping in and through the EU must comply with the new rules. Inaccurate data may trigger shipment holds, investigation and potential fines.

UK

UK: Proposals to address late payment culture

On 30 July, the UK Government announced the Small Business Plan, with a focus on a package of proposals aimed at tackling late payment culture, in particular for SME suppliers.

Key proposals include:

limiting payment terms to 60 days, with the possibility of reducing this to 45 days after 5 years

a 30-day invoice verification period, so that invoices cannot be disputed once this has expired

statutory interest on late payment mandatory, removing the ability for parties to use a lower interest rate and making the interest payment automatic

reporting requirements on statutory interest both owed and paid, in order to aid transparency

financial penalties to businesses that persistently pay their suppliers late

investigations into poor payment practices, including acting as arbitrator in disputes and imposing arbitration awards

enhance scrutiny of large companies’ payment practices at audit committee and board level

A consultation on these proposals closes on 23 October 2025.

Impact: If implemented the proposals would supplement the voluntary Fair Payment Code. They could impact all businesses, but particularly large businesses within scope of the payment practices reporting regime. Businesses should review these proposals and consider the impact that the proposed reforms would have on their payment practices and contract terms.

UK: Report on inquiry into forced labour in international supply chains published

On 24 July, the UK Joint Committee on Human Rights published its report on its inquiry into forced labour in international supply chains.

The purpose of the inquiry was to consider the UK legal and voluntary framework. It aimed to check its effectiveness in managing the risks of exposure to forced labour in the UK market.

Key findings and recommendations include:

goods that are produced or part-produced using forced labour are being sold in the UK

the UK is falling behind international partners in its approach to forced labour in supply chains

the reporting duty in Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 should be strengthened

there is a willingness in the UK business sector to implement mandatory human rights due diligence; to do so would create a level playing field without putting responsible businesses at a disadvantage

new legislation is needed to establish

whilst the UK includes provisions on human rights and labour rights in some of its international agreements, there is no official policy on approach to this and no mechanisms to assess the impact of these clauses, and this should be addressed

the green energy transition creates specific risks of forced labour in supply chains because of the reliance on critical minerals and polysilicon

Impact: The inquiry will help inform the Government’s review of measures to tackle forced labour and increase transparency in global supply chains. This was promised in the December 2024 response to the House of Lords Modern Slavery Act 2015 Committee report. The Government now has two months to respond to the report. It is unclear whether it will commit to take legislative action in this area, and if it is likely to see a shift towards mandatory human rights due diligence.

UK: Product Regulation and Metrology Act 2025

On 21 July, the Product Regulation and Metrology Bill received Royal Assent, becoming the Product Regulation and Metrology Act 2025 (PRM Act). It aims to create a framework that gives the Secretary of State powers to make regulations to reduce or mitigate risks posed by products. This includes holding online marketplaces to account for unsafe products sold via their platforms. Certain categories of product are excluded from the scope of the PRM Act, including food, plants, animal by-products and products of animal origin, aircraft and their components, military equipment and medicines and medical devices.

The Government has announced its intention to use the PRM Act to introduce new requirements on online marketplaces to:

prevent unsafe products being made available to consumers

ensure that their sellers comply with product safety laws

provide consumers with relevant product information

cooperate with regulators

Impact: The actions of manufacturers, importers and distributors along a supply chain could come under increased regulatory scrutiny. The UK Government has indicated that they are prepared to enact further legislation as global supply chains get more complex and interconnected.

UK: Tax implications for umbrella companies

On 21 July, the UK Government announced draft legislation forming part of the draft Finance Bill, amending Part 2 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (ITEPA 2003). It aims to make recruitment agencies accountable for Pay As You Earn (PAYE) on payments made on or after 6 April 2026 to workers supplied through umbrella companies (or the end client, where there is no agency).

The legislation aims to make the agency and umbrella company jointly and severally liable. Allowing HMRC to pursue either or both. If there is more than one agency in the supply chain, the rules will apply to the agency that has the direct contract with the end client to supply the worker.

Impact: Businesses should ensure their supply chain documentation and due diligence meet UFLPA compliance. Transparent supply chain documentation, meeting all import requirements, should help mitigate enforcement risks and subsequent reputational damage.

For more insight on the draft legislation, see our briefing.

GB/Northern Ireland: New powers to impose ‘not for EU’ labelling on goods on the GB market

On 1 July, the Marking of Retail Goods Regulations 2025 came into force. The Northern Ireland Retail Movement Scheme (Scheme) makes it easier to move goods from Great Britain (GB) to Northern Ireland (NI). In order to come within scope of the scheme, goods have to be individually labelled as “not for EU”.

These new regulations are intended to stop businesses from pulling out of the NI market because of these labelling requirements. Empowering the Secretary of State for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs to introduce ‘not for EU’ labelling for specified categories of retail goods that are placed on the GB market. In other words, the labelling requirements become the same for those goods in both the NI and GB markets. This can only happen if there is evidence that the supply of a retail good is, or is likely to be, seriously adversely affected by relevant business operators withdrawing from the NI market because of the ‘not for EU’ labelling requirements under the Scheme.

Impact: These regulations will impact all businesses selling retail goods in GB and/or NI. These businesses could see supply chain disruption, but the Secretary of State has stated that the risks will be monitored.

UK: Office of Trade Sanctions Implementation publishes guidance on sanctions circumvention

On 4 August, the Office of Trade Sanctions Implementation (OTSI) published ‘Countering Russian sanctions evasion – guidance for businesses’, which aims to support UK businesses in identifying export control and sanctions circumvention practices. The guidance sets out key circumvention data, including a list of goods that are seen to be at a generally greater risk of being diverted and re-exported to Russia, and a list of third-countries where entities continue to sell sensitive goods to Russia. It also identifies a number of potential red flag indicators of export control and sanctions evasion.

The guidance also shares best practice in relation to due diligence. This is split into four categories: product, customer, transaction, and export destination.

Impact: Businesses are responsible for determining its specific sanctions risk exposure and implementing an appropriate set of safeguards and controls to mitigate such risk. These safeguards and controls, especially relating to due diligence practices, should be informed by the suggestions set out in this guidance to protect against emerging methods of circumvention.

UK: New sanctions targeting Russia’s oil fleet

On 12 September, the UK launched a new round of sanctions that target 70 ships transporting Russian oil, as well as 30 entities and individuals identified to be supplying the Russian military with equipment used in weapon systems. The UK Government states this is in response to Russian air strikes violating NATO airspace in Poland. Impact: Businesses should continue to review the lists of sanctioned entities and individuals and manage dealings accordingly to ensure compliance with all UK sanctions on Russia.

US

US: New tariffs on copper imports announced

On 30 July, the US Administration announced increased tariffs of 50% on imported copper products. The increased rate applies from 1 August 2025. It applies to semi-finished copper products, including copper pipes, wires, rods and sheets. It also applies to copper-intensive derivative goods, such as cables and electrical components. The new rate does not apply to raw forms of copper, anode and cathode material or copper scrap.

The proclamation also directs the Secretary of Commerce to take steps to boost the US domestic copper industry. This includes a requirement that 25% of high-quality copper scrap produced in the US must be sold in the US. Additionally, from 2027 25% of copper input materials produced in the US will be required to be sold domestically. The requirement will rise to 30% in 2028 and 40% in 2029. Copper input materials include products such as copper ores, concentrates, mattes, cathodes, and anodes.

Impact: Businesses importing affected copper products may experience price increases and disruption to their supply chains. Electric vehicle manufacturers, defence, electronics and AI industries could be particularly affected. The housebuilding sector may also be impacted, with potential increased construction costs.

US: Draft Ensuring Safe and Toxic-Free Foods Act of 2025

On 17 July, a Senate bill was introduced which aims to end the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) self-affirming pathway for food substances. It would require Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review for all GRAS determinations, including food ingredients, packaging and contact materials.

If enacted it would introduce public posting of GRAS notices and a 60-day comment period. It would also expand the FDA’s Food Chemical Reassessment Program. This would introduce reassessment of 10 substances every three years. Substances relying solely on industry self-GRAS determinations would be considered unsafe two years after enactment.

Impact: Businesses involved in food manufacture, packaging and contact materials may want to proactively assess their processes and supply chains. Businesses could expect increased scrutiny and reassessment of ingredients. Several large food and beverage companies have recently announced reformulation of popular products, particularly in relation to synthetic dyes.

US: Export Control Transparency Act becomes law

On 19 August 2025, the Maintaining American Superiority by Improving Export Control Transparency Act was signed into law. The new law aims to increase transparency in the US Department of Commerce export control system. The Department must now provide Congress with annual reports on all export license requests to covered entities.

In addition to aggregated statistics, the report must contain information on all license applications, including:

the name of the entity submitting the application

a brief description of the item (including the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) and reason for control, if applicable)

the name and location of the end-user

a value estimate

decision with respect to the license application or authorization

the date of submission

the date, location, and result of any end-use checks

Impact: Affected businesses may face increased scrutiny of their due diligence processes, including historic license applications. Significant penalties may apply if businesses are found to be in breach of export control rules. US businesses may consider reviewing their compliance practices, specifically those relating to end-user and end-use verification.

US: 407 product categories added to steel and aluminium tariffs

On August 19, the Department of Commerce announced an additional list of products to be covered by tariffs. The steel and aluminium content of these products will now be subject to a 50% duty rate. Among the 407 additional product categories now included are:

wind turbines and their parts and components

mobile cranes

bulldozers and other heavy equipment

railcars

furniture

compressors and pumps

The affected product list now encompasses industrial and chemical products, as well as consumer and personal care goods. There are three annual periods for public steel and aluminium product inclusion requests. The next opportunity opens in September and will be announced in the Federal Register.

Impact: Businesses should review the full list of affected product categories, and evaluate their sourcing strategies and pricing models if required. Importers will need to comply with new requirements, including verifying the origin and processing of affected products. Businesses may also consider preparing submissions for any products they believe should be excluded in the next inclusions request window.

US: Updated forced labour in China strategy

On August 19, the Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force of the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies, announced a new strategy to strengthen enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). This is aimed at preventing goods made with forced labour in China from entering the domestic market.

The new strategy adds five new high-risk sectors:

caustic soda

jujubes

copper

lithium

steel

The UFLPA Entity List now includes 144 banned entities. The update strengthens Customs and Border Protection’s ability to detect and stop such imports. It also aims to help domestic businesses reduce reputational and regulatory risks in their supply chains.

Impact: Businesses should ensure their supply chain documentation and due diligence meet UFLPA requirements. Transparent supply chain documentation could help prevent enforcement risks and any ensuing reputational damage.

The choices made now will ripple through our economy, our environment and our climate resilience for generations.

The Bermuda Environmental Sustainability Taskforce strongly urges the Regulatory Authority to chart an ambitious path towards renewable energy — and to firmly reject proposals to introduce liquefied natural gas. Bermuda must move away from fossil fuels, not towards new ones. LNG would bind our island to long-term carbon emissions, price volatility and environmental risks — directly undermining our climate commitments.

Since the last IRP was issued, the cost of renewable energy has plummeted. We see no reason why the RA could justify allowing LNG now after rejecting it seven years ago.

LNG is the wrong choice

LNG is not a bridge to the future; it is a roadblock.

• Climate incompatibility: LNG is still a fossil fuel. Building new LNG infrastructure would lock in decades of carbon emissions just as the world is racing to cut them

• Environmental risk: LNG facilities carry major safety and spill hazards. Methane leaks trap 40 times more heat than carbon dioxide over their 12-year life span

• Physical impracticality: Bermuda’s small size and dense development make it virtually impossible to build LNG terminals with the required safety buffer zones

• Economic liability: LNG prices are volatile, and costly infrastructure will likely become stranded assets as the world rapidly transitions to clean energy

• Lost opportunity: Every dollar spent on LNG delays investment in renewable energy systems that will power Bermuda’s future.

The case for renewables

A clean energy transition is not just environmentally sound; it’s economically smart. The next IRP should commit to:

• High renewable targets: Set clear milestones for solar, wind and battery storage to cut emissions, create local jobs, and strengthen energy independence

• Accelerated floating solar: The RA’s proposed 10mW floating solar system could supply a meaningful share of Bermuda’s daytime power while overcoming land constraints. This should be fast-tracked and paired with battery storage

• Vehicle-to-grid integration: Electric vehicles can serve as mobile batteries, storing surplus solar and feeding it back into the grid during peak demand. This would reduce the need for expensive peaker engines while empowering consumers

• Energy efficiency: Incentivise building retrofits, efficient appliances and stronger codes to lower consumption and household costs

• Equity and inclusion: Ensure a just transition that protects low-income residents and includes broad community participation, so the benefits of clean energy are shared by all

• Grid diversity: When a Category 5 hurricane hits Bermuda, barely a telephone pole will be left standing. The only people with power will be solar-energy producers with stand-alone battery storage or a parked EV car with battery. This is our future

A vision for 2040

Imagine a Bermuda powered by 80 per cent to 100 per cent renewables by 2040. Homes and businesses run on abundant local energy from rooftop and floating solar, supported by offshore wind and advanced storage systems. Our vehicles double as grid assets. Energy bills are stable, our air is cleaner and our economy is more resilient.

This is the future we can choose — if we act now.

No time to lose

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has said: “We are on the cusp of a new era. Fossil fuels are running out of road. The sun is rising on a clean energy age… There are no price spikes for sunlight. No embargoes on wind.”

He’s right. Ninety per cent of renewable projects are now cheaper than fossil fuels. The smart economic choice and the moral imperative are one and the same.

The Regulatory Authority has a rare opportunity to set Bermuda on a path towards clean, resilient, home-grown energy. BEST calls on the RA to reject LNG proposals and embrace a bold renewable vision. Doing so would cut emissions, enhance energy security, protect our fragile environment and build a healthier, more prosperous future for everyone who calls Bermuda home.

U.S. Rep. Michael Rulli’s bill drew support from enough Democrats in the House of Representatives that it is now moving to the Senate, which will consider whether it is necessary to back up the executive order that, among other things, called for reinstating the group that provides guidance on the future of coal technologies and markets.

And Rulli, R-Ohio, is right.

It is important for those making decisions about our energy future to have information and guidance from coal producers, users, equipment suppliers, state and local officials, and other stakeholders across the coal value chain.

Lawmakers will do well, however, to address criticisms of such a group by advising its members that — as an accessory to the federal government — it works for us, rather than to serve its own interests.

But if it is necessary to hear from coal stakeholders, in this era of all-of-the-above, responsible energy diversification and expansion, the Department of Energy should seek out other similar councils filled with representatives of other energy industries.

A quick glance at the lists of advisory councils and committees working with the department shows there is a State Energy Advisory Board, which develops recommendations “regarding initiation, design, implementation, and evaluation of federal energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.”

But if there are other groups advising on renewables, they are impossible to find amid the National Petroleum Council, Ultra-Deepwater Advisory Committee (for natural gas and other petroleum resources), even the Unconventional Resources Technology Advisory Committee … meant to “advise on the development and implementation of programs related to onshore unconventional natural gas and other petroleum resources.” The list is quite a long one.

Eyebrow-raising references to Paul Revere in his comments about the bill aside, Rulli is right that our energy future is a matter of national security.

For that very reason, lawmakers MUST remember that just as we need to hear from stakeholders in the coal industry, we also need to hear from those working to provide energy via renewables and other ways that are not simply the way things have always been done.

The third DRC-Africa Battery Metals Forum is set to take place on September 29-30, 2023, in Kolwezi, under the theme ""Leveraging foreign interest in critical minerals to boost the country's economy."" This premier engagement platform brings together stakeholders across Africa's critical minerals transition sector, marking a significant shift from previous editions held in Kinshasa to the heart of DRC's mining region.

What is the DRC-Africa Battery Metals Forum?

The DRC-Africa Battery Metals Forum serves as a vital platform connecting key players in the battery metals ecosystem. The event facilitates dialogue and collaboration among producers of essential battery metals including cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel, graphite, manganese, and rare earths, alongside investors, manufacturers, technology providers, traders, end-users, and policymakers.

According to the World Bank's ""Minerals for Climate Action"" report, production of minerals like graphite, lithium, and cobalt could increase by nearly 500% by 2050 to meet growing demand for clean energy technologies. Forums like this are critical in addressing the complex supply chain challenges these growth projections present.

The gathering focuses on practical solutions for developing sustainable supply chains while maximizing economic benefits for host countries. Previous forum editions have resulted in significant partnership announcements and policy initiatives aimed at improving traceability and sustainability in the battery metals investment sector.

Why is Kolwezi Significant for Battery Metals?

The Strategic Importance of Lualaba Province

Kolwezi, the capital of Lualaba Province, represents a crucial hub in the global battery metals supply chain. The region has maintained its status as a significant mining center since the 1940s, with particularly abundant reserves of:

Copper: Essential for electrical conductivity in batteries and EVs

Cobalt: Critical for cathode stability and performance in lithium-ion batteries

The selection of Kolwezi as the forum's venue underscores the growing recognition of Lualaba Province's central role in the battery metals ecosystem. According to the US Geological Survey, the Katangan Copperbelt, which includes Kolwezi, contains some of the world's highest-grade copper and cobalt deposits, with ore grades averaging 3-5% for copper and 0.2-0.4% for cobalt—significantly higher than global averages.

Geological Wealth and Production Capacity

Kolwezi sits atop one of the world's richest mineral belts, containing:

Approximately 45-50% of global cobalt reserves

Significant copper deposits estimated at over 70 million tonnes

Additional critical minerals including manganese and rare earths

The geological formation of the Katangan Copperbelt dates back approximately 800 million years, when sedimentary deposits rich in copper and cobalt were formed in ancient marine basins. Over time, these deposits were subjected to intense heat and pressure, creating the exceptionally high-grade ore bodies that define the region today.

This natural endowment positions Kolwezi as a cornerstone of the global energy transition, providing essential materials for renewable energy technologies and electric vehicle manufacturing. The region's deposits feature unique mineralogical characteristics that make them particularly valuable for battery production, including high cobalt-to-copper ratios and relatively low levels of arsenic and other problematic elements compared to competing sources.

Any legislative clarity that either affirms or modifies these crucial supports will significantly influence investor confidence and the operational strategies of solar companies.","Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH), a leading global supplier of microinverter-based solar and battery systems, has been battling severe stock turbulence from late 2024 through mid-2025. The company's shares have plummeted by approximately 69.1% from their 52-week high of $124.40 on September 19, 2024, reflecting a significant erosion of investor confidence. This sharp decline has been exacerbated by a confluence of industry-wide challenges and specific operational pressures, painting a challenging picture for the once-high-flying solar innovator.

The immediate fallout includes widespread analyst downgrades, with ratings shifting from ""Moderate Buy"" to ""Hold,"" and even some ""Sell"" recommendations as the year progressed. High short interest and sustained institutional selling have further pressured the stock, which has consistently underperformed the broader Nasdaq Composite, dipping 44% year-to-date as of September 19, 2025. This persistent downward trend signals a critical juncture for Enphase, forcing a reevaluation of its market position and growth trajectory in a rapidly evolving renewable energy landscape.

A Perfect Storm: Unpacking Enphase's Tumultuous Year

The dramatic downturn for Enphase Energy stems from a ""perfect storm"" of sector-wide headwinds, policy uncertainties, and company-specific performance issues that began to intensify in late 2024 and continued through 2025. The global residential solar market, after years of robust expansion, entered a period of contraction, leading to a significant slowdown in installations and a re-rating of valuations across the industry.

A pivotal factor contributing to the decline was the growing uncertainty surrounding crucial clean energy tax credits. In May 2025, a GOP bill passed by the House of Representatives aimed to significantly reduce or eliminate tax benefits, including the 30% federal tax credit for homeowners installing solar rooftop systems (Section 25D). This legislative threat, coupled with critical remarks on the sector from President Trump in August 2025, sent shockwaves through the market, directly impacting investor confidence in companies like Enphase that rely heavily on these incentives.

Compounding these external pressures, Enphase faced internal challenges, particularly margin compression. The company grappled with rising input costs, reciprocal tariffs, and higher component costs. New tariffs were projected to reduce gross margin by approximately 2% in Q2 2025, with a potential 6%-8% total impact in Q3 2025. This erosion of profitability highlighted the company's reliance on Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits, without which underlying gross margins were considerably thinner. Softening U.S. demand, partly due to seasonality and California's net metering reform, and a slowdown in European markets due to unfavorable government policies further weighed on revenue growth.

The timeline of disappointing financial results further fueled the stock's turbulence. In Q4 2024, while revenue saw a slight sequential increase, the Q1 2025 revenue forecast suggested a decline. Q1 2025 results confirmed this trend, with total revenue of $356.1 million representing a decrease from the prior quarter, and U.S. revenue falling approximately 13%. The company missed adjusted earnings estimates and provided Q2 revenue guidance well below analyst expectations, leading to a nearly 9.3% stock drop. Although Q2 2025 results showed some stabilization, the Q3 revenue guidance of $350 million (midpoint) again fell short, triggering another 5.9% decline, underscoring the persistent struggle to meet market expectations.

Shifting Fortunes: Winners and Losers in a Volatile Market

The significant turbulence experienced by Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) has created a ripple effect across the solar energy sector, delineating potential winners and losers among its competitors and partners. Companies with diversified revenue streams, stronger balance sheets, or less exposure to the residential solar segment, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, might be better positioned to weather the storm. Conversely, those heavily reliant on residential installations or similar policy-driven incentives could face similar, if not greater, challenges.

One potential beneficiary could be larger, more diversified energy companies or utilities (e.g., NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK)) that are involved in renewable energy but are not solely dependent on residential solar equipment sales. Their scale and broader energy portfolios might offer more resilience against market fluctuations and policy shifts. Additionally, companies focusing on commercial or utility-scale solar projects, which often operate under different regulatory and incentive structures, might see relatively stable demand compared to the beleaguered residential segment.

Conversely, direct competitors to Enphase, especially those in the microinverter and solar inverter space, such as SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ: SEDG), have also been deeply affected by the same industry headwinds. SolarEdge, which also relies heavily on residential and commercial solar installations, has faced similar pressures from slowing demand, inventory gluts, and policy uncertainties. The entire solar equipment manufacturing segment is under scrutiny, and companies with weaker financial positions or less innovative product pipelines might struggle to survive if the downturn persists.

Installers and distributors of solar equipment (e.g., Sunrun (NASDAQ: RUN), SunPower (NASDAQ: SPWR)) are also caught in the crossfire. A slowdown in equipment sales directly impacts their installation volumes and profitability. While lower equipment costs due to oversupply might offer some margin relief, the overarching issue of reduced end-user demand and uncertain tax credits presents a significant headwind. Companies that can adapt their business models, perhaps by offering more comprehensive energy management solutions or focusing on energy storage, may fare better than those solely focused on panel installations.

Broader Implications: A Shifting Landscape for Renewable Energy

The challenges faced by Enphase Energy are not isolated but symptomatic of broader, systemic shifts within the renewable energy sector, particularly solar. This turbulence underscores a critical juncture where the industry is transitioning from a period of rapid, incentive-driven growth to one demanding greater cost efficiency, technological innovation, and resilience against policy uncertainties. The residential solar market, once a darling of investors, is now confronting the realities of market maturity, regulatory reforms, and increased competition.

This event fits into a wider trend of consolidation and re-evaluation across the clean energy landscape. Many companies that thrived on generous government subsidies are now facing a more competitive environment where profitability and sustainable business models are paramount. The potential reduction or elimination of federal tax credits, as proposed in the House bill in May 2025, highlights the precariousness of policy-dependent growth. This could accelerate the shakeout of weaker players and force a greater emphasis on unsubsidized economic viability for solar installations.

Ripple effects extend to the entire supply chain, from raw material suppliers to financial institutions that fund solar projects. Reduced demand and margin compression at the manufacturing level can lead to decreased orders, oversupply, and price wars, impacting profitability for all stakeholders. Moreover, the decline in investor confidence in a leading company like Enphase could make it harder for smaller, less established renewable energy firms to secure funding, potentially stifling innovation and market entry.

Historically, the renewable energy sector has experienced boom-and-bust cycles, often tied to government incentives and technological breakthroughs. The current downturn shares similarities with past periods of market correction, where overcapacity and policy shifts led to significant industry restructuring. For instance, the challenges in the early 2010s, following the expiration of certain tax credits and increased competition from Chinese manufacturers, led to bankruptcies and consolidations. The current environment suggests a similar period of recalibration, where companies must demonstrate robust fundamentals beyond just growth potential. Regulatory bodies are also under pressure to provide clear, stable policy frameworks to support long-term investment, as inconsistent policies create significant market volatility.

What Comes Next: Navigating Uncertainty and Seeking New Horizons

The path forward for Enphase Energy and the broader solar sector remains fraught with both challenges and opportunities. In the short term, the market will closely watch for any definitive outcomes regarding federal tax credits. Should the proposed GOP bill to reduce or eliminate incentives gain further traction, it would likely trigger another wave of negative sentiment and potentially force significant strategic pivots across the industry. Conversely, any clarity or reaffirmation of existing incentives could provide a much-needed boost to investor confidence and stabilize stock prices.

For Enphase, strategic adaptations will be crucial. This could involve a stronger focus on international markets less affected by U.S. policy shifts, deeper penetration into the energy storage segment, or even exploring new business models such as providing comprehensive energy management solutions rather than just hardware. The company's strong balance sheet and continued product innovation, such as the IQ Battery 10C and IQ8P Microinverters, provide a foundation for these pivots, but execution will be key to regaining market share and investor trust.

Market opportunities may emerge from this downturn for companies that can innovate around cost efficiencies and develop products that offer compelling value propositions even without significant subsidies. The long-term trajectory towards decarbonization and energy independence remains intact, suggesting that the underlying demand for solar and storage will eventually rebound. Companies that can survive this period of volatility and emerge leaner and more efficient will be well-positioned for future growth.

Potential scenarios range from a continued challenging environment if policy uncertainty persists and demand remains soft, to a gradual recovery driven by technological advancements, new market entries, or a more stable regulatory landscape. A critical outcome will be the industry's ability to reduce its reliance on direct subsidies and compete more effectively on a level playing field with traditional energy sources. This could lead to a stronger, more resilient solar sector in the long run, albeit after a period of significant consolidation and transformation.

Wrap-Up: A Resilient Future for Solar Amidst Current Headwinds

Enphase Energy's (NASDAQ: ENPH) stock turbulence from late 2024 through mid-2025 serves as a stark reminder of the complexities and inherent risks within the rapidly evolving renewable energy sector. The confluence of slowing global demand, significant policy uncertainties surrounding federal tax credits, and persistent margin pressures created a challenging environment that saw the company's shares plummet dramatically. While Enphase boasts a strong balance sheet and continues to innovate with new products, these factors alone were insufficient to counteract the prevailing market headwinds and shifting investor sentiment.

Moving forward, the market will be keenly observing several key indicators. The resolution of policy uncertainties surrounding the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and other clean energy incentives will be paramount. Any legislative clarity that either affirms or modifies these crucial supports will significantly influence investor confidence and the operational strategies of solar companies. Additionally, signs of stabilization or rebound in residential solar demand in key markets like the U.S. and Europe will signal a potential easing of the current downturn.

Investors should watch for Enphase's ability to diversify its revenue streams, enhance cost efficiencies, and strategically expand into new geographies or product segments like energy storage, which may offer more resilient growth avenues. The company's future performance will largely depend on its capacity to navigate this period of intense competition and regulatory flux, adapting its business model to thrive in an environment where sustainable profitability, rather than just rapid growth, becomes the primary metric of success. The long-term vision for a decarbonized energy future remains strong, but the journey there will undoubtedly continue to present both significant hurdles and transformative opportunities for companies like Enphase.

This act effectively eliminated the federal EV tax credits for new, used, and leased electric vehicles, along with a $1,000 credit for home EV chargers.
Proponents of the OBBBA argued that the EV tax credits disproportionately benefited wealthier households and that non-EV-buying taxpayers were subsidizing EV purchasers.
New EV sales reportedly jumped 18-33% and used EV sales soared 59% in recent months compared to the previous year.
Companies heavily reliant on the $7,500 tax credit to make their vehicles competitive, particularly those with higher price points or less established brand loyalty, are most vulnerable.","The electric vehicle (EV) market is currently experiencing a frenzied surge as consumers nationwide rush to purchase eligible vehicles before the federal $7,500 EV tax credit for new EVs and the $4,000 credit for used EVs expire on September 30, 2025.

The looming deadline is profoundly influencing purchasing decisions, with a notable acceleration in EV and hybrid sales since early summer, as buyers aim to secure substantial savings before they vanish.

This immediate buying spree, however, is juxtaposed with widespread industry predictions of a significant slowdown in EV sales beginning in October. Analysts anticipate a ""speed bump"" for the market, as the absence of federal incentives and a ""payback"" from accelerated summer purchases are expected to temper demand, potentially lasting through the first quarter of next year. The expiration poses a considerable challenge for automakers ramping up EV production and raises concerns about future investment, the stability of green jobs, and the U.S.'s competitive standing in the global EV supply chain.

The Sudden End of an Era: Unpacking the EV Tax Credit's Accelerated Demise

The federal $7,500 EV tax credit, officially known as the New Clean Vehicle Credit, is set to expire on September 30, 2025, a dramatic acceleration from its original 2032 sunset date under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. This rapid curtailment is a direct consequence of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA), signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025. This act effectively eliminated the federal EV tax credits for new, used, and leased electric vehicles, along with a $1,000 credit for home EV chargers.

Prior to its expiration, the $7,500 credit for new EVs was contingent on several factors, including North American final assembly, strict critical mineral and battery component sourcing requirements (often splitting the credit into two $3,750 halves), MSRP caps ($80,000 for vans/SUVs/pickups, $55,000 for sedans), and modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) limits. A key change implemented in 2024 allowed buyers to transfer the credit to an eligible dealership at the point of sale for an immediate discount. Recent IRS guidance has also clarified that a binding purchase agreement with a deposit made before September 30, 2025, can still qualify for the credit, even if delivery occurs after the deadline, potentially extending eligibility into early 2026 for some consumers.

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (P.L. 119-21) represents a significant policy reversal, moving away from technology-specific subsidies for clean energy. Proponents of the OBBBA argued that the EV tax credits disproportionately benefited wealthier households and that non-EV-buying taxpayers were subsidizing EV purchasers. In place of the EV credit, the OBBBA introduced a new auto loan interest deduction, allowing buyers to deduct up to $10,000 annually in interest on qualifying new U.S.-assembled vehicles (electric, hybrid, or gas-powered) purchased between 2025 and 2028, subject to income limits. This shift aims to support broader domestic manufacturing rather than specific vehicle types.

Initial market reactions have been a mix of urgency and apprehension. Dealerships are experiencing a ""gold rush,"" actively advertising ""last chance"" opportunities to clear EV inventory. New EV sales reportedly jumped 18-33% and used EV sales soared 59% in recent months compared to the previous year. Automakers are adjusting sales strategies, with some pushing aggressive campaigns to clear current inventory, while others are re-evaluating production volumes and considering offering their own incentives post-expiration. Key stakeholders include the U.S. government (President Trump, Congress, IRS), automakers (e.g., Tesla, GM, Ford), car dealerships, and consumers racing against the clock.

Navigating the New Landscape: Winners and Losers in a Post-Credit EV Market

The abrupt end of the federal EV tax credit on September 30, 2025, will fundamentally reshape the competitive landscape for electric vehicle manufacturers, creating distinct winners and losers as the market shifts from a subsidized environment to one driven by intrinsic value.

Companies heavily reliant on the $7,500 tax credit to make their vehicles competitive, particularly those with higher price points or less established brand loyalty, are most vulnerable. Newer EV manufacturers that have yet to achieve economies of scale and depend on incentives to attract buyers may face substantial headwinds. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN), for instance, saw its R1S models already facing eligibility issues for the federal credit earlier in 2025. The complete expiration will remove a significant incentive for direct purchases, likely leading to reduced sales and increased pressure on profitability, even as the company invests in future, more affordable models like the R2. Similarly, Volkswagen AG (OTCMKTS: VWAGY), whose ID.4 also lost direct purchase eligibility earlier in the year, may see a dip in sales for eligible models, potentially requiring the company to absorb some of the $7,500 cost through internal incentives, impacting per-unit profitability.

Conversely, companies with diversified portfolios, strong brand recognition, established profitability in their EV segments, or those focused on higher-end markets less sensitive to the $7,500 incentive are better positioned. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), despite a reported dip in overall sales in the first half of 2025, has a strong brand, vertical integration, and existing profitability from EVs that provide a degree of insulation. CEO Elon Musk has historically supported the credit's termination, arguing it harmed Tesla. The company's strategic focus on more affordable models for 2025 and its ability to adjust pricing could position it as a long-term winner. Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM) and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (NYSE: HMC) are also well-placed due to their ""hybrid-first"" strategies and diversified product offerings. With slowing pure EV adoption trends, strong hybrid sales could provide stable revenue streams, cushioning the impact of the federal credit's expiration.

Legacy automakers like General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) represent a mixed bag. Both have several eligible EV models, such as the Chevrolet Blazer EV and Ford F-150 Lightning, which benefited from the credit. While they are likely to experience a short-term sales dip for these models, their larger scale, existing dealer networks, and long-term commitment to the EV transition may allow them to implement aggressive internal incentives (rebates, favorable lease terms) to sustain demand. However, this could come at the cost of profitability in the short term. Both companies are also actively working on more affordable EV options to compete effectively in a subsidy-free market.

A Seismic Shift: Broader Implications of the EV Tax Credit's Demise

The expiration of the federal EV tax credit on September 30, 2025, represents a seismic shift, signaling the U.S. EV market's transition from a heavily subsidized environment to one increasingly driven by market forces. While a short-term surge in sales is currently underway, analysts widely anticipate a subsequent temporary dip of 20% to 30% in EV sales in the immediate post-deadline period. This is because the credit effectively made EVs more accessible, particularly for budget-conscious consumers, and its absence will widen the cost gap between EVs and comparable gasoline models.

This policy reversal, orchestrated by the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA), reflects a broader recalibration of U.S. energy priorities. The OBBBA not only terminates EV credits but also repeals other clean energy incentives, including those for solar and wind facilities, green hydrogen production, and home electrification. It also eliminates non-compliance penalties for CAFE standards, further reducing pressure on manufacturers to produce fuel-efficient vehicles. This signifies a move away from technology-specific subsidies towards a focus on broader tax relief and supporting domestic manufacturing across all vehicle types, as evidenced by the new auto loan interest deduction.

The ripple effects will be felt across the entire automotive ecosystem. Smaller EV rivals like Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN) and Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: LCID) are particularly vulnerable due to their heavy reliance on incentives. The battery production sector is already experiencing an overcapacity crisis, with BloombergNEF data indicating a 56% plummet in U.S. battery deployment projections since 2022 and $6 billion in manufacturing projects canceled in Q1 2025. This could erode U.S. competitiveness against countries like China, which continues rapid expansion in battery manufacturing. While the expiration of the home charger credit might slow some infrastructure development, the current pre-deadline buying spree could still accelerate broader public charging infrastructure as municipalities respond to heightened EV volumes.

Historically, the removal of government incentives for specific industries has often led to initial market contractions, forcing industries to adapt or consolidate. Comparisons can be drawn to similar events where government support for emerging technologies was withdrawn, often revealing the true market demand and forcing innovation. Studies suggest that eliminating the EV tax credit could lead to a significant decrease in EV sales by 2030, potentially jeopardizing planned U.S. EV assembly plant expansions and making a substantial portion of U.S. battery manufacturing capacity redundant. This underscores the critical role of policy in shaping industrial landscapes and the risk of ceding ground to international competitors who actively support their nascent EV industries.

The Road Ahead: Navigating the Post-Subsidy EV Landscape

The expiration of the federal EV tax credit on September 30, 2025, ushers in a new, challenging phase for the electric vehicle market. In the short term, the immediate aftermath is expected to be a period of significant adjustment. Following the current ""gold rush"" of pre-deadline purchases, analysts widely anticipate a notable dip in EV sales, potentially between 20-30% in the fourth quarter of 2025 and into early 2026, as vehicles effectively become thousands of dollars more expensive for consumers. Automakers and dealerships will likely respond by offering their own aggressive incentives, price cuts, and favorable financing options to stimulate demand and manage inventory. State and local incentives will also gain heightened importance as buyers seek alternative forms of financial relief.

In the long term, the EV market will be compelled to mature beyond government subsidies, focusing instead on intrinsic value and market fundamentals. This means a renewed emphasis on cost reduction through technological advancements in battery chemistry and streamlined production processes, aiming for price parity with gasoline cars by 2027. The industry will need to build greater consumer confidence through improved range, faster charging, and a ubiquitous, reliable charging infrastructure. While overall EV adoption is still expected to grow, it will likely be at a slower, more organic pace than initially projected, with some forecasts suggesting a 25% EV sales mix by 2030, rather than the more ambitious 50%. A strategic pivot towards hybrids and plug-in hybrids is also anticipated, serving as a bridge technology for many consumers.

Automakers will need to implement several strategic adaptations. This includes aggressive cost reduction efforts, rethinking global production and sourcing strategies now that North American assembly incentives are gone, and diversifying product offerings to include more affordable EVs and a wider range of hybrid options. The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA) not only removed the EV credits but also introduced a new auto loan interest deduction. This allows buyers to deduct up to $10,000 annually in interest on loans for new, U.S.-assembled vehicles (EV, hybrid, or gas-powered) purchased between 2025 and 2028. While not a direct replacement for the upfront EV credit, this deduction offers long-term savings and shifts the policy focus to supporting domestic manufacturing across all vehicle types. This could partially offset the financial impact for some buyers who finance U.S.-assembled EVs, but notably excludes leased vehicles.

The Dawn of a New Era: A Market Redefined

The federal EV tax credit's expiration on September 30, 2025, marks a pivotal moment, fundamentally redefining the U.S. electric vehicle market. The immediate takeaway is the unprecedented ""gold rush"" as consumers rush to secure the $7,500 incentive, leading to record sales in the months preceding the deadline. This short-term boom, however, is a precursor to an anticipated slowdown, challenging the industry to prove its long-term viability without direct government subsidies. The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA) is the legislative instrument behind this shift, moving federal policy away from technology-specific consumer incentives towards broader support for domestic manufacturing through mechanisms like the new auto loan interest deduction.

Moving forward, the market will be characterized by a heightened focus on affordability, technological innovation, and robust infrastructure. Automakers will be compelled to aggressively reduce costs, develop more competitively priced EV models, and enhance the overall value proposition to attract a wider consumer base. The long-term success of EVs will hinge on their ability to compete on par with gasoline vehicles based on price, performance, and convenience, rather than relying on purchase incentives. The new auto loan interest deduction, while not EV-exclusive, will indirectly support U.S.-assembled EVs by making financing more attractive, thereby bolstering domestic production.

The lasting impact of this policy shift will be a more resilient, market-driven EV industry. While the immediate transition may be bumpy, it forces a necessary evolution towards greater self-sufficiency and innovation. Investors should closely monitor several key indicators in the coming months: the severity and duration of the post-expiration sales dip, automakers' strategic responses (including pricing, new models, and proprietary incentives), advancements in battery cost reduction, and the continued build-out of charging infrastructure. Furthermore, tracking the effectiveness of the new auto loan interest deduction and observing how state and local incentives evolve will provide crucial insights into the market's trajectory. The coming months will truly test the EV era's ability to stand on its own.

Washington, D.C. – In July 2025, Trump and congressional Republicans pushed through the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — better known as the Republican Rate Hike — plunging Americans into a downward spiral of affordability. Donald Trump and Republicans’ agenda is creating a self-inflicted energy crisis. Their law is driving utility costs sky-high, shuttering factories, deepening our dependence on foreign oil, and polluting our air and water, all to fund new tax breaks for billionaires and oil and gas executives. Climate Power today released its inaugural Energy Crisis Snapshot, pulling from a new tracker detailing the rising costs, job losses, power shortages, and abandoned investments caused by Republicans’ nonsensical war on clean energy.

“Trump promised lower bills and more jobs, and Americans are getting the exact opposite,” said Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power. “Trump is undercutting American jobs, driving up energy bills, and destabilizing the grid by gutting the cheapest, fastest power sources available. The Republican war on clean energy serves no one but the Big Oil executives whose campaign checks are clearly paying off.”

The report’s findings include:

• Household electric bills are up 10% nationally since Trump took office, and are poised to spike even further. New analysis from the Center for American Progress and Climate Power shows just how widespread the Republican Rate Hike has become. Since Trump took office, gas and electric utilities in 41 states and D.C. have raised—or are seeking to raise—rates by at least $78.9 billion. The hikes hit more than 80 million electric customers and 28 million gas customers, with families in Missouri, New York, and Illinois facing some of the steepest burdens—up to $500 or more in added annual costs.

• More than 80,500 energy jobs have been lost or delayed between Trump’s election and September 8, 2025. Companies have canceled, delayed, or laid off staff at 142 energy projects in 37 states, representing over $42.80 billion in lost investment. 57 percent of listed projects have been canceled altogether since Trump’s election.

• At the very moment we need more electrons on the grid to service a dramatic increase of data centers being built around the country, 25,013 megawatts of planned energy generation have been lost due to energy projects that were canceled or delayed since Trump’s election.

Nearly 13 million homes in the U.S. could be powered by the energy generation projects that have been canceled or delayed since Trump’s election.

Climate Power will track the fallout from the Republican Rate Hike through a monthly Energy Crisis Snapshot, backed by a weekly business impacts tracker that monitors private clean energy projects facing delays, cancellations, and job losses

since Trump’s inauguration.

A memorandum of understanding creating a formal framework for co-operation and responsibilities was signed by the UK Government, Scottish Government, Highland Council and Inverness and Cromarty Green Freeport. Crucially, the signing unlocks £25 million of UK Government capital funding.

The Green Freeport will support skills growth in the Highlands. Over the next 25 years, it is poised to create more than 11,000 long-term jobs and a workforce equipped with future-ready skills. It will attract over £6.5b of investment to build a legacy for future generations.

Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander said: “This is a pivotal moment in the UK Government’s mission to boost economic growth in all parts of the UK. The Inverness and Cromarty Green Freeport will transform the economy of the Highlands, as well as playing a key role in our clean energy future. Supported by £25m of UK Government investment, and a range of UK Government tax incentives, this important collaboration between governments and local partners will deliver thousands of high-quality jobs and attract billions in investment.”

The signing took place at Aurora Energy Services’ recently opened £1.2m training facility in Inverness. The new centre will train more than 2,000 workers for the renewables sector every year and will become a valuable part of the supply chain needed to deliver the Freeport’s ambition.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/static/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-09-27 17:00:28.353114

It's not just climate scientists who are concerned about the financial and environmental cost of keeping coal plants running, as one may have expected.
Experts believe that keeping more ageing coal plants online would inflate consumer costs further.
Most of the coal plants in the U.S. are old and inefficient, with the average age of a coal plant standing at 44 years in 2024.","While much of the world is looking to phase out its coal production, United States President Donald Trump has put coal back on the energy agenda, with big plans to reinvigorate ageing coal facilities. Despite concerns over the impact of ongoing coal use on human health and the environment, Trump views fossil fuels as the most stable energy source to boost U.S. energy security, which could lead to consumers paying more for their energy bills over the coming years.

Upon entering office in January, Trump declared an energy emergency, and he has since worked rapidly to change the landscape of U.S. energy by signing a flurry of executive orders and passing bills aimed at reducing the growth of the renewable energy sector and, instead, returning to a reliance on fossil fuels. In April, Trump signed an order entitled “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry and Amending Executive Order 14241”.

In the order, Trump stated, “Coal is abundant and cost-effective, and can be used in any weather condition. Moreover, the industry has historically employed hundreds of thousands of Americans. America’s coal resources are vast, with a current estimated value in the trillions of dollars, and are more than capable of substantially contributing to American energy independence, with excess to export to support allies and our economic competitiveness.”

Despite promises to lower consumer energy bills in the coming years, sectoral experts now believe that doubling down on coal production could actually lead to an increase in consumer energy bills, compared to investing in alternative energy sources, such as wind and solar power. Trump’s executive order tasked the Department of Energy (DoE) with ensuring that coal power plants continue to operate, even those that are destined for closure.

In July, the DoE published a report that states that current power plant retirements and additions will put the U.S. at massive risk of blackouts by the end of the decade. It has used its newly given powers to stop the closure of the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan, even though the utility operating the plant warned that closing the facility would save consumers over $600 million. The DoE plans to halt the closure of other coal facilities across the country in line with Trump’s energy aims.

However, several energy experts have said that the report relies on worst-case scenarios to reach its conclusions and largely overlooks the new renewable energy capacity being added to the grid. Experts argue that paying to keep ageing coal plants online could result in consumers paying billions of dollars more for some of the least efficient and least reliable power plants on the grid, as well as put their health and the environment at risk.

A report from June, by the think tank Energy Innovation, showed that coal power was 28 percent more expensive in 2024 than in 2021, following several years of movement away from the “dirtiest fossil fuel” to various other less-polluting energy sources. The analysis shows that 95 percent of the 162 U.S. coal-fired power plants that were still operating at the beginning of the year were more expensive than in 2021, with costs increasing at twice the rate of inflation for half of these plants.

It's not just climate scientists who are concerned about the financial and environmental cost of keeping coal plants running, as one may have expected. Several U.S. utilities have found that the operating costs of coal plants are simply too high, particularly compared to gas-fueled facilities and renewables. Several utilities have chosen only to use coal plants for power as a last resort, when they cannot deliver enough solar or wind power to the grid, for example, due to the high cost of production. Experts believe that keeping more ageing coal plants online would inflate consumer costs further.

Most of the coal plants in the U.S. are old and inefficient, with the average age of a coal plant standing at 44 years in 2024. Older plants tend to be more expensive to run because they need more investment in maintenance. The generating power at these plants also falls over time, making them highly inefficient compared to many other energy sources. And consumers are seeing the effects of keeping these facilities online unnecessarily.

In Georgia, Plant Bowen was expected to be retried in 2028. However, Georgia Power has extended its life to 2035, even as costs rose from $46/MWh in 2021 to $72/MWh in 2025. This also follows six electricity bill increases for Georgia Power customers between 2023 and 2025. Meanwhile, in South Carolina, the Williams Station coal plant has had its retirement date delayed from 2028 to at least 2031, as costs have increased by $27/MWh, or more than 50 percent.

So, while President Trump insists that fossil fuels, including coal, will help fix the country’s “energy emergency”, the financial reports at many of these coal plants appear to prove otherwise. Meanwhile, the cost of gas and renewable energy production continues to fall, offering a cleaner alternative for consumers, as well as lower energy bills.

data centers.
But storing energy that way is relatively pricey and may still fall short of providing the nonstop energy that data centers need.
(As part of this week’s deal, OpenAI agreed to use Nvidia chips in at least 10 gigawatts’ worth of data centers.)
Many data centers near cities and towns don’t have that kind of space.","It’s been a big week for A.I. data centers. That means it’s also been a big week for coal and natural gas.

Nvidia this week announced a $100 billion investment to support OpenAI’s enormous build-out of data centers that use its chips. The next day, OpenAI said it had signed deals with SoftBank and Oracle to build five new data centers as part of the Stargate Project, a $500 billion plan for A.I. infrastructure. (The three companies unveiled it at the White House back in January.)

The announcements are the latest in a global push to speed the construction of A.I. data centers. OpenAI, Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft are together spending more than $325 billion on them by the end of the year. To stay on the bleeding edge, the companies want the latest processors, cooling systems, facilities — all running 24/7 on mind-bending quanta of electricity.

In the U.S., more than half of that power is coming from fossil fuels.

President Trump, who called green energy a “scam” at the U.N. General Assembly this week, has enthusiastically endorsed natural gas, coal and oil. He has also subsidized them. As part of his official A.I. plan, he pledged to scrap “radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape” and fast-track fossil fuel projects instead.

But there are reasons beyond politics that help explain why smog-spewing fossil fuels have become the go-to power source for futuristic data centers. The pairing is almost unavoidable — at least for now.

Renewables

Sprawling solar farms, windmills and hydroelectric dams are the best energy options for the planet, and usually the cheapest. Their economic upside has made them, collectively, the fastest-growing power source for data centers worldwide.

But renewables often can’t shoulder the load alone, despite being a major part of the A.I. power plan. That’s because servers hum and whir around the clock — not just when the sun is up or the wind is blowing. They demand a constant, stable flow of electricity. If power falters, even for a few seconds, companies lose thousands of dollars, sometimes more.

There’s a fix: Companies can pair solar and wind farms with massive batteries that store power and then release it in a steady stream. But storing energy that way is relatively pricey and may still fall short of providing the nonstop energy that data centers need. “Batteries are a great way to shift daytime electricity to evening electricity — but not a great way to shift July electricity to January electricity,” said Matthew Bunn, a professor at Harvard who studies energy policy. So even the greenest facilities rely on fossil fuels or the local grid for backup, he told DealBook.

Another challenge: The biggest data center campuses will consume multiple gigawatts of power. (As part of this week’s deal, OpenAI agreed to use Nvidia chips in at least 10 gigawatts’ worth of data centers.) To continuously produce just a single gigawatt, a renewable-energy plant would need around 12.5 million solar panels — enough to cover nearly 5,000 football fields. Wind turbines would need even more room. Many data centers near cities and towns don’t have that kind of space.

Nuclear

That’s where nuclear plants come in. They have smaller footprints, generate steady power and, like renewables, emit no carbon.

But they’re expensive. That’s why the nuclear industry has been in a decades-long rut. It boomed back in the 1970s, when the global energy crisis quadrupled oil prices. But Americans’ enthusiasm for nuclear energy soured after a series of headline-grabbing accidents, like the 1979 partial meltdown at Three Mile Island.

Around the same time, our electricity needs started to decline — which tends to happen in mature economies. Oil prices came down, so we stopped building nuclear reactors.

The industry has been groping for a good sales pitch ever since. With A.I., it finally has one: Energy demand is soaring, and nuclear companies can help fill the gap.

A slight snag: They’ll need another seven or eight years to do it, best-case scenario, said Jacopo Buongiorno, a nuclear science professor at M.I.T. That’s how long it takes to build new nuclear plants.

So, it’s a gamble: Tech companies investing in nuclear power (Microsoft, Google and Amazon, among others) are betting billions that A.I. demand will continue to rise a decade from now, when those nuclear facilities open for business. But it’s not clear their bets will pan out.

Fossil Fuels

The U.S. has vast natural gas reserves in underground reservoirs and offshore deposits, so it’s cheap and available. And the infrastructure to harness it can be ready fast: “A year or two, and you have a gas plant,” Buongiorno said.

If data centers continue expanding at their going rate, their energy needs will far surpass the current supply by 2030. So tech companies that need to bridge that widening gap are reaching for fossil fuels. Natural gas is already the top power source for U.S. data centers, according to the International Energy Agency, and it’s on track to dominate through at least 2030.

The only other energy source that can be deployed in one to two years — aligning with the construction timeline for most data centers — is solar, which has its own drawbacks.

His plan may work. It may also accelerate climate change by pumping heat-trapping gases into an atmosphere already at its highest-recorded temperature ever. For now, though, tech companies are seeing an opportunity to invest.

IN CASE YOU MISSED IT

Inflation held firm last month, the Fed’s preferred measure showed. Yesterday’s Personal Consumption Expenditures report showed core inflation rose 2.9 percent on an annualized basis, matching Wall Street forecasts, but still well above the central bank’s 2 percent target. That said, traders are still penciling in two more rate cuts even as Fed policymakers debate future moves.

Intel held investment talks with Apple. Intel’s shares soared on Wednesday after news broke that the company had held discussions with Apple about a possible investment. The talks, which took place before and after the Trump administration took a stake in Intel, raised questions about whether companies were considering Intel investments to please the White House.

Nvidia pledged to invest $100 billion in OpenAI. The chipmaker at the center of the artificial intelligence boom agreed to supply the ChatGPT developer with millions of its most advanced processors and said it would take an undisclosed equity stake. The deal — along with a separate announcement that OpenAI will team with SoftBank and Oracle to build five new U.S. data centers — underscores the astonishing costs of the A.I. business, which is raising hard questions about whether these gigantic investments will pay off.

Jimmy Kimmel returned to late-night TV. Kimmel was emotional and defiant in his first episode back after Disney suspended his show over comments he made about the killing of Charlie Kirk. The episode averaged 6.2 million viewers, almost four times its average audience, though Nexstar and Sinclair, which together own about 20 percent of ABC’s affiliates, pre-empted the show. President Trump suggested that he might take further action against ABC.

How the new H1-B fee is hitting in Silicon Valley

The White House’s announcement that it would charge a new $100,000 fee to applicants for the popular H1-B visa set off alarm bells across corporate America.

But they rang particularly loudly in Silicon Valley: About two-thirds of such visas, which are distributed via a lottery, go to workers in computer-related occupations.

“The first thing that happened was panic,” said Deedy Das, a partner at the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, which has more than 250 start-ups in its portfolio.

DealBook’s Sarah Kessler talked with Das, who is a former H1-B visa holder, about how the change is being received at the smallest and largest companies in tech. The interview has been edited and condensed.

What have you heard from start-ups about the new fee?

When you are an immigrant start-up founder, one route you can take is to sponsor your own H1-B visa through your start-up.

That is probably the group most affected by a $100,000 fee, because you are paying out of your pocket. The company just got incorporated. You don’t have any cash. You don’t have funding.

The second most affected group are smaller start-ups. In computer science, about 60 percent of students who get Ph.D.s and 45 percent who get master’s degrees are international. So chances are, if I say, I want to hire anyone who is good enough, most of them are going to be on an H1-B. For those companies, $100,000 is meaningful.

What about larger start-ups?

Most of the later stage start-ups are at a point where they’re like, OK, we’re just paying the $100,000 fee.

It’s not ideal. But even if you have a thousand employees, you’re probably not hiring more than 100 people on H1-B next year. You’re probably hiring like 10. Maybe I just spend a million dollars in a one-time fee and continue doing what I was doing.

Will they just set up remote offices in other countries?

I don’t think start-ups will overnight decide, hey, we need an office somewhere else. There are tons of issues with offices in Europe, tons of issues with offices in India and China, all of these other places. It takes a lot of work.

I was talking to an start-up founder who liked that there’d be less competition for the lottery.

I think it is a reasonable incentive to say, if you want to hire internationally, pay more. Do I think 100K is the right amount? I mean, no, maybe start with 20K.

The IT consultancies who typically abuse these programs might resort to another kind of visa, but leaving that aside, I think they will struggle because they disproportionately use visas to pay lower wages.

Do you think the $100k fee makes starting a company in the U.S. less appealing?

Absolutely.

It’s hard to describe just how much better America is for entrepreneurship than the rest of the world: Everything from ease of doing business, access to capital and funding, access to talent and the social acceptance of failure.

Daily Record of Dunn

Benson commissioners agreed to take a thorough look at its costs of providing electricity to the town after hearing its electric department had about half the money it needed to cover its bills last fiscal year.

“The electric fund had an operating loss for the year,” Jay Sharpe, the town auditor, told the board at its meeting Sept. 18.

And fiscal year 2024 wasn’t a fluke.

Operating expenses have exceeded revenues in that department for at least the last three fiscal years, he said, pointing to a bar graph. Another graph showed deep dips of red to illustrate the department’s habit of operating with negative cash flows during those same years.

The Town of Benson Electric Department “only had $300 in petty cash” at the end of fiscal year 2024, and it had to borrow money from the town’s general fund to pay for its operations, Sharpe added.

His Raleigh-based accounting firm, Sharpe Patel CPA, recommends towns try to have two to three times the money it needs in the bank to cover all of its bills. The electric department had half of what it needed.

ElectriCities of North Carolina offered to complete the study at a cost of $28,900, only charging the town $23,900 after awarding Benson a $5,000 grant for the study.

“A cost of service study looks at the total costs an electric distribution system has for the provision of electrical service,” Interim Town Manager Steve Harrell told the board at its meeting Sept. 18. “This includes functional costs for local lines, poles, and transformers to deliver power to end-users and the costs for billing, meter reading and customer support.”

In other action, commissioners voted unanimously to end its $400 monthly health care stipend for any employees, outside of the 11 who already receive it, not wanting coverage from the state health plan.

The cost of the initial 1,500 chargers is almost 500 million Czech Koruna, which equals about $24 million at current exchange rates.
Los Angeles, — where over half the residents are renters — has also latched onto this idea and begun mounting EV charging stations on existing streetlights.
There are also six new EV chargers at Phoenix, Arizona public libraries as part of that city's effort to install 500 public charging points by 2030.
Smaller cities are also taking steps to improve their EV charging infrastructure.","Electric Vehicle (EV) range anxiety and charging concerns are the technology's biggest sticking point for most consumers, and maintaining a sufficient charging infrastructure will be the biggest challenge moving forward. This is a particular challenge in large cities, where residents of apartments and condos above street level can't install personal charging stations like many homeowners. As for public EV chargers, in populated areas they tend to be in commercial areas, along highways, or in other spots less accessible to residents. To make EV charging more convenient for residents, some cities are taking a creative approach to the problem. The Czechian capital of Prague announced earlier in September that it had a plan to install 6,000 new charging points by 2030 to help prepare for the European Union's transition to exclusively zero-emissions vehicles.

Prague's goal is to install 1,500 of those charging stations by the end of 2026, and the city is doing that by converting some existing lampposts to EV chargers. These level 2 chargers take advantage of 230-volt AC power available across Europe, meaning many EV owners will be able to gain dozens of miles of range in a few hours. The cost of the initial 1,500 chargers is almost 500 million Czech Koruna, which equals about $24 million at current exchange rates. Prague is a city of over 1.3 million people, and the government sees this initiative as a way to measurably improve their lives. Deputy Mayor for Transport Zdeněk Hřib told Yahoo! News, ""Without accessible charging options, electromobility will remain the privilege of a small group. Prague must ensure that every resident has the opportunity to make the switch.""

Los Angeles, — where over half the residents are renters — has also latched onto this idea and begun mounting EV charging stations on existing streetlights. The city also installed LED bulbs in the lamps to reduce power draw, connecting the 240-volt power lines already in place to Level 2 chargers with retractable cables. A company called Voltpost is installing streetlight chargers in the Detroit area, and the city of New York worked with electrical utility Con Edison to install100 curbside chargers in 2024. The Big Apple hopes to have 10,000 such stations installed by 2030, five years before the state's ban on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles goes into effect. There are also six new EV chargers at Phoenix, Arizona public libraries as part of that city's effort to install 500 public charging points by 2030.

Smaller cities are also taking steps to improve their EV charging infrastructure. Lancaster, Pennsylvania received a $3.1 million federal grant to install 74 electric charging stations in public parks and low-income neighborhoods in the city. Lancaster deputy director of public works Cindy McCormick told Lancaster Online these locations ""align with areas where residents don't necessarily have access to charging and off-street parking, which is an impediment for people to purchase electric vehicles.""

New York City is partnering with private firms to build a 24-hour public EV charging station at JFK airport with 12 DC fast chargers and 53 additional chargers, and car companies are stepping in to fill in the gap as well.

TerraPower, founded by Bill Gates, is exploring whether its new natrium technology could be used for the facility.

The two companies along with the Kansas Department of Commerce, announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding Tuesday to explore sites for a possible nuclear plant.

There is already one nuclear power plant in the state.

Evergy’s Director of Corporate Communications Gina Penzig says there are record levels of development in both Kansas and Missouri with data centers, logistics, and manufacturing.

“And so, it’s driving an increased need for electricity over the next five to ten years,” Penzig said in a Zoom interview with FOX4 Wednesday.

Evergy recently announced they were planning to build two new natural gas plants in south central Kansas and a solar site in Douglas County.

“As we look forward over the next five, ten, 15 years with the growing need for electricity in the region, we want to consider all of the possibilities,” Penzig said.

That includes a nuclear power plant using TerraPower’s natrium technology. FOX4 asked Penzig where they’d consider building this.

“Our service area goes roughly from Hutchison to the eastern border of Kansas and then from north to south, so somewhere in about that eastern third of the state is where the site selection process will focus,” she responded.

Evergy has operated the Wolf Creek Nuclear Generating Station in Burlington for the last 40 years. Penzig says that facility has had a great safety record.

TerraPower would not speak to FOX4 on camera Wednesday, but in June of 2024, they started building the first advanced nuclear reactor project in Wyoming. Later on Wednesday afternoon, a spokeswoman for TerraPower said a natrium nuclear power plant would take three years to open.

Penzig says Evergy and TerraPower will announce sometime next year whether they’re going to team up to build a natrium reactor nuclear power plant or not.

It's the reason why EV leases are so cheap, so if you want an affordable EV, you should act soon.

There are great deals on both mainstream and luxury EVs, you just have to know where to look.

The time has come. Later this coming week, the federal clean vehicle tax credit will disappear, and many of the ""I can't believe this price"" lease deals will go with it. But it's not gone yet, and you can still get a truly absurd price. Here's how to do it.

While the $7,500 EV tax credit expires on Sept. 30, it is possible that many automakers might continue to eat those costs themselves and continue to offer aggressive deals through the year. But long-term, there's no guarantee of that. This is a great weekend to go EV-shopping—perhaps the last great one for a while.

First off, at this point, you're going to be fighting with a lot of other customers for a rapidly shrinking supply of cars. That's why I'd suggest striking a deal this weekend; most dealers are good enough at inventory management that they'll be running low by Tuesday. Second, I'd skip the ""let me talk to the manager"" step by just browsing on a leasing forum or using a car broker. At this point, it's more about knowing who has excess inventory than squeezing the finance manager, so this can kill two birds with one stone.

I jumped on Leasehackr this morning to scour for deals, and I'm shocked by what I'm seeing.

While Leasehackr is not the only lease deal forum, and I haven't used a broker myself, it seems to be the one with the most consistently eye-popping deals. Here are a few that caught my eye. But note that lease deals in general are region-specific, and I'm looking in California, where inventory is plentiful and deals tend to be great.

The Deal King: Hyundai Ioniq 5

Hyundai dealers are offering crazy deals on new Ioniq 5s.

Part of why you see so many more Hyundai Ioniq 5s than Kia EV6s is that Hyundai has long offered much more aggressive lease deals. As the cheap-lease free-for-all ends, the Ioniq 5 still reigns. I saw this one advertised for $157 a month for 36 months, with $3,000 due at signing (I'm not including specific broker information because I can't speak to the quality of different brokers, and deals are changing rapidly).

That adds up $8,495 over the life of the lease (the first payment is included), meaning your net effective payment is $235 a month. That's for a car with a native Tesla-style NACS port, faster charging speeds than anything else remotely affordable and 318 miles of range. That's all the EV most people need, at a price that's hard to argue with.

The Luxury Play: Pick Your Poison

BMW and Mercedes have both been trying to clear out EV inventory. You can get great deals on EVs from both brands. The BMW i4 is one of my favorite EVs, and I've seen deals advertising 36-month leases for $399 a month for 36 months with $3,000 due at signing. If you must have a crossover, you can get an ex-loaner Mercedes EQE SUV for as little as $399 a month for 36 months with $3,5000 due at signing. That's a helluva deal for something with an MSRP of $80,000.

But there is a catch with these luxury-brand leases. For EV deals, Mercedes, BMW and Audi seem to be advertising ultra-low-mileage leases that only give you 7,500 miles per year. Since the average American drives over 12,000 miles a year, make sure that's not a dealbreaker.

Cadillac incentivized leases tend to come with 10,000 miles a year, which is much more reasonable. If you're interested—and based on our experiences, you should be—you can get an Optiq or a Lyriq for under $400 a month with about $3,500 down. But that's a two-year lease, so the down payment stings a little harder.

Affordable Alternatives

While the Ioniq 5 is our go-to non-Tesla recommendation, I personally leased a Chevy Blazer EV last year because the deals are just as good. I'm willing to sacrifice charging speed and driving dynamics for more space and ground clearance, so I'd recommend looking at what your local Chevy dealer is offering.

I found two-year deals for both the Equinox EV and Blazer EV that require a one-time payment of less than $6,000. One-pay leases are not always the best if you worry about exiting early, or if you don't have upfront cash, but it's hard to argue with these numbers. At $6,000 all-in, you can get a spacious electric crossover with over 300 miles of range for just $250 a month.

If paying up front isn't your jam, rest assured that you still have more options. First, your local Chevy dealer may be willing to arrange a similar deal with less down. But you can get another of the segment staples for cheap. Volkswagen ID.4 leases are cheap as hell right now. I saw a base-model, rear-wheel-drive version offered for 24 months at 7,500 miles a year for just $99 a month with $3,000 due at signing. If you want an all-wheel-drive, long-range ID. 4Pro, you might be able to get one for $139 a month with $3,000 down.

Examples, Not Promises

These are example deals, because every lease is different. You won't qualify for every rebate, and you'll need good credit to get these rates. But I'm writing about these deals to show you just how much money is sitting on the table. You just have to find a way to grab some yourself.

The good news is it's never been easier. There are forums like Leasehackr and plenty of car-buying services out there to ease the pain. Or, if you don't want to deal with a broker fee, do what I did: Put it requests at multiple dealers, and don't show up in person until you have a real offer, including all taxes and fees, in writing. You can't afford to be playing games, because time is running out.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/kolvBe/s1/2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-xrt-limited.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 12:02:18.117812

The Fix Our Forests Act will help reduce wildfire risk for Colorado communities and speed up mitigation projects while maintaining environmental safeguards and encouraging local involvement

WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators John Hickenlooper, John Curtis, Alex Padilla, and Tim Sheehy highlighted growing support for their bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act from governors, state and local officials, community leaders, and industry stakeholders. The bill works to strengthen wildfire resilience by improving forest management, supporting fire-safe communities, and streamlining approvals for projects that protect communities and ecosystems from extreme wildfires.

The comprehensive bill reflects months of bipartisan negotiations to find consensus on how to accelerate forest management projects, promote safe and responsible prescribed fire treatments, expand public input in assessments of wildfire resilience needs, and enhance collaboration between federal agencies, states, tribes, and stakeholders.

Continued support for the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act picks up with organizations such as Colorado Water Congress, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Water Resources Association, and more joining to endorse the bill. Coalitions of local fire chiefs and wildfire organizations have also sent in letters of support for the legislation.

“As the Western United States continues to experience unprecedented wildfire seasons, we recognize the urgent need for comprehensive and coordinated federal action. The status quo is completely untenable as our local, state, and federal systems are overwhelmed,” wrote the chair of Colorado State Fire Chiefs, Wildland Section, and the Fire Chiefs of Vail Fire and Emergency Services, Eagle River Fire Protection District, Aspen Fire Department, Red, White, & Blue Fire District, Summit Fire and EMS, Grand Fire District #1, and Colorado River Fire Rescue in a joint letter of support for the Fix Our Forests Act. “We are greatly impressed by the collaborative nature of this legislation and the commitment it reflects to bipartisan solutions that empower local, state, and federal partners alike… As leaders of Colorado mountain region fire departments, we stand ready to support the implementation of policies that strengthen our ability to protect lives, property, and the natural environment.”

“It is paramount that we work to improve the health of our nation’s forested lands and protect communities and watersheds, particularly in the West, where wildfires have become increasingly devastating and destructive. This legislation outlines a comprehensive approach to improving forest and watershed health by helping to foster a collaborative partnership between federal agencies and local communities, authorizing common sense environmental streamlining authorities, and expanding important research initiatives,” wrote Colorado Water Congress in a joint letter of support for the Fix Our Forests Act. “The resources included in this bill are crucial to help control and reduce the severity of wildfires and protect Colorado’s watersheds. CWC supports a collaborative process of planning, prioritizing, and implementing hazardous fuel reduction and forest health improvement projects while protecting, restoring, and enhancing forest ecosystems to promote the recovery of threatened and endangered species, improve biological diversity, water quality, and enhance productivity.”

“The devastating, ongoing wildfires across several Western states (e.g., Arizona, California, Colorado, and Oregon) highlight the need to prepare for the threat of wildfires while enhancing the ability of communities to withstand and recover from such events,” wrote Marty Durbin, Senior Vice President of Policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in a letter of support for the Fix Our Forests Act. “The U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly supports S. 1462, the Fix Our Forests Act of 2025, sponsored by Sens. Curtis, Hickenlooper, Padilla, and Sheehy. We urge the Committee to quickly mark-up and report this bill for consideration by the full Senate.”

“The Fix Our Forests Act is a critical step forward. The bill provides an opportunity to speed up the planning and implementation of wildfire risk reduction projects on federal lands while expanding collaborative tools to bring more partners into this vital work. Additionally, it bolsters the use of prescribed fire to help reduce fire severity and restore ecosystems. The bill recognizes that replanting after wildfire and other extreme events goes hand in hand with active forest management and the legislation supports ecosystem and habitat restoration across our public lands and in the priceless white oak forests of the Eastern U.S. The Fix Our Forests Act also takes a broad view of the solutions needed by establishing a Community Wildfire Risk Reduction Program to address risk in the built environment and creating a Fire Intelligence Center to improve interagency coordination and adoption of new technologies,” wrote a coalition of 22 different wildfire organizations in a joint letter of support for the Fix Our Forests Act.

“The Fix Our Forests Act provides a forward-looking framework that strengthens interagency collaboration and delivers common-sense reforms to improve forest and watershed health. NWRA believes this legislation will provide lasting benefits for our environment, public safety, and water quality and infrastructure,” wrote the National Water Resources Association in a letter of support for the Fix Our Forests Act.

The Fix Our Forests Act is supported by Colorado Governor Jared Polis; Utah Governor Spencer Cox; California Governor Gavin Newsom; Colorado Department of Natural Resources; Colorado State Forest Service; American Property Casualty Insurance Association; California Natural Resources Agency; Climate and Wildfire Institute; Utah Farm Bureau Federation; The Nature Conservancy; Association for Firetech Innovation and Convective Capital; Federation of American Scientists; National Audubon Society; Berkshire Hathaway Energy; Arnold Ventures; Utah Department of Natural Resources; The Property and Environment Research Center (PERC); Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership; National Wild Turkey Federation; National Wildlife Federation; Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions; American Forests; Colorado Rural Electric Association; Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation; Western Governors’ Association; National Association of State Departments of Agriculture; National Association of State Foresters; United Power; Rocky Mountain Elk; Citizen’ Climate Lobby; Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control; Bipartisan Policy Center Action; International Association of Fire Chiefs; Alliance for Wildfire Resilience; Wildfire Alliance; Tall Timbers; Rural Voices for Conservation Coalition; The Stewardship Project; Megafire Action; California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection; Hispanics Enjoy Camping, Hunting, and the Outdoors; Ruffed Grouse Society and American Woodcock Society; State of Utah; Environmental Defense Fund; Rural County Representatives of California; Salesforce; Central Valley Water Reclamation Facility; C2ES; U.S. Chamber of Commerce; Colorado State Fire Chiefs Wildland Section; Colorado Water Congress; and National Water Resources Association.

“I applaud the bipartisan work and leadership of the Senate sponsors of this bill, including Colorado’s Senator Hickenlooper, in crafting a bill that will make Colorado communities safer amidst the urgent and growing wildfire crisis in the West. From supporting responsible and expedited on-the-ground fuel reductions, to bolstering the use and development of the latest wildfire satellite monitoring technology which compliments Colorado’s national leadership in the aerospace sector, and to investing in stewardship practices for local communities to be better prepared for wildfires and reforestation efforts with the state nursery to improve our ability to recover – this bill makes major strides in addressing the country’s wildfire risk and will support Colorado’s continued leadership in wildfire preparedness, response and recovery,” said Colorado Governor Jared Polis.

“Extreme risk of catastrophic wildfires across the West demands urgent action,” said California Governor Gavin Newsom. “In California, we’re fast-tracking projects by streamlining state requirements and using more fuel breaks and prescribed fire. The Fix Our Forests Act is a step forward that will build on this progress — enabling good projects to happen faster on federal lands. I’m appreciative of Senator Padilla and the bipartisan team of Senators who crafted a balanced solution that will both protect communities and improve the health of our forests.”

“A century of fire suppression and decades of reduced forest management have left us with overgrown, unhealthy forests that are more vulnerable to disease and catastrophic wildfire,” said Utah Governor Spencer Cox. “The Fix Our Forest Act, along with the tools provided by President Trump’s executive order, will help us actively manage our forests—protecting our watersheds, improving wildlife habitat, reducing wildfire risk, and providing the timber we need to build strong homes and neighborhoods.”

“We applaud the efforts made by Senator Hickenlooper in the Fix Our Forests Act to provide federal, state, and local partners with the tools needed to address wildfire mitigation in the most vulnerable areas in Colorado. Wildfires do not abide by our political boundaries. But here in Colorado we have built strong coordination among federal, state, local land managers and stakeholders to help reduce the impact of wildfires on our critical infrastructure and landscapes,” said Dan Gibbs, Executive Director, Colorado Department of Natural Resources. “We appreciate that this legislation builds upon this important collaboration and draws on existing agreements, such as Shared Stewardship, which will help strengthen our intergovernmental partnerships as we prepare for the next Colorado mega-fire.”

“Forests are central to our way of life in Colorado. They support world-class outdoor recreation and a vital water supply that more than 40 million Americans rely upon. I am grateful to Senator John Hickenlooper for his work on the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act,” said Matt McCombs, Colorado State Forester and Director of the Colorado State Forest Service. “This critical legislation will bolster our shared stewardship ethic in Colorado and enhance our ability as a state to improve forest health, protect lives, communities and water supplies from wildfire, and ensure that the forests that define Colorado endure for generations to come.”

“First of all, thanks to Senators Hickenlooper, Curtis, Sheehy, and Padilla for their leadership in moving all this forward! Having spent so many hours working on the Wildfire Mitigation and Management Commission, it is refreshing to see so many of the recommendations moving forward!” said Mike Morgan, Director of the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control.“Colorado has taken a very aggressive approach in addressing the wildfire challenges we face and we are pleased to see these efforts at the federal level taking a more holistic look at the challenges we all face and in support of the Commission’s recommendations. This bipartisan effort will serve Colorado and America well! I fully support this effort and I am happy to help in any way that would be helpful.”

“TNC appreciates the serious undertaking of Senators Curtis, Hickenlooper, Sheehy, and Padilla to build on legislation targeted at preventing more catastrophic wildfires through improved forest and fuels management and expanded use of prescribed fire. TNC has been working to restore beneficial fire and improve the resilience of forest systems on the ground for more than 60 years. Every year, wildfires continue to grow deadlier and more devastating to communities and the environment, and we remain concerned that the significant cuts to the Forest Service workforce will impede work to protect people and nature from these wildfire risks. We support this legislative effort aimed at improving the forest management process to better address catastrophic wildfires,” said Kameran Onley, managing director of North America policy and government relations, The Nature Conservancy.

“For many Americans, catastrophic wildfires are a very real and growing threat to their homes and lives,” said Environmental Defense Fund Executive Director Amanda Leland. “The U.S. Forest Service needs new tools and more resources now to prevent and control these wildfires, and with the right funding, this bipartisan proposal will help. Protecting people and nature from catastrophic wildfire requires both a robust, science-based plan of forest management and the resources to implement it.”

“As the megafire crisis grows larger and more severe with each fire season, we need policy solutions that reflect the urgency and scale of the problem. Senators Curtis, Hickenlooper, Padilla and Sheehy have negotiated a Senate companion to the Fix Our Forests Act that will move the federal government towards a science-based, strategic approach to addressing megafires. We look forward to working with the sponsors to advance this bill and enact the most transformative wildfire and land management law in a generation—since the Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003, if not the National Forest Management Act of 1976,” said Matt Weiner, CEO of Megafire Action.

“We are thrilled to see the Fix Our Forests Act introduced in the Senate through a bipartisan cooperation between Senators Curtis, Hickenlooper, Padilla, and Sheehy. The bill greatly expands upon the version that passed the House, adding critical details to support wildfire risk reduction in the built environment and provisions for mitigating the health impacts of smoke to communities while promoting expanded use of prescribed fire,”said Annie Schmidt and Tyson Bertone-Riggs, Managing Directors, Alliance for Wildfire Resilience. “Covering a third of the recommendations of the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission, this bill is a significant step forward in wildfire policy and, coupled with sufficient funding and staffing to realize the proposed tools and programs, will make a real difference in our nation’s experience with wildfire.”

“I thank Senators Hickenlooper, Padilla, Curtis, and Sheehy for introducing this bipartisan legislation,” said Fire Chief Josh Waldo, President and Board Chair of the International Association of Fire Chiefs. “As we saw in January’s fires in Los Angeles, the nation faces a serious and growing risk from fires in the wildland urban interface (WUI). This legislation will enact many of the recommendations of the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission. It also will improve coordination of federal wildland fire preparedness efforts; promote the use of prescribed fires and other preventative measures to prevent WUI fires; and promote the development of new technologies to help local fire departments. We look forward to working with the bill’s sponsors to pass this legislation.”

“Our national forests provide essential wildlife habitat, store carbon, and supply communities across the nation with clean air and water. These vital landscapes are under threat and must be proactively stewarded if they are to survive the changing climate, rapidly intensifying wildfires, and past management missteps. The bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act will help increase the pace and scale of evidence-backed forest management, including the use of beneficial prescribed fire and the restoration of white oak forests. But we must have a robust and talented federal workforce in place for it to succeed,” said Abby Tinsley, vice president for conservation policy at the National Wildlife Federation. “We will work with Senators Hickenlooper, Padilla, Sheehy, Curtis, and Chairman Westerman in the House to strengthen and advance this important conversation.”

“The health of our nation’s forests is dependent on the rivers, streams, and wetlands that sustain them. Actively conserving and restoring these critical aquatic resources is an important tool that can be used to mitigate the impacts of wildfire and drought, among other threats,” said Alicia Marrs, director of western water for the National Wildlife Federation. “We’re encouraged to see language in the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act that recognizes the wildfire benefits of aquatic restoration. We look forward to continuing to work with leaders from both sides of the aisle to elevate these common sense and cost-effective approaches to forest and water management for all Americans.”

“Wildfires grow more intense and destructive each year, leaving behind immense devastation for our forests, wildlife, and communities,” said Marshall Johnson, chief conservation officer at the National Audubon Society.“The bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act represents an important step in reducing wildfire risks across forested landscapes. Audubon thanks Senators Hickenlooper, Curtis, Padilla, and Sheehy for working together to craft a bill that sets the stage for improved forest management, and we urge Congress to dedicate the resources necessary to ensure federal agencies are well-equipped to reduce wildfire risks, steward our forestlands, and protect wildlife habitat.”

“The growing frequency and severity of wildfires pose a tremendous threat to the health of our forests and the safety of countless communities. The Fix Our Forests Act takes important steps to mitigate wildfires, improve forest health, and protect local communities. We appreciate this thoughtful, bipartisan effort led by Senators Curtis, Hickenlooper, Sheehy, and Padilla to advance this important legislation,” said Jennifer Tyler, VP of Government Affairs at Citizens’ Climate Lobby.

“The declining health of our National Forests and the fish and wildlife habitat that they provide is a concern for America’s hunters and anglers,”said Joel Pedersen, president and CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. “TRCP applauds the leadership of Senators Curtis, Sheehy, Hickenlooper, and Padilla for introducing the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act in the Senate and urges Congress to advance these important forest management provisions and to accompany them with adequate resources and capacity to carry out on-the-ground work.”

“HECHO enthusiastically applauds the impressive bipartisan leadership behind the Senate’s Fix Our Forests Act. At a time when cooperation is more important than ever, these Senators are putting forward real, thoughtful solutions to reduce wildfire risk while engaging local and rural communities. This legislation is a critical step toward actively managing our forests to protect public lands, watersheds, and the communities that depend on them. By expediting emergency authorities in high-risk firesheds —and through the creation of the Wildfire Intelligence Center—this effort has the potential to significantly reduce catastrophic wildfires and strengthen prediction and response, particularly in fire-prone states like Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, and Utah. It’s a shining example of the kind of balanced, forward-looking leadership we need to protect our natural landscapes and communities,” said Camilla Simon, Executive Director of Hispanics Enjoying Camping, Hunting, and the Outdoors (HECHO).

“BPC Action applauds the bipartisan leadership of Sens. Curtis (R-UT), Hickenlooper (D-CO), Sheehy (R-MT), and Padilla (D-CA) on the introduction of the Fix Our Forests Act. By streamlining and improving forest and hazardous fuels management activities on public and Tribal lands, this legislation will help reduce wildfire risks, improve forest health, and protect communities in fire-prone areas. The Fix Our Forests Act also delivers substantial economic and environmental benefits by addressing critical needs to enhance the domestic supply chain of seeds and advance biochar commercialization,” said Michele Stockwell, President of Bipartisan Policy Center Action (BPC Action).

“The Senate’s bipartisan Fix Our Forest Act is a critical step toward restoring forest health and reducing catastrophic wildfire risk. This bipartisan legislation tackles the root causes of catastrophic wildfires by fixing the Cottonwood decision, reforming litigation standards, expanding categorical exclusions up to 10,000 acres, and boosting restoration capacity through long-term stewardship contracts and extended Good Neighbor Authority. Healthy forests require active stewardship—not bureaucratic delay. We thank Senators Hickenlooper, Sheehy, Padilla, and Curtis for bringing forward this bill, and we urge swift passage of this much-needed legislation,” said Brian Yabolnski, CEO of The Property and Environment Research Center (PERC).

“Wildfires continue to ravage communities igniting homes, businesses, and infrastructure. APCIA commends Senators Curtis, Hickenlooper, Sheehy, and Padilla for their bipartisan leadership of the Fix Our Forests Act. The bill would improve fire assessment and prediction for wildland areas and communities to improve response, reduce hazardous fuels, enable greater vegetation management by utilities in federal rights-of-way to prevent fires, and create a community wildfire risk reduction program to support fire-resistant building methods, codes, and standards, promote ignition-resistant materials, defensible space, and other measures to reduce risk,” said David A. Sampson, President & CEO of APCIA

“The Fix Our Forests Act streamlines collaboration between the National Wild Turkey Federation, the USDA Forest Service, and other partners, cutting red tape to accelerate urgent forest restoration and management on federal lands,” said Matt Lindler, NWTF Director of Government Affairs. “This bill ensures we can better manage and conserve vital natural resources for wildlife, hunters and anglers. We are grateful to see the Senate introduce this critical piece of legislation and await the signature from the president.”

“There is no time to waste in restoring and reforesting the forests that work every day to be the lungs of our nation,” said Brian Kittler, Chief Program Officer-Resilient Forests. “More than ever before successful and timely forest restoration will require strengthened coordination across federal, state, and tribal governments together with non-profit organizations. This bill prioritizes a complementary series of actions that will accelerate wildfire resilience and community resilience including ensuring post-fire reforestation is implemented quickly and with the best available science.”

“The science is clear: tackling the wildfire crisis requires better forest management, increasing the use of prescribed fire, and investing in and deploying the next generation of wildfire technologies. The Fix Our Forests Act will get this urgently needed work done. Now is the time for the Senate to build on the bipartisan leadership demonstrated by the sponsors and pass this bill,” said James Campbell, Wildfire Policy Specialist at the Federation of American Scientists.

“CWI commends Senator Curtis, Senator Hickenlooper, Senator Sheehy, and Senator Padilla for their bipartisan efforts to meaningfully address the wildfire crisis. The Fix Our Forests Act is an important step towards accelerating proven solutions to reduce catastrophic fire risk, improve forest and ecosystem health, and safeguard our local communities,” said Marissa Christiansen, Executive Director at the Climate and Wildfire Institute.“We are pleased to see many recommendations from the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission Report included in the updated legislation, including a directive to establish the Wildfire Intelligence Center to serve as the national hub for wildfire data, prediction, and response. We look forward to working with the bill’s sponsors to help accelerate solutions to the wildfire crisis by incorporating the best available science, data, and management principles into commonsense policy reform and decision-making.”

“AFI supports the Fix Our Forests Act and calls on the United States Senate to pass it with the urgency the $100 billion a year wildfire crisis warrants from our elected officials,” said Bill Clerico, Founding Chair of AFI and Managing Partner of Convective Capital. “AFI is particularly supportive of the legislation’s inclusion of a Wildfire Intelligence Center, a long-overdue step to better integrate and coordinate wildfire response efforts and invest in cutting-edge technology. Our country’s wildfire response efforts are antiquated and are leaving us ill-prepared for this growing crisis. FOFA is a critical step to refining our wildfire response efforts and protecting our communities.”

“State forestry agencies play a lead role not only in managing and protecting over 550 million acres of state and private forests, but also working to improve the health and resiliency of federal lands through cross-boundary partnerships nationwide. State Foresters are also responsible for wildfire protection on more than 1.5 billion acres and, in collaboration with local fire departments, responding to 80 percent of the nation’s wildland fires,” said Jay Farrell, Executive Director of the NASF. “NASF applauds the bipartisan work of Senators Sheehy, Curtis, Hickenlooper, and Padilla to chart a path forward to greatly enhance wildfire management and recovery efforts and stem the tide of disastrous wildfires that threaten our nation’s forests and the livelihood of communities that depend on them. We recognize that many of the improvements made in the Fix Our Forests Act are nuanced and look forward to continuing our work with Congress to ensure its landmark reforms become law.”

“The poor health of our federal forests exacerbates the wildfires that negatively impact wildlife habitat, sportsmen’s access, and communities across the country, and comprehensive reforms are needed to actively treat hazardous fuels efficiently and at scale to increase forest resiliency to severe wildfires, insects, and disease,” said John Culclasure, Senior Director of Forest Policy at the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation. “We are grateful for the bipartisan leadership of Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus Members Senators Curtis, Hickenlooper, Padilla, and Sheehy for introducing the Fix Our Forests Act to improve forest management through strengthened authorities, collaborative tools, and improved processes. We look forward to working with the bill sponsors to advance the legislation quickly as we approach wildfire season.”

“Arnold Ventures praises the bipartisan introduction of the Fix Our Forests Act, an evidence-based, constructive proposal to cut red tape and prevent catastrophic forest fires. We applaud Senators John Curtis (R‑UT), John Hickenlooper (D‑CO), Tim Sheehy (R‑MT), and Alex Padilla (D‑CA) for their work to craft and introduce this important and necessary legislation. We encourage all Senators to support and ultimately pass the Fix Our Forests Act,” said Charlie Anderson, Executive Vice President for infrastructure at Arnold Ventures. “AV also thanks Reps. Bruce Westerman (R‑AR) and Scott Peters (D‑CA) for championing this vital work in the House of Representatives. We are heartened by the collaborative work across party lines in both chambers to support thoughtful, bipartisan policy that will save lives and property.”

“Berkshire Hathaway Energy applauds the Senate introduction of the Fix Our Forests Act and thanks the bipartisan group of Senators who worked together to move it forward. The bill’s provisions would improve forest management activities on federal and tribal lands in common-sense ways, improving their resilience to wildfire,” said Scott Thon, President and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. “Passage and enactment of these provisions would be a step to help prevent catastrophic wildfires and lessen their environmental damage. Berkshire Hathaway Energy recognizes the growing threat of wildfires affects everyone and requires holistic solutions with businesses, governments and key stakeholders working together to design and implement constructive, enduring solutions.”

“Our forests face serious threats, and this bipartisan bill is a vital step forward in addressing complex forest health challenges,” said Joel Ferry, Executive Director of the Utah Department of Natural Resources. “It gives land managers the tools to proactively reduce wildfire risk, protect critical watersheds, and restore forest ecosystems through stronger collaboration.”

“The bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act provides much-needed tools that will move the needle and improve our work to mitigate wildfires,” said CAL FIRE Director and Fire Chief Joe Tyler. “This bill will bring California’s use of cutting-edge technology to the rest of the country. The proposed Wildfire Intelligence Center will advance the kind of predictive services, monitoring, and early detection work already happening at California’s Wildfire Forecast and Threat Intelligence Integration Center.”

“Utah’s farmers and ranchers applaud Senator Curtis’ sponsorship of the ‘Fix Our Forests Act’, which will enhance forest health, reduce wildfire risks, and protect vital watersheds. We are particularly encouraged by provisions promoting locally-led restoration efforts, targeted grazing as a wildfire mitigation tool, and watershed protection strategies,” said ValJay Rigby, Utah Farm Bureau Federation President. “The Utah Farm Bureau appreciates the bill’s emphasis on active forest management and increasing the pace and scale of treatment projects to address catastrophic wildfire risks. The ‘Fix Our Forests Act’ represents a significant step toward healthier forests and safer communities.”

BACKGROUND:

The West has long been prone to wildfires, but climate change, prolonged drought, and the buildup of dry fuels have increasingly intensified these fires and extended fire seasons. Wildfires today are more catastrophic – growing larger, spreading faster, and burning more land than ever before.

Colorado has seen four of the five largest fires in our state’s history since 2020, including this summer’s Lee Fire. The 2021 Marshall fire was Colorado’s most destructive on record, burning over 1,000 homes. The Cameron Peak and East Troublesome fires in 2020 together burned more than 400,000 acres, the two largest fires in the state’s history. Nationwide, total acres burned rose from 2.7 million in 2023 to nearly 9 million in 2024, a 231% increase.

Forest health challenges are also increasing in frequency and severity due to climate stressors like drought and fire, and biological threats like invasive species – all of which the West is particularly vulnerable to. From 2001 to 2019, total U.S. forest area declined by 2.3%, with the Intermountain West experiencing the largest losses by area.

To address these challenges, the Fix Our Forests Act would:

Establish new and updated programs to reduce wildfire risks across large, high-priority “firesheds,” with an emphasis on cross-boundary collaboration.

Streamline and expand tools for forest health projects (e.g., stewardship contracting, Good Neighbor Agreements) and provide faster processes for certain hazardous fuels treatments.

Create a single interagency program to help communities in the wildland-urban interface build and retrofit with wildfire-resistant measures, while simplifying and consolidating grant applications.

Boost reforestation with the inclusion of Hickenlooper’s Reforestation, Nurseries, and Genetic Resources (RNGR) Support Act to support reforestation capacity of state, tribal, and private nurseries.

Strengthen coordination efforts across agencies through a new Wildfire Intelligence Center with the inclusion of Hickenlooper’s bipartisan Wildfire Intelligence Collaboration and Coordination Act of 2025, which would streamline federal response and create a whole-of-government approach to combating wildfires.

Support prescribed fire activities on both federal and non-federal lands – prioritizing large, cross-boundary projects, strengthening the prescribed fire workforce, and facilitating coordination on air quality protections.

Expand research and demonstration initiatives – including biochar projects and the Community Wildfire Defense Research Program – to test and deploy cutting-edge wildfire prevention, detection, and mitigation technologies.

Enable watershed protection and restoration projects to include adjacent non-federal lands; establish new programs for white oak restoration; and clarify policies to reduce wildfire-related litigation and expedite forest health treatments.

Janine Warren wanted an electric vehicle to cut her carbon footprint, but she also wanted a Cadillac, preferably a small SUV.

After General Motors Co. launched its Cadillac Optiq early this year, Warren, an accounting coordinator at the public school district in Norman, Oklahoma, picked one up in April, trading in her gas-burning Cadillac SUV.

“We’re kind of Cadillac people,” she said. “But I feel like this is my favorite car by far, as far as a smooth ride and a quiet ride.”

Americans bought 310,800 electric vehicles in the second quarter of the year, a 6.3% drop from the year-earlier period, according to Cox Automotive Inc. However, the sales dip — 21,000 vehicles — was nearly equal to the slump in transactions for Tesla Inc., the longtime market leader whose CEO triggered a backlash among a wide swath of potential buyers.

Other carmakers also reported sagging sales, but many saw a growing number of buyers. Altogether, EV sales from rival brands were level in the quarter, driven largely by a sales surge for new models from GM. The company is now selling 12 fully electric vehicles in the US and commands 15% of the US EV market, triple that of Ford Motor Co. That means GM is now selling one electric vehicle for every three Teslas, a major coup given Tesla controlled 80% of the market four years ago.

CEO Mary Barra said profitable EV sales are now the company’s “North Star” on an earnings call Tuesday morning. “We are growing in EVs because we have a strategic portfolio of vehicles that people love for their design, performance, range and value,” she said.

Honda Motor Co. Ltd. also notched a sales boom in the period. Meanwhile, a handful of brands saw their EVs lose momentum, including Hyundai Motor Co. and Ford, which halted sales of one of its popular models over a software glitch.

GM appears to have unlocked the puzzle of EV affordability, which remains one of the bugaboos keeping drivers from going electric. Its Chevrolet Equinox EV, which debuted last year, starts at $33,600 without federal or state incentives. That’s almost one-third less than what a typical car or truck sells for in America these days. From April through June, some 17,420 people drove off in an Equinox EV, behind only Tesla’s Model Y and Model 3.

“It’s all about the affordability,” explained Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox. “And consumers are familiar with the Chevy brand.”

GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson has said the Equinox, in particular, is “gaining momentum with mainstream consumers.” At Cadillac, meanwhile, one in five models sold is now electric.

Long-term EV adoption in the US is expected to slump after the Trump administration dismantled federal incentives and continues to attack clean-air mandates. BloombergNEF forecasts 27% of the US market will be electric by 2030, down from the 48% share it estimated a year ago.

However, Cox expects EV buying to be frenzied until Sept. 30, when federal purchase incentives of up to $7,500 per vehicle expire. Ford, for example, is telling dealers to expect a rush of third-quarter buyers.

“We’re definitely going to see a lot of manufacturers and dealers try to create a sense of urgency,” Valdez Streaty said.

Warren in Oklahoma is one of the customers who accelerated her purchase to grab the government incentives. She had eight months left on the lease of her gas-powered Cadillac, but turned the keys in early. She won’t be buying another combustion engine.

“The technology is only going to get better and the range is only going to get better,” Warren said, “so it’s like, ‘Why go back?’”

The company plans to convert over 600 Shell locations into electric charging stations.
""This marks the first time in Finland that we're continuing operations at the station without any liquid fuels,"" said Juha Vanninen, head of retail in Finland at St1.
In fact, almost one in five vehicles sold was electric in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency.
St1 shows that it's possible to make EV charging stations more accessible to owners by building a strong network of them across Nordic countries.","Finland recently marked a milestone in the global shift away from dirty fuels. Nordic energy company St1 turned a Shell gas station into a power station solely for electric vehicles, cutting out gas and diesel entirely, reported Electrive.

The company plans to convert over 600 Shell locations into electric charging stations. ""This marks the first time in Finland that we're continuing operations at the station without any liquid fuels,"" said Juha Vanninen, head of retail in Finland at St1.

This comes at a time when EVs are becoming more popular than ever across the globe. In fact, almost one in five vehicles sold was electric in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency.

EVs have a lot of advantages compared to gas-powered vehicles. It costs less to charge an EV than to fuel a gas-powered car, for one. Consumer Reports data also shows that EV owners spend about 50% less on maintenance over their vehicles' lifetime.

If you have solar panels installed at home, you could save even more. Solar makes charging costs more affordable — sometimes cutting your energy bill down to $0. Consider using the free solar installation quote tool from EnergySage to find a vetted installer in your area.

EVs also benefit the planet by reducing pollution from tailpipes and helping clean up the air in communities, especially urban areas.

St1 shows that it's possible to make EV charging stations more accessible to owners by building a strong network of them across Nordic countries.

Other companies are doing similar expansions, like EVgo, which is attempting to more than triple its network across America by 2029. And DeCharge launched a pilot program allowing property owners to install its chargers on their properties.

Building out these networks could encourage more people to buy EVs and, in turn, speed up the shift to cleaner transportation and less reliance on dirty fuels.

The move has already caught the attention of many online.

A Redditor commented on a post about St1's station conversions in r/electricvehicles: ""Norway has been a leader in all countries going EV. Super cool to see and hope to see more of this!""

Robotics can play a role in addressing the climate The long history of robotics is deeply rooted in the pursuit of efficiency and safety.
The time to invest, innovate, and integrate robotics into our climate strategy is now, before the opportunity to make a meaningful decarbonization impact disappears.","The U.S. is losing the game. We all want to leave our country more prosperous, secure, and sustainable for future generations, with a thriving domestic manufacturing sector. We’re locked into a constant competition with China in innovation, but while America is still pursuing this future, China’s industry has already been successful.

Just look at China’s electric vehicle (EV) sector: it’s now a massive economic engine for the country‘s manufacturing base, spawning giants like CATL and BYD while contributing to significant improvements in air quality across Chinese cities. This success story offers a roadmap that we can and should follow domestically.

However, we’re well behind, and our only path to competitiveness lies through rapidly advancing automation and manufacturing efficiency—with robotics at the core of this strategy.

State of robotics adoption in the U.S.

A large focus of the new administration has been to bring manufacturing stateside, with tariffs and other policies incentivizing domestic production. But this means very little considering the massive manufacturing labor shortage. According to the Manufacturing Institute, the industry will need 3.8 million additional workers by 2033, but as many as 2.1 million will go unfilled — with an opportunity cost of about $1 trillion a year to the U.S. economy.

While concerns about labor displacement are valid and require proactive solutions, the reality is stark. If we want more industrialization in the U.S., the only path to growth and competitiveness on a global scale is through the uptake of advanced automation and robotics. If we don’t, we’re not even in the race.

The U.S. is already seeing large-scale private investment into next-generation robotics applications, with robotics-related startups securing around $6.1 billion in venture capital investments last year.

Fueled by breakthroughs in computer vision and foundation AI models, what it means to be state-of-the-art is shifting. It will soon be possible that robots will be able to accomplish more and more complex tasks on their own, adapting to their environments and making decisions without relying on predefined logic or human teleoperation. This evolution promises efficiency gains, improved productivity through round-the-clock operation, and automation of tasks previously deemed impossible.

However, to meet this potential and translate this momentum in industrial deployment, the country needs a national strategy. Admittedly, we’ve had the opportunity to make meaningful gains domestically with technology that has already been in existence for many years. We now stand at yet another technological inflection point, and to fail to engage with strategic clarity and a unified vision would be missing an opportunity we may not see again.

The potential for economic growth and, I’d argue, accelerated decarbonization as a co-benefit, is enormous. Today’s global average robot density is still relatively low at 162 units per 10,000 manufacturing employees.

Editor’s note: RoboBusiness 2025, which will be on Oct. 15 and 16 in Santa Clara, Calif., will feature a panel on “Closing the Robotics Gap With China.” Register now to attend.

Robotics can play a role in addressing the climate

The long history of robotics is deeply rooted in the pursuit of efficiency and safety. From the early days of automotive manufacturing, with robots like Unimate shouldering dangerous tasks, to today’s agile mobile robots and sophisticated drones, the trajectory has been clear: Robotics enable us to do more with less.

These advancements laid the groundwork for the resource efficiency that is crucial in our fight to mitigate climate impacts as our economy continues to grow. It has the potential to make various climate technologies more effective and also meet labor demands of the climate industry. Recent estimates indicate an additional 13 million workers will be required to meet the needs from “green growth” across the world’s biggest economies.

Robotics are already enabling meaningful market growth for decarbonization use cases. Often in use cases that fall under the “4 Ds” framework: dull, dirty, dangerous, and dear (expensive) tasks. These are precisely the areas where robots can provide the most significant decarbonization co-benefits.

Certain sectors — such as grid upgrades, manufacturing, and mining — can capture disproportionate benefits by adding robots to the workforce. They aid in avoiding labor shortages and perform operations in extreme conditions unsafe for people.

From automating solar farm construction, EVs, and battery manufacturing to enhancing wildfire prevention and land use management, American startups are already leveraging robotics to tackle some of the most pressing environmental challenges.

The energy and industrial infrastructure sectors are already embracing this potential. Companies like Terabase are scaling robotics for solar installation, increasing labor productivity by 2x and dramatically reducing costs.

In land management, Kodama Robotics and BurnBot are emerging as crucial tools for wildfire prevention and suppression, and for more efficient reforestation efforts. For aviation, a sector that is notoriously difficult to decarbonize, Pyka is using autonomous aircraft for cargo delivery and crop dusting to reduce CO2 emissions by over 90%.

Even in mature markets like manufacturing, articulated robotic arms and autonomous logistics robots have long been recognized for their role in driving productivity, efficiency gains, and, consequently, emissions reductions.

Assuming a 5% emissions improvement across the whole industrial light manufacturing economy, this could be a reduction of over 30 million tons of CO2 emissions. And, that’s just the start.

Learning from China’s Success

China has become the global leader in both industrialization and the emerging climate economy as a result of its robotics and automation advances and widespread adoption. It has dominated market expansion across solar cells, EVs, batteries, and other crucial technologies. In turn, decarbonization technologies have proven to be massive economic growth drivers in China.

We’re now seeing the flywheel effect. Robotics offers a clear pathway to greater efficiency, reduced emissions, and a more sustainable future. It has long been core to scaling emerging climate technologies, and to make the U.S. a compelling and competitive manufacturing powerhouse, we must embrace automation to even be in the game.

The current technical inflection point makes this opportunity even more exciting, but potential alone is insufficient. We all want more domestic manufacturing and communities that are clean and safe from increasing climate disasters. Our industrialization pursuits and the emerging global climate economy are inexplicably tied.

The time to invest, innovate, and integrate robotics into our climate strategy is now, before the opportunity to make a meaningful decarbonization impact disappears. America has the innovation capacity and entrepreneurial drive to lead this transition — we simply need the strategic vision and commitment to make it happen.

As the AI and data center boom continues, the battle over who pays for America’s energy future—and who profits—shows no signs of cooling down.","Private investment in America’s electric utilities is booming as the artificial intelligence revolution and the demand for massive data centers send shockwaves through local power grids and communities. From the sun-baked fields of New Mexico to the pine forests of Minnesota, private equity firms and Big Tech giants are pouring billions into utilities and infrastructure, reshaping how—and for whom—electricity is delivered.

According to The Independent, private investment firms are aggressively acquiring stakes in electric utilities that serve more than 150 million customers across the United States. This surge is driven by the explosive growth of energy-hungry data centers, a trend ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Greg Brown, a finance professor at the University of North Carolina, summed up the motivation: “The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made.”

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink made the firm’s ambitions clear in a July interview on CNBC, declaring, “Infrastructure is at the beginning of a golden age. We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy, and energy.”

The deals are stacking up. Blackstone is seeking regulatory approval to buy out the Public Service Company of New Mexico and Texas New Mexico Power Co., while Wisconsin regulators have already greenlit the buyout of Superior Water, Light and Power. Last year, Blackstone also acquired a 19.9% stake in Northern Indiana Public Service Co. But nowhere is the fight more intense than in Minnesota, where a proposed $6.2 billion buyout of Allete, parent company of Minnesota Power, has sparked a fierce debate that could set the tone for future utility takeovers.

The proposed deal would see a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board acquire Allete for $67 a share—a 19% premium. Minnesota Power, which serves 150,000 customers and manages a portfolio of coal, gas, wind, and solar power sources, is seen as a valuable prize. The potential for Google to build a data center in the region only raises the stakes, making ownership of Minnesota Power even more lucrative.

Supporters of the buyout, including building trades unions and the administration of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, argue that BlackRock’s deep pockets will help the utility meet the state’s ambitious clean energy goals. Allete projects it will need $4.3 billion over five years for transmission and clean energy projects to comply with Minnesota’s requirement that utilities deliver 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040. The company insists that BlackRock’s ownership would not change its operations, strategy, or values, and that the buyout price will not impact electric rates.

But not everyone is convinced. The state attorney general’s office, industrial customers such as U.S. Steel and Enbridge, and consumer advocates are sounding the alarm. Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute put it bluntly: “It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from.”

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive turned consumer advocate, testified against the Minnesota Power buyout. He explained, “It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it. The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.” He and others worry that private equity’s incentive is to maximize returns by pushing for higher capital investments—like new poles and wires—since regulators allow utility owners to earn around 10% returns on such spending.

The skepticism is shared by regulators. In July, administrative law judge Megan J. McKenzie recommended rejecting the BlackRock deal, citing the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do—pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.” The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission staff echoed these concerns, warning that private investors could saddle Minnesota Power’s parent company with massive debts, borrow at low interest rates, and earn outsized profits if regulators grant generous returns. “For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses—it is a lose-lose.”

Meanwhile, in rural Louisiana, the impact of Big Tech’s energy appetite is playing out in real time. As reported by KNOE, Meta (the company behind Facebook and Instagram) is building a $10 billion data center in Richland Parish—so large it covers the area of 70 football fields and will consume more power daily than the entire city of New Orleans at peak summer usage. To support this behemoth, Entergy agreed to construct three gas-powered plants producing 2,262 megawatts, with the total infrastructure bill topping $3 billion.

The Louisiana Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August 2025, touting added consumer protections. Yet, critical details remain shrouded in secrecy due to nondisclosure agreements. Consumer advocates and even some commissioners are frustrated by the lack of transparency. Mandy DeRoche of Earthjustice warned, “You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community.”

Meta has agreed to fund about half the construction costs over 15 years but not the maintenance or operation of the new power plants. The company is also exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law, a move the state acknowledges could result in “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue. Critics fear that if Meta withdraws or fails to renew its contract, the public could be left footing the bill for decades. All grid users are already expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Locals in Richland Parish have mixed feelings. Some, like drywall business owner Trae Banks, welcome the economic boost and the promise of 500 new jobs. “We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” Banks said. Others worry about a boom-and-bust cycle, rising housing costs, and displacement. Mayor Jesse Washington of nearby Delhi noted, “We have a lot of concerned people—they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here. I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

States are scrambling to adapt. More than a dozen have moved to protect ratepayers from bearing the costs of powering data centers. Pennsylvania is drafting a model rate structure, New Jersey is studying the cost impacts, Oregon passed new legislation, and Texas implemented a “kill switch” law to reduce data center loads during emergencies.

As the AI and data center boom continues, the battle over who pays for America’s energy future—and who profits—shows no signs of cooling down. With billions at stake and communities caught in the crossfire, the outcome will shape not just utility bills but the very fabric of the nation’s digital and economic infrastructure.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/i7QrK73-U3tDx2GBTVqScro9jPM=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2F03d359f7-08ce-45e9-9285-f2b2b056b58f.jpeg,N,,2025-09-27 11:03:19.447226

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

RELATED STORY | As electric bills rise, evidence mounts that data centers share blame

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy"" and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/483169f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+176/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fe0%2F4e924da54e689440282f9f6046a4%2Fap25268584312807.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 12:03:36.650184

Energy analysts now expect that no new offshore wind farms will get built in the United States after 2028.","Oil and gas executives are expressing concern about the Trump administration’s attacks on offshore wind, including attempts to block the construction of projects off the East Coast.

Executives generally have refrained from publicly denouncing President Trump, but in interviews with The New York Times, some voiced misgivings about what they have seen as undue political meddling in energy.

“Ever-changing policy, particularly as administrations change, is not good for business,” Darren Woods, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, said in a recent interview. “It’s not good for the economy and ultimately, it’s not good for people.”

Mr. Woods, who runs the largest U.S. oil and gas company, was responding to a question about the Trump administration’s attempts to halt fully permitted offshore wind farms. He stopped short of directly criticizing those actions.

Others have shared more pointed concerns privately, including that efforts to rescind federal approvals could set a precedent that a future administration could use to hamper pipelines or other fossil fuel infrastructure.

“Life is long, and the sword being wielded against the renewables industry right now will likely boomerang back in 3.5 years against traditional energy,” reads a response to a recent anonymized survey of oil and gas companies by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.

A federal judge recently allowed work to restart on one offshore wind project that the Trump administration tried to stop, a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island called Revolution Wind. Another, Empire Wind, was able to proceed after federal officials lifted a stop-work order after negotiations with Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York, a Democrat.

The Trump administration has said it wanted to assess how offshore wind farms might affect national security.

Asked about the oil and gas industry’s concerns, a White House spokeswoman, Taylor Rogers, criticized the actions of Mr. Trump’s predecessors.

“It was Obama and Biden who declared war on the energy industry by shutting down gas pipelines, banning offshore drilling in large parts of our waters, halting L.N.G. export terminals and freezing coal mining projects,” she said.

Mr. Trump is not the first president to oppose energy projects, though the practice appears to be escalating. President Joseph R. Biden revoked a federal permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline in 2021, saying the project was not in the national interest. The pipeline, which would have carried oil from Alberta to Nebraska, was under construction.

Mr. Biden also paused federal approvals for new natural gas export infrastructure last year to study how they would affect the climate, economy and national security. A federal judge later ordered that the pause be lifted.

Mr. Trump has been especially blunt in attacking wind turbines and has made unfounded claims about them, including that they cause cancer and are responsible for whale deaths.

His administration has sought to block all new leasing for wind farms on federal lands and waters and moved to revoke federal approval for other permitted wind developments off the coasts of Maryland and Massachusetts. The White House also recently instructed a half-dozen federal agencies to probe the risks of offshore wind, The Times has reported.

“Windmills, we’re just not going to allow them,” Mr. Trump said during a recent cabinet meeting.

The quicker phaseout of tax credits for wind power, passed by Congress this summer, is only adding to the industry’s troubles. Energy analysts now expect that no new offshore wind farms will get built in the United States after 2028.

“I feel for the wind guys, man,” said Toby Rice, the chief executive of Pittsburgh-based EQT, one of the country’s largest natural gas producers. “I know exactly how it feels when you have an energy project that’s close to getting built getting stopped. I would like to see a world where that doesn’t happen.”

Trade organizations have said they are especially concerned about the Trump administration’s efforts to revoke already-granted permits.

“Not only does this inject significant uncertainty into the infrastructure development process, but it invariably increases the price of the projects and risks raising the cost of electricity, diminishing our ability to meet growing demand,” Martin Durbin, the senior vice president of policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, wrote earlier this month.

Jason Grumet, who leads the American Clean Power Association, has said his trade group of renewable energy companies has heard from members that there is now a risk premium associated with investing in the United States.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/26/multimedia/26biz-oil-wind-mhpt/26biz-oil-wind-mhpt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 11:02:39.369295

When compared to historical levels, the air quality in the United States has improved. However, exposure to air pollution remains one of the top environmental health risks faced by Americans. It is estimated that one hundred thousand to two hundred thousand deaths annually are associated with this exposure, which exceeds the deaths from murders and car crashes combined.

This makes searching for information regarding President Trump’s ending of electric vehicle (EV) tax credits in September a perfect chore for the AI bot. Below is what ChatGPT pulled together regarding the end of EV credits in 2025 and how it will impact car buyers.

Also here is a popular loophole to still score the EV tax credit.

What’s Specifically Changing?

Until Sept. 30, qualified new EV buyers can still get up to $7,500 in the form of a tax credit. Used buyers may be eligible for a credit of up to $4,000, with some restrictions. But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act or OBBBA, eliminates the credits for both new and used EVs as of that date.

For those cutting it close to the deadline, it’s important to note that delivery does not have to occur before Sept. 30. What’s important is that you’ve signed a contract with a deposit or payment before the deadline.

What Does This Mean for EV Buyers?

Some of the consequences of the EV credit expiration are obvious. For starters, this means that EVs will effectively cost more for most buyers after Sept. 30. There might also be a “gold rush” at dealers in the last two weeks of September as buyers potentially flood dealer lots trying to cash in before the credits expire. But here are some additional consequences listed by ChatGPT:

More emphasis on local and state incentives: Federal EV credits aren’t the only game in town. Those offered by various states and municipalities may see growing importance in terms of incentive pricing. Buyers should do their homework and see what non-federal credits may still be available, both before and after Sept. 30.

Sales may slow after Sept. 30: If you wouldn’t qualify for an EV credit anyway, you might be rewarded by purchasing an EV after the deadline. As demand is expected to wane once the tax breaks go away, dealers may have to offer their own incentives to purchasers after Sept. 30. This puts post-deadline buyers in the driver’s seat when it comes to negotiations, including in the leasing market.

Used EVs may drop in value: ChatGPT noted that used EV values might shift as well if demand drops after the credits end. Resale and trade-in values are likely to fall as used EV buyers can no longer avail of the federal tax credit. This could also open up opportunities for buyers.

Steps To Take Now

If you find yourself rushing to get an EV before the credits expire, here are the action steps that ChatGPT suggests you take:

Act before Sept. 30: If you’re in the position to do it, at least put down a deposit to lock in your purchase, even if you can’t take delivery until after the deadline.

Check eligibility of the specific EV model (new or used): Not all vehicles qualify for the federal credit to start with, so don’t rush in without knowing all of the facts. Some of the factors that could impact eligibility include assembly location, battery/mineral sourcing, dealer, price and so on.

Compare total costs, not just sticker price: This part of the equation often gets overshadowed by the large $7,500 credit. When determining whether or not an EV is a value, factor in not just the federal credit and any state or local incentives but also likely charging costs, maintenance, utility/charging cost savings and so on.

Explore state and local incentives: As mentioned above, federal credits are not the only game in town. Some states may step up or boost incentives to make up for the loss at the federal level. Where you live may actually end up mattering a lot.

Consider transportation alternatives in your budget if the cost of EVs rises: It’s a simple fact that without the federal credits, other alternatives, including hybrid, PHEV or even highly efficient gas models, may actually make your purchase more cost-competitive.

Plan for resale and charging infrastructure: Even after the subsidies expire, two factors can help maintain the value of your EV: the quality of the charging infrastructure in your area and the overall demand for electric vehicles relative to other locations.

If you’re looking to snag EV tax credits before they expire — and potentially never come back — you’ve got to act fast. While you should never rush into a financial transaction, particularly one that is likely to be the second-largest in your life after buying a home, in this case, haste could translate to thousands of dollars in savings.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy"" and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”

More than two dozen Republican attorneys general, led by West Virginia’s J.B. McCuskey and Kentucky’s Russell Coleman have urged President Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency to , claiming the rule is holding back American industry and the county’s energy dominance.

The Sierra Club warns dropping a rule that effects emissions from cars, industry and power plants would gut the EPA’s power to fight climate pollution, harm public health and impact weather.

""I believe that climate change is real. I think that virtually all science agrees that it's real,” West Virginia Sierra Club Chair Jim Kotcon said. “Denying that reality and impacts from that is not a science. It’s not a service to the citizens of West Virginia.""

McCuskey said that power rests with Congress, that the EPA's past actions were an overreach and the only rational energy for West Virginia and the nation involves coal, oil and natural gas.

The GOP attorneys general argue that the original endangerment finding was illegal because only Congress could act on a decision so economically and politically significant.

""We have one pathway insuring that this country moves in the direction that we want and that is to a rational energy policy that recognizes that the minerals that have been placed under our feet by the creator need to be developed in a way that causes prosperity for every American and - particularly in my opinion - every single West Virginia,” he said.

McCuskey contends the price for the rule has been too high.

If Ford uses this opportunity to correct those habits, it can turn the page to a bright future.

Ford’s reshaping of its Dearborn product development and executive complexes — the global automaker is moving its world headquarters, including executives, closer to where product design and engineering take place — gives the automaker a rare a chance to overhaul its product planning and vehicle development processes, breaking bad habits that have plagued it for decades.

Ford must get this right.

Many of the automaker’s recent decisions to delay and change vehicle programs appear reactive and short-term, opening gaps in its lineup, wasting time and resources. If Ford uses this opportunity to correct those habits, it can turn the page to a bright future.

Otherwise, apparently dramatic moves like bulldozing its 70-year-old Glass House headquarters building and an even older design and engineering center will amount to little more than pouring old wine into new bottles.

Bright spots, big challenges

Ford’s current development process has created bright spots:

F-series pickups remain the unchallenged sales leaders, approaching a mind-boggling 43 years as America’s No. 1 selling model line.

The brilliant Maverick pickup created a new class of affordable and appealing compact vehicles.

The reinvention of the Bronco SUV raised expectations of serious off-roaders, creating welcome competition to the Jeep Wrangler.

But those triumphs look more like isolated incidents of brilliance than the result of a rigorous, repeatable system that efficiently allocates billions of dollars and tens of thousands of people.

Ford also:

Repeatedly delayed the second-generation F-150 Lightning electric pickup.

Canceled a new family of three-row electric SUVs after years of expensive development.

Is about to idle a massive factory in Louisville, Kentucky, that turned out two important vehicles — the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair compact SUVs — to build a family of new electric vehicles.

“The end of the Escape and Corsair will mean Ford has fewer vehicles to sell,” S&P Global Mobility principal analyst Stephanie Brinley said. “It’ll take a while for that plant to get back up to meaningful production scale.Ford’s not going to build 150,000 vehicles in the first year, and capacity there exists for 250,000 to 300,000” vehicles.

At the same time, the sprawling BlueOval City manufacturing complex in Stanton, Tennessee, being created 340 miles away from Louisville Assembly to make EVs and batteries waits in limbo as Ford pauses the next generation of the F-150 Lightning until 2028 at the earliest.

'At the 5 yard line'

“Every reset entails years of lost sales and billions of dollars of lost investment,” said Paul Waatti, AutoPacific director of industry analysis. “There’s a time and a place to make a pivot, but it’s not when you’re at the 5 yard line.

“Ford has set itself behind quite a bit.”

Ford generated headlines announcing a new generation of electric vehicles, but there’s cause for concern about its ability to execute that, or any, plan without fundamental change.

The very fact that Ford physically moved the vehicle development team 2,000 miles from its Dearborn engineering center to Long Beach, California, to work in secret demonstrates how broken the system is.

The problem isn’t Dearborn, or that people working on the secret project might have their creative process sullied by parking next to employees involved in the automaker’s current products.

A 'skunk works' can’t fix what ails Ford

The issue is that Ford lacks a disciplined product development and lifecycle planning process, and it always has.

The automaker called the secret offices its ""skunk works,"" in reference to a legendary Lockheed engineering center where a group worked on advanced aircraft, but that skunk works worked on far-out ideas — think the once super-secret but now iconic U-2 spy plane — not next year’s models.

Ford’s issue is the here and now, not a lack of blue-sky thinking.

The company almost routinely develops outstanding vehicles, then allows them to age into irrelevance while competitors improve and replace their competitors regularly. The Taurus, Escape and Ranger all led their segments for years, before declining due to management inaction.

F-series pickups are the only products where Ford management holds replacements to a strict schedule and insists on clear leadership on measurable criteria. The result: 48 years of truck sales leadership.

We can all hope that team dispatched to the Long Beach, California, offices where Ford developed the new EVs did that, but it won’t matter unless Ford's leaders change their approach to creating vehicles and keeping them competitive.

Otherwise, it’s only a matter of time before Ford is looking for another magic bullet, instead of rolling out a steady flow of first-class vehicles.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/12/PDTF/86117011007-new-ford-world-headquarters-01-a.JPG?crop=1023,577,x0,y52&width=1023&height=577&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-27 08:57:38.227668

This year, the organization gave Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress an “F,” scoring 12% on their metrics for transitioning away from climate-harming energy sources, coal and natural gas.

Mikaela Curry, East/South Beyond Coal campaign manager for the Sierra Club, said Duke supported the passage of legislation this session to roll back a climate law the utility originally supported. The new law eliminates the state’s 70% carbon-cutting goal by 2030 and allows the utility to charge ratepayers in advance for future energy plants.

“It’s been predicted that this cost families and businesses an extra $23 billion in the cost of burning gas at power plants through 2050,” Curry pointed out. “They lobbied in this legislation that really increased risks for families and ratepayers where North Carolina customers assume the risk of cost overruns.”

The study on costs from the legislation concluded the high price volatility of gas would lead to the $23 billion price tag. Duke Energy said the new law will give it more flexibility to meet growing demand. The Dirty Truth report found Duke Energy plans to build out nearly 8,800 megawatts of gas by 2035.

One source of growing electricity demand across the country is data centers. Curry noted the new climate law in North Carolina will allow Duke Energy to charge people for projects which might not be necessary.

“Customers are on the hook still to pay for those things, even if it turns out that all those data centers aren’t built or there’s other ways to manage the load,” Curry explained. “It makes sense for a utility that has shareholders, of course. They are guaranteed rate of return on profits. And so the more that they build, the more opportunity they have to secure profits.”

Curry stressed Duke Energy is focusing on fossil fuel technology, which will drive utility prices up.

The world has a problem. Energy demand continues to rise each year with a growing population — there were one billion humans on Earth in 1804, and over eight billion today — and the vast majority of energy used comes from burning fossil fuels including oil, coal and gas.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change considers that we can only burn at most between 20% and 30% of the remaining fossil fuel reserves to make sure we don’t hit the ‘catastrophic’ two degree upper limit — and the consensus seems to be that oil will run out by 2052 regardless, with gas following in 2060 and coal lasting perhaps until the end of the century.

Billions of dollars are now being poured into renewable infrastructure and technology — solar, wind, hydro, biomass and geothermal. There’s also significant capital investment into nuclear, though as this requires the use of uranium, it can only be classified as a low carbon energy source as uranium will also eventually run out.

Solar energy uses photovoltaic cells or solar thermal systems to convert sunlight into usable electricity, while wind energy relies on turbines. Hydropower generates electricity from flowing water, while geothermal energy uses heat from beneath the Earth's surface. Meanwhile, biomass produces energy from organic materials like plants and waste.

The sector is growing rapidly, particularly as costs fall and technology advances — while governments continue to use legislation to bring renewable targets forward and incentivise change. Perhaps cynically, some consider that governments are more interested in the enhanced energy security by diversifying energy sources, and reduced reliance on imported fuel.

Many analysts consider that the majority of the world’s energy supply will come from renewable resources by 2050 — and if nothing else, renewables are a major contributor to economic development, creating millions of jobs worldwide in manufacturing, installation and maintenance.

Of course, there are always going to be detractors. Critics point out that renewables are still less reliable than fossil fuels, and that current infrastructure is nowhere close to being able to replace non-renewable sources today. There are also concerns over the initial environmental costs of building and installing renewable infrastructure, which can create a carbon debt that takes years to pay back.

However, most believe this is the future, and as fossil fuels deplete, current choices may become future mandates — especially as more of the world demands first world living conditions and artificial intelligence energy demand surges.",https://a.c-dn.net/c/content/dam/publicsites/igcom/uk/images/news-article-image-folder/GT_wallstreet_18-04-24.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg,N,,2025-09-27 07:59:07.837079

(AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy"" and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/2news.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/f5/9f517c66-11ff-57cd-bb49-760130b676c7/68d7627625467.image.jpg?crop=1662%2C873%2C0%2C187&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-27 06:58:24.916896

Power predicted that nationwide EV sales will likely reach a record of more than 12% of car sales this month.
At Cadillac of Beverly Hills, electric vehicles make up about two-thirds of new vehicles sold, said product specialist Naeim Nastar.
“Don’t miss out — the $7,500 EV Tax Credit ends this month!” the ad said.
“ For some potential buyers, the end of the tax credit means they will stop shopping for EVs.","Shoppers are snapping up electric vehicles as time is running out on a big tax break for going green.

At the Orange County Auto Show, Corinne Lawson and her husband took a test drive in a glimmering white Mustang Mach-E, an all-electric vehicle made by Ford.

Lawson is looking to buy her fourth Mustang and — for the first time — is leaning toward a battery-powered one. The smaller motor makes it a more comfortable car for her family.

“It has a backseat for the grandkids,” Lawson said, who lives in Tustin and is retired. “That might be enough to tempt me.”

Interest in electric vehicles was high at the auto show, which opened Thursday and goes through Sunday. Potential EV owners lined up to get rides in the latest models. They have only days left to take advantage of a tax credit that would save them $7,500 on a new EV and $4,000 on a used one.

The federal tax credit is set to expire Tuesday, in accordance with a new policy from the Trump administration. As the clock ticks, consumers and auto dealers have seen a jump in sales of new and used EVs.

“We’re seeing a big spike in EV sales,” said John Sackrison, executive director of the Orange County Automobile Dealers Assn. “There’s a window of time that’s running out, and we know it’s going to become more challenging for consumers to make the leap over to electric.”

In May, before Trump moved to eliminate the tax credit, around 21% of new vehicles sold in Orange County were all-electric, Sackrison said. That number jumped to 25% in June after Trump targeted the credit, and again to 32% in July.

National sales of new EVs jumped 19% in July from last year, Cox Automotive said. J.D. Power predicted that nationwide EV sales will likely reach a record of more than 12% of car sales this month.

The rush to buy EVs also comes as Trump levies volatile tariffs on key trading partners, making cars and car parts from overseas more expensive.

At Cadillac of Beverly Hills, electric vehicles make up about two-thirds of new vehicles sold, said product specialist Naeim Nastar. The dealership has seen a “significant increase” in electric vehicle sales over the past couple of months, he said.

“We’re still selling gas cars, but most people who come in now are here to take advantage of the tax credit for electric,” Nastar said.

On Instagram on Thursday, the Ocean Cadillac dealership in Miami posted an ad promoting several of its electric models.

“Don’t miss out — the $7,500 EV Tax Credit ends this month!” the ad said. “This weekend is your chance to save big.”

At the auto show, Cadillac offered test rides in its electric Lyriq SUV and displayed several electric models on the floor, including the Optiq and Escalade. Show attendees slowly walked through the maze of vehicles, examining features like charging ports and trunk space.

Murrieta resident R.J., who declined to share her full name for privacy reasons, carried a black Cadillac T-shirt she received as a gift after her test ride. She’s considering buying a Lyriq, she said, but is also interested in electric models from BMW and Kia.

“I was hoping to get that $7,500 credit,” R.J. said at the auto show, “but I won’t have time to make my decision before it goes away.”

Analysts warned that there will likely be a hangover after the buying spree.

“The effect on sales will shift from positive to negative,” Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D.Power, said in a report this week. “A very significant decline in EV sales is expected for October, reflecting both the effect of the federal EV tax credit expiring and the start of payback from all the EV purchases that were accelerated into the summer. “

For some potential buyers, the end of the tax credit means they will stop shopping for EVs.

Stacey and Jim Palma were getting ready to purchase their first EV earlier this year when they found out the credit had an expiration date. The Long Beach retirees said they were now interested in a more affordable hybrid vehicle.

“We’re backing out a little because the rebates are going away,” Jim said. “Our incomes are limited, and the incentive is not going to be there anymore.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3626d0a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3528+0+476/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fff%2Fa8%2F9721f7984e43a56ed62759e73407%2F1523819-fi-oc-auto-show-ev-demand-gxc-0285.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 06:58:02.246704

In advance of a possible shutdown in the fall of 2023, some state governors, including Katie Hobbs of Arizona and Utah’s Spencer Cox, announced they would use state funds to keep national parks open.
According to the CPANP, keeping national parks open during a government shutdown, particularly in the current context, could lead to worse outcomes than in the past.
National parks are already under pressure to remain open amid severe workforce reductions, due to a swathe of budget cuts implemented by the Trump Administration in the spring.
“If national parks are to be open to visitors when National Park employees are furloughed, these nascent issues from the summer season are sure to erupt,” the CPANP letter states.","If Congress doesn’t agree on a short-term spending bill to maintain funding for the federal government by September 30, a shutdown may be on the horizon. And if the U.S. government indeed shuts down, many former national park employees think national parks should, too.

Dozens of former national park superintendents and the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks (CPANP) urged Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in an open letter to “protect our parks and public lands by closing them if a government shutdown occurs.”

“As former superintendents of national parks across the country, we write to you with an urgent appeal to protect our parks and public lands by closing them if a government shutdown occurs,” the group wrote in the September 25 letter. “Past shutdowns in which gates remained open with limited staff have hurt our parks: iconic symbols cut down and vandalized, trash piled up, habitats destroyed, and visitor safety jeopardized. If you don’t act now, history is not just doomed to repeat itself, the damage could in fact be much worse.”

Congress determines the National Park Service (NPS) annual budget because the bureau is housed within the Department of the Interior. When Congress fails to pass a budget, shutdowns may occur. During federal closures, government programs and sites considered non-essential to national security or safety—such as those run by the NPS—are at risk of losing both funding and employees.

The federal government has experienced at least 14 shutdowns since 1980, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit think tank. But the government has only shut down twice in the 21st century. The first occurred in 2013, when over 400 national park locations closed. The most recent shutdown, which took place in December 2018, is also the longest in U.S. history, lasting for over 34 days.

In the past, these shutdowns “have hurt our parks,” wrote CPANP in the latter. The advocacy group comprises 4,600 current, former, and retired NPS employees and volunteers.

During the 2018 shutdown, some 80 percent of Park Service employees were furloughed; however, many of the country’s most iconic parks remained open, managed by a bare-bones crew. At the time, Outside reported that there was no one to collect park fees, guide tourists, plow the roads, or clean overflowing pit toilets. Trash was being cleared only by a few volunteer groups in a handful of popular sites.

In advance of a possible shutdown in the fall of 2023, some state governors, including Katie Hobbs of Arizona and Utah’s Spencer Cox, announced they would use state funds to keep national parks open. The 2023 shutdown was averted, however, and it remains unclear whether similar state-led initiatives will keep parks funded and open in a possible 2025 shutdown.

According to the CPANP, keeping national parks open during a government shutdown, particularly in the current context, could lead to worse outcomes than in the past. National parks are already under pressure to remain open amid severe workforce reductions, due to a swathe of budget cuts implemented by the Trump Administration in the spring.

“Sure, we can keep everything open,” an anonymous NPS ranger told Outside in April after a round of cuts earlier this year. “But who wants to recreate in a park with broken down facilities and no maintenance and no search and rescue?”

The CPANP says any attempt to keep parks running during the shutdown would be courting disaster.

“If national parks are to be open to visitors when National Park employees are furloughed, these nascent issues from the summer season are sure to erupt,” the CPANP letter states. “Leaving parks even partially open to the public during a shutdown with minimal—or no—park staffing is reckless and puts both visitors and park resources at risk.”",https://www.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1089483216.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 07:59:30.461420

Transcript

Jim Puplava:

Last week on the program we did a big picture. We called it Economic War in the New World Order. We're moving to a multipolar world from a unipolar world. We're used to seeing the U.S. dominate geopolitically and economically. And now it looks like it's going to be more of a multipolar world. And the worst case would be a bipolar world, much like the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. But in this case, it would be the U.S. and China. What we're seeing is the economic and geopolitical orders are readjusting.

And I'm going to talk about a book we mentioned on the show last week. It's called Breakneck. It's by Dan Wang. And just to give you a background: first of all, he grew up in China. He was born there, and his parents migrated to Canada after Tiananmen Square. So he spent part of his youth in Canada before migrating to the United States. Today he's a prominent writer. He's a researcher specializing in China, technology, and engineering. He's formerly a technology analyst with Gavekal Dragonomics and a fellow at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center. He's now a research fellow at Stanford’s Hoover History Lab. And his new book is called Breakneck: China's Quest to Engineer the Future.

Some of the key themes—before we get into some of the details of the chapters—are the engineering state versus the lawyerly society. Basically, if you take a look at the Politburo, whether you're talking about the president of China, who's a chemical engineer, or the others, they're all engineers. You contrast that to the U.S., where the political figures are all lawyers. And what he talks about is that in China, if they want to do something—they're going to build a bridge, they're going to build a dam, a factory, a high-speed rail line—they think about it and just do it. They're not going to get caught up in zoning, environmental regulations, or impact studies that take five years before you can do anything.

And you know, we talked about this on the show, and it really struck me: Dan talks about the latest nuclear reactor that we built in the U.S. It took 17 years and $30 billion. He said for that same amount of money, China could build 11 nuclear power plants—and do it in five years. This is one of the problems where China basically focuses on process and getting things done, while we focus on environmental regulations. He contrasts this engineering-driven approach to governance and development with the U.S.’s lawyer-centric litigious environment.

The theme examines how each system influences capability, decision-making, and the speed of implementation. The best example is the one I just mentioned: it took us 17 years to build one nuclear power plant, while they could build 11 in five years. It's basically engineers versus lawyers. Because the first three chapters of the book talk about the contrast between a society run by engineers—which, by the way, used to be the U.S., if you go back to the early 20th century and especially after World War II. That began to change in the ’70s. Meanwhile, China developed a long-term plan.

We’ll get into long-term strategy in the next book review, but you contrast what China does—from high-speed rail to new cities—with America’s system of obstructing progress through legal and bureaucratic processes. That’s why it takes forever, whether you're going to start a new mine, build a factory, or even a housing development. For example, Chris, in my own case, when we designed a custom home that we wanted to build, it took me over a year just to get the permits. Another example: look at Los Angeles. Many affluent communities were destroyed by fires, but rebuilding is still caught up in red tape.

Another point I think is key here, especially when you look at why China has become the world’s largest manufacturer—and rapidly a high-tech society—is their dominance in drones, robotics, and manufacturing capacity. In fact, about 50% of EV sales globally are from China. He talks about this concept of “process knowledge,” something we lost when we outsourced manufacturing to China, Mexico, and elsewhere. A significant portion of the book details this. He contends that China's industrial might isn't simply the result of imitation, but of a deep accumulation of practical know-how. He highlights how they can take something, reinvent it, and make it more efficient. That’s something we've lost by outsourcing.

Cris Sheridan:

Yeah. And Key Point News came out today with Alibaba releasing a new model that rivals the U.S. big tech firms—the leading state-of-the-art models out there. And one of the things they’re doing is they’re often releasing these open-source, for free. That erodes the U.S. moat and creates a very competitive environment. Like you’re saying, they take the technology, re-engineer it, make it more efficient, and release it at a much cheaper price—or even for free, in the case of these AI models. That’s a good example of how this is playing out.

Jim Puplava:

And it's something that China has done repeatedly. They've been accused of dumping products. This happened with rare earth minerals in 2010, when China embargoed exports to Japan. Japan then started buying rare earths from the U.S. What did China do? They dumped rare earth metals on the market and drove that U.S. company out of business.

So another way to compete economically against U.S. high-tech companies is something like AI. We’re all talking about ChatGPT, Perplexity—all these AI programs that are basically free. Well eventually these companies are going to want to monetize them. Like some advanced AI models that require a subscription service. But China is releasing similar models for free, depriving U.S. companies of the revenue they would otherwise capture. In a way, China is dumping its AI knowledge into the marketplace for free to compete against Silicon Valley.

Cris Sheridan:

And they’re also doing what we’re doing here in the U.S.—building out massive data centers as part of securing that AI advantage. As we know, superintelligence—the ability for AI models to get more and more capable—requires massive amounts of processing power. That’s why we’re seeing huge buildouts here in the U.S., and China’s doing the same thing.

Jim Puplava:

In fact, there was a story in the Wall Street Journal this week that big tech companies from Meta and Microsoft to Amazon are going to be building AI and cloud centers in the Gulf States, because there isn’t enough energy capacity in the U.S. grid to handle the number of AI centers that are needed to make AI practical. They’re going overseas because our infrastructure here is too old.

Cris, let’s get into the first chapters. As I mentioned, the first three chapters—there are seven total—really emphasize the engineering state versus the lawyer state. He talks about massive Chinese infrastructure projects, built with speed, compared to U.S. projects that are delayed or blocked by legal barriers. China’s centralized governance allows coordinated, long-term planning, unlike America’s fragmented policies.

One problem is that in China, a dictatorship comes up with an idea and implements it. In the U.S., you have a political and lawyerly society, and elected officials who can’t think beyond the next election cycle. Everything here tends to be short-term.

In Chapter 2, he talks about the success and scale of these Chinese “mega-projects,” and there’s a YouTube video that showcases them. Compared to that, U.S. infrastructure looks ancient. President Trump once talked about trillions of dollars set aside to build U.S. factories and projects, but Chris, none of that works if it takes five years to get through zoning and environmental studies before you ever build. Like I say, right now, big tech companies are going overseas because our electrical grid simply isn’t modern or strong enough to handle this wave of AI data centers.

Cris Sheridan:

And we should also point out that China now leads in electricity production. They have a large and growing nuclear fleet and coal plants. They’re using every possible resource to achieve their goals of cheap and abundant energy for their economy. We should be doing the same, but we’re hamstrung by policymakers and red tape. That’s really the central point of Dan Wang’s book.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, one of the things he emphasizes is process knowledge. It’s not just enough to engineer and design something. As Henry Ford demonstrated, with manufacturing you learn from hands-on experience. That knowledge accumulates and makes future production faster and more efficient.

Wang argues that the U.S. has lost this base knowledge by offshoring manufacturing, while China has meticulously built it up. That’s why China is becoming the leader in industries like EVs, green energy (solar panels and windmills), and robotics.

A good example was just this week, when the U.S. banned China from accessing Nvidia’s high-end chips. Instead of giving in, China boycotted lower-tier Nvidia chips and quickly developed an advanced chip of their own—with faster performance at a lower price. That’s process knowledge in action.

Cris Sheridan:

So he’s framing China as an engineering state—capable of rapid, large-scale projects—while the U.S. is a “lawyerly society,” excelling at legal processes but often obstructing progress. Of course, there are pros and cons on both sides. The founders of the U.S. set up checks and balances for good reasons, but as Wang points out, the complexity of this new landscape plays heavily into the multipolar view of power.

Jim Puplava:

We’re basically moving from a unipolar world to a multipolar world. The U.S. just doesn’t have the dominance it once did. Think back to the ’80s, when Reagan’s military buildup helped us win the Cold War. At one point, we had over 600 Navy ships. What shook China was what they witnessed in the Gulf War. They thought the U.S. might stumble like Vietnam, but instead, with our technology, we won in 42 days.

That changed China’s military trajectory. Their philosophy became: whatever the U.S. fears, focus on that. So, they’ve built over 50,000 sea mines in the South China Sea. They developed carrier-killer missiles traveling at twice the speed of sound. They built the world’s largest submarine fleet, mainly diesel-powered, for regional purposes. But now, just this week, they launched sea trials for their first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier with a magnetic catapult—and more are coming. They’re moving from a regional to a global military power.

On a more positive note, towards the end of the book, Wang says both societies can offer something to the world: China with its engineering capabilities, and the U.S. with its commitment to human rights. Ideally, China could become less restrictive, while the U.S. could shed some regulatory burdens.

Cris Sheridan:

That’s similar to what we’ve talked about before. China isn’t just copying anymore. They lead in EVs, robotics, and even in quantum communications. They’re producing patents and breakthroughs beyond the U.S. Maybe it’s time the U.S. starts learning from them and improving their methods for our own needs.

Jim Puplava:

That connects with another book I’m reading right now: First Among Equals: U.S. Foreign Policy in a Multipolar World. And there’s also Graham Allison’s Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides’s Trap? He argues that unless China moderates its ambition—or unless Washington agrees to share primacy in the Pacific—some conflict (a trade war, cyberattack, or accident at sea) could ignite a much larger war.

But I want to stay positive on this. I think we’re starting to wake up. Pharmaceutical companies are bringing factories back. COVID showed us the downside of overreliance, with half our drugs made in Asia. Ford, Apple, others are also returning production to the U.S. But again, it takes years just to get through permits and impact studies. Five years before pouring a foundation. We need to streamline the process—it doesn’t have to be five; maybe one or two years would be a big improvement.

Cris Sheridan:

So, here in the U.S. we suffer from too much red tape—we’re under-building in housing, development, and infrastructure. Meanwhile, China is guilty of overbuilding—decades of rapid building have created their own problems.

Jim Puplava:

Exactly. They overbuild and overproduce. That’s why exports are so critical for them—they don’t have enough internal consumption to absorb all the products.

Dan Wang emphasizes that the U.S. needs to get back to being a builder nation. Build infrastructure, build factories, restore process knowledge. He recommends watching the video China’s Insane Megaprojects That Make U.S. Infrastructure Look Ancient. It’s astounding what they’ve accomplished.

We’ll continue this theme with our next book review: The Long Game: China’s Grand Strategy to Displace the American Order by Rush Doshi.

Cris Sheridan:

So with that said, again, we were reviewing Breakneck: China’s Quest to Engineer the Future by Dan Wang. It was released August 26, 2025. It’s one of our must-read books this year.

Later, Max Jancich and Ashton Harper talk to Andrew King, the director of RecycleForce, an Indy-based non-profit which focuses on e-waste recycling.

And now for your environmental reports:

As the saga of climate reporting (and misreporting) continues, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine just released a study confirming, beyond scientific dispute, that human-created greenhouse gases poses current and future harm to our health and welfare. The National Academics undertook this report in response to the Environmental Protection Agency proposal to overturn the endangerment finding. These rules regulate climate pollution, including from coal and gas-fired power plants, cars and trucks, and methane from the oil and gas industry. Despite federal reports minimizing the negative effects of climate change, this research demonstrates that the opposite is the case. Major fossil fuel producers, also known as “carbon majors,” have been linked to the growing frequency and intensity of heatwaves in the past years, confirming their role in the progression of climate change.

Feeling concerned about the changes being made to pollution regulation? The EPA is currently taking feedback on www.regulations.gov regarding the Reconsideration of 2009 Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Standards.

Scientists may have the knowledge, but they don’t always have the effective communication skills to drive an impact. Researchers at the University of Notre Dame reveal that while the conservation field has grown to include more diverse voices, disconnects and even overlaps in communication are undermining biodiversity protection efforts.

The solution isn’t getting everyone to agree; in fact, the Notre Dame team developed five practical principles for more productive disagreement. This guidance includes engaging with plural perspectives and recognizing unequal power relationships. The key insight is that conservation conversations work best when they happen in specific places where people share a stake in the outcome, and when power imbalances are directly addressed.

This matters because conservation is fundamentally about people and their choices, not just science. The research shows that addressing these communication gaps and power disparities—especially between the Global North and South—is essential for lasting environmental protection. The principles offer a roadmap for more effective dialogue in an increasingly polarized world, with implications that extend well beyond environmental issues.

The sandhill crane, a wading bird under protected status in Indiana, is treasured for its tall, elegant profile, red-orange cap, and memorable bugle call. Once extirpated from (no longer found in) Ohio, things are looking up for this impressive bird. The Ohio DNR has recorded their reappearance over the past three decades, including a 4% increase in the observed sandhill crane population in 2025 alone. These birds are often found migrating through northern Indiana up to the tens of thousands and can be spotted at Jasper-Pulaski Fish & Wildlife Area and southwest of Bloomington at Goose Pond Fish & Wildlife Area.

New Map Shows $29 Billion in Climate and Environment Grants Canceled or Frozen by Trump.

Regarded as the culmination of decades of organizing for environmental justice, the Biden Administration’s sweeping community grant programs were quickly terminated by President Trump.

Human-Caused Warming Tripled the Death Toll of European Heat Waves This Summer, New Report Shows.

Public health researchers struggle to track the accelerating pace of global warming impact.

There have been few hurricanes this year due to factors like persistent wind shear, widespread sinking air in the atmosphere, and a larger-scale pattern of dry, stable air over the Atlantic. While sea surface temperatures remain warm enough, these conditions have thwarted the development and organization of tropical systems. However, with a upcoming cycle expected to shift and bring lower-pressure air back to the Atlantic, increased hurricane activity is forecast for late in the season.

International efforts to reach an agreement on reducing plastic pollution are disappointing. But we don’t need to wait for a treaty to make changes in our own lives.

Progress towards a legally binding global treaty on plastics pollution stalled and went into reverse this past week. The United Nations Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, ran overtime. It’s likely to conclude without an agreement.

This is an incredibly disappointing result. Members of the Scientists’ Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty, were hoping for action to genuinely curb plastic pollution. Their priorities included considering the whole life cycle rather than just disposal, setting targets to reduce plastic production, and regulating the use of harmful additives to reduce risks to human health.

Unfortunately, vested interests hijacked the negotiations. Countries with major petrochemical producers resisted caps on virgin plastic production. We’ve seen this before. Legitimate scientific concerns about harm have been downplayed by powerful interests time and time again — with tobacco, PFAS, asbestos, and climate change.

When it comes to plastics — especially the micro- and nanoplastics now invading our bodies — awareness and early action could make all the difference. But we can still take action into our own hands as consumers, to minimise exposure and reduce waste. It we act together, we can also send a powerful message to the plastics manufacturing industry.

Health insurance plans through Kentucky’s marketplace, kynect, are used largely by small business owners, older Americans ineligible for Medicare and rural residents.

“I believe health care is a basic human right, and we should expand access, not make it more difficult to afford.

The credits allowed federal funds to subsidize health insurance markets for people who make more than Medicaid recipients but lack a work-sponsored health benefit. Health insurance plans through Kentucky’s marketplace, kynect, are used largely by small business owners, older Americans ineligible for Medicare and rural residents.

A letter signed by Gov. Andy Beshear and seventeen other governors earlier this month urges Congress to take action and extend the credits.

“If they expire, premiums will rise by thousands of dollars for many families, millions will lose coverage, and people will be forced to make impossible choices between paying for healthcare, rent, or groceries,” the letter states.

Without the subsidies, the program’s premiums are expected to “increase dramatically in January,” according to a Sept. 26 news release from Beshear’s office.

Originally introduced by the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, the subsidies grew during Covid-19 under former President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. Many of those more recent enhanced expansion plans had their premium plans reduced to $0.

“Rising costs for everyday needs are hurting Kentuckians, and I am committed to raising my voice and taking action to help,” Beshear said in a statement. “I believe health care is a basic human right, and we should expand access, not make it more difficult to afford.

“Between the ‘big, ugly bill’ taking aim at our health care system and the threat of these credits expiring, quality health care is going to be out of reach for most families – and that’s just wrong. ”

Predictions show President Donald Trump’s cuts to Medicaid under the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act could take health care away from more than 200,000 Kentuckians.

Dustin Pugel at the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy cautioned that if Congress doesn’t extend the premiums, health insurance rates could go up due to an imbalance between who is paying for care and who is receiving care.

“When the folks who are using less care but still paying in premiums leave, that raises rates for everybody else, because insurance companies have to compensate for that,” Pugel said. “And so it creates a spiral that, you know, we wouldn’t see this year, but we may see in future years.”

Costs have already been rising for hospital stays and doctor’s visits, according to a Peterson-KFF report. It also noted general inflationary pressures, labor costs and specialty prescriptions as factors in the increased rates.

Advocates like Priscilla Easterling, outreach director at Kentucky Voices for Health, think state lawmakers could take on investments to kynect next session if Congress doesn’t extend the subsidies. But ultimately, she hopes for broader access across the nation.

“We’re urging Congress to take action, ideally making those improvements permanent so individuals and families can count on stable, affordable coverage long-term,” Easterling said.",https://www.kentucky.com/public/latest-news/sp93mc/picture312041215/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/GettyImages-2197708857.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 06:58:10.285352

Wind energy projects help offset energy costs.
U.S. wind turbines are also reducing air pollution by over 100 million tons annually, the American Clean Power Association reported.","A post on r/conspiracy questioning whether wind energy is ""really green"" sparked spirited discussion. Commenters challenged the post after it claimed turbine blades cannot be recycled and are piling up in landfills, fueling misconceptions that more affordable energy sources like wind are more harmful than helpful.

In practice, wind energy is one of the most effective solutions available for cutting polluting gases. Turbines generate far more energy over their lifetimes than is used to manufacture them.

According to a 2013 study in the journal Energy Policy, the energy return on investment of wind ranges from 18 to 20. This means it delivers many times more energy than what goes into building and operating it.

While estimates vary, most studies find that wind projects make up for the pollution produced during its construction in just a few months.

For instance, one study published in Renewable Energy found that the average energy payback for turbines is seven months. Another study that the New Scientist shared provided estimates between seven and nine months.

That's a small trade-off, considering wind turbines have a typical lifespan of 20 to 25 years, according to Yale Climate Connections.

While the Reddit poster claimed that thousands of wind turbine blades end up in Wyoming landfills each year, others pointed out that the problem is mostly tied to turbines built decades ago.

""The ones that are being recycled or buried right now are from 25 years ago, when there was no thought in recycling wind turbines. Modern-day blades are made to recycle,"" one user explained.

An article in the MIT Climate Portal highlighted that some turbine parts can be recycled. These include wiring, electrical components, and steel towers. However, recycling turbine blades is still considered a challenge because they're made from composite materials like fiberglass.

Researchers are looking into making blades using easily recyclable plastics, the MIT article explained. Companies like Veolia and GE are collaborating to develop recycling technologies that can shred fiberglass blades and transform them into cement.

As reported by the Union of Concerned Scientists, businesses are also stepping up and turning turbine blades into textiles and railroad pellets. Consumers and communities benefit directly from this transition. Wind energy projects help offset energy costs.

U.S. wind turbines are also reducing air pollution by over 100 million tons annually, the American Clean Power Association reported. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, this reduction in air pollutants can minimize health effects like asthma and bronchitis.

Though posted three years ago, the conversation reflects misconceptions that still circulate today.

One Redditor noted: ""Not as clean as solar but much cleaner than oil.""

Another user summed up: ""This is a bad take if I am being honest. Wind energy is a good thing, for most.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2di2CE2ro5u5hwxOjPaEgg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTI7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/05dad4889eac7be49b287d24e3a84b7c,N,,2025-09-27 06:58:27.569611

The Michigan Department of Transportation expects next spring to issue another round of requests for proposals to add more DC fast chargers in hopes of encouraging EV adoption. Limited access to charging stations, particularly fast chargers that can add 100 miles of range on some EVs in as little as 10 minutes, is one of the biggest causes of hesitancy and range anxiety for consumers in assessing whether to get an EV.

The U.S. Department of Transportation last week approved the state's revised plan under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, paving the way for the release of $52 million remaining from $110 million originally allocated for the program before President Donald Trump's administration froze the funding in February.

""We're still very much moving ahead with the NEVI program, and never stopped,"" said Steve Minton, who is managing the project for MDOT. ""And we're excited to be able to utilize the remaining funding, and work with the industry to get as many chargers out as we can with the funding that we have left, and do it in a strategic way that will benefit the state of Michigan's citizens.""

The federal funding pause was for the $5 billion Biden-era NEVI initiative included in the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Republican and Democratic lawmakers both criticized the program after it produced a few completed, functional charging stations within its first three years — becoming a poster child for government inefficiency.

But after a signal that a court could rule against the administration's funding pause, the Federal Highway Administration last month issued revised rules that seek to provide more flexibility to states and reduce red tape. States had to supply their updated agreements within 30 days.

""While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress' will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said when the new rules were announced.

Michigan's updated fiscal 2026 plan has about 70 fewer chargers than before the revisions, Minton said. In particular, the plan focuses on how the state will use the remaining funds, the kind of community engagement it has done to develop and receive feedback on the plan, and cybersecurity strategies to protect the network.

Much of the information in MDOT's revised plan is from its previous update. The department kept the plans for future use of the funds general, including applications for major routes, community charging, destination charging and future consideration, Minton said.

""There wasn't time,"" he said, ""to really get down to a specific level of detail with how we're going to use every last dollar.""

That, however, will be part of the next step. NEVI first requires the buildout of ""alternate fuel corridors"" along which to place the chargers off highways at locations like gas stations, convenience stores and supermarkets. In Michigan , those corridors include Interstates 75, 96 and 69, U.S. 127 and other major roadways.

The Biden-era rules required that chargers be installed within 50 miles of each other, but the Trump revision allows states to set that distance to whatever they believe is reasonable. MDOT chose 60 miles, though in the Upper Peninsula, the distance is as much as about 80 miles after the department didn't receive a proposal to shrink that spread. MDOT was planning to submit a letter this week to the FHWA certifying that buildout.

""We've got 83 stations,"" Minton said, ""along these AFCs that we feel achieves that buildout status.""

Michigan is expected to achieve buildout in the next few years. Trump's funding pause didn't stop reimbursement for already-approved NEVI charger locations in Michigan, though just two sites — in Lansing and Walker outside of Grand Rapids — have been completed so far. They include a total of 10 charging ports. Another four sites are under construction, and Minton said he expects 10 could be completed by the end of the year.

With the fuel corridor charger buildout certified, Michigan would be free to use the charger funds for discretionary projects. That may include more chargers along those corridors, but also could include chargers in local communities, along other major highways like U.S. 23 in northeast Michigan, in population centers like Metro Detroit, Grand Rapids and Lansing and tourism destinations, and for heavy trucking.

MDOT will work on prioritizing those objectives in the coming months in consultation with other relevant agencies and external partners. Minton said he expected that by March or April, the state will issue its next request for proposals for that funding, which will be the largest money pot compared to previous NEVI RFPs.A Michigan State University study that concluded Michigan needs more than 66,600 chargers — estimated to cost $998 million — to support 25% EV market penetration will help inform the plans.

""We had plenty to do with round one and round two, with having 83 sites that we weren't ready to even start the next round,"" Minton said. ""The time it took for them to figure out if they were going to move ahead with NEVI or what they were going to do, it allowed us to continue on. And then when they did finally release the guidance update in August, it was actually really good timing for us.""

MDOT gave companies awarded funds in 2023 under NEVI three years to get the chargers up and running. Those awarded in 2024 have two years. The state, however, is still bringing some of those companies under contract with the proper documents, insurance and proof of bonding to be a state and federal contractor.

""That's been a learning curve for the industry,"" Minton said.

Additionally, electrical components for transformers and switch gears needed to support the buildout of fast chargers can have long lead times. MDOT must obligate its NEVI funds prior to the end of the 2026 fiscal year, but there isn't a federal deadline by when the funds must be used. In addition to the years to design and build out these sites, companies are reimbursed by up to 80% over five years, during which time they commit to operate and maintain the chargers.

Given the pulled and then reinstated funding for NEVI, Minton said there's motivation to secure contracts for the funding, though stopping it likely would require an act by Congress: ""I'm not seeing a lot of risk if we take a little time to do some planning. We don't want to just jump into another solicitation. And we've been engaged with our Federal Highway office division, and they're on board with our approach to how we're going to move ahead. We're not going to drag our feet with it.""

Mehrnaz Ghamami, an associate professor at MSU's College of Engineering who co-authored the EV charger report, said roadways for intercity travel should be the priority to reduce range anxiety, given that cold weather can reduce battery capacity by 30%.

""Without fueling stations,"" she said, ""a lot of those trips won't be EVs.""

Michigan so far has done a good job of filling those gaps, she said, though some remain, especially in the Upper Peninsula. Some areas don't even have gas stations or other locations to install chargers.

With residents in urban areas more likely to adopt EVs, ensuring access to charging stations for those in multi-family housing units would help increase EV use in Michigan, Ghamami added. Support for medium-duty and heavy-duty transportation is also an important next space to address.

The new federal guidance removed an order for states to ensure ""the deployment, installation, operation, and use of EV charging infrastructure achieves equitable and fair distribution of benefits and services."" It also eliminated a requirement for states to explain how their NEVI implementation would encourage participation from small businesses, including minority-owned and women-owned small businesses. The new requirements also minimized state obligations to consider ""electric grid integration and renewable energy.""

The revised rules, however, don't prevent states from taking those matters into account, and the research for Michigan's original proposal will continue to inform its plans and priorities as it moves ahead.

""We may not just come out and say it directly,"" Minton said about ensuring charging in disadvantaged communities, ""but we'll still be looking at that very much.""

Detroit-based Red-E is a supplier of EV chargers and their software. It’s supplying dozens of NEVI locations in Michigan and more nationally. CEO Abass El-Hage illustrated the difference the funding makes: A regularly used charger in a place like Los Angeles might be able to make up the investment in three to five years without incentives. But in more remote areas, a charger might only see two vehicles per day. The payback could be 10 to 15 years.

“The incentives come in to bridge that gap,” El-Hage said, making the deployment of chargers in rural places possible where it otherwise wouldn’t make financial sense to do so.

One of the biggest concerns in the program's deployment had been the cost for infrastructure to support fast chargers in remote areas — which small utility companies in northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula were estimating could be millions of dollars in some cases. With the 50-mile requirement gone, that alleviates the risks of Michigan losing out on funding, though it doesn't address the challenge of making EV charging available in those areas as NEVI was intended to support.

Companies like Toronto-based eCamion Inc.'s Jule are helping address those obstacles. The EV charging system supplier includes massive lithium ion battery storage with its system. Doing so helps particularly rural areas avoid costs of upward half-a-million dollars for utility infrastructure upgrades to support direct-from-grid charging, said Joseph Povolo, Jule’s sales and marketing coordinator.

Instead, the system allows the battery storage to charge during off-peak hours at night when electricity use is “next to nothing,” Povolo said. Energy from the battery then charges EVs that visit the ports, typically during the day. The system also lessens the burden on rural electrical grids by charging during off-peak times to lessen the need to increase the electricity generation needed during peak times, such as the afternoon.

“We take whatever spare capacity on the nearest transformer,” Povolo said. “Usually, we don’t need more than 50 kilowatts of spare capacity. If that’s what you have, that’s more than enough.”

The U.S.-built batteries also act as a backup power source in the event of a power outage. Jule has more than 100 ports across roughly 40 locations. There is a pipeline of 60 planned NEVI sites nationally, including at least two in the Upper Peninsula in Quinnesec and Iron Mountain. Another 150 to 200 sites in Canada are expected to come online in the next two to three years.

Povolo declined to provide exact pricing for the system, but it’s at least a quarter of a million dollars for the system alone. Red-E’s system, including installation, is around that.

""That is one option in more rural areas that we support,"" Minton said. ""I imagine we'll have more of that as we move ahead.""

Local Impact in Topeka

The City of Topeka received $500,000 in Community-Wide Grant funds. These dollars will be used to complete eight Phase I and three Phase II environmental site assessments, maintain an inventory of brownfield properties, and support reuse planning. Priority sites include:

The 36-acre former White Lakes Mall

Two former schools

Mayor Mike Padilla emphasized the city’s collaborative approach: “It is great to be able to work with different organizations to reinvest in Topeka to create clean new areas for growth.”

Statewide Revitalization Efforts

KDHE received $2 million in Community-Wide Assessment funds. These will support 116 Phase I and Phase II site assessments statewide, preparation of at least three cleanup plans, and annual community meetings to provide progress updates.

Priority focus areas include:

Oak Grove neighborhood, Kansas City (Land Bank properties)

Eureka: former racetrack, nursing home, Masonic Lodge, and expansion sites near the fire department

El Dorado: the Grizzly Development

“These Community-Wide Grant funds from EPA put Kansas communities in the position to leverage additional funds that will aid in redevelopment, revitalization, and cleanup plans across the state,” said KDHE Secretary Janet Stanek.

Broader Context

The EPA Brownfields Program has provided more than $2 billion in funding nationwide since 1995, supporting cleanup or assessment of more than 35,000 sites and leveraging over $35 billion in redevelopment investment. In Kansas, these grants have supported renewal of industrial, retail, and institutional sites, bringing them back into productive community use.

By targeting properties such as malls, schools, and land bank parcels, the Topeka and KDHE grants align with a broader trend of linking brownfield redevelopment to housing, infrastructure, and resilience planning across the Midwest.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250926-092716-f43-Kansas%20City%20downtown%20skyline.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 07:59:47.915136

Pairing a rooftop solar system with an energy-efficient heat pump can further reduce your energy costs.

What's happening?

According to a study published in Nature Energy, Stanford researchers found that around 60% of U.S. households could reduce electricity costs by roughly 15% by investing in a solar and storage home system.

A residential solar setup would also help families ride out power outages — which are becoming more frequent due to an aging grid and extreme weather events — safely and comfortably, per a summary by Stanford University.

However, the team noted that households with higher energy burdens that experience more blackouts than normal and would consequently see the greatest benefits from a home solar system have the least access to energy upgrades.

""The solar-battery benefits often fail to align with the areas that need them most, like in certain high-outage-risk states where only one-fourth of households can get affordable backup power from solar-battery systems,"" Arun Majumdar, Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability dean and co-author of the study, said in the report.

The authors explained that the inequitable distribution of solar energy in many areas is partially due to policymakers' ""knowledge gap"" regarding how to increase adoption of rooftop solar and battery packs in high-risk locations.

Luckily, free tools provided by EnergySage make it easy for homeowners to access affordable solar panels, as they can compare quotes from qualified installers in their area.

Why are inadequate policies regarding electric bills concerning?

Electricity costs are climbing in many states due to infrastructure challenges and more extreme weather triggering blackouts. As a result, more people are considering investing in home solar and battery storage to save on bills and reduce the strain on the climate and grid.

Since many utilities offer solar buyback plans that credit homeowners for the excess energy they generate, it makes it even easier to save on energy costs.

However, utilities in some states, such as California, have switched to net billing tariffs rather than net metering policies, as it better incentivizes battery storage while addressing the financial burden on non-solar customers.

In states such as Iowa and Idaho, which still use net metering, and in disadvantaged communities, investing in a home battery system may not be feasible or offer the same benefits.

The study's authors suggested that policymakers look into ""incentive programs, rate approvals, and industry regulations"" that could promote a more equitable energy landscape while increasing grid resilience.

""Economic incentives, financing mechanisms, and community-based deployment programs that target areas with high financial and reliability needs but low economic viability of solar-battery systems could help families that need such systems the most,"" Tao Sun, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford and the study's lead author, said.

What can be done to reduce energy bills?

As the study explained, since solar panels generate free electricity and battery systems store that energy for later use at night or during high-cost peak hours, a home system can significantly reduce energy costs.

With EnergySage, homeowners can take advantage of up to $10,000 in savings on solar purchases and installations, making it a great service for all your solar needs.

And with its free mapping tool, you can see the average cost of a solar system and available tax incentives and rebates on a state-by-state basis, ensuring you benefit from all the savings you're eligible for while getting the best price on home solar.

Pairing a rooftop solar system with an energy-efficient heat pump can further reduce your energy costs. Thanks to EnergySage's free heat pump quote comparison tool, you can find an installer and the right heat pump for your budget, along with an affordable home solar setup, all in one place.

Nevada, New Mexico and Arizona face the greatest health risks from extreme heat—the deadliest weather-related hazard in the U.S.","A new state ranking published by the Commonwealth Fund compares all 50 states and Washington, D.C. on their climate risks.

The scorecard, which the organization said is the first of its kind, evaluated states on eight indicators. They include flood risk, healthcare facilities, energy efficiency policies and the health impacts of emissions from electricity generation and the healthcare sector overall. The report was written by researchers at Northeastern University and Yale University.

“The health care sector is dedicated to promoting patient health but also contributes significantly to climate change and environmental harm,” the report said. “Because of this interconnectedness, it is incumbent upon the sector to embrace sustainability measures and climate action in order to uphold its commitment to ‘do no harm.’”

Vermont, New York, Washington, New Jersey and Maine ranked safest overall, thanks to their strong energy efficiency and clean energy policies. They are also less vulnerable to environmental hazards and have lower healthcare sector emissions.

West Virginia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Florida and Mississippi ranked lowest. These states face more frequent and intense hazards and don’t have supportive energy and environmental policies, per the report.

“As a physician, I have seen firsthand how closely the environment and health are linked,” Joseph R. Betancourt, M.D., Commonwealth Fund president, said in a press release. “People are better off when they can breathe clean air and when the hospitals they depend on are prepared for extreme weather. I hope this scorecard inspires states to learn from one another’s efforts to reduce pollution, prepare for environmental risks, and better protect people’s health.”

Some states face greater natural risks than others. Nevada, New Mexico and Arizona face the greatest health risks from extreme heat—the deadliest weather-related hazard in the U.S.

Both Arizona and California have the poorest air quality, driven by ground-level ozone, wildfire smoke and dust. The states with the cleanest air were Alaska and Hawaii.

The report also ranked flood risk to hospitals. Florida has the highest share of hospital beds in high-hazard flood zones, at nearly 15%. Louisiana and Mississippi also face severe flood risks.

Healthcare accounts for 8.5% of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. West Virginia, Wyoming and North Dakota were among the states with the highest per capita, healthcare-related emissions, reflecting heavy reliance on fossil fuels.

Mississippi, South Carolina and Alabama have the highest emissions related to healthcare worker commutes, linked to limited public transit options and longer travel distances for staff. These emissions, the report noted, significantly contribute to the sector’s carbon footprint.

The report highlighted opportunities for policies at the federal, state and health system levels. The authors recommended that policymakers strengthen clean energy and energy efficiency policies. They urged them to support healthcare facilities in assessing climate risks and preparing for extreme weather. They also recommended requiring standardized reporting of healthcare sector emissions to guide improvements and helping healthcare organizations invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, clean power and low-emission transport options for patients and staff.

“Extreme weather is no longer a distant threat—it's happening more often and disrupting care across the nation,” said Matthew Eckelman, Ph.D., Northeastern University associate professor and associate chair for research of civil and environmental engineering. “No state is spared, and every community is vulnerable. But action matters. Our scorecard shows that states with strong clean energy and resilience policies are doing a better job protecting health and health care infrastructure, while other states leave patients exposed during potential crises.”",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/GettyImages-2077603530.jpg?VersionId=z.X_Sq0002eRzmae21OsS.Xx69iwVNVu,N,,2025-09-27 14:01:53.149715

What we did not anticipate was the rapid-fire retreat from this space that we're now seeing from some automakers. It's enough for EV aficionados to ask: Was any of it ever real? Does America still have a shot at an electric future, or are we as a country in our ""back to gas"" era?

That's what my co-host Tim Levin and I are diving into on this week's Plugged-In Podcast. In just the past couple of weeks, we've heard of EV cancellations, slowdowns and delays from Porsche, Nissan, Volkswagen and Acura, just off the top of my head. More moves are coming, I'm sure.

But here's how to think about this current moment.

As we'll dive into on the show, a lot of this also has to do with the added complication of tariffs. When automakers are facing billions in added costs every quarter, unprofitable EVs that aren't selling at rates they were projected to are first to go. And then there's what I believe to be the real issue: the loss of any real fuel-economy regulations or penalties here in America.

With no ""carrot"" to entice customers to go electric and no ""stick"" to punish them if they don't, it's back to business as usual—which is objectively bad news for America's climate, clean air, technological competition with China, and even what I'd say is customer choice. A lot of folks were choosing these cars. What options will they have a few years from now?

BMW, for one, is responding by saying ""all of them"": the next X5 will come with gas, diesel, plug-in hybrid, electric and hydrogen powertrains. Talk about playing the spread.

But Tim and I also believe that when you look at worldwide trends around electrification, autonomy and the rise of electric mobility, this field can't be stopped. Not forever. And we have reasons to be optimistic, which we'll dig into today.

That's contingent on automakers getting new technologies right, of course. Also on today's episode: we dig into Volvo's recent technology woes, and what it's doing to fix its next-generation cars.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/P3MMQA/s1/nko-pzxshok.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 05:57:58.035281

Sales volume is expected to rise 6% from last year but decline 14.9% from the previous month due to three fewer selling days.

""The new-vehicle sales pace has been surprisingly strong this summer and through the third quarter as uncertainty around tariff policy has decreased,"" said Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist at Cox Automotive. ""Continued low inflation and unemployment rates, coupled with a strong stock market, have kept consumers in a buying mood. A key contributor to sales in recent months has been an increase in EV sales, as buyers rush to market before the $7,500 tax credits expire at the end of September.""

Q3 EV Sales Poised to Set Record

With a surge of EV buyers in market before the end of government-supported tax incentives, Cox Automotive is forecasting a record 410,000 EVs will be sold in Q3, a significant increase (21.4%) year over year and a jump of more than 30% compared to Q2.

The share of EV sales in the third quarter will likely be close to 10% of total sales, a record. The previous EV sales peak in the U.S. was Q4 2024, when 365,824 EVs were sold, accounting for 8.7% of total new-vehicle sales.

""The federal tax credit was a key catalyst for EV adoption, and its expiration marks a pivotal moment,"" said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of Industry Insights at Cox Automotive. ""This shift will test whether the electric vehicle market is mature enough to thrive on its own fundamentals or still needs support to expand further.""

Cox Automotive expects EV sales to slow notably in Q4, but long-term sales growth will continue.

Q3 and Year-to-Date Forecast

Cox Automotive is forecasting Q3 2025 new-vehicle sales to climb year over year by 6.2%, although they are projected to finish lower compared to Q2 by 1.6%. The year-over-year volume gains in the market are expected to be driven almost entirely by the four biggest automakers: General Motors, Toyota Motor Corporation, Ford Motor Company and Hyundai Motor Company. Cox Automotive forecasts the ""Big Four"" in Q3 to post combined sales gains of 11.2% year over year. The rest of the industry is expected to be higher by 0.1%.

Year to date, the story remains the same, with the Big Four forecasted to gain 9.1 % while the other automakers decline by 2%.",https://www.autobodynews.com/images/June_2024/EV_sales_full.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 05:58:07.226376

Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.
More buyouts worry opponents Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.
Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock’s ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete’s suggestion that it’ll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn’t been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie’s concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power’s parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”

On the White River, advocates are concerned about what those toxins are doing to the people who live and recreate near the body of water.

""It’s where we all live, it’s where we all work, it’s where we all play. We want to see that space safe and healthy to enjoy,"" Executive Director of Friends of the White River Eddie Gill IV said.

His organization wants to educate the public about coal ash contamination.

“Whenever we have unnatural chemicals that are leaching into our groundwater supply and ultimately into our river, that’s a negative thing we don’t want to see,"" Gill said.

Groundwater monitoring results of the Harding Street Station's Ash Pond System found levels of arsenic, lithium and molybdenum above groundwater protection standards.

Exposure to those toxins can cause a range of health issues, including cancer.

But a consultant for AES claims their evaluation found no adverse impacts on the community or environment.

“For a very long time, the White River has had this stigma that it’s a toxic wasteland and that it’s dirty. We shouldn’t recreate in it, we shouldn’t get in it,"" Gill said.

Gill hosts several water and land cleanups throughout the year, including one this week, in partnership with Eli Lily.

Advanced nuclear technologies had long been confined to research labs, but between 2015 and 2022 the number of commercial nuclear ventures tripled.
Out of that grew the nation’s first nuclear engineering degree program and one of the earliest university-based nuclear reactors.","Nuclear energy is in the midst of its largest expansion in three decades, with 70 reactors under construction in 15 countries as of this summer. Interest in the carbon-free power source has grown in recent years as nations work to expand dependable, domestic energy supplies to support rising electricity demand.

In the U.S., bipartisan federal support that ramped up in the Biden administration has continued under President Trump, with a pilot program to fast-track testing advanced reactor designs and executive orders that aim to quadruple nuclear energy capacity to 400 gigawatts by 2050. Utilities are finding ways to extend the lives of operating plants beyond their initial charters. And the private sector is investing in startups that are developing small modular reactors and making big discoveries for future fusion technology.

Appetites for nuclear energy have ebbed and flowed since even before the technology first connected to the grid in the 1960s. The University of Michigan has been at the forefront all along, from establishing the first university-based initiative dedicated to the peaceful uses of nuclear technology to the technological, educational, and diplomatic leadership its faculty and alumni provide today in labs, classrooms and communities around the world.

Todd Allen is the Glenn F. and Gladys H. Knoll Department Chair of Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences—the nation’s No. 1-ranked department of its kind. In this Q&A, he discusses the past and future of nuclear energy and how U-M is working to facilitate safe deployment.

Michigan Engineering: What brought about the resurgence of interest in nuclear energy?

Allen: Several factors led to the surge we’re seeing today, which is truly unprecedented. The first is the climate. Nuclear energy has always been free of carbon emissions and so as countries and companies have sought to rein in emissions, nuclear has become increasingly attractive. Other major factors are the need for energy security coupled with the rising demand for electricity. In the US, this is driven in part by electric vehicles and data centers for AI.

We’ve also seen exciting technological advancements in areas like small modular reactors, microreactors and other advanced reactor designs that can offer safe, cheaper, and more flexible options than traditional plants, and that has led to more private sector interest. As just one example, in early 2025, Amazon led a $500 million funding round for X Energy, a small modular reactor company. Nuclear Energy Institute President and CEO Maria Korsnick gave an expansive overview of the nuclear industry’s growth in May at the Nuclear Energy Policy Forum.

How has fusion progress—such as the first fusion ignition in a 2022 experiment led by alum Annie Kritcher—contributed to renewed nuclear interest?

Allen: The physics breakthroughs that got us a step closer to fusion energy are certainly contributing now, but the resurgence of interest in traditional nuclear fission energy was already well underway. Advanced nuclear technologies had long been confined to research labs, but between 2015 and 2022 the number of commercial nuclear ventures tripled.

There’s a lot of excitement about fusion’s potential to provide abundant clean energy and we’ve seen significant investment in fusion startups. Our alumni are playing lead roles in that space and we’re very proud of them. I think it’s important to manage expectations about the timeline for deployment. And in the meantime, we’re going to see a lot of advancement and deployment in fission technology.

Tell us more about nuclear fission advancements and what’s happening at the University of Michigan.

Allen: I mentioned smaller nuclear reactors. Microreactors are the size of a shipping container and would use around 1,000 times less land than a traditional large reactor. They’d be simpler to maintain and operate and could serve as energy sources in remote areas or for specific loads such as dedicated power for a military base. Larger advanced reactors that might support a data center are also smaller than traditional reactors. We have researchers working on various aspects of these advanced technologies and their components. We’re also developing hand-held radiation detectors to streamline plant maintenance and ensure nuclear materials stay secure. We’re working to identify the best materials for fusion reactors, and much more.

It’s important to recognize that technology is just one of the pieces needed to accelerate nuclear deployment. Community support is another critical factor, and historically that’s been challenging to maintain. At U-M we’re working closely with communities to understand their needs.

I think one of the most important things we’re doing here is helping to develop the nuclear workforce of the future. We do that in our own labs, classrooms and communities and also by leading efforts to convene educators from around the country and the world. Next week on campus we’re hosting the first ever symposium of the Nuclear Energy Agency’s Global Forum on Nuclear Education, Science, Technology, and Policy. It brings together academic, industry, and policy leaders from around the world to shape strategies for educating the next generation of nuclear experts.

Building the workforce to quadruple nuclear energy by 2050 is a tall order. How else is U-M contributing?

Allen: It’s certainly ambitious. The executive orders that set this goal include a mandate to create tens of thousands of jobs in that timeframe. I wrote about some of this in the memo Building the Nuclear Workforce: Unleashing American Nuclear Home and Abroad for Third Way. The nation’s engineering schools have their work cut out for them.

At U-M, we recently launched a minor in nuclear engineering and radiological sciences so more engineering students can be exposed to the field and its opportunities. We run a host of outreach programs for students in high school and even younger. And those in our programs, we prepare for the nuclear industry of the future, which is very different from what it was in the past.

If you go back to the first generation of commercial nuclear technology, we had large, custom-built electricity generation stations. But today new companies are working to build reactors of lots of different sizes and for different purposes. The first ones were just for electricity, but that’s changing. Dow Chemical, for example, wants them just for the heat they produce. There are so many different deployment scenarios possible and with that there are a lot more and varied opportunities for jobs. You can go work for a startup company. You can be involved in business development or putting out a new product. You can work for the regulator.

At U-M, we’re uniquely suited to prepare students for this wide range of options as well as the extended range of knowledge the field now requires. That’s because of the breadth of expertise on our campus. We’re working with our Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering on opportunities in nuclear for maritime shipping. There are opportunities in advanced manufacturing. Those are just a couple examples.

The good news is young people are getting the message. Undergraduate enrollment this fall in nuclear engineering is up 25% from where it was five years ago. I think the zero-carbon nature of the technology attracts a lot of students.

We’ve talked about the future of nuclear energy, but can you touch on U-M’s role in its past?

Allen: Certainly—the University of Michigan was really one of the founders of the field. Way back in 1948, just a few years after World War II, U-M established the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project to advance peaceful uses of nuclear technology. Out of that grew the nation’s first nuclear engineering degree program and one of the earliest university-based nuclear reactors. Our professors have gone on to win Nobel Prizes. Our alumni have served in leadership roles in government and industry.

From the earliest days, the University of Michigan has treated nuclear energy as a topic that requires discussion across our campus and beyond, and that continues today.",https://news.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2022-michigan-memorial-phoenix-project.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 04:57:44.404010

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.","HOLLY RIDGE, La. — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers — a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible. For instance, it’s unclear exactly how much the social media giant will pay toward the cost — more than $3 billion — for new electrical infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing to create a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags other states in efforts to insulate regular power consumers from costs tied to data centers.

There is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals, said Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for environmental advocacy group Earthjustice.

“You can’t follow the facts; you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” she said.

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option and if the project will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to lost revenue totaling “tens of millions of dollars or more each year.”

Meta has agreed to pay for about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of its contract or not renew it, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish, and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic is frustrating residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington said.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,” the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

In recent years, the signs of climate change have become impossible to ignore. From record breaking heatwaves sweeping across Europe to devastating floods in Asia and prolonged droughts in Africa, the Earth is sending clear warnings. At the center of the crisis is one undeniable fact: our reliance on fossil fuels is heating up the planet. The question now is not if we must act, but how.

The Promise of Renewables: One of the most promising answers lies in renewable energy. Unlike coal, oil, and gas, renewable sources such as solar, wind, hydropower, and biomass offer clean, sustainable alternatives. They don’t just promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; they also carry the potential to transform economies, create jobs, and secure a healthier future.

Solar and Wind Power: Take solar energy, for instance. Once dismissed as too costly, solar panels are now becoming a common sight on rooftops and fields. The cost of photovoltaic technology has plummeted in the past decade, making solar one of the most affordable sources of power worldwide. In sun-rich regions, entire communities are powering homes, schools, and businesses with

nothing more than rays of light. Wind power, too, is making waves literally. From the expansive plains of Texas to offshore farms in the North Sea, giant turbines are harnessing gusts of wind to feed national grids. These projects don’t just deliver clean electricity; they also generate thousands of jobs in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance.

Hydropower and Biomass: Hydropower remains a cornerstone of renewable energy, particularly in countries blessed with powerful rivers. While large dams often spark environmental debates, small-scale hydropower systems are gaining popularity as sustainable solutions for rural areas. Biomass energy, meanwhile, is quietly revolutionizing waste management, turning agricultural residues and organic waste into usable fuel.

Policy and Community Action: Governments and businesses are central to this transformation. Across the world, policy incentives from tax breaks to renewable energy targets are encouraging innovation and investment. In some African and Asian countries, community led mini-grids are bringing affordable electricity to villages for the very first time, replacing smoky kerosene lamps with clean, reliable light.

Challenges Ahead: Yet, challenges persist. High upfront costs, inconsistent government policies, and inadequate infrastructure continue to hinder progress, particularly in developing nations. There are also concerns about balancing renewable expansion with environmental protection, such as land use for solar farms or the impact of dams on ecosystems.

A Future Powered by Clean Energy: Despite these obstacles, the momentum is clear: the renewable revolution is no longer a distant dream, but a present reality. Global investments in renewables have outpaced fossil fuels for several years, and more nations are pledging to achieve net-zero emissions within the coming decades. The benefits extend beyond tackling climate change. A shift to renewables strengthens energy security by reducing dependence on imported fuels. It improves air quality, lowering the burden of respiratory diseases caused by pollution. Most importantly, it offers hope to younger generations that the world can still chart a sustainable course. As the world grapples with the urgent need for climate action, renewable energy stands out as both a practical and powerful solution. By embracing the sun, the wind, water, and even waste, humanity has the tools to rewrite its energy story. The challenge now is to accelerate the pace, overcome the barriers, and ensure that clean energy is not a privilege for a few, but a right for all. Because when it comes to climate change, the cost of inaction will always be far greater than the price of change.",https://cdn.thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/06014238/Adebayo-Adeleye.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 08:57:48.009116

PJM member states’ longstanding dispute with the grid operator reemerged this week as 11 of their governors met in Philadelphia.

There’s nothing like a shared frustration to bring people together. For a group of Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states, that’s rising power prices on the grid operated by PJM Interconnection. Both Republican and Democratic governors are calling out PJM’s management and demanding change — a repeat of a cycle that’s been going on for years and has no easy solution.

The U.S. is home to seven regional transmission organizations and independent system operators that are each responsible for managing power transmission and operating energy markets among utilities in their area. PJM is the largest, serving more than 65 million customers across D.C., Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and 10 other states. And for years, leaders in those states have said it’s not doing a great job.

The crux of the issue is rising electricity prices. This summer, PJM announced a new record in its annual capacity auction, which it uses to secure power resources for the grid. Prices hit $16.1 billion, up from $2.2 billion in 2023, Canary Media’s Jeff St. John reported in July.

There are a few reasons for the spike in costs. For one, PJM expects that it will need a ton more power-generation capacity in the coming years as data centers come online — though experts dispute just how big the AI energy-demand bubble will actually be. PJM does have a massive backlog of clean-power and battery projects looking to connect to the grid and meet that demand. But the operator hasn’t undertaken reforms that critics say could speed interconnections, and is instead campaigning to keep expensive, dirty fossil-fuel power plants online.

PJM member states’ longstanding dispute with the grid operator reemerged this week as 11 of their governors met in Philadelphia. There, Pennsylvania’s Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro and Virginia’s Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin both said they would leave PJM if states don’t get a bigger role in the grid operator’s governance.

“This is a crisis of not having enough power, and it is a crisis in confidence,” Youngkin said. ​“It’s this crisis that demands real reform, real reform immediately — and at the top of the list is that states must have a real say.”

PJM President and CEO Manu Asthana acknowledged that his organization needs to take cost-cutting steps like improving its load forecasting and interconnection processes, but he also put the onus on states to better their own infrastructure siting and permitting rules.

Washington Analysis researcher Rob Rains is doubtful that states will follow through and depart PJM. He said doing so could actually cost customers more in the short term, as the states may have to negotiate their own power procurement at rates even higher than what PJM has secured. Rains predicts that instead of cutting ties with the grid operator, governors will pull other levers to pressure PJM to establish stronger power-market safeguards to keep prices low. Meanwhile, analysts at ClearView Energy Partners suggest states should keep up their push to get more electricity generation developed as soon as possible.

Trump stands alone at the U.N. climate summit

The U.S. set itself apart from the rest of the world at the United Nations’ climate summit this week, and not in a good way. On Wednesday, around 120 countries announced new emissions-reduction plans and climate commitments. That included China, the world’s top carbon polluter, which declared it would aim to cut emissions at least 7% from its peak by 2035. New pledges also came from other major emitters, including the European Union, and from countries with smaller populations and lower gross domestic product.

But the U.S. wasn’t among them. Instead, in a speech on Tuesday, President Donald Trump railed against all things green, clean, and climate-friendly. Climate change is ​“the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,” Trump said — a scientifically unsound statement, to say the least.

The summit came just days after U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said the Paris climate agreement is at risk of ​“collapsing” and that countries needed to ramp up their emissions goals to get things back on track.

Utilities are failing on climate, Sierra Club says

For the past four years, the Sierra Club has annually graded the U.S.’s biggest utilities on their clean-energy progress. The marks haven’t been stellar, but utilities were at least taking steps in the right direction. That is, until this year, when the Sierra Club granted utilities a collective ​“F,” Canary Media’s Jeff St. John reports.

The ​“Dirty Truth” report examined 75 of the nation’s biggest utilities to see whether they intend to close their coal plants by 2030, whether they plan to build new gas plants, and how much clean energy they expect to build by 2035. In a spot of good news, 65% of utilities have increased their clean-energy deployment plans since 2021. But they’ve slid backward on fossil fuels, increasing their intended gas-plant additions and walking back plans to shut down coal plants.

TOP NEWS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE

STATE NEWS

U.S. CLIMATE ALLIANCE TACKLES CLIMATE POLLUTION AND BOOSTS THE ECONOMY: The U.S. Climate Alliance, a coalition of 24 governors supporting climate action, released new data this week showing that collectively, their states have reduced greenhouse gas emissions 24% below 2005 levels while increasing their GDP by 34%. The alliance is also reducing emissions faster than the rest of the U.S. through actions like employing clean energy workers, lowering air pollutants, and planning for disasters.

ALLIANCE TAKE: U.S. Climate Alliance Executive Director Casey Katims said, “While the federal government moves to stop measuring pollution, deny science, and obstruct climate action, the Alliance and its members are relentlessly pressing forward. These new pollution reduction figures show that when we come together, set big goals, and take bold action, we build healthier communities and a stronger economy.”

CAMPAIGN FOR GEORGIA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION HEATS UP: Climate and environment organizers gathered in Atlanta at the “Watts at Stake” event to strategize and mobilize voters ahead of November’s election for two seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, responsible for regulating utilities. Groups like Georgia Conservation Voters, one of the organizers of the summit, said they are holding both virtual and in-person town halls to educate voters. With energy costs rising across Georgia and around the country, and the Trump administration doing everything it can to ban and undercut clean energy, it’s critical that the PSC has commissioners who will protect Georgians and put their interests above polluters.

STATES TAKE ACTION TO ACCELERATE CLEAN ENERGY BEFORE FEDERAL TAX CREDITS EXPIRE: Governors around the country including Gavin Newsom of California, Kathy Hochul of New York, Jared Polis of Colorado, and Katie Hobbs of Arizona have recently issued orders to focus resources and expedite clean energy projects to take advantage of federal tax credits enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act before they expire, after being slashed by President Trump’s “Big Ugly Bill.” Regulators and utilities in additional states have taken similar actions, such as in Maine, Minnesota, and Oregon. These efforts to increase clean energy development will help meet rising energy demand and save customers money.

REPUBLICANS PUSH COUNTRY CLOSER TO SHUTDOWN: As the government funding deadline looms, Trump and Republicans in Congress have refused to negotiate on a budget bill and continue to threaten a government shutdown. LCV joined environmental groups including Climate Action Campaign, Climate Power, Earthjustice Action, Evergreen Action, Friends of the Earth Action, NRDC Action Fund, and Sierra Club to urge Republicans to take action and pass a bipartisan funding bill that will lower costs and protect our environment.

OUR TAKE: LCV and environmental groups said, “President Trump and Congressional Republicans have spent this year raising costs for working families, from energy to groceries to health care, while rolling back programs that help families deal with those costs. Now, Donald Trump and Russell Vought clearly want to shut down the government and continue illegally gutting essential services that make people’s lives more affordable. Given the fact that the administration and Republicans in Congress are already ignoring the funding levels set by law that protect clean air and water, and a healthy climate, it is plainly false to call the GOP’s continuing resolution ‘clean.’ Without real commitments, a deal isn’t worth the paper it’s written on.

“Republicans who voted to raise energy and health costs in the Republican Rate Hike have a choice to make: they can start to side with their constituents desperate for relief and come to the negotiating table to pass full-year bipartisan funding bills that help lower costs and protect our environment, as the Senate has shown is clearly possible, or they can continue to cower to Trump and shut down the government.”

TRUMP DOJ SUES SIX STATES TO OBTAIN SENSITIVE DATA FROM VOTER ROLLS: The Department of Justice has filed lawsuits demanding that California, New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and New Hampshire share unredacted voter rolls, which include sensitive data like drivers license numbers and the last four digits of Social Security numbers. It is highly unusual to release voter rolls without redacting this information. Last week, similar lawsuits were filed in Maine and Oregon as well.

CVPA TAKE: Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania Executive Director Molly Parzen said, “This lawsuit from the Trump Administration is just the latest blatant attempt to intimidate voters and undermine our elections. The voter rolls requested contain sensitive, personal information for Pennsylvania voters, and handing that information over to the Trump Administration does nothing to make our elections more safe or secure.

“The Trump Administration has repeatedly tried to sow doubt and create fear around our elections. This lawsuit takes their political game a step further – breaching the trust of all Pennsylvanians and putting our privacy at risk.

“The first step in protecting our environment is protecting our democracy and ensuring all Pennsylvanians can participate in free, fair, and secure elections. Lawsuits like this undermine our core systems of democracy and represent a blatant abuse of power for political gain.

“We look forward to supporting Pennsylvania leaders as they fight this overreach and work to protect our rights and freedoms.”

Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.
More buyouts worry opponents Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.
Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy"" and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”

Enerdrape is looking to expand its reach into things like installing panels in underground tunnels for large-scale energy generation.","A Swiss startup will soon be bringing its innovative geothermal panel technology to the United States for the first time.

According to Think Geoenergy, Enerdrape will be installing the panels in downtown Chicago's Millennium Parking Garages, which contain over 9,000 parking spaces. The panels harness the Earth's natural geothermal energy and use it to heat and cool buildings.

Geothermal energy generally involves drilling holes deep into the Earth's crust, pumping water into the holes, and allowing the Earth's natural heat to boil the water. That water is pumped up to the surface where the steam spins a turbine and generates energy. The water is then pumped back below the surface to start the process again.

It's a clean form of energy that doesn't create the same planet-overheating pollution as oil, gas, and coal. Besides being clean, geothermal energy is renewable, and it can significantly lower energy bills.

Enerdrape's geothermal panels work a little differently from the average geothermal energy project: there's no drilling involved.

It's a closed-loop system where piping within the panels contains heat transfer fluid that the Earth's warmer underground temperature heats up. That absorbed heat is then transferred to a heat pump that's used to heat or cool a building. It's then sent back to the panels to get heated again.

Geothermal panels like the ones that will be installed in Chicago are already being used in parking garages in France and Switzerland. According to Enerdrape, the company has installed 864 panels so far. They produce 275 megawatt hours of electricity a year and prevent 46 tons of carbon pollution from entering our atmosphere every year.

Besides Chicago, the company is also looking into projects in New York. They mainly involve hotels, housing complexes, and residences.

""At this stage, everything is preliminary, but the situation is promising,"" said Enerdrape co-founder and CTO Alessandro Rotta.

Enerdrape is looking to expand its reach into things like installing panels in underground tunnels for large-scale energy generation. The panels could also be used to power electric charging stations.

Claim: At the UN, President Donald Trump declared that renewable energy sources such as wind and solar “don’t work,” are “too expensive,” and represent a “joke.” He argued that clean energy harms the economy, drives higher energy costs, and cannot sustain infrastructure.

The Fact: Independent analysis contradicts Trump’s claims. In 2024, 80% of global electricity generation growth came from renewables and nuclear, with renewables cheaper than fossil fuels. Solar and wind surpassed coal in the US, providing 16% of power and driving millions of jobs.

President Donald Trump used his September 23 speech at the United Nations General Assembly to launch a sweeping attack on renewable energy, dismissing solar and wind as ineffective, expensive, and incapable of powering modern economies. His remarks directly challenged the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change and came at a time when clean energy is rapidly transforming both the global energy mix and the US job market.

Trump claimed that renewable technologies “don’t work” and are “a joke,” warning they drive up consumer costs and undermine economic stability. He argued that fossil fuels remain the backbone of reliable power generation. But his assertions were quickly contradicted by independent data and fact-checks.

According to the International Energy Agency and ABC News, renewable and nuclear power supplied 40 percent of the world’s electricity in 2024, with renewables alone responsible for 80 percent of global generation growth. In the US, solar and wind now provide 16 percent of electricity, surpassing coal. Projections show renewable energy will meet 95 percent of global demand growth through 2027, highlighting its growing dominance in power markets. Cost competitiveness has also flipped against Trump’s claims. The International Renewable Energy Agency reported last year that more than 90 percent of new renewable projects were cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives. Solar photovoltaic systems averaged 41 percent lower in cost than the cheapest fossil option, while onshore wind was 53 percent cheaper. These figures show that clean energy is not only viable but increasingly the more economical choice.

The workforce story is equally striking. Clean energy has become one of America’s fastest-growing employment sectors, with more than 3.5 million people employed—more than nursing, cashiering, food service, or elementary school teaching. Jobs range from wind turbine technicians to solar installers, both among the fastest-growing occupations nationwide. In 2024 alone, nearly 100,000 jobs were added in solar, wind, batteries, energy efficiency, and electric vehicles.

Still, growth is slowing. The US added 50,000 fewer clean energy jobs compared with 2023. Analysts point to economic headwinds and policy uncertainty. Critics argue that Trump’s administration has fuelled this uncertainty by cancelling projects, reducing tax credits, and imposing new regulatory hurdles. In the first half of 2025, E2 reported that businesses cancelled $22 billion worth of projects that would have created more than 16,500 jobs—many in Republican-leaning states.

Trump’s UN remarks underscore a widening gap between political rhetoric and energy realities. While he portrays renewables as costly and ineffective, evidence shows they are cheaper, cleaner, and central to future economic growth.","https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-38996,msid-124166483/124166483.jpg",N,,2025-09-27 12:02:50.774369

The department recently sent letters to local governments in at least six states — Alabama, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Mexico — informing them it was withdrawing money awarded under the $1.1 trillion infrastructure law former President Joe Biden signed in 2021.

The reversals are among the clearest signals yet of the drastic shift from the Biden administration’s emphasis on alternative transportation, such as transit and biking, to the Trump administration’s focus on preserving and expanding lanes for cars and trucks.

While the new grants Trump’s transportation department announced this year reflect that change, it’s practically unprecedented for an administration to claw back grants awarded by a predecessor without a compelling reason, such as potential environmental harms. However, the latest recalled projects didn’t have fully funded grant agreements in place, which would have made reversing them far trickier.

The transportation department’s press office didn’t respond to emails requesting comment.

Prioritizing Roads, Not Trails

Connecticut won a $5.7 million federal grant last summer to help design segments of a 44-mile recreational trail connecting several communities along the Naugatuck River.

Rick Dunne, executive director of the Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments, said the grant’s final details were being negotiated when the U.S. Department of Transportation sent a letter this month to inform local officials that the project wouldn’t move forward. The agency wants “multimodal grant programs” to focus on “projects that promote vehicular travel,” the letter explained.

“They’re defining quality of life for Americans as enhancing automobile operations,” Dunne said.

The same reason was given in a letter sent to Albuquerque, New Mexico, pulling $11.5 million in funding for a leg of a rail trail cutting through the city’s core. It was among the first active transportation projects awarded under the infrastructure law, with funding announced in 2022, but it was still going through the approval process.

“We are going to stand up for Albuquerque and prevent the Trump Administration from pulling money from a project the people of Albuquerque want,” Mayor Tim Keller said in a press release. “We will see you in court.”

Kevin Mills, vice president of policy for the Rails to Trails Conservancy, called the cuts “an affront to the priorities set by Congress and Americans’ demands for safer, more convenient walking and biking routes.”

DOT also withdrew a $20 million grant awarded in 2022 to transform three streetscapes in Boston. The reversal was based in part on the project’s electric vehicle charging stations, which the administration said contradicted its preference for promoting “traditional forms of energy and natural resources,” the Boston Globe reported.

No Project Too Small to Cut

Some of the withdrawn projects were relatively small in dollars and scope but still targeted for reversal due to the department’s changing priorities.

One applied to just a single block in San Diego County, California, where the community wanted to test whether it could improve safety without disrupting traffic flow. It sought to employ “creative roadway features” such as roundabouts in place of traffic signals, with plans to expand the approach to other intersections if the model proved successful, said Donna Durckel, spokesperson for the county’s Land Use and Environment Group.

But Trump’s transportation officials flagged it as “hostile to motor vehicles” in a letter sent Sept. 9 because the project included a so-called road diet that would have reduced the stretch from four lanes to two.

On the same day, McLean County in central Illinois got a similar letter recalling federal funding awarded last year to help design a final 9-mile segment of a bike and pedestrian trail along Route 66. County engineer Jerry Stokes said the project wouldn’t affect motor vehicle travel but would promote safety by getting bicyclists and pedestrians off the road.

Is it now ready to make a move? | CBC News,"Paula Duhatschek, CBC News",,,,,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-nuclear-power-conference-1.7643049,"Nuclear power already exists in New Brunswick and Ontario, with Ontario relying on nuclear for more than half of its electricity.
In 2008, it also set up a panel to explore the potential of nuclear power, but a decade and a half later, there are no nuclear reactors to be seen.
His company plans to build a nuclear power station in Northern Alberta, though with a more traditional CANDU-style reactor rather than with SMRs.
Public opinion and social acceptance could be a sticking point, considering concerns around the safe storing of nuclear waste and some high-profile problems with nuclear power plants in the past.
""We believe in the long-term … that nuclear power wins,"" said Wilkes.","While Alberta may be best known for its oil and gas industry, a conference in downtown Edmonton this week is hyping another form of energy: Nuclear.

""The potential is tremendous here,"" said May Wong, a senior vice-president with power generator Capital Power, which is exploring the possibility of building small modular reactors (SMRs) in Alberta.

""We have a moment in time where we can transform our industry and create a new industry.""

Smaller in scale and output than a traditional nuclear reactor, SMRs are built in a factory; in theory, they are cheaper, safer and quicker to construct, and can be used in less-populated regions.

Nuclear power already exists in New Brunswick and Ontario, with Ontario relying on nuclear for more than half of its electricity. The province also has plans to ramp up its nuclear capacity through the use of SMRs — an initiative that made Ottawa's recent list of fast-tracked ""nation-building projects.""

Now the buzz has made its way to Alberta; the province recently set up an expert panel to explore the possibility of building reactors, and Premier Danielle Smith, who has expressed reservations about renewables such as wind and solar, has said ""there's a lot to like about nuclear.""

Alberta has been here before. In 2008, it also set up a panel to explore the potential of nuclear power, but a decade and a half later, there are no nuclear reactors to be seen.

So what's changed this time around?

'Ideal' timing

The appeal of nuclear power is that it can provide a lot of reliable electricity on a long-term basis without much in the way of emissions, said Nathan Neudorf, Alberta's minister of affordability and utilities, in an interview on the sidelines of the SMR Forum in Edmonton.

Part of the appeal is that Alberta isn't going it alone, he said. Instead, the province would be jumping on a global bandwagon.

Countries around the world are scrambling to ramp up their nuclear capacity as a way of securing a stable, low-carbon source of electricity. And big-name tech companies, such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon, are signing large procurement contracts to secure a steady supply of nuclear power for their growing AI and cloud services.

""All of those things work together to create this timing … making it ideal,"" said Neudorf.

The renewed urgency around nuclear power is driven in part by expectations that demand for electricity will skyrocket globally in the decades ahead due to growing demand for everything from air conditioning to electric cars to AI data centres.

Alberta, in particular, is also contending with demand driven by a steep increase in population and the province's plan to become a hub for AI data centres.

Scott Henuset, the CEO of Energy Alberta, made a similar point. His company plans to build a nuclear power station in Northern Alberta, though with a more traditional CANDU-style reactor rather than with SMRs.

""We feel that it does have a place in all of Western Canada, securing the power [supply] and increasing grid stability,"" Henuset said in a Zoom interview this week.

But the economics of nuclear power in Alberta could pose a challenge; the upfront capital costs are high, which could make it a tougher sell in a province where natural gas is abundant and already provides the bulk of electricity.

The projected cost to develop four SMRs at Ontario's Darlington power plant is about $21 billion, while a large-scale nuclear facility in Georgia cost $35 billion US for two built-from-scratch reactors.

""Right now, natural gas use is obviously more cheap,"" said Dustin Wilkes, president and CEO of Calgary-based Nucleon, an SMR project developer. ""Short term, it's very difficult.""

Competition from natural gas

History has shown that to be the case.

In the early 2000s, Energy Alberta — then led by Scott Henuset's father, Wayne — was exploring the possibility of building reactors near Peace River. The company was later bought by Ontario-based Bruce Power, but when the price of natural gas plummeted a few years later, the project was scrapped, Henuset said.

While the price of natural gas remains low today, the global appetite for nuclear power has created a much different investment climate, Henuset said. Upfront costs may be high, he said, but the long-term payoff will be worthwhile given how long nuclear plants can run and how much demand for electricity is expected in the decades ahead.

""There is economic viability for nuclear power; we wouldn't be looking at it if it wasn't there,"" said Henuset.

When it comes to SMRs, in particular, Wong, with Capital Power, says the costs of the small, prefabricated reactors will likely go down significantly over time — a prediction echoed by industry observers and researchers.

Wilkes said that while nuclear power is new to Alberta, the province's advantage is its deregulated electricity system, which allows private operators to build and compete to sell power into the market.

Still, there are plenty of details that need to be ironed out before anyone starts splitting atoms.

Wong said while the appeal of nuclear is that a power plant can run for a long time — once built, the equipment is relatively easy to maintain or upgrade — it also means the costs of operating it and the necessary safety protocols must too be factored in over many decades.

And the nuclear waste produced by the power plants must be considered; there has been heated debate in Ontario when possible sites are chosen to store the material.

""Because it's very long duration, from a development perspective, as well as an [operational perspective], that uncertainty increases much more than traditional technology,"" said Wong.

Utilities Minister Neudorf said the province must first hear from Albertans whether they want nuclear power in the first place. An online survey seeking public input and information from industry and local governments is open until Oct. 25.

Public opinion and social acceptance could be a sticking point, considering concerns around the safe storing of nuclear waste and some high-profile problems with nuclear power plants in the past.

A 2009 report commissioned by the Alberta government made no recommendations about whether the province should proceed with developing a nuclear power plant industry, while detailing how every form of electricity production has its trade-offs, such as emissions, water use and overall expense.

At the COP28 UN climate conference in 2023, Canada and several other countries made a pledge to triple the amount of nuclear electricity around the globe by 2030.

As for Henuset and Wilkes, the two CEOs expect it will take somewhere around a decade for their respective projects to get up and running.

By that point, they say, the demand for electricity will be even greater — and the case for nuclear will be more compelling.

More buyouts worry opponents Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.
Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock’s ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete’s suggestion that it’ll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn’t been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie’s concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power’s parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”

First, we had a tremendous victory at the LA Convention Center last week on the most recent stop-and-start Convention Center expansion project that has been ongoing for the past decade. If you count all the other efforts over the years to modernize and expand the LA facility, it goes back even longer. But now, through hard work, perseverance and grit, we’ve finally done it. The powerful labor and business coalition we helped organize finally got this project over the finish line.

There’s no doubt LA has lost many conventions over the past decade to other large cities because our Center wasn’t large enough, had enough contiguous space, or modern enough to get the attention of the large conventions our downtown needs to help revitalize. The timing was never right, Council members always said. And now, because of our hard work and dedication, we got the job done. This is the power of coalition.

Kudos to our Political Director Antonio Sanchez and his team for their instrumental help in pushing this through. Who will benefit? First, our members. The project will result in dozens and dozens of job calls starting in the next few weeks. That will ramp up to several hundred jobs over the next few months. But the other huge beneficiaries of the project will be the residents and businesses in the LA region. We can expect more tourism, more events, better city services and more money flowing through our economy as a result of our city becoming a first-class convention destination, starting with the 2028 Olympics.

Make no mistake, it will be an aggressive timetable to get the ambitious job done in time for the Olympics. (See our story on page 1 for more of the details about the job.) But I am confident our skilled, trained and experienced members are up to the task.

I wanted to flag another good jobs victory for our members in the Antelope Valley. We, along with our brothers and sisters in the LA/OC Building Trades Council, recently signed a Community Workforce Agreement (CWA) in Palmdale, which will begin creating more good IBEW 11 jobs in the near future. We will be writing about it in the next edition of News@11.

Tradeswomen Conference

A delegation of 26 of our members has just returned from the 2025 Tradeswomen Build Nations Conference put on by the North American Building Trades Union. Thousands of tradeswomen from around the country gathered in Chicago for two days to network, share stories, learn new skills, discover resources and get support to thrive in their careers in the trades.

The conference featured government, industry, and labor leaders, apprenticeship and training coordinators, and tradeswomen from across the country who attended and facilitated workshops, panels, and plenary sessions. The goal was to uplift tradeswomen in unions, promote recruitment and retention, strengthen leadership skills and union identity, and foster mentoring and support networks.

Diana Limon, our Director of Recruitment and Support, and I were on two panels at the conference, reaching out to attendees to promote the IBEW as a good career choice for women.

In the near future, we will be creating an all-women VEEP class for our women veterans. Look for more information on that coming soon.

Prop 50 Must Pass

In our industry, politics matters. As many of you know, Texas has redistricted the state to add five more Republican elected officials in a scheme to rig the 2026 mid-term elections. In response, Gov. Newsom has called for a Special Election on Nov. 4 where voters will decide on a Constitutional amendment to temporarily redistrict California’s maps to add five Democrats.

This is a very important election for our members, and we are urging you to vote YES on Prop. 50. By voting YES, you will be protecting jobs and infrastructure projects that the current Administration in Washington, DC has delayed or canceled. You will be voting for fair representation for all working families. And you will be securing your future by advancing clean energy and grid modernization projects that create thousands of jobs for our members.

Chang is a commissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Steven Wellner and Kathleen Ratcliff serve as her advisors. The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not reflect the views of other FERC commissioners or any stance of the agency.

Generational change is occurring in the nation’s energy sector. While FERC is considering urgent short-term fixes, it also must evaluate longer-term solutions that shape the sector. One solution that meets this era of change is the integration of transmission planning and interconnection processes.

The current challenges facing the electric industry are multifaceted, with compounding effects. Rapid and accelerating load growth, backlogged interconnection queues, limited regional/interregional transmission buildout, ongoing supply chain issues and increasingly frequent extreme weather events are exacerbating reliability concerns and raising electricity bills for consumers.

States, utilities, grid operators, customers, and market participants grappling with these challenges are exploring short-term fixes, some of which call into question the open-access principles and market constructs this country has used to plan and build the grid’s infrastructure to date.

Open access and competitive wholesale electricity markets have been our bedrock principles because they have delivered real value to customers: They have kept energy costs affordable, met customers’ needs efficiently and ensured those who create the need for new infrastructure bear their fair share of the associated costs.

The question, then, is what reforms can meet our current demands while preserving the benefits of open access and competition? The answer is clear: Modernizing, harmonizing, and integrating our transmission planning and interconnection processes can meet those challenges.

Dramatic load growth is on the horizon

The biggest issue facing the industry is the expectation of rapid, dramatic load growth in the near term.

While previous circumstances that have driven load growth were largely distributed throughout the country, new load growth represented by data center additions is likely to be concentrated in certain geographic areas. This type of load growth could induce significant local system impacts, but the pace of growth, and where that growth will occur, are difficult to accurately project in system-wide plans.

Open access and wholesale electricity markets under FERC’s jurisdiction are under pressure as this rapid load growth compounds pre-existing stressors.

Keep up with the story. Subscribe to the Utility Dive free daily newsletter

Meeting the expected load growth will require the interconnection of a substantial amount of new generation alongside major transmission infrastructure buildout. FERC, states, and industry participants face foundational questions about how to meet this moment: How do system planners analyze new load additions, how do they prioritize project development and construction and how are costs allocated among parties that benefit from new generation and transmission?

These are hard questions playing out at the retail and wholesale level throughout the country.

The stakes are high because failure to responsibly, reliably, and cost-effectively meet new demand potentially impacts all customers. Retail customers could face higher prices, including from potential stranded investments; uncoordinated connection of new loads could exacerbate reliability risks; the grid’s inability to accommodate necessary data center growth could prevent us from realizing artificial intelligence’s potential benefits; or data centers could abandon grid interconnection and take needed generation off systems that rely on it.

Interconnection bottlenecks are hindering market response

Nearly 30 years ago, FERC issued Order No. 888, which established a building block of the modern electric grid: open, nondiscriminatory access to the transmission system. In Order No. 2003, the Commission extended that principle to the generator interconnection process. Open access has supported the expansion of wholesale market competition, increasingly through organized regional markets, on which a sizable majority of the American people rely to deliver reliable and affordable power.

At the core, well-functioning wholesale markets depend on the collective ability of investors to bring new, economic resources onto the system, both to replace retiring resources and to meet new demand. Interconnection queues are the single biggest bottleneck for getting new generation online, however. The median time for an interconnection request to move through the queue has jumped from less than two years during the early 2000s to around five years today. Markets are strongly signaling that new generation is needed, but because of these delays, a supply resource investor would have had to join the queue years ago to be able to respond.

While FERC has reformed the interconnection processes through Order Nos. 2023 and 845, the length of the rulemaking and compliance process has rendered those actions useful and necessary, but no longer innovative. RTOs have submitted – and the Commission has approved – proposals that accelerate certain generation projects through the interconnection process. These proposals are in tension with the Commission’s historic open access policies, however, and they raise the question of how FERC can uphold those policies and support well-functioning competitive markets while meeting the load growth challenge. The answer to preserving these foundational principals is better system planning.

Short-term needs are overtaking long-term planning

We know that when transmission system planners have the necessary data and resources to conduct long-term planning, it yields substantial benefits for customers. That principle is at the core of the Commission’s regional transmission planning reforms, including Order No. 1920. However, many stakeholders rightfully continue to emphasize that long-term planning is not a replacement for near-term planning, which must address facility replacements, reliability-related upgrades and upgrades constructed to interconnect new generation.

Read More in Transmission & Distribution

Because the near-term need is so great, system planners are understandably devoting as many resources as they can to meeting it, which may be to the detriment of the system’s long-term planning needs.

We cannot stay in crisis mode forever. Planning for the longer term, while also accounting for near-term drivers, is key to maximizing benefits to ratepayers.

Insufficient long-term planning for transmission system buildout is having an immediate impact on interconnection costs now, when the country desperately needs new, cost-effective generation. Interconnection customers with real proposed generators may experience unpredictable and significant cost increases – sometimes as much as hundreds of millions of dollars – halfway through the interconnection process. Those costs can lead to generation project withdrawals, cascading restudies, and further exacerbation of delays. Even the fastest interconnection study processes cannot solve this recurring and inefficient approach to connecting new resources to the grid.

Integrate transmission planning and interconnection processes

The grid is a single machine; it should not be planned and constructed in a piecemeal fashion by reacting to interconnection customers. Planning and constructing the system with an eye to both replacing aging infrastructure and meeting the needs of new generation will provide substantial efficiencies and cost savings for consumers.

With an integrated process, interconnecting resources would have more cost certainty, which should facilitate better decisions about proceeding with planned projects, both reducing queue volume and project churn. Such a process will, in turn, reduce interconnection queue timelines, allowing new resources to more quickly respond to demand growth and related price signals from markets.

While the Commission took limited steps to harmonize the two in Order No. 1920, entities in the electric sector — both public and private — can and should do more.

For instance, our grid planners, particularly the RTOs/ISOs that serve more than two thirds of the country, must truly optimize the grid that we have today, such as by using cutting-edge technologies when building out the network. Order Nos. 2023, 1920 and 881 moved the ball forward in this respect by requiring transmission developers to consider the use of advanced technologies and requiring changes to make better use of the existing grid. Utilities need not wait until full implementation of those orders to integrate these types of technologies into their planning practices.

Improving the integration of transmission planning and interconnection processes can be a substantial undertaking, particularly given the competing demands on system planners’ time, such as looming compliance obligations for Order No. 1920. Ideally, this integration would happen at the regional and interregional levels, rather than locally. Given the wide-ranging benefits of an integrated approach, RTOs/ISOs are best equipped to lead on designing and implementing coordinated and consolidated processes. Ultimately, the details matter greatly; any integration of the transmission planning and generation interconnection processes must continue to satisfy open access standards, and any reforms and advancements should provide substantial benefits to customers.

The core responsibility of electricity grid regulators, planners, and operators is to ensure that the lights stay on at a price customers can afford. Maintaining disparate planning processes for the wires needed to deliver power increases costs and delays of building new resources when we cannot afford them.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/HoL9Rm_Ms9HVL9r6039f5X04mVUH1yQicl8-5LnSaK4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9KdWR5Q2hhbmcucG5n.webp,N,,2025-09-27 12:03:01.170216

Buyers across the country have been flocking to dealerships ahead of the deadline.

People have had a lot of reasons to make the switch over the years -- like embracing new technology, not buying or burning gasoline, and the speed and quietness of EVs.

For many, a $7,500 tax credit has been a strong incentive, too, especially when it came to leasing a new electric car at a low monthly payment.

""The EV tax credit that we're looking at that's going to expire has been heavily utilized. If you look at it from an adoption point of view, utilizing leasing and using that workaround is key,"" said Ivan Drury, the Director of Insights at Edmunds.com.

That incentive goes away at the end of the month, so this summer has seen a surge in EV registrations compared to last year. Some of it comes down to more model choices, but July's sales were up sharply after Congress passed the ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" which eliminated the tax credit.

Chevrolet's EVs jumped 100%, Volkswagen saw gains of 127%, sales of Porsche's fully-electric models shot up 174%, and Audi had a staggering increase in EV sales, up 252%.

August EV sales were also up overall, and September may end up being a very good month for electric cars, too.

Right now, the Orange County Auto Show is underway, and organizers expect EVs to be getting lots of looks.

""The auto show's a perfect place to come and see a bunch of the EVs, and then get out to the dealership and close that deal before the 30th,"" said John Sackrison, who runs the auto show.

So, with the monetary incentive going away, is that going to put a huge dent in the sales for EVs?

""There's definitely going to be a hangover. You're going to see kind of this lull, a very, very short interim lull, but EV sales aren't going away forever,"" Drury said.

It’s not yet clear where in Kansas TerraPower would want to build a nuclear reactor.
Advanced nuclear reactors and TerraPower For decades, logistics and expenses have held nuclear energy back.
The Trump administration has thrown its weight behind advanced nuclear power, drawing a mix of praise and criticism.
“ At what point is it just too expensive for us to just keep having Evergy build and build?” Barnett said.","One of the companies leading the charge to deploy safer, smaller, faster-to-build nuclear reactors is hoping to find a site for one in Kansas.

TerraPower, cofounded by former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, began construction last month on its first power plant of this kind in southwest Wyoming as a $4 billion demonstration project cofunded by the U.S. Department of Energy.

Now it is interested in building one in Kansas to generate power in utility company Evergy’s service area.

TerraPower, Evergy and state officials announced this week that they have signed a memorandum of understanding to explore the prospects. They issued a news release featuring enthusiastic quotes from Democratic Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and both of the state’s Republican U.S. senators.

“We need to explore all available sources to power the future of our great state,” Kelly said.

“Nuclear energy is the way of the future,” U.S. Senator Roger Marshall said.

But the reaction from clean energy advocates in Kansas is mixed. The news sparked some interest in emissions-free power generation, but also concern about the price tag and whether the project would attract more data centers to the region with significant needs for electricity and water. Kansas faces water sustainability challenges.

“ We want to make sure that the plans we’re making for the clean energy future are affordable,” said Dorothy Barnett, executive director of the Climate + Energy Project. “ I am increasingly concerned for our friends and neighbors who are struggling to pay their utility bills.”

Kansas regulators signed off on $128 million in rate hikes for Evergy this week.

The Sierra Club said Kansas has financially smarter options for powering its economy.

“We’ve got plenty of roofs here in Kansas,” said Zack Pistora, state director for the Sierra Club in Kansas. “Or backyards that could say, ‘Hey, we’ll be glad to lease our roof or our land for solar, Evergy. You can pay us instead of paying this out-of-state company.’”

Looking for potential sites in Kansas

An official with the Kansas Department of Commerce said regional power demand is projected to more than double over the next decade. That’s according to the regional grid operator, the Southwest Power Pool.

“We need to be ready for this,” said Paul Hughes, the department’s lead on matters involving megaprojects. “And I’m not saying it has to be this (nuclear) project, but we do need to act in ensuring that Kansas isn’t effectively blocked out of future opportunities because of the availability or unavailability of power in the state.”

Asked why TerraPower is specifically considering Kansas, Hughes noted that Evergy already has experience with nuclear energy. It owns Wolf Creek Nuclear Generating Station 60 miles south of Topeka, the state’s only nuclear plant. By contrast, some states don’t have nuclear power and some have restrictions or outright bans.

This fall Kansas State University launched a nuclear engineering program.

It’s not yet clear where in Kansas TerraPower would want to build a nuclear reactor. The company will need to consider proximity to transmission lines and to a workforce. It will also need to find communities interested in the project, and will need to ensure that any potential sites have stable underground geology.

Hughes said the state commerce department will help facilitate the discussions.

“We can help communities articulate their interest in the project or disinterest in the project,” he said.

Communities that aren’t interested will be passed over for consideration, he said.

“These (projects) just don’t go well when you try to force feed them into a community — and all parties to this agreement understand that,” Hughes said.

Advanced nuclear reactors and TerraPower

For decades, logistics and expenses have held nuclear energy back. Conventional nuclear plants not only have high price tags but also a propensity to greatly exceed their budgets and to take longer than expected to build.

Modular advanced nuclear designs are smaller than conventional plants and represent a potential industry turning point that is decades in the making. The companies developing them say they will be safer and faster to build.

However, none of the designs like TerraPower's are yet in commercial operation in the U.S.

The Trump administration has thrown its weight behind advanced nuclear power, drawing a mix of praise and criticism. This spring it unveiled executive orders and plans to reconsider some regulations, press for approval of projects, and use the controversial Department of Government Efficiency to overhaul the nation’s independent regulator of nuclear energy.

Kansas officials said they’re aware of the development.

“ It is on our radar,” Hughes said. “We want to make sure that (Kansas is) doing this safely and that’s what we’ll do.”

TerraPower expects its Wyoming project to come online this decade. The company says that the project will create 1,600 jobs during peak construction, after which about 250 jobs will remain at the site for day-to-day operations.

The company’s design, the Natrium reactor, uses liquid sodium rather than water to envelop uranium fuel. This liquid has a far higher boiling point – 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit – which the company says adds to the reactor’s safety.

The reactor heats the liquid sodium, which in turn heats pipes full of molten salt. The pipes carry the molten salt to a storage tank that serves as a power battery. The salt heats tubes of water, creating pressurized steam. The steam turns a turbine to generate electricity. The salt then cycles back to the reactor area to be heated up again.

The battery represents a key departure from a conventional plant such as Evergy’s Wolf Creek. The facility would store the heated molten salt in a tank and draw upon it as needed to meet demand.

Wolf Creek can’t adjust its output to the ebb and flow of electricity demand or to account for sunny and windy weather generating more from solar and wind farms.

What do clean energy advocates think?

Barnett, from the Climate + Energy Project, wants to hear more details.

Generating electricity without pumping out greenhouse gases is “one of the most important things as we think about our climate future,” she said.

Additionally, her organization wants power plants to pair well with renewable energy and is interested in the efforts of advanced nuclear designs to do that.

But she’s skeptical because many people already struggle to pay their utility bills and Evergy not only got the greenlight this week from Kansas regulators for $128 million in rate hikes, it also got permission this summer to build and co-own two new natural gas-burning power plants.

“ At what point is it just too expensive for us to just keep having Evergy build and build?” Barnett said.

The Wyoming project suggests that an advanced nuclear facility would cost billions.

Also, she has questions about potential indirect effects. For example, even if the reactor doesn’t require much water because it uses liquid sodium as a coolant, data centers do. This means the reactor’s impact on water use in Kansas could depend on how the power gets used.

Pistora, with the Sierra Club in Kansas, said Evergy and TerraPower will need to answer a slew of pressing questions.

“Does this make economic sense from a cost and benefit standpoint?” he asked. “What about the water use? What about the (nuclear) waste disposal? … Where are we going to get this nuclear material and where’s it going to be mined?”

A few utility-scale battery projects have been proposed in Kansas, Pistora said, which could help store energy from renewable sources or existing fossil fuel plants for when the power is needed.

Like Barnett, he pointed to the recent approval of Evergy’s requests to hike its rates and to build new natural gas power plants.

“ Now we’re hearing about nuclear, which is the most expensive power out there,” he said. “Why are we going for these big-ticket, capital-intensive, expensive energy projects?”

3.8%

Increase in total net electricity generation this July compared with the same month last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The EIA attributed the increase to hot weather, but analysts told Utility Dive this could be the beginning of an anticipated surge in demand from data centers and electrification.

David Pacyna, SOO Green HVDC Link CEO, said in an interview that the project could start operating in late 2031 to mid-2032.

2.1 GW

New generation that has been added in the PJM Interconnection footprint this year. Concerns that capacity is not growing fast enough to meet anticipated demand is driving a rebellion by governors in the PJM footprint who say they will pull their states out of the organization unless given more influence in the grid operator.

The report looked at where utilities stood in efforts to close their coal plants by 2030, add no new natural gas and be powered by clean energy alone by 2035. Though the report doesn't specifically define ""clean energy"" — it mentions wind, solar and battery storage.

The score for CenterPoint Energy in southwest Indiana dropped the most. It went from a B to a D. The utility’s unfinished 20-year plan calls for keeping coal plants open past 2030 — at least seven years later than originally planned.

Indiana Michigan Power up north dropped one letter grade to a C. Its parent company, AEP, asked Indiana customers to pay for coal plants owned by the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation, even though Michigan and Ohio pulled back some of their funding.

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

Despite having an overwhelming financial advantage, the campaign supporting Proposition 50 has tried to portray itself as the underdog in a fight to raise money against opposition campaigns with ties to President Trump and his supporters.
California’s congressional districts are drawn once every decade after the U.S. Census by a voter-approved independent redistricting commission.
And relatively few Californians pay attention to redistricting, the esoteric process of redrawing congressional districts.
There are more than 30 campaign committees associated with Proposition 50 registered with the secretary of state’s office, but only three have raised large amounts of money.","Supporters of the November ballot measure to reconfigure California’s congressional districts — an effort led by Gov. Gavin Newsom to help Democrats win control of the U.S. House of Representatives next year — have far out-raised the opposition campaigns, according to fundraising disclosures filed with the state.

The primary group backing Proposition 50 raked in $77.5 million and spent $28.1 million through Sept. 20, according to a campaign finance report that was filed with the secretary of state’s office on Thursday.

The committee has $54.4 million in the bank for the final weeks of the campaign, so Californian should expect a blizzard of television ads, mailers, phone calls and other efforts to sway voters before the Nov. 4 special election.

The two main groups opposing the ballot measure have raised $35.3 million, spent $27.4 million and have roughly $8.8 million in the bank combined, campaign finance reports show.

Despite having an overwhelming financial advantage, the campaign supporting Proposition 50 has tried to portray itself as the underdog in a fight to raise money against opposition campaigns with ties to President Trump and his supporters.

“MAGA donors keep pouring millions into the campaign to stop Prop. 50 in the hopes of pleasing their ‘Dear Leader,’” said Hannah Milgrom, a spokesperson for the Yes on 50, the Election Rigging Response Act campaign. “We will not take our foot off the gas — Prop. 50 is America’s best chance to stop this reckless and dangerous president, and we will keep doing everything we can to ensure every Californian knows the stakes and is ready to vote yes on 50 this Nov. 4th.”

A spokesperson for one of the anti-Proposition 50 campaigns, which was sending mailers to voters even before the Democratic-led California Legislature placed Proposition 50 on the November ballot, said their priority was to help Californians understand the inappropriateness of redrawing congressional boundaries that had been created by a voter-approved, state independent commission.

“We started communicating with voters early about the consequences of having politicians draw their own lines,” said Amy Thoma, a spokesperson for a coalition that opposes the ballot measure. “We are confident we’ll have the resources necessary to continue through election day.”

A spokesperson for the other main anti-Proposition 50 group agreed.

“When you’re selling a lemon, no amount of cash can change the taste. We’re confident in raising more than sufficient resources to expose Prop. 50 for the blatant political power grab that it is,” said Ellie Hockenbury, an advisor to the No on 50 - Stop Sacramento’s Power Grab campaign. Newsom “can’t change the fact that Prop. 50 is nothing more than a ploy for politicians to take the power of redistricting away from the voters and charge them for the privilege at a massive cost to taxpayers.”

The special election is expected to cost the state and the counties $282 million, according to the secretary of state’s office and the state department of finance.

If approved, Proposition 50 would have a major impact on California’s 2026 congressional elections, which will play a major role in determining whether Trump is able to continue enacting his agenda in the final two years of his tenure. The party that wins the White House frequently loses congressional seats two years later, and Republicans hold a razor-thin majority in the House.

After Trump urged GOP-led states, notably Texas, to redraw their congressional districts to increase the number of Republicans elected to Congress in next year’s midterm election, Newsom and other California Democrats responded by proposing a counter-effort to boost the ranks of their party in the legislative body.

California’s congressional districts are drawn once every decade after the U.S. Census by a voter-approved independent redistricting commission. So Democrats’ proposal to replace the districts with new boundaries proposed by state lawmakers must be approved by voters. The state Legislature voted in August to put the measure before voters in a special election on Nov. 4.

Polling about the proposition is not definitive. It’s an off-year election, which means turnout is likely to be low and the electorate is unpredictable. And relatively few Californians pay attention to redistricting, the esoteric process of redrawing congressional districts.

There are more than 30 campaign committees associated with Proposition 50 registered with the secretary of state’s office, but only three have raised large amounts of money.

Newsom’s pro-Proposition 50 effort has received several large donations since its launch, including $10 million from billionaire financier George Soros, $7.6 million from House Majority PAC (the Democrats’ congressional political arm) and $4.5 million from various Service Employees International Union groups. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and his wife have contributed $1 million to a separate committee supporting the proposition.

The opposition groups had few small-dollar donors and were largely funded by two sources — $30 million in loans from Charles Munger Jr., who for years has been a major Republican donor in California, and a $5-million donation from the Congressional Leadership Fund, the GOP political arm of House Republicans.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/13bcfae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x1890+0+255/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fce%2F20%2Ff602abea4d9190b0c74679c37f3e%2F1482102-me-early-voting-features-5-brv.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 22:59:05.070990

As electric cars running on rechargeable lithium-ion batteries continue to gain a larger market share of the roadways, it's becoming increasingly important for firefighters to learn how to tackle the challenges that come with keeping the public safe when things go wrong.

On Thursday and Friday, Tesla staged a training session instructing first responders on how to contain these fires.

Tesla, alongside the San Bernardino County Fire Department, held the event at the San Bernardino Airport. It's the second such event the automaker has held for first responders.

""Our goal is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy, and so we can't do it alone,"" said Tesla business development manager Jan Gromadzki.

As the world moves toward sustainable energy, tactics for handling emergencies such as fires will change. As such, Tesla brought technology that's not even included in its vehicles, like the storage systems for its lithium-ion batteries, so first responders know exactly what to do in the case of an emergency.

""How do you train the firefighters for tomorrow? And if you're just training for past events, then you're not very forward thinking as a fire agency,"" said Ben Flanders, who attended the event as a member of the Rialto Fire Department.

The department recently sent letters to local governments in at least six states — Alabama, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Mexico — informing them it was withdrawing money awarded under the $1.1 trillion infrastructure law former President Joe Biden signed in 2021.

The reversals are among the clearest signals yet of the drastic shift from the Biden administration's emphasis on alternative transportation, such as transit and biking, to the Trump administration's focus on preserving and expanding lanes for cars and trucks.

While the new grants Trump's transportation department announced this year reflect that change, it's practically unprecedented for an administration to claw back grants awarded by a predecessor without a compelling reason, such as potential environmental harms. However, the latest recalled projects didn't have fully funded grant agreements in place, which would have made reversing them far trickier.

The transportation department's press office didn't respond to emails requesting comment.

Prioritizing roads, not trails

Connecticut won a $5.7 million federal grant last summer to help design segments of a 44-mile (71-kilometer) recreational trail connecting several communities along the Naugatuck River.

Rick Dunne, executive director of the Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments, said the grant’s final details were being negotiated when the U.S. Department of Transportation sent a letter this month to inform local officials that the project wouldn't move forward. The agency wants “multimodal grant programs” to focus on “projects that promote vehicular travel,” the letter explained.

“They're defining quality of life for Americans as enhancing automobile operations,” Dunne said.

The same reason was given in a letter sent to Albuquerque, New Mexico, pulling $11.5 million in funding for a leg of a rail trail cutting through the city's core. It was among the first active transportation projects awarded under the infrastructure law, with funding announced in 2022, but it was still going through the approval process.

“We are going to stand up for Albuquerque and prevent the Trump Administration from pulling money from a project the people of Albuquerque want,” Mayor Tim Keller said in a press release. “We will see you in court.”

Kevin Mills, vice president of policy for the Rails to Trails Conservancy, called the cuts “an affront to the priorities set by Congress and Americans’ demands for safer, more convenient walking and biking routes.”

DOT also withdrew a $20 million grant awarded in 2022 to transform three streetscapes in Boston. The reversal was based in part on the project's electric vehicle charging stations, which the administration said contradicted its preference for promoting “traditional forms of energy and natural resources,” the Boston Globe reported.

No project too small to cut

Some of the withdrawn projects were relatively small in dollars and scope but still targeted for reversal due to the department's changing priorities.

One applied to just a single block in San Diego County, California, where the community wanted to test whether it could improve safety without disrupting traffic flow. It sought to employ “creative roadway features” such as roundabouts in place of traffic signals, with plans to expand the approach to other intersections if the model proved successful, said Donna Durckel, spokesperson for the county's Land Use and Environment Group.

But Trump's transportation officials flagged it as “hostile to motor vehicles” in a letter sent Sept. 9 because the project included a so-called road diet that would have reduced the stretch from four lanes to two.

On the same day, McLean County in central Illinois got a similar letter recalling federal funding awarded last year to help design a final 9-mile segment of a bike and pedestrian trail along Route 66. County engineer Jerry Stokes said the project wouldn't affect motor vehicle travel but would promote safety by getting bicyclists and pedestrians off the road.

“We're kind of at a standstill now until new funding sources become available,” he said.

This adds to the initial funding for FIRE Collaboratives announced in January.

According to DOE, “these investments are part of DOE’s broader mission to unleash American energy, science, and innovation, ensuring the technologies that define the future of fusion power are developed here in the United States.”

“This funding represents a major step toward establishing commercial fusion energy as a singular competitive advantage for the nation,” said Tammy Ma, director of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s (LLNL) Livermore Institute for Fusion Technology.

LLNL has a prominent role in these projects. As the home of fusion ignition, LLNL is uniquely positioned to help translate the physics breakthrough into a viable source of commercial fusion energy. LLNL first achieved fusion ignition in a 2022 National Ignition Facility experiment and has since repeated the achievement multiple times.

The FIRE collaboratives will receive $128 million, awarded to seven teams focused on creating a fusion energy science and technology innovation ecosystem by forming virtual, centrally managed teams. The selected teams aim to bridge the DOE Fusion Energy Sciences program’s basic science research and growing fusion industries.

LLNL staff are involved with three of the FIRE collaboratives:

Catherine Percher: Fusion Neutrons for Integrated Blanket Technology Development Through Advanced Testing and Design, led by the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This collaborative will address a crucial gap in the development of fusion pilot plants: the development and validation of integrated blanket technology in prototypical environments, particularly under the irradiation of 14 MeV D-T neutrons and with high-magnetic fields to demonstrate representative performance of key components and systems.

Kelli Humbird and Derek Mariscal: Fusion Energy Data Ecosystem and Repository (FEDER), led by General Atomics. This collaborative will create a centralized, federated platform that integrates data from experiments, materials science and modeling, supporting both magnetic and inertial fusion research. The project aims to standardize data formats and provide advanced tools for data discovery, analysis and visualization, enhancing collaboration and accelerating progress toward practical fusion energy.

Vlad Soukhanovskii: Advancing the maturity of liquid metal plasma-facing materials and first-wall concepts, led by the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. This collaborative will solve key technical problems with liquid metal plasma-facing materials and wall concepts so that liquid metals can be considered for fusion pilot plant designs. Research will include four main challenges: testing protective materials, understanding material properties, studying how liquid metals behave in magnetic fields and developing new metal alloys.

The INFUSE program will receive $6.1 million. With this funding, DOE selected 20 projects that accelerate private-sector fusion energy development by reducing barriers to collaboration between businesses and national laboratories or universities. LLNL’s Matt Selwood is leading the national laboratory effort collaborating with Pacific Fusion to investigate coded apertures for pulsed magnetic fusion neutron imaging.

Derrick Hollie is the founder of the Energy Poverty Prevention Project.","As the weather turns colder, millions of families are bracing for another season of high energy costs and, for many, the threat of going without heat. One truth is impossible to ignore: Energy is becoming a luxury.

In the last year, residential electricity prices have risen 6.5 percent nationwide, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Since 2022, estimates place the overall increase closer to 13 percent. Natural gas, heating oil and propane prices remain volatile, and households that struggled to keep cool this summer are now worried about how to stay warm this winter.

This is not a regional issue. From New England families dependent on fuel oil, to Midwestern households facing record utility bills, to seniors on fixed incomes in the South, the crisis of energy poverty has gone mainstream. Families are making impossible choices: between groceries and heating, or medicine and electricity.

As the leader of the Energy Poverty Prevention Project, I’ve spent nearly a decade calling out this quiet emergency. I’ve testified before Congress five times. I’ve met parents who ration electricity, seniors who wear coats indoors, and students who can’t keep their laptops charged for school. For them, energy is neither affordable nor reliable; it’s a luxury.

Who is at fault? Greedy utility executives? Commodity traders? For the answer, look no further than your nearest elected official.

For years, government policy has pushed a one-sided energy transition. Coal and natural gas plants that once provided steady, affordable baseload power have been retired in droves. In Maryland, more than 3,800 megawatts of coal-fired power generation have been taken offline since 2012. Meanwhile, subsidies flow toward electric vehicles and energy-hungry data centers, all of which compete with families for the same kilowatts.

Utility executives and commodity traders keep the lights on. Government, too often, turns them off.

That’s why I’m urging Congress and state leaders to act: Protect access to affordable, reliable energy by ending policies that raise costs and leave vulnerable communities behind.

If we put customers and providers, rather than bureaucrats, at the center of energy policy, the result will be lower bills, more growth opportunities, and greater financial freedom for families.

The Energy Poverty Prevention Project can’t do it alone. It’s time for policymakers to wake up. It’s time to measure energy policy by human costs, not carbon counts. No parent should choose between feeding a child and heating a home. No student should fall behind because they can’t keep the lights on. And no American, not one, should be forced into poverty to survive the winter.

Let’s act as if energy matters. Because for millions, it’s the difference between hardship and hope.

Watch Rep. Tom Tiffany’s recap on energy reform from the roundtable HERE.

Rep. Tom Tiffany (WI-07) released the following statement:

“Permitting reform is common sense.

I will keep working in Congress to streamline federal reviews, protect our environment, and get shovels in the ground faster.”

Rep. Tony Wied (WI-08) released the following statement:

“Northeast Wisconsin builds world-class products. When projects sit in limbo under layers of federal red tape, we lose jobs, we lose investment, and families pay more for electricity and fuel. We can respect local voices and environmental standards, and still move at the speed of the economy. I support reforms that set firm timelines, cut duplication across agencies, and get workers back on the job.”

AFP-WI Director of Grassroots Operations Paul Schecklman released the following statement:

“Federal permitting restrictions are holding back the reliable energy Wisconsin families and businesses need. Projects and new investments like data centers face delays and higher costs because of Washington red tape. Congress should enact commonsense reforms now so we can meet rising demand, support jobs, and ensure every community has affordable, dependable power.”",https://americansforprosperity.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AFP_image-1024x536.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 20:58:58.336557

Yet the clean energy boom is beginning to cut into this pollution.
The next phase of clean energy deployment could help China to go much further than the pledges Mr. Xi announced this week and supplant in a more significant way the dirty energy the country relies on.
In practice that means systematically building infrastructure, sophisticated supply chains and a predictable domestic market for clean energy.
Mr. Trump rolled back President Joe Biden’s flagship climate initiative, the Inflation Reduction Act, and with it billions of dollars in federal investment in the clean energy sector.","President Xi Jinping of China has long taken pleasure in poking fun at the West’s short political attention span in confronting long-term challenges such as climate change. Western diplomats told me that in 2017 he regaled a delegation with a story about how President Barack Obama had traveled to Beijing to attempt to pressure China to cut its greenhouse gas emissions faster, only to be followed by President Trump, who downplayed the threat of climate change.

The point was that in contrast to the West, where election cycles have constrained consistent climate action, China plays a long game — planning decades into the future. And it doesn’t like to make promises it can’t keep.

This week, at the United Nations General Assembly, Beijing offered the world a glimpse of how it plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the years and decades ahead with a pledge to reduce them by 7 to 10 percent by 2035.

Such a modest commitment is frustrating to environmental advocates and Western leaders alike, who see it as falling short of what the climate crisis demands. In one sense, they’re absolutely right. China is the world’s biggest polluter and single-handedly burns more than half of the world’s coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel. According to my organization’s research, China would need to slash its emissions by at least 30 percent from peak levels by 2035 to align with the Paris Agreement’s target to limit average global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Beijing’s new pledge clearly misses that mark.

Yet to judge China’s climate ambition by the new pledge alone is to miss the far more consequential economic story: China has become the world’s clean tech superpower. Its dominance in the solar, battery and electric vehicle industries should allow it to move faster on climate and help much of the rest of the world use fewer fossil fuels, too. While the West is distracted and divided, China is focused and surging ahead.

There are reasons for China’s choice to set a conservative target. Domestically, China’s economic slowdown, particularly in provinces reliant on heavy industry, has made its leaders wary of climate actions that could jeopardize growth.

Internationally, wavering commitments from key Western polluters, most sharply the United States and, to a lesser extent, the European Union, also affect China’s willingness to act boldly. In the absence of Western leadership, its self-interested approach tends to become more pronounced.

Yet in the decade since Mr. Obama visited Beijing to implore Mr. Xi to cut emissions more aggressively, China’s clean energy sector has evolved from a nascent industry into a powerful engine of its economy and a source of national pride.

Today, China manufactures over 80 percent of the world’s solar panels, around 75 percent of electric vehicle batteries and more than 60 percent of wind turbines. In 2023 alone, the clean tech sector accounted for 40 percent of China’s growth in gross domestic product, a staggering number in an otherwise sluggish economic environment. China now installs more solar panels annually than the rest of the world combined.

The clean tech sector is also becoming the core of China’s industrial future and global business expansion. Last year, China invested $72 billion in green manufacturing outside its borders, equivalent to about 40 percent of China’s total foreign direct investment.

The country still accounts for about 30 percent of climate-warming gases, with its vast industrial base and coal fleet responsible for 90 percent of new emissions globally since 2015. Yet the clean energy boom is beginning to cut into this pollution. The rapid deployment of renewable energy brought China’s carbon dioxide emissions down by 1 percent in the first half of 2025, continuing a trend that began in early 2024.

The next phase of clean energy deployment could help China to go much further than the pledges Mr. Xi announced this week and supplant in a more significant way the dirty energy the country relies on. For instance, while Mr. Xi’s government pledged that China would add six times the amount of wind and solar energy it had installed in 2020 and ensure that 30 percent of its energy came from nonfossil fuel sources by 2035, it is likely to go far beyond that.

Unlike the West, where climate targets are often ambitious but vulnerable to political cycles, China has aligned decarbonization with its economic growth strategy. In practice that means systematically building infrastructure, sophisticated supply chains and a predictable domestic market for clean energy.

In the West, temporary surges in ambition often give way to political backsliding, creating the illusion of progress without deep structural changes. Mr. Trump rolled back President Joe Biden’s flagship climate initiative, the Inflation Reduction Act, and with it billions of dollars in federal investment in the clean energy sector.

Beginning in 2029, AtmosClear, a subsidiary of Houston-based Fidelis New Energy, plans to generate renewable baseload power at the Baton Rouge plant using sustainable materials like sugarcane bagasse while capturing 680,000 metric tons of biogenic CO2 annually, which ExxonMobil has agreed to inject more than a mile underground. The biogenic CO2 produced could also be used as a feedstock for low-carbon natural gas or other synthetic fuels, according to AtmosClear.

ExxonMobil’s carbon capture and storage system includes a 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline network, Class VI injection wells, and monitoring systems. “We have a number of permits under review for potential storage sites,” ExxonMobil Media Advisor Margot Armentor said in a release. “We’re in the early stages of determining whether these sites will be suitable CO2 storage locations,” said Armentor.

In April, tech giant Microsoft signed a 15-year agreement with Fidelis AtmosClear for carbon dioxide removal as part of a voluntary commitment the tech giant made to become carbon neutral by 2030. Microsoft has entered into several carbon dioxide removal (CDR) purchase agreements with various companies since 2020. Other technology companies are also pursuing voluntary carbon removal strategies, often with net-zero and carbon-negative goals that rely on buying CDR credits.

Louisiana State University Professor Richard Hughes said Lousiana’s geology is almost perfect for carbon capture and storage. “The way the interaction of the rivers and the Gulf of Mexico has happened over Millenia is we’ve got these thick sands, and the river moves back and forth so that the sands are covered by shale. The shale is kind of an impermeable piece where nothing can move up or down, and the things in the sand just stay there, and we have a sequence of these sand layers from 20,000 feet down almost to the surface,” Hughes said in a YouTube video.

President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” preserved and expanded 45Q tax credits for carbon capture and storage, which were initially established in 2022 by the Inflation Reduction Act. Trump’s bill simultaneously canceled billions in Department of Energy awards to companies developing decarbonization projects, however, as reported by The Center Square.

Fidelis AtmosClear plans to begin construction in 2026 and expects to begin producing baseline power and biogenic CO2 in 2029. The company said it estimates the project will result in over $800 million of investment and approximately 75 permanent and 600 construction jobs. The plant will also support a significant revival of forestry management jobs impacted by mill closures in the area, Fidelis said.

Will Green, president and CEO of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, said in an op-ed Friday published by Nola.com that there is more than $20 billion in proposed CCS investment across the state.

Louisiana, North Dakota, Wyoming, West Virginia and Arizona are the only states to a have achieved primacy for carbon capture and storage from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which means they have taken over the day-to-day responsibility of issuing permits for Class VI wells, monitoring compliance, and taking enforcement actions when violations occur.

The Louisiana legislature developed carbon capture and storage policies through numerous bills passed during the 2024 and 2025 legislative sessions. These actions included legislation clarifying the use of eminent domain for transport of carbon dioxide via pipeline, protected landowners from liability, created a regulatory framework, and set new restrictions in response to industry and community concerns.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/70/c7052d19-caa3-4ccc-bc0f-46934a7b1c76/68b870858c2a6.image.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 19:01:02.674063

Money maker: Energy Secretary Chris Wright is using the same type of investment vehicle that Republicans have criticized Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul, for using.","President Donald Trump has used his emergency powers to keep a handful of older coal- and oil-fired power plants open past their scheduled retirements.

And he’s just getting started with his intervention into U.S. electricity markets, Zack Colman reports.

The Energy Department and the White House National Energy Dominance Council are considering new orders and a more aggressive effort to keep large, around-the-clock fossil fuel plants from closing — pushing deeper into decisions traditionally left up to power companies or state utility commissions.

Some plants might have to stay open even if they are unprofitable, potentially driving up consumers’ electric bills.

Trump and his top policy brass — Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum — say the decadeslong transition from coal to a diverse range of power sources including renewable energy has tipped the United States into an energy crisis that can’t be undone without mining and burning more coal, as Hannah Northey reports.

Zack reports that White House officials fear Trump’s vision of an energy-hungry, tech-driven economy could come crashing down unless “baseload” coal plants slated for retirement stay open while regulators exempt others from federal air quality standards.

Coal has been on the losing end of electricity markets that dispatch the cheapest sources of power generation first. Natural gas, wind and solar power have been the cheapest sources. Old, inefficient coal plants are now among the most expensive for power companies to operate, and they pollute more than other sources.

Less complicated politically is Trump’s promise to bring down electricity prices, which continue to climb in most regions of the country.

‘There is no emergency here’

Wright confirmed at an event hosted by Reuters this week that the administration is “absolutely” exploring ways to keep baseload plants open, including more secretarial orders.

Wright has used that emergency authority to keep three power-generating units open: a coal-fired plant in Michigan and two oil-fired units of a plant in Pennsylvania. He used similar authority to keep a Maryland oil plant running and allow it to exceed its operating limit, at the regional grid operator’s request.

The Trump administration is looking at using the Defense Production Act to prop up plants financially and ordering plants to stay open in the name of preserving capacity for peak demand.

Projections for rapidly rising electricity demand is putting pressure on regional power grids. But opponents of the administration’s use of emergency power say it’s just adding costs onto consumer electricity bills.

“There’s no emergency here,” said Ari Peskoe, director of the electricity law initiative at Harvard Law School’s Environmental and Energy Law Program, who argued that Wright is assuming a persistent energy emergency in the country.

David Patton, a grid analyst, told one regional power organization — the Midcontinent Independent System Operator — this month that Wright’s order to keep a Michigan coal plant open “was costly and not needed to meet MISO’s reliability requirements.”

Ditching the science

The Environmental Protection Agency may be forced to abandon its scientific argument for scrapping the finding that drives climate regulation, Jean Chemnick writes.

That argument, drawn from a Department of Energy report that downplayed the risks of climate change, is facing pushback and a lawsuit over how the group that wrote the report was formed. The group, made up of scientists widely seen as climate contrarians who were handpicked by Secretary Chris Wright, has since been disbanded, throwing the report in limbo.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if it doesn’t play much of a role at all in the final rule,” said Jody Freeman, director of the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School.

“If they’re not smart and they leave it in there,” Freeman said, “they’re just inviting a court to say, ‘You ignored the overwhelming science, and under arbitrary and capricious review, you can’t.’”

US prepares to step up on nuclear fuel

DOE is set to release at least $900 million to fund domestic uranium enrichment projects to fuel the nation’s nuclear fleet before imports from Russia are cut off, Brian Dabbs and Francisco “A.J.” Camacho write.

The money could come by the end of September, sources told Brian and A.J. The U.S. imports up to a quarter of its uranium from Russia and has only one company currently producing the type of uranium that large reactors use. Some in the industry see the federal funding as just the tip of what’s needed.

Lee Robinson, chief operating officer for General Matter, a nuclear fuel enrichment company, said this week at an Atlantic Council event that the U.S. nuclear fleet could run into “shortage territory” in the coming years.

A ray of hope for plastics talks

Through the gloom of another failed global plastics treaty summit, close observers say they saw a glimmer of hope emanating from China, Leonie Cater reports.

In its closing speech, the world’s biggest plastic producer subtly changed its language on tackling the plastic crisis, acknowledging the problem has to do with the entire life cycle of plastic. It comes as Beijing moves to fill a vacuum left by the U.S. withdrawal from global engagement in environmental talks.

The plastics industry accounts for 3.4 percent of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Plastic production is on track to almost triple by 2060.

In Part 2 of “A Government Most Fowl”, I’ll discuss how the midterms run-up should be used to reset the clean energy and environment debates in response to today’s political realities.","Venice has its pigeons and Capistrano its swallows. Flying over the White House and Capitol Hill these days are birds of a different feather – chickens. For the president and the GOP Congress, they’ll soon be coming home to roost.

Although all elections are important, some are more so than others. History will look back on the 2026 midterms as among the most momentous of the modern era. The reason for this can be summed up in three simple words: Donald John Trump.

The president so dominates the executive and legislative branches that the 2026 elections will be a referendum on his handling of the economy and the affairs of state. Trump claims to have won a popular mandate at the polls last November. It’s FAKE News.

Trump’s winning margin in 2024 was less than 1.5 percent of the popular vote. Although beating Harris by 16 percent in the Electoral College vote, it’s a flawed number in that it fails to reflect popular sentiment and how evenly divided the nation seems to be. The narrow majorities in both the House and Senate are further proof that America is split nearly in half between Trump supporters and everyone else.

If presidential elections are examples of regime change, then the electionof Donald J. Trump in 2024 is an example of radical culture change.

Trump doesn’t have a popular mandate. He has a license given him by the Republicans in Congress and the conservatives on the Supreme Court to do almost anything he wants. The Republican Senate has rubber-stamped its approval of what many believe to be the least competent and most ethically compromised cabinet since the Harding administration.

The House fiddles while the president impounds the monies Congress appropriates, guts agencies established by law, and stops projects that have attracted billions of dollars of private investment because he thinks wind turbines are ugly and coal “clean” and “beautiful”. (What if we were to gold plate the wind turbines, Mr. President?)

Without understanding what was actually being done, the Republicans in Congress hailed Elon Musk and his chainsaw for cutting government programs they oversee and are responsible for, because they contained words like climate, clean energy, environment, minority, vaccine, scientific or medical research, equity, and justice.

Government reform by a keyword search has predictably resulted in major gaps in the operation of federal agencies and the implementation of various programs and policies. Because weather and climate change are closely connected, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cut critical forecasting work. It suspended tracking programs at the National Weather Service (NWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

What does it say when an administration fires the independent inspectors general of nearly every cabinet department and doesn’t replace them? What does it tell you about the relationship of an administration to the truth when the government attempts to overwrite history to conform to nationalistic myths or censors and removes scientific information from federal websites because it conflicts with the fancies of the president?

The first nine months of Trump’s 2nd regime have turned the federal government feral.

The Department of Justice attacks any individual, group, or institution that deigns to disagree with the president and his worldview. Not to put too fine a point on it, but Trump has been able to wing his way out of most problems by crying FAKE NEWS, using misdirection, firing the messenger, or threatening to use the full might of the federal government to prosecute an opponent.

The consequences of Trumpian economics and government reforms are just now showing up in the economy. Given all that’s happened over the past eight months, it’s easy to forget that the impacts of many of Trump’s policy and program reforms, tariffs, and deportation programs are in the earliest stages of implementation.

Delays between implementation and impact are the result of various factors. In the case of rising prices, pre-tariff inventories and efforts by companies to “eat” the new import costs for as long as possible have tamped down pricing. However, companies are running out of options.

At some point, the truth catches up to all of us – Mr. Trump included.

A July survey by KPMG found that “83 percent of businesses expect to raise prices in the next six months, with nearly three quarters already passing on some of the costs.” According to the company: “The full impact on consumers is likely still to come.”

Two of Trump’s most vaunted accomplishments – tariffs and the “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBB) are among the reasons the president’s approval ratings are trending south. According to the Pew Research Center, 61 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump’s tariff policies, while 38 percent approve. The disapproval number for OBBB is 46 percent, while 32 percent approve, with 23 percent being unsure. (See Figure 1)

A Washington Post/IPSOS poll released on September 18th confirmed Pew’s earlier findings. Trump’s approval within Republican ranks was also shown to be dropping, especially among “younger Republican and GOP women.”

What could also prove problematic for Republicans in the 2026 congressional elections is the view of a majority of adult Americans (53 percent) that Trump “is making the federal government work worse, while only about half as many (27 percent) say he is making government better.” The numbers reflect lessening support for Trump’s handling of the federal bureaucracy.

Trump is underwater in terms of voter approval, even for his handling of immigration and crime. Both are issues he has traditionally scored high on. Although the surveys show predictable partisan splits, the loss of favorability amongst independent voters could prove the difference in 2026.

Trump’s response to the poll numbers is – as it always is – to blame the polls and the bias of organizations responsible for them. The president spares no one. In a recent interview on FOX News with Martha McCallum, he blamed FOX for bad polling.

There’s going to come a time when claims of FAKE NEWS and disingenuous pollsters will not outweigh the truth of weakening job markets, rising prices, and dysfunctional federal agencies.

The reasons behind Trump’s loss of support are real rather than theoretical. If younger Republicans lose faith in the president’s economic policies, it’s because recent graduates are being hit hardest by the softening labor market.

China’s reduced imports of US farm products are negatively impacting the nation’s agricultural economy. Not only are farmers unable to sell their soybeans, but they aren’t buying new combines, harvesters, and tractors. The loss of low-wage immigrant labor to harvest crops and pack meat means a rise in food prices.

Mr. Trump could fire every government statistician and replace them with MAGA acolytes, and it wouldn’t change the reality of rising prices and the increasing concerns of voters. Trump’s rebrand of his OBBB as the Working Families Tax Cut is unlikely to take voters’ minds off the fact that their dollar is buying less than it did a month ago, or that they’re paying more for health insurance, when they can afford it at all.

Trump and the GOP have other reasons to be anxious over the potential outcome of the 2026 elections. Historically, midterm elections are notoriously brutal to a sitting president’s party.

Known as the midterm curse, the party controlling the White House has lost an average of 28 seats in the House of Representatives and four seats in the Senate over the 22 off-year elections between 1934 and 2018. (The 2022 midterms did not follow the law of averages as the Democrats lost just six seats in the House while gaining one in the Senate.)

The generic congressional ballot shows Democrats with a lead over Republicans of between three and eight percent, indicating that partisanship is still a major factor in how Americans are likely to vote in 2026. The 2018 generic ballot showed a spread in favor of the Democrats of between seven and 13 percentage points.

The 2018 elections resulted in “a net total of 41 seats from the total number of seats they had won in the 2016 elections.” It was the Democrats’ “largest gain of House seats since the post-Watergate 1974 elections, when they picked up 49 seats.” Trump’s approval ratings at the time hovered around 50 percent.

Even factoring in red-state redistricting, the current numbers suggest that the Democrats have a reasonable chance of taking control of the House after the 2026 elections. The likelihood that the Dems will gain the net of four seats needed to flip the Senate is less.

If the overwhelming majority of economists and political analysts are right, the negative consequences of the president’s policies will only worsen between now and November 2026. If the past is prologue, then the midterm elections will return control of the House to Democrats. From an environmental perspective, Democratic control of the House is a net good thing.

Trump’s opposition to clean energy sources and environmental regulation is so virulent that it’s resulting in the administration working against itself. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has leveraged billions of dollars of private investments in red states – ironically, more in red than blue. One example is the recently raided, under-construction Hyundai battery plant in Georgia.

The White House has rebuffed efforts of red state Republicans to continue the programs. GOP proponents have partly argued that the administration could take credit for it. Trump had no problem taking credit for infrastructure projects contracted for by the Biden administration. Why not for the IRA? (I’ll have more to say about this in Part 2 of “A Government Most Fowl” as it concerns messaging.)

Nothing is more critical in terms of federal climate policy than slowing the administration’s cancellation of renewable energy programs and the unwinding of environmental regulations back to a time before Nixon.

The 2026 midterm elections are an opportunity to effectively slow the Trump administration’s onslaught against clean energy and the environment. In the run-up to the election, the clean energy and environmental communities must keep their collective eyes on the prize – a Democratic House majority.

If I were asked to suggest a phrase that best describes what the midterm election will be about, I’d put “back to basics” at the top of my list. Even in good times, elections are about the economy.

Contrary to what Trump says and demands his administration agree with, people are worried about inflation, jobs, and whether tariffs are worth their sacrifice. Seeing your utility bill go up five percent or more in a month isn’t FAKE NEWS. It’s a problem for the average family of four.

Part of people’s core concern is whether the government will be there for them in times of emergency – personal or societal. A majority of voters believe Trump isn’t the problem solver he claims to be. In fact, they’ll soon be wondering if he isn’t the problem giver.

Voters in 2026 are going to be looking for answers to bread-and-butter issues. It will be up to the clean energy and environmental communities to help frame the debate in a manner that resonates with voters, particularly independents and conservative youth and builds a foundation for the 2028 elections.

In Part 2 of “A Government Most Fowl”, I’ll discuss how the midterms run-up should be used to reset the clean energy and environment debates in response to today’s political realities. One is that Trump has set the terms of the debate, which means keeping it simple and less philosophical.

The GOP budget from the House Appropriations Committee would scale back funding for Maine environmental regulators.

The Natural Resources Council of Maine says that would put clean air and water at risk.

Also read:

Leaders with the NRCM say the cuts could affect not only Maine’s environment, but also the state’s tourism industry.

""Our waters are not clean enough to swim in,” Natural Resources Council of Maine Federal Policy Advocate Anya Fetcher said. “If our air is more polluted, then there will be less of an incentive, less of an interest in coming to Maine to enjoy all of the beauty that our state has to offer.""

Leaders say these proposed cuts would represent the most extreme rollback of environmental funding in decades.

In the meantime, a budget approved on the Senate side, where Susan Collins chairs the Appropriations Committee, would leave more EPA funding intact.

,IRA Tax Credits,2025-09-26 21:30:01+00:00,Washington Examiner,Don't bail out Joe Biden's broken subsidies - Washington Examiner,Rep. Eric Burlison,,,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/op-eds/3827047/dont-bail-joe-biden-obamacare-broken-subsidies/,"I can promise you that Biden’s subsidies do not fit the bill.
And the best part is, in this case, doing so requires us to do nothing at all: Republicans must simply allow Joe Biden’s disastrous temporary subsidies to expire.
Even without Biden’s COVID subsidies, taxpayers will still cover 80% of the typical enrollee’s premium —up from 68% in 2014.
That’s because Obamacare subsidies cap what enrollees pay, fully insulating them from rising healthcare costs and shifting costs directly onto taxpayers.
The truth is that when Americans are actually presented with the facts of the issue at hand, polling shows the majority of Americans want Congress to let these subsidies expire.","Layered on top of already generous subsidies that are not going away, these Biden-era handouts force taxpayers to foot the bill for fully subsidized health care for more than nine million Obamacare recipients. Not a single Republican has ever voted for these subsidies or to extend them. None should do so now. Democrats themselves couldn’t even secure support within their own ranks to make these subsidies permanent. In fact, former Senator Joe Manchin opposed their inclusion in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, citing fiscal concerns.

The question now is whether Republicans will draw a clear line in the sand or settle for a position no stronger than Joe Manchin’s. In November, the people gave President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress a clear mandate to deliver on the conservative agenda. I can promise you that Biden’s subsidies do not fit the bill.

It is incumbent upon us to actually do the work of the people and restore some semblance of fiscal responsibility. And the best part is, in this case, doing so requires us to do nothing at all: Republicans must simply allow Joe Biden’s disastrous temporary subsidies to expire.

Much like our fight to restore work requirements in Medicaid — a deeply popular and common-sense policy — Republicans again have the opportunity to take a principled conservative stand to protect taxpayers in the face of fabricated pressure campaigns. Dubious polling pushed by Democrats and insurance lobbyists suggests that the midterms could be a bloodbath for Republicans if they allow Biden’s COVID subsidies to expire. “Premiums will double,” they say. “Millions will lose coverage.”

Here’s the reality.

42% of Obamacare enrollees are on fully subsidized plans as of 2024. Another 28% pay a premium of $50 or less. When Biden’s subsidies expire, the average enrollee (someone earning 200 percent of the federal poverty level) will only have to pay $32 a week for a plan — about the cost of a median DoorDash order. Someone earning 100% of the poverty level would only have to pay $3.45 — the cost for a cup of coffee.

Even without Biden’s COVID subsidies, taxpayers will still cover 80% of the typical enrollee’s premium —up from 68% in 2014. That’s because Obamacare subsidies cap what enrollees pay, fully insulating them from rising healthcare costs and shifting costs directly onto taxpayers.

If Republicans cave to the Left’s demands, it will be entirely clear that generous taxpayer-funded pandemic healthcare subsidies will be here to stay; almost four million Americans will lose their employer coverage, crowded out by artificially low government-backed premiums.

Free market principles be damned.

This, of course, doesn’t even scratch the surface of the systematically broken Biden subsidies, which cost taxpayers $30 billion annually in improper payments. Biden’s Covid-19 credits are direct cash payments from the United States Treasury to health insurers. Every customer is a fresh check, providing a direct incentive for insurance brokers to collect as many enrollees as possible, often without their knowledge. With $0 premium plans becoming widely available, many enrollees never see a bill.

In 2024 alone, nearly 12 million enrollees filed no claims. Between 2021 and 2024, the number of zero-claim enrollees tripled. As a result, taxpayers sent tens of billions of dollars to insurers even though no care had ever been given.

Is it our position that taxpayer money is best spent on corporate welfare for insurance companies that provide nothing in return? Do we earnestly believe that the American taxpayer will look favorably upon us for layering more waste, fraud, and abuse on an already broken healthcare system?

The truth is that when Americans are actually presented with the facts of the issue at hand, polling shows the majority of Americans want Congress to let these subsidies expire. So let them.

If Democrats want to hold the government hostage because we refuse to burden taxpayers with another trillion-dollar list of demands that would erase all the progress Republicans have made over the past eight months, let them.

SUPREME COURT TO HEAR FTC FIRING LAWSUIT TEEING UP CHALLENGE TO 90-YEAR-OLD PRECEDENT

Republicans were not sent to Washington to rubber-stamp Joe Biden’s COVID-era policies, allowing inflation to spiral further out of control. Our broken healthcare system does deserve attention, but monthly subsidy checks to insurance companies while shifting rising healthcare costs onto taxpayers isn’t “making health care more affordable.”

If politicians are genuinely interested in raising the living standards of Americans, spending measures that pile more debt onto the backs of working families, suppress free market competition, and incentivize government dependency shouldn’t even be entertained.

This agreement aims to promote the revitalization of the country’s nuclear supply chain and build on a shared vision by both companies to grow American manufacturing.

“Nucor is dedicated to rebuilding American energy infrastructure to make it more resilient,” said Leon Topalian, Nucor’s Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our work with The Nuclear Company will help us continue our long-term initiatives to repower the domestic energy sector, as well as reshore manufacturing to lessen American dependence on unreliable foreign global supply chains.”

The Nuclear Company and Nucor will evaluate the promotion of steel materials and related manufacturing that meet the stringent American Society of Mechanical Engineers’ NQA-1 certification standard. The review process will also consider factors, including energy infrastructure and the available workforce, to promote reinvestment in the industrial asset base that has long made America the world’s manufacturing leader.

The partnership follows President Donald J. Trump’s series of executive orders calling for 400 GW of nuclear reactors by 2050 to ensure America has the baseload power required to lead the world in AI. The orders also call for 10 large-scale reactors to be under construction by 2030, as well as strong investments in the American nuclear supply chain for materials, components and fuel.

America’s nuclear supply chain has suffered in recent years as China and Russia have aggressively built reactors and exported competing technologies. A 2022 report by the U.S. Department of Energy found the American nuclear supply chain lacks large forges for the production of gigawatt-scale reactor pressure vessels, with current production concentrated in Asia. A study by the World Nuclear Association found that the number of American facilities certified to produce commercial nuclear-grade components has decreased by more than 40 percent over the past three decades. Over that time, the United States started and built just two nuclear reactors. By contrast, China built 37 reactors in the past decade alone.

“America is at a critical point for power,” said The Nuclear Company Co-Founder & CEO Jonathan Webb. “China is on the verge of becoming the world's largest nuclear power producer, surpassing the United States, just as it did decades ago with manufacturing. Our partnership with Nucor will protect America’s national security, help achieve energy independence and create a more resilient economy.”

The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges.
A White House official declined to specify the size of the U.S. stake in Lithium Americas, but said it would be “very small” — less than 10% — and serve as “a cash buffer” for the company.
Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.
A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption.","The White House is moving forward with a deal that would allow the U.S. government to take a small equity stake in a Canadian company that is developing one of the world’s largest lithium mines in northern Nevada, an official said.

The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of President Donald Trump’s administration intervening directly in private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

A White House official declined to specify the size of the U.S. stake in Lithium Americas, but said it would be “very small” — less than 10% — and serve as “a cash buffer” for the company. Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.

“We support the project moving forward,” said the White House official, who was granted anonymity in order to talk about a deal that is not yet completed.

“Critical minerals like lithium are very important’ to boost the U.S. economy and restore domestic manufacturing,” the official said, adding: “We’re trying to do this in a way that is fair to the taxpayers. We don’t believe in free money.”

A spokesman for Lithium Americas declined to comment, but the company said in a statement that it is in discussions with DOE and General Motors regarding the DOE loan.

“The topics of these discussions include certain conditions precedent to draw on the DOE Loan and associated loan specifics, as well as incremental requests from the DOE for potential further conditions” to gain access to the loan, the statement said.

Jim Cain, a GM spokesman, said Friday the company remains “confident in the project” but declined to comment on ongoing negotiations.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial to building a domestic supply chain to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics. It also represents a rare point of agreement between Trump and former President Joe Biden. Both Republicans and Democrats support the mine project as a way to boost American critical minerals production and cut reliance on China, the world’s largest lithium processor.

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

Environmental groups and leaders of three tribes spent years fighting the mine, which they say borders the sacred site of a massacre of more than two dozen Native Americans in 1865.

The DOE under Biden backed the project as a way to help mitigate climate change by speeding the shift away from fossil fuels.

Trump has aggressively moved away from confronting climate change, labeling it “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world” in a speech this week at the United Nations. “If you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,” Trump told world leaders on Tuesday.

The bid to boost the lithium project comes as the pace of U.S. electric vehicle sales has slowed as the industry struggles to attract mainstream buyers who remain concerned about charging infrastructure and affordability.

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption. The massive tax law approved this summer phases out federal incentives for new and used EV purchases, effective at the end of the month.

Consumers rushed to dealer lots this quarter to take advantage of the credits before the phase-out takes effect. The credits have saved car buyers up to $7,500 off the cost of their EV.

Without the incentives, many automakers will struggle to make sales.

Besides batteries for cars, cell phones and other electronics, lithium is also used in the manufacture of glass, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Lithium batteries are also used to store wind and solar power.

So once we're past this tax credit, pull out your crystal ball, what what what do you think the EV market looks like ahead, Kevin?
Uh California is one we've been watching, accounting for about 30% of EV sales last year.
and there have been talk that they would be replacing the tax credit themselves, but recently it just came out that they're not going to be replacing that tax credit.
Yeah, so there is a used EV tax credit.","Well, August saw the highest sales of electric vehicles this year, up 19.4% from July and since January EV sales are up 61%, but some industry analysts fear those high voltage sales could be short circuited after tax credits for EV buyers expire on September 30th. Join me now is Kevin Roberts, Carguru's Director of Economic and Market Intelligence. Kevin, good to see you as always. Uh maybe start big picture, Kevin, you know, what is the story with tax credits? They've they've boosted sales so much.

Kevin, why are they going away? Explain that for us. And have folks been, you know, have you seen them rushing in ahead of that deadline?

Yeah, so as part of the big beautiful bill, uh the expiration of the tax credits was pulled ahead to September 30th. and once that was announced, we really started to see the momentum start to pick up from consumers looking to get ahead of that tax credit expiration. So that's both on the purchase of vehicles and also it's helping on EV leasing as well. So, uh we've been I I've been calling it a EV crescendo uh as consumers really look to get ahead of uh get their sales in uh before that credit expires.

And Kevin, you know, um we did see Tesla update its website, um saying, you know, order by September 30th. This included even a a countdown clock on the site. Kevin, how are how are some of the other auto makers? Do we know? Do we have line of sight there? How are they trying to kind of build awareness, get people in the door in the showroom?

Well, I mean, I can say from our data, you can see that the sales rate has picked up. and not only that, the amount of, you know, the number of EVs on dealer lots has been declining and the market day supply has dropped quite significantly. Uh from where we were, you know, at the end of June, 108 days supply and now we're under 45 days supply. So, the message is clearly getting out to consumers and they're looking to kind of snap up those EVs before that credit expires.

So now bottom line, Kevin. So, you know, now let's let's look ahead. So once we're past this tax credit, pull out your crystal ball, what what what do you think the EV market looks like ahead, Kevin? What what would you expect to see?

So, it's it's unknown. I I've been taking a look at what happened in other markets where tax credits expired. If you look to Europe, you know, you saw double digit declines uh of EV sales afterwards. Uh California is one we've been watching, accounting for about 30% of EV sales last year. and there have been talk that they would be replacing the tax credit themselves, but recently it just came out that they're not going to be replacing that tax credit. So a large EV market that we could be seeing uh a drop in sales volume in.

Are there certain EV names, Kevin, EV makers that in your opinion, hey, these guys, they they may be better positioned than others in a sort of a post- tax credit world.

So, normally, I would have assumed that automakers might be looking to plug the gap themselves, but we're in a post- tariff environment and that tariff tax bill they're currently consuming most of themselves right now. So I don't know how much automakers are going to be able to really kind of foot the bill uh as those EV tax credits go away.

And and Kevin, by the way, what what does the the used market for EVs look like? You have line of sight there?

Yeah, so there is a used EV tax credit. It's for vehicles under $25,000. So we've been seeing an acceleration in that market as well. Not as much as what we've been seeing in the new vehicle market, but there has been an uptick uh in that used EV market and we've been seeing a lot more used EVs particularly get under that $25,000 threshold. And so it's a small but growing market.

We've been talking here about EV's, but let's kind of like broaden out this discussion a bit. Look at that larger car market, uh Kevin, so gas, hybrid vehicles. I saw a JD Power site is saying, um, they think sales is expected to actually contract in September. Do you agree with that, Kevin? And if so, is that, what would be the reasons for that? Is that just high higher rates, higher prices, both?

I I mean, we've been seen almost a pull ahead in vehicle sales the past couple months. We saw that at the end of March, early April when the tariffs were first announced, there was a lot of kind of looking to get ahead of those pre-tariff prices. Uh we saw, you know, an acceleration of sales in July and August as well, um as consumers, you know, didn't see prices increase and were looking to get out there as well. So, there is a concern about potential pull ahead of sales volume. Uh but when and where that might strike is a little bit uncertain at this point.

Kevin, you you mentioned tariffs, just want to end here on that. Um, and just your sense of how they factor into this discussion because you have trade agreements, frameworks with the UK, EU, Japan. I mean, they they do provide for this um, the 15% tariffs. Is that in your opinion, Kevin, is that a, is that manageable for the industry?

So, we've already been seeing automakers uh absorb a lot more of the tariff costs than what I initially expected. I think most people were initially expecting. We can see with trade data, the tariff rates are there and the tariffs are taking effect. Uh so the trade deals that are going to be announced will help to kind of bring down that rate. uh and will provide more room for automakers to potentially absorb those tariff costs for a longer period of time than what we might have initially thought when the tariffs were initially brought out in March.

The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of President Donald Trump's administration intervening directly in private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

A White House official declined to specify the size of the U.S. stake in Lithium Americas, but said it would be ""very small"" — less than 10% — and serve as ""a cash buffer"" for the company. Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.

“We support the project moving forward,'' said the White House official, who was granted anonymity in order to talk about a deal that is not yet completed.

“Critical minerals like lithium are very important' to boost the U.S. economy and restore domestic manufacturing,"" the official said, adding: “We're trying to do this in a way that is fair to the taxpayers. We don't believe in free money.”

A spokesman for Lithium Americas declined to comment, but the company said in a statement that it is in discussions with DOE and General Motors regarding the DOE loan.

“The topics of these discussions include certain conditions precedent to draw on the DOE Loan and associated loan specifics, as well as incremental requests from the DOE for potential further conditions” to gain access to the loan, the statement said.

Jim Cain, a GM spokesman, said Friday the company remains “confident in the project” but declined to comment on ongoing negotiations.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial to building a domestic supply chain to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics. It also represents a rare point of agreement between Trump and former President Joe Biden. Both Republicans and Democrats support the mine project as a way to boost American critical minerals production and cut reliance on China, the world’s largest lithium processor.

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

Environmental groups and leaders of three tribes spent years fighting the mine, which they say borders the sacred site of a massacre of more than two dozen Native Americans in 1865.

The DOE under Biden backed the project as a way to help mitigate climate change by speeding the shift away from fossil fuels.

Trump has aggressively moved away from confronting climate change, labeling it "" the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world "" in a speech this week at the United Nations. ""If you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump told world leaders on Tuesday.

The bid to boost the lithium project comes as the pace of U.S. electric vehicle sales has slowed as the industry struggles to attract mainstream buyers who remain concerned about charging infrastructure and affordability.

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption. The massive tax law approved this summer phases out federal incentives for new and used EV purchases, effective at the end of the month.

Consumers rushed to dealer lots this quarter to take advantage of the credits before the phase-out takes effect. The credits have saved car buyers up to $7,500 off the cost of their EV.

Without the incentives, many automakers will struggle to make sales.

Besides batteries for cars, cell phones and other electronics, lithium is also used in the manufacture of glass, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Lithium batteries are also used to store wind and solar power.

Those provisions are the basis of opposition from Associated Builders and Contractors of Massachusetts, a group of 480 open shop contractors and related businesses.
“We are very aware of the extreme change in the amount of federal funding that is available now,” Murphy said.
“And one thing I just want to say on that is that we should not let the lack of federal funding stop us from implementing these, at the very least, these energy assessments.
And then see where we can actually implement the changes, or where we can get funding from.”","BOSTON – Estimating that the federal government’s turn away from clean energy projects has eliminated at least 20,000 jobs here, organized labor groups on Thursday renewed their push to create more work by requiring energy assessments in public schools and universities across Massachusetts.

Massachusetts AFL-CIO, the Climate Jobs Massachusetts Action coalition and a handful of individual locals were among those who voiced support for a bill (H 3476 / S 2275) that would require energy and air quality audits for public schools, universities and colleges.

The assessments would estimate the costs of energy improvements as well as greenhouse gas reductions that would result if improvements were made, and it would establish a new Healthy and Sustainable Schools Office within the Department of Energy Resources that could implement the recommended changes.

“Let’s identify the oldest boilers, the worst air ducts and crumbling insulation, and let’s fix them with highly-trained workers and responsible contractors that are going to do a clean job and keep costs down. Let’s find the schools that have the greatest potential for solar panels and thermal energy networks, and install high-quality systems that will save districts money over time and get their buildings closer to net zero,” Ryan Murphy, executive director of Climate Jobs Massachusetts Action, said. “These upgrades would save money. More efficient heating systems, combined with generation and heat transfer solutions like solar and geothermal, mean lower bills for schools and less demand on our grid.”

The bill would also require contractors bidding on the work to agree to comply with the prevailing wage law, any project labor agreements and to ensure their workforce includes a minimum number of workers who went through a registered apprenticeship program. Those provisions are the basis of opposition from Associated Builders and Contractors of Massachusetts, a group of 480 open shop contractors and related businesses.

“We certainly support the concept of healthy schools and the work that will be involved to create them, but we do oppose this bill because of some of the requirements that create unreasonable bidding requirements that will limit competition and workforce participation,” association President Greg Beeman told the committee. He added, “This is untenable, and will result in open shops not being able to bid on this work, reducing the overall number of bidders.”

Murphy told the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy that clean energy projects “unfortunately, have been hit hard by recent federal government decisions” and estimated that the federal government “has killed at least 20,000 planned clean energy jobs here in Massachusetts so far.” He and Chrissy Lynch, president of the Massachusetts AFL-CIO, pitched the energy audit bill as a way to replace those job opportunities.

“We do not have a worker shortage in our energy unions. We have a high-quality job site shortage,” Lynch said. “This bill would put energy workers back to work and allow training centers to take in more apprentices.”

The Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy Committee advanced a redraft of the legislation last session as part of a larger bill that focused on transportation infrastructure. The committee advanced that bill to the House Ways and Means Committee in early April 2024, and it advanced no further, according to a committee summary of the latest version.

Co-chair Sen. Michael Barrett asked Murphy and Lynch about the bill’s proposed funding mechanism. The bill simply directs the state to “appropriate funds to a revolving fund to finance activities authorized under this act” and to “apply for, receive, and accept funding from local and federal sources.”

“The one area of resistance we always get in this general domain is if we’re imposing unfunded mandates,” Barrett said.

Murphy said the Healthy and Sustainable Schools Office created under the bill would “search for or collect the available funding, whether through federal grants or state funding that might be available” and mentioned revenues from the state’s surtax on higher-income households as one potential source.

“We are very aware of the extreme change in the amount of federal funding that is available now,” Murphy said. “And one thing I just want to say on that is that we should not let the lack of federal funding stop us from implementing these, at the very least, these energy assessments. And then see where we can actually implement the changes, or where we can get funding from.”",https://i0.wp.com/atholdailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/56b26f64-da4c-4778-af22-6dd98245bc7a.jpg?fit=750%2C500&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-26 18:01:42.914681

Industry groups warn of job losses in the tens of thousands if sales falter, echoing sentiments in Pickup Truck Talk.","As the federal electric-vehicle tax credit hurtles toward its expiration on September 30, 2025, dealerships across the U.S. are witnessing an unprecedented surge in sales. Buyers are scrambling to secure rebates of up to $7,500 on new EVs and $4,000 on used ones, a policy originally enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act but now curtailed by recent legislative changes. This deadline has transformed showrooms into bustling hubs, with inventory depleting faster than anticipated, according to reports from industry analysts.

The rush isn’t just anecdotal; data from automakers like Tesla and Ford indicate a spike in orders, with some models selling out weeks ahead of schedule. This phenomenon echoes past incentive phaseouts, but the scale here is amplified by years of pent-up demand fostered by the credit itself. Yet, beneath the frenzy lies a deeper question: Could this short-term boom inadvertently lay the groundwork for sustained EV growth without government subsidies?

The Surge and Its Immediate Effects

Analysts at NerdWallet note that the credit’s end marks a pivotal shift, potentially pricing out budget-conscious consumers who relied on it to make EVs affordable. In states like California and New York, where adoption rates are highest, the loss could lead to a temporary dip in sales, with projections from the Internal Revenue Service suggesting a 20% to 30% drop in the immediate post-deadline period.

However, the current buying spree is flooding roads with more electric vehicles than ever, which could create a self-reinforcing cycle. As per insights from GeekWire, this influx might accelerate infrastructure development, from charging stations to grid enhancements, as municipalities respond to heightened demand. Industry insiders argue that the sheer volume of new EV owners will generate organic advocacy through word-of-mouth and real-world demonstrations of the technology’s viability.

Irony in the Incentive’s Demise

Ironically, the rebate’s expiration could force manufacturers to innovate more aggressively on cost reduction, a point emphasized in recent coverage by Detroit Free Press. Without the crutch of federal aid, companies like General Motors and Rivian are already pivoting toward cheaper battery chemistries and streamlined production, aiming to compete on price alone. This mirrors historical patterns in consumer electronics, where subsidies kickstarted markets that later thrived independently.

Posts on X (formerly Twitter) reflect a mixed sentiment among users, with some lamenting the end of rebates as a blow to affordability, while others highlight how the rush is exposing more drivers to EVs’ benefits, potentially normalizing them in everyday use. For instance, discussions point to a 15% headwind in sales for 2025 but underscore long-term resilience through technological advancements.

Global Comparisons and Domestic Ripples

Looking abroad, Canada’s experience offers a cautionary yet optimistic parallel. As detailed in Electric Autonomy, provinces like Quebec have doubled down on incentives, sustaining growth, while others scaling back saw initial slumps followed by rebounds driven by private investment. In the U.S., similar dynamics are at play, with states like Texas and Florida poised for losses in the billions, according to The News Wheel, yet this could spur localized policies to fill the void.

The broader economic implications extend to jobs and supply chains. Experts cited in CBT News warn of potential disruptions in manufacturing, but they also predict that the rebate-fueled boom will leave a legacy of skilled workers and established factories, reducing dependency on imports from China.

Long-Term Adoption Catalysts

Delving deeper, the irony highlighted by GeekWire centers on behavioral economics: The deadline creates a sense of urgency that not only boosts immediate adoption but also builds a critical mass of users who influence peers. Surveys from Cox Automotive, referenced in X discussions, show dealer expectations dipping short-term but rebounding as EVs prove their worth in fuel savings and performance.

Moreover, environmental advocates argue that this shift tests the market’s maturity. With falling battery costs—down 80% since 2010, per Kiplinger—EVs are nearing price parity with gas vehicles, potentially rendering subsidies obsolete. The rush might thus serve as a bridge to a subsidy-free era, where innovation and consumer preference drive growth.

Challenges Ahead for the Industry

Still, challenges loom. The IRS’s recent clarification, as reported by NPR, allows some flexibility for deals in progress, but post-September, affordability barriers could widen disparities, particularly in rural areas with sparse charging networks. Industry groups warn of job losses in the tens of thousands if sales falter, echoing sentiments in Pickup Truck Talk.

Yet, optimists point to Singapore’s model, where rebate extensions, as covered in The Straits Times, have sustained momentum without full reliance on incentives. In the U.S., this could translate to hybrid strategies blending private incentives with public infrastructure pushes.

A Pivotal Moment for Electric Mobility

Ultimately, the end of the EV rebate represents a litmus test for the sector’s resilience. As AInvest analysis suggests, while it reverses a decade of momentum, the last-minute rush might inject enough vehicles into the ecosystem to tip the scales toward widespread acceptance. For insiders, the key will be monitoring how automakers adapt, from Tesla’s energy storage pivot amid sales headwinds—noted in X posts—to legacy players like Ford doubling down on affordable models.

This transition, fraught with uncertainty, could redefine electric mobility, proving that sometimes, the removal of a safety net forces the industry to soar on its own merits. As one analyst put it, the rebate’s sunset might just herald a brighter dawn for EVs.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-8033c0b4-2ad8-4fb9-a049-c8f531fa4615.jpeg,N,,2025-09-26 18:02:51.539133

But those tactics don’t lower utility bills or build durable political coalitions. And now, amidst a radical shift in U.S. politics where the economy dominates, there’s a growing call for a pragmatic reset.

This week, we dissect two critiques of climate politics. In a Bloomberg essay, Michael Liebreich argues it’s time to ditch the guilt and doom, stop chasing impossible targets, and focus on fast, affordable progress. Alex Trembath of the Breakthrough Institute says the “climate hawk” is an endangered species in U.S. politics.

We’ll walk through their arguments, and debate what a reset in climate politics and policy might look like.

Plus, another reset in finance. Generate Capital and Greenbacker, two of the most important clean energy investors, are both under new leadership. Both companies are re-evaluating their approaches to the market. What do these shakeups say about the state of climate capital and the “missing middle” of projects that still struggle to get financing?

Stephen Lacey: When is your birthday actually?

Jigar Shah: It’s August 30th, but we had this party last year and people really liked it, so we did it again this year and it was even better.

Katherine Hamilton: You’re so lucky that you have a birthday in a nice month.

Jigar Shah: It is true.

Katherine Hamilton: My birthday is the middle of February and nobody celebrates my birthday.

Jigar Shah: Oh, well, now we’re going to have to make it our mission to celebrate your birthday.

Stephen Lacey: Well, good. I’m glad you were out last night, Jigar, because the later you stay out, the punchier you are, so…

Jigar Shah: Oh, no. Not good.

Stephen Lacey: Good entertainment value.

From Latitude Media, this is Open Circuit. This week, do we need a climate reset? For the last decade and a half, the loudest voices in the climate movement treated decarbonization kind of like a moral crusade. Ban gas stoves, declare emergencies, punish fossil fuel companies. But those tactics don’t lower utility bills or win durable majorities. And now, amidst a radical shift in US politics, there’s a growing call for a pragmatic reset. We’re going to look at some of the critiques and ideas for shifting strategy, plus we’re going to talk about another reset, this one in finance, Generate Capital and Greenbacker are two of the most important clean energy investors, have swapped out CEOs and they’re rethinking their strategies. What is behind the shakeup?

I’m Stephen Lacey, executive editor of Latitude Media. Welcome, all. As always, Katherine Hamilton and Jigar Shah by my side, well, virtually by my side, I guess, staring at me through a computer screen. Katherine Hamilton is the chair of 38 North Solutions. Hey there.

Katherine Hamilton: Hey.

Stephen Lacey: You’ve got some really interesting tools behind you. It looks like you’re, I don’t know, in a shaker village or something.

Katherine Hamilton: I always think it looks like a Game of Thrones, some chamber. Yeah, I put a lot of found objects in my house.

Stephen Lacey: Nice. Where do you go find those?

Katherine Hamilton: Tool sheds on my property.

Stephen Lacey: Well, you’re not at Climate Week, but it sounded like a busy week for you. You ventured down from the mountains into the city.

Katherine Hamilton: I did very briefly, but I was so jealous because I kept seeing all the cool reports coming out of Climate Week where y’all were.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, big week. Always a big week. Jigar Shah is the co-founder of Multiplier. He’s the former director of DOE’s Loan Programs Office. How is New York Climate Week this year, Jigar? It’s often called like a mini-cop because you’ve got tens of thousands of people flocking to the city, you’ve got the UN General Assembly. Did it feel any different than past years, given the political circumstances?

Jigar Shah: Yeah, I do think people are very hopeful. I think they’re probably mistaking that for defiant. When I talk to people, the level of clarity around what they want to invest in and what gives them the most sort of confidence in this moment seems lacking. And so there was a lot of great conversations around where the federal nexus is and where you can actually continue to deploy at scale and some of the things that are going on around us, like the governors who all gave big speeches at the PJM Conference on Monday. And so I think there’s a lot of those conversations. I’d say that there were less international conversations, the rooms that I were in, but it was great.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, it kind of depends on the room you’re in because you can have a choose your own adventure experience at New York Climate Week. You can go to lots of events around solutions, infrastructure, energy. A lot of the stuff that we talk about here, you could follow along with the formal UN process where countries this year were handing in their pledges late. You can get as doomery as you want too. You can go to events like the Make Billionaires Pay March that happened this week that kind of blended a coalition of anti-ICE, anti-capitalism, pro-Palestinian, and anti-fossil fuel activism. That always feels a little confusing to me. And so that actually is a good backdrop for what I want to talk about today. There’s this growing set of critiques around pieces of the climate movement and calls for a reset in how we negotiate around climate policy and actually message around this stuff.

So I want to talk about that. That’s a big part of the conversation. But I want to turn first to a story unfolding in the world of clean energy finance, a shakeup of sorts. Two of the leading firms, Generate Capital and Greenbacker have new CEOs, and they’re pledging strategic redirection. Generate is also reportedly discussing an IPO, perhaps as a new way to raise capital. Jigar co-founded Generate. And we’ve been talking about this and he says that the changes that these two companies reflect some signs of challenges in the market. Let’s start with these two firms, Jigar. Why do they matter? What is the background on how they were structured?

Jigar Shah: Yeah, it’s a good question and maybe on the outset, we should start with the fact that these companies have raised a lot of money and that money has been deployed into projects and those projects generate cash flows. So neither one of the companies is on the verge of bankruptcy or anything like that. They’re making money, people are getting paid. All of that stuff is occurring. But when you look at investment firms, they really are defined by their ability to raise more money. And right now, both of them are having a hard time raising more money. And so to get to your question, Greenbacker was created because there seemed to be a hole in the marketplace for an ability for retail investors to invest in clean energy. There were a lot of people who were banks or pension funds who could invest in renewable energy. But if you wanted to put $50,000 of your own money into something and just get a 6% dividend yield back, there was not a lot of options.

And so you had to be what they call an accredited investor to invest in clean energy. And so most people are not accredited, which is generally having a 2 to $3 million net worth, including your home value. So the way that Greenbacker did that was they filed with the SEC as if they were going public, but they never actually listed on an exchange. And so your shares are not easily traded every day. It’s not on the stock market, but you’ve gone through an SEC approval process such that you can market to retail investors. And then with Generate Capital, there was a recognition that when you have a standard GP/LP structure, general partner, limited partner structure, that you have to tell the limited partners exactly how you’re going to invest that money before they give it to you. It’s really detailed.

And in the clean energy space, being that detailed is very hard because the market changes every year. And so getting yourself the ultimate flexibility to be able to do these kinds of investments is very hard within that structure. So Generate decided to become a C corp. So in Generate’s case, all of the investors are just shareholders of Generate Capital, and that money, within reason, can be used for any purposes that Generate deems in the company’s interest. And the board, which is made up of the investors, can obviously fire the CEO or tell you you want to do something different or whatever it is. But day to day, they don’t give you detailed instructions on how to invest the money.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, Jigar. So I’m curious about Generate, because I know when you were there, you spoke a lot about the investments in fuel cells and anaerobic digesters and a bunch of other project finance that seemed really smart and seemed to really scale a lot of technologies that were working. They just needed project finance. And I just wonder how our current climate and the policy direction that our country’s been going and if that has changed how they’ve invested or if they’ve kind of stuck to what you had originally started doing.

Jigar Shah: Yeah, no, that’s a good question. And so maybe to think about when you have a company like Generate Capital, you can imagine if you invest in things that are fairly low risk that everybody is doing, then the returns are also lower. And then when you want to pay everybody’s salaries who work at the company, there’s not much left over to give back to investors. So you need higher returns. And the way that we got higher returns was to invest in leading-edge technologies. You tried to avoid bleeding-edge technologies, but you tried to be on the leading-edge. Those are people who really couldn’t get money from traditional sources of capital because like we discussed before, it wasn’t in their mandate.

So think anaerobic digesters, think battery storage, when we funded STEM back in 2014, 2015, there were a lot of different asset classes that we can go through. But part of that is also representing those asset classes into other conversations. So like with fuel cells for instance, they qualified for a 30% tax credit, but you could imagine none of the traditional tax credit investors wanted to do tax equity for fuel cells. So it took me two years to get the fuel cell companies to get tier one tax equity providers to even pay attention to them.

And as a result, Generate was able to invest at a rate that was a much higher rate of return upfront. We took the risk that we could find a tax credit buyer, and when we did, the returns that we were left with were much higher because tax equity comes in at a pretty low cost of capital. And what we were left with had a much higher cost of capital than expected, similar to anaerobic digesters where you had to figure out the renewable natural gas marketplace and the California low carbon fuel standard credits and all of this complexity. And so the question becomes, first of all, who should figure out this complexity for brand new business models? And then once you’ve figured out that complexity, can you hand it off to lower risk capital? Because when you do that, then the assets that you’re holding become even more valuable.

Stephen Lacey: Okay. So that’s really helpful background. So why are we talking about these two firms? David Crane, the former CEO of NRG, undersecretary of infrastructure at DOE when you were there, is now taking over as CEO. Greenbacker just announced a new CEO as well, Daniel de Boer, the former head of infrastructure at the firm. Both of these moves are framed as responding to a rapidly evolving market, which is often code for market pressures. Translate this for us.

Jigar Shah: So in Greenbacker’s case, they plodded along for a long time. So they were raising $10 million a month, $5 million a month. So they weren’t raising big dollars. But they made the mistake of wanting to invest in low-risk assets, so think solar and wind assets. And then by the time you paid for all the salaries at the senior level, they really could only pay a 3%, 3.5% return. But instead of telling their investors that, what they did was when solar comes back with money, they come back both in principle and in debt. So you might get 10% of your money back every year, some of which is paying back the mortgage, and some of which is the interest on the mortgage. And so if you’re paying people a 6% dividend yield out of that 10%, well, then that means you don’t have a lot left over to invest in new projects. So that means that over time, you just get smaller and smaller and smaller.

And then around 2020 with the ESG boom, they went to Morgan Stanley and Morgan Stanley just put a huge amount of money behind them. So I think it was maybe 2 or $3 billion that came in in a very short period of time and they figured out how to put it to work. Obviously, it took a little bit of time, but they also did, I think, a really large project with Hecate. And so they’re now in the process of getting that done. So Dan has come in really just to get them fixed up, like what’s working, what’s not working, which projects were maintained properly, which ones weren’t. But the fundamentals of Greenbacker are still flawed because if you actually are promising investors 6% returns, you have, let’s call it 3% of the returns that have to go to pay everybody’s salaries, well, then you need to make 9% to actually stay breakeven. And that doesn’t come from low-risk solar and wind assets.

So they recently wrote down their portfolio by 30%. So that means if it was worth 2 billion before, it’s now worth 1.4 billion. And they have to decide can they go out and raise more money? But you can imagine that one of the roles that they’re playing even in the solar and wind space is to do weird, funky stuff. So if somebody was doing a one-off wind turbine in the back of their factory, which we saw in California for years, or if people are doing new models of community solar that tried to work closely with environmental justice groups or whatever, then you can imagine very large sophisticated buyers of those assets might be like, “That’s too one off. We don’t want to deal with that $10 million project.” And so Greenbacker could play that role. But I think after 12 years or so of being in business, they still haven’t really found their way. And so they switched CEOs to try to really fix what’s broken.

Katherine Hamilton: So Daniel de Boer came from their infrastructure arm. So how does that change the way they may be thinking about their portfolio going forward?

Jigar Shah: Yeah, it doesn’t, and that’s what scares me. I think the world of Dan and I think the world of Carl Weatherley-White, who I’ve known for years, who I think has come in as CFO, but the challenge with Greenbacker fundamentally is they have to find ways of doing funky stuff, even if they’re only comfortable with solar and wind, that generates that return, which is the promised return to investors, plus the cost of running the platform. And if they can’t do that, then they’re constantly giving people money back that actually was slated to be reinvested into new projects. And so then that means that you’re not long for the world. And so I think in this moment where we’re trying to grow the market for clean energy, there is a mainstream set of boxes. So as you know, whether it’s Brookfield or an Exterra or all these other big players who buy projects, they have very sophisticated boxes and they want 100 pieces of paper that proves that you’ve done this and proves that you’ve done that, and et cetera, et cetera.

And if you’re not that person, if you’re not a developer that can give them 100 pieces of paper or it’s not cost-effective for you to put it together because your project is $10 million and 100 pieces of paper might cost $1 million to put together, then where do you go for alternative financing? And to date, it’s been family offices maybe or other people. And those people are like, “Well, I can put my money anywhere, so I think I’m going to put it over here where I can make a lot more than over here.” And so that’s why we had the GGRF, which is now obviously not in existence. And so when you think about the total amount of financing solutions that our country needs to be able to onboard all of this extraordinary effort that developers are putting forward to get to churches, to get food banks done, to get fire stations, solar systems, to get police officers what they need. Whatever it is that people are doing with this great technology we’ve invented, there has to be an appropriate investor available for them to go to.

Stephen Lacey: And can you go into a little bit more detail about what has been plaguing Generate and how that compares to Greenbacker’s challenges?

Jigar Shah: So Greenbacker never tried to do leading-edge stuff. Generate really was very successful at doing leading-edge stuff. So when you think about all the anaerobic digesters they funded, they just reopened the Cayuga facility in New York, which is the largest food waste digester that processes food waste there. I just heard that they process a lot of White Claws that were mislabeled and had to be crushed. And so there is hundreds of thousands-

Stephen Lacey: Is that White Claw, the alcoholic seltzer?

Jigar Shah: Exactly, exactly. So when I was at Generate, we used to take all the ice cream from Unilever’s facilities. They’d always have a bad batch of ice cream and then they’d have to get rid of it. And for these food companies-

Stephen Lacey: You’ve got White Claws and ice cream. Perfect for your birthday party.

Jigar Shah: That’s what we do. So there are hundreds of thousands of tons of this food waste. So most the time, the plant is running great, but one batch goes bad, what do you do with it? And for a lot of these large corporations, they’ve committed to scope two and scope three emissions reductions. And so putting food waste in landfills, which then release methane is not good for them. So they needed a place for it to get processed. And so we put in money into a bunch of facilities and there was London, Ontario, and then there was the UK and other places, and I think they probably put a couple hundred million dollars to work into what they did. Those made very, very nice returns. I think that’s great.

But over time, what happened was they ended up with 38 people in their capital markets team and their capital markets team went out to the marketplace and said, “Hey, we have all this stuff to sell.” And the people that they went to said, “Well, that’s interesting, but what we really would love is boring community solar.” And so Generate said, “Well, maybe we should do more boring community solar.”, which they did, which is great, but then they don’t get 16 to 18% returns on boring community solar. So they did some funky financial stuff, which is fine. Lots of people do that. I think it was well within the risk tolerance, and then interest rates started going up, and when interest rates started going up, your equity returns go down because the debt actually takes more of the return.

And so now, Generate Capital has made far lower returns on low-risk assets than they made on their higher-risk, higher-reward assets. And so as a result, they’ve had a really hard time raising money the last two years because people are like, “Well, you’ve invested in low-risk stuff and haven’t given us high returns, and so why would we give you more money?” And so it’s one of those things where I think that the difficulty of the business model was the point. And when their capital markets group, which got very bloated, decided that they wanted to do easier stuff and they wanted to raise money for easier stuff, well, then they didn’t meet the returns.

Stephen Lacey: So does this mean, given the changes of focus at these two companies, that we are going to see capital limitations in the market?

Jigar Shah: Yeah, most certainly. Right? And that’s why you-

Stephen Lacey: How acute are those capital limitations?

Jigar Shah: Well, you saw that Chris Anderson of TED Fame announced a big conference. Well, he announced a big fund, a $300 million fund for doing this missing middle stuff. And then he announced a big conference, I think he’s doing this weekend in California to try to get people focused on putting more money into this missing middle. But it’s a big deal. When you think about the Loan Programs Office, we probably had $350 billion or so of unprocessed loans that were submitted to Loan Programs Office for review. But when I left, so those projects are presumably real that folks were seeking debt for. And then you have all the folks who are looking for grants out of the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations or the MASC office or the Great Deployment Office or others.

And so when you think about the quantum of capital at writ large that people want for all of these sectors and clean cement and clean steel and heat batteries, and you tell me which sector, but there’s tons of them, it’s at least $100 billion if not more. And if you count up Wollemi and Spring Lane and Ultra and a few other folks, that’s maybe a billion. And so it’s not even close to the need that we have. And so all these companies have done this extraordinary work of getting through venture rounds and getting to their first of a kind project and all this other stuff, and now we need them to be part of the gigaton scale climate reductions and they’re under capitalized.

Stephen Lacey: This is an indication of why this sector is so difficult. If we continue to have trouble funding this missing middle and we have these capital constraints, what does that mean for overall carbon reduction goals and thinking about these critical sectors?

Jigar Shah: So right now, people are talking about China being the electrostate, right? But let’s be clear about what they’re really doing. They’ve scaled up solar, they’ve scaled up lithium-ion batteries and LFP batteries. They have scaled up nuclear plant deployments. These are all technologies that were shared with the Chinese during the Obama administration. And so we’re talking about electrostate technology scale up of stuff that was shared with them during the Obama administration. Now that’s awesome, and we are going to continue to grow around the world and China is selling some of those equipment to Ethiopia and Pakistan and lots of places around the world. But at some point, we’re going to need to move to heat and we’re going to have to move to clean steel and we’re going to have to move to clean cement. And you know who’s not doing that right now? China. And so the real question is when and where are all of these technologies going to scale up?

And I’m hopeful that the UK gets there with the National Wealth Fund or GB Energy. I’m hopeful that the EU figures out what it wants to do with its policies or Australia. I saw Saul Griffith this week and near Climate Week, and he’s trying to get people there. They want to do green iron because Australia is known for just selling rocks and they want to do more value added work on the continent. So making lithium processing a priority or making green iron or whatever it is. But those technology companies are all in the United States. And so the question is that do they want to scale up here? Do they want to go to Australia to scale up? Are they going to just give their technology away in bankruptcy to China? Exactly how do we roll out the next generation of decarbonization technologies, which were probably admittedly 10 years away from really getting scaled up?

Stephen Lacey: All right, let’s turn now to our main story. I think it’s the perfect time to stocktake, as the UN climate parlance goes, on how we’re talking about climate, what the climate movement looks like and pathways forward in the current environment. And to kick off our next segment, I want to play a piece of tape from Donald Trump giving his speech this week to the UN General Assembly in New York. And this was happening right as tens of thousands of people were convening around the city for Climate Week.

Donald Trump: But we’re not letting this happen in America. In 1982, the executive director of the United Nations Environmental Program predicted that by the year 2000, climate change would cause a global catastrophe. He said that it will be irreversible as any nuclear holocaust would be. This is what they said at the United Nations. What happened? Here we are. Another UN official stated in 1989 that within a decade, entire nations could be wiped off the map by global warming. Not happening. It used to be global cooling. If you look back years ago in the 1920s and the 1930s, they said, “Global cooling will kill the world. We have to do something.” Then they said, “Global warming will kill the world.” But then it started getting cooler.

So now they just call it climate change because that way, they can’t miss. It’s climate change because if it goes higher or lower, whatever the hell happens, there’s climate change. It’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world in my opinion. Climate change, no matter what happens, you’re involved in that. No more global warming, no more global cooling. All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong. They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.

Stephen Lacey: I wanted to hear that tape for a couple reasons. One, I don’t think you could ask for a more direct example of how dark and twisted the politics of climate are right now in America at the highest levels. But two, Trump is hinting at something that reflects an actual critique of a very vocal contingency, the doomers. And since the 2010s, the loudest message from progressive groups pushing policy action on climate change has been focused on worst case scenarios. And out of that, a deeply moral approach to policy advocacy. And that approach, at least among the most visible climate organizations, groups like the Sunrise Movement, 350.org, Greta Thunberg’s FridaysForFuture, the Extinction Rebellion, meant that for them, the only reasonable option was blocking fossil fuels, creating radical and social equity, and pushing this narrative that we add only 10 years to avert catastrophic impacts.

And if Donald Trump’s speech at the UN tells us anything, it’s that that strategy didn’t work. And I’m certainly not suggesting that you can draw a straight line between the election of Trump and the failure of the climate movement. Of course not. But they’re actually not that far from each other. Trump was elected in part because voters felt like they had felt like the left had abandoned kitchen table economic issues in favor of other causes, and they weren’t focused enough on solving problems. I think that is an important factor in the last election. And instead of building this kind of durable majority that activists thought they were, they were often alienating voters who have increasingly been worried about paying rent, affording gas, keeping the lights on. And this is where the idea of this pragmatic reset comes in.

Michael Liebreich has a really phenomenal essay in Bloomberg, this two-part essay. And in it, he argues that we need to stop making people feel guilty, stop obsessing over the climate apocalypse, and take a much more pragmatic approach to the framework for how we talk about and present climate change and the actual climate talks themselves. And Alex Trembath from the Breakthrough Institute had an essay out earlier this year where he argued that the era of the Climate Hawk is over. And he also argues that centering politics around existential threats and moral urgency has polarized the issue and hitched climate to progressive identity politics. And so I think this is just a really interesting time to grapple with this question. Do we need a complete reset on climate, both in coalition building and in policy? And I’ll turn to you first, Katherine. What do you think of, how do you buy the critique that I just outlined?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, I’ve thought a lot about this because I listened to Liebreich, both his part one and part two of his essay, which part one tried to say, “Here’s the math we got to use to think of what’s next.” And then part two is like, “Here are the things we need to actually do for a reset.” And I also started thinking about what was happening in New York with all of the protesters, with people protesting a number of things. It wasn’t just one thing. And my sensibility has always been you need people on both sides to get to the middle. So it’s great that there’s a pragmatic approach that you can take, and we should go through and dissect what that is and what that might look like. But I don’t think you get there unless you have the left flank as well and have that pushing so that you have a middle.

Because right now, you have a president who’s out there claiming that climate is a total hoax, you have the left trying to demonstrate against a wide variety of things because there is a lot going on right now that people are protesting, and then the pragmatic approach is coming to the middle. And I think you have to have both sides to be able to come into the middle. So I think Liebreich is not wrong that this is a good time to think about that because we need to come together with what are some pragmatic solutions? That’s a good thing to think through, but you don’t get to a negotiation and a middle unless you have both sides to push back on. So for me, that’s the setup.

Stephen Lacey: I generally agree with that. I guess the question is how it filters into politics. The Democratic Party itself has a really deep problem, and many Americans felt like the Democratic Party had aligned way too closely with this progressive social agenda and rather than these kitchen table issues. And so to me, it depends on how folks who are focused on climate on the left align with the activist agenda.

Katherine Hamilton: I actually think that’s an issue of narrative and messaging because if you look at all of the bills that passed, that were essentially climate bills that passed during the Biden administration, the CHIPS Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the Infrastructure bill, those were all really pragmatic solutions that dealt with kitchen table issues. But that was not what the narrative was. And I think that’s where things failed because that’s not… The narrative should have been super inclusive about this is actually going to affect your price of eggs. And now we’re seeing that happen. You take the stuff away, it is going to impact everything in your life and the affordability issues. But I think that a lot of that was not about the actual content, but about the narrative and messaging.

Stephen Lacey: Definitely. Yeah, Jigar, what do you make of the premise?

Jigar Shah: Yeah, I tend to agree with Katherine as we’ve talked about, I think on our collective podcast for 10 plus years. I think that-

Stephen Lacey: Agree meaning that you need that flank?

Jigar Shah: Well, I’ll give you an example that’s extreme. I’ve never criticized Mark Jacobson over his a hundred percent wind, solar, and hydro thing, even though I know that it’s completely freaking impossible to do anything that he’s suggesting. But there’s a lot of people who are inspired by his work, and that’s how we got a lot of the renewable portfolio standards passed at the state level. And so do I need to come out and slay his message? No. But in closed doors, I’m telling people we need a lot of clean firm power generation. And so that includes nuclear and includes geothermal, it includes other stuff. So I think the part that all these Monday morning quarterbacks misunderstand is getting to 48 votes in the Senate for the Inflation Reduction Act was virtually impossible. I think people don’t understand how diverse the Democratic Party is broadly and how important the left flank was to get Sheldon Whitehouse and Bernie Sanders to agree on something.

And so yes, they fell short of 50, they only got 48. And then you had a very pragmatic negotiation that didn’t include the environmental groups or other left flank folks from January of 2022 through August of 2022, that was only Joe Manchin, and to some degree, Kyrsten Sinema. And they passed the bill that, as Katherine suggested, was really damn pragmatic. But I just think that people don’t understand how politics works. They just want to Monday morning quarterback the narrative at the end. And look, Donald Trump has been a master of narrative. Look, I don’t love that he’s a master of the narrative, but he is. And Biden in particular was not. He certainly wasn’t doing press releases every day and press conferences every day and all the things that a president frankly has to do because while I loved Secretary Granholm, she is no stand-in for the President of the United States. And so that narrative just didn’t get done because Joe Biden wasn’t giving it.

So I just think that some of this stuff is a little too much. That being said, we’ve always agreed with these two pieces on balance within our podcast. The notion that you were going to go to the American people and say, “This is only going to cost you a little bit more, but we’re going to save the planet.” was always a terrible narrative. It was terrible for Waxman-Markey and it’s terrible now. And it doesn’t have to be the case because we have all of these extraordinary technologies that actually are the most affordable way to meet this load growth moment in this particular case and the fastest way to meet this load growth moment in this particular way.

And so we don’t have to sacrifice. For the first time in my entire career, there is no sacrifice needed. You get the most affordable solution and the fastest solution. And that should be celebrated. And I think that to Katherine’s point, the left and the doomers played some role in getting the urgency there. And all of us technocrats had a very important role in actually doing the work to get the technologies lined up and the money in there and projects built on Walmart stores and whatever it is that got the cost down.

Stephen Lacey: Katherine, how do you think the progressive climate activist wing influenced policy headed toward the IRA? In 2018, the Sunrise Movement broke out with this congressional sit-in, AOC came and visited them and praised them. There was this viral moment where they were all holding up their green jobs for everyone now signs and AOC sort of gave them the momentum they needed, and the Sunrise Movement eventually became a very influential student-led group. And the argument was that they really did create, they forced Pelosi and others to start talking about climate change in the 2018-2019 era that eventually led to the negotiations around the IRA. Is that accurate to you?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, I think it did really stress the urgency and also showed that there were young people who really cared and cared enough to go and try to meet with her and to make a point of it. Of course, in the end, they were not completely happy with what the outcome was. But that may have never been the case, but it did raise it as an issue, and it was something that had been percolating since Waxman-Markey had failed in favor of healthcare during the Obama administration. And that was probably the right choice. Everybody needs healthcare, so maybe that was the right choice, but the tactics had changed and also the energy had changed around it.

So I think it was really important that they did that and that they kept the pressure on because that forced the discussion. And maybe everybody didn’t get what they wanted out of the bill, but it definitely led, I think, to climate action. And I also think there are provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act that may not have happened without those folks like low-income adders and being able to focus on communities that most need the help. I don’t know that any of that would’ve happened without that pressure.

Jigar Shah: Yeah. One other thing I would say is that as somebody who has been on boards of environmental groups and other things for a long time, we are in a weird place right now, right? Because the cleantech sector has really abrogated its entire responsibility in developing its own political infrastructure. We sort of put together CEA and then AWEA and then that became ACP, but we were really borrowing the political infrastructure from the environmental groups for many, many years. So when you think about whipping votes in state legislatures or whipping votes in the federal government and in Congress, a lot of those were environmental folks who had been around for a long time, and then they had C3 organizations and C4 organizations that could lobby and all these other things. And so it’s only now that the cleantech sector is actually recognizing that borrowing the environmental group’s political infrastructure is probably not the right call.

And in some ways, I think that’s probably what Alex Trembath is really suggesting is that the cleantech sector is sort of saying that we’re in lockstep with the environmental groups, which is not always a good thing. And frankly, probably 40% of the cleantech sector’s employees voted for Trump. And so it’s not really the right methodology by which to get our stuff done. And so now you see the cleantech sector actually building its own political rails and funding its own candidates and putting all these things together and the environmental groups are going to have to figure out what it wants to do because it’s not clear to me that being pro stuff is what the environmental groups do.

In general, they raise a lot of money when they’re against stuff. That’s what activates their base. That’s how they get lots of $50 donations, is PFAS, and figuring out how to shut down coal plants, and doing all this other stuff. Building tons of batteries and solar, it’s hard for them to raise money on that stuff. And so I think part of our challenge is they have frankly been big warriors and they’ve been doing things that I’m not sure was part of necessarily their business model because the cleantech sector wasn’t doing it. Now the cleantech sector has decided it should do it, and I think we’ll be better off for the environmental groups pushing what they care about and the cleantech sector pushing what they care about.

Stephen Lacey: I want to dissect Alex Trembath’s argument quickly. So his argument is that climate hawkism failed politically. That for more than a decade, climate hawks and activists tried to put this existential threat and moral urgency at the center of politics, and that they want attention but not durable majorities. And that climate has never cracked the top tier of voter priorities, that the efforts to raise salience actually polarized the issue instead of broadening support. And then the path forward is this pragmatism we’ve been talking about, which is climate change is of course real and serious, but it’s best addressed indirectly by focusing on things that people care about, like energy abundance, affordability, resilience, innovation, and that climate outcomes should be more of a co-benefit, not the centerpiece. What do you make of his critique of climate hawkism specifically?

Jigar Shah: The thing that I worry about with that entire line of argumentation is it just feels like pontification by Monday morning quarterbacks. For folks who actually have to lift heavyweights all the way up the mountain and actually get stuff done, that is not how anything works. Going into the middle and saying, “We’re not going to talk about climate. We’re only going to talk about the benefits of our technology, and we’re just going to be a pro-technology argument, and we just want R&D and we just want innovation.” That’s why we’re 20 years behind. This is the Bjorn Lomborg crap that we’ve been dealing with for a long time, which is that the technologies aren’t ready to deploy at scale. Let’s keep investing in R&D. And it turned out that investing heavily into the deployment of technologies is what dropped the costs so precipitously. It wasn’t more R&D. More R&D is also always welcome. But what we want to do is actually get people to deploy stuff at scale.

Now, the question becomes can you get people to deploy stuff at scale while staying completely under the radar screen and not using climate as an argument? Which is kind of what Alex is saying. I don’t know. How did that work out for nuclear power? Not very well. And so now, the Trump administration is weaponizing nuclear power and maybe they’ll get 10 AP1000s under construction, maybe not. But when you think about how nuclear power has tried to stay under the radar screen since 2008, and very few of them have actually gotten deployed, it didn’t work that well. I think that some of the things that we do, you can say is a hype cycle within the capitalist system, too much money going into AI, but before too much money going into hydrogen or whatever it is.

And some of it is actually supported by the fact that climate hawks were the ones who convinced the capitalists that this was a hype cycle and that they should dump a bunch of money into it. And so I just think that he gets too cute by saying that I want this part of the menu, but not this part of the menu. And I think we would’ve had the exact same results technologically and crowding and capital and all that stuff if we just had done the stuff that fits my gluten-free vegan, sort of like [inaudible 00:43:49].

Katherine Hamilton: Hey, don’t knock gluten-free.

Stephen Lacey: I think we’re about to test it right now. No one is talking about climate, and we are going to see how the conversation progresses, given that people are going to be talking about affordability, reliability, resilience, and so all the things that-

Jigar Shah: No, that’s not a test.

Stephen Lacey: Why is it not a test? It’s-

Jigar Shah: Because remember, what I’m claiming is that we would not be in this situation where all of our technologies are fully affordable and we can get away with just the affordability message if we had not participated in climate hawkism the last 10 or 20 years.

Stephen Lacey: But you don’t think that the business community would’ve just innovated anyway? That there’s a contingency of entrepreneurs and investors who wouldn’t have been driving it forward without that messaging?

Katherine Hamilton: Oh, yeah. Who got all the regulation in place for tailpipe emissions and power plant emissions? If we hadn’t had the climate hawks, that wouldn’t have happened, and that opened up markets for clean energy. So that actually created the space for these new technologies to be able to pencil out. So I absolutely disagree with that premise. I also think there are voters who are single-issue voters. So I just don’t think it’s true that people are only going to vote on affordability. Maybe that’s the bulk right now. But there are climate voters. Just as there are pro-choice voters, there are people that that is their only issue that they care about, and I don’t think that that will necessarily change.

Now, some of the things, if you think of it like, “Oh, I’m just going to have a rational read of what Alex Trembath says, which by the way, if you read it, you’ll get very… And if you care about climate, you’ll get emotional reading it. So the best way to do it is to get ChatGPT to just summarize it because then it’s very dispassionate and it takes all of the tone that he loves to use out of it. But he’s saying that climate hawk era is over, that climate should be de-centered politically, but politics has room for a lot of issues as I just said. There are a lot of people who vote for a number of things, and climate mitigation can be a very happy side effect of driving down affordability and increasing jobs as Jigar has talked about forever. And then critiquing all the climate targets. Well, if you don’t have climate targets, what are you working for? What are you working toward?

And so it’s important for everybody to have a goal, even if it’s something you’re not going to be able to meet, you have a goal and you take steps to get there. And then this cultural backlash, making it a cultural issue is really tough because there are only certain people who want it to be a cultural issue. If you can de-culturize it and just have it be about the health and well-being of humans on this planet, I think you’ll be able to still make your arguments and still move ahead even if you just care about climate.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, but the climate activists marching at Climate Week are leaning into the culture wars. They’re making it about everything, every social justice issue possible, and I just do not see how that is at all a winning message in this current environment. And I think if Democrats take their cues from that or people who are generally supporting climate policy regardless of which party they’re in, if anyone is taking cues from that, it will not land.

Jigar Shah: Sure. But remember, at Charlie Kirk’s funeral, the president said that, “I actually hate my opponents.” versus other people. So you have culture wars on that side, which I don’t think other people should be participating in. Look, the fact that people do and say things that I don’t think is fully reasoned through your lens and my lens doesn’t mean that I hate them for expressing their free speech rights. And I just think that people don’t… Look, the weird thing is about Alex, is that I’ve probably been the most effective communicator of eco modernism without believing in it of anybody in the entire 25-year history of his institution. And so I only use economic messages or pollution messages or other stuff because it works for me in the companies that I work with and the technologies I’m putting forward. But to not recognize how the actual political process works and not how moments get created and how things become memes and things become viral like Greta, do I wish Greta never existed? Of course I don’t. Like, oh, my goodness.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, I’m certainly not saying that.

Jigar Shah: No, but that is kind of what he’s saying. He’s saying, “I wish that this had never been politicized. I wish that these people had never actually broken through. I wish that these things were just completely dispassionate.” I get it. We all wish that we just lived lives of quiet-like amplitude, but that’s not the world we live in. We agreed for social media companies to exist. Now, you’ve got all this screaming going on on Facebook or on Twitter or on Bluesky or whatever it is. We live in the world we’re in, and the notion that people are like, “Gosh, I wish everyone was as boring as I am.” No. No, no, no. That is not the world we live in. And so I don’t know why I want to engage in something that just is nonsensical.

Stephen Lacey: I think it’s a really helpful conversation. I don’t think it’s nonsensical. I think it’s the perfect time to be having this conversation. So let’s go into some of Liebreich’s other views on what this pragmatic climate reset looks like. Katherine, what are some others that resonated with you?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, I’ll tick down… He had eight things that he wants to reset on and we can dive into any of these, but resetting climate politics, we’ve talked about that. How do you get to the center on the politics without guilt-based messaging? Sure, let’s do better messaging. Resetting climate targets, he says they should be more reasonable. You got to have climate targets, so figure out what those are. Reset energy priorities. So he’s allow for some flexible gas plants so that you can at least use those for peaking and not for baseload, and you don’t have a bunch of stranded assets. He isn’t saying you need to not do renewables. I think he’s just saying to be a little more flexible. Reset hydrogen expectations. If two people are trying to decide whether to invest in hydrogen, just send Michael Liebreich into the room who will say, he will say, “This was the stupidest idea in stupidville.” Which is exactly what he said in that article. He hates hydrogen so much. Reset diplomacy, and we may want to talk about that and dig into the COPs and how do those work.

And reset science scenarios. He has some arguments about how some of those are outdated and need to be re-upped. That would be great if we can all get on the same page on that. The US right now is not in the mood to do that, but that would be great to do. Reset finance and ESG to sort of take ESGs not as a separate piece of the puzzle, but as part of the full financial system. And also make governments be more in charge of regulation. Unfortunately, right now, our government is not doing that. And then reset policy and regulation to try to have more of a value for money test where the value is in the climate reduction. These all seem really rational, pragmatic ideas. The issue is like how do we then execute on those?

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, I thought he has really good ideas for how to change the climate negotiations process, which is really relevant, given the UN assembly this week. There were a couple of ideas that stood out to me. One was basically shrink the circus of climate talks, hold it with a much smaller number of people, focus on concrete deals in very specific industries like in steel, cement, shipping, energy. Don’t try to hash out these economy-wide, one-size-fits-all targets. Take the land use and agriculture piece and forestry out of the conversation and make it its own convention because the politics and culture of land are so much different than many of the other industrial conversations.

And then really revisit this idea of loss and damages. He argues that it doesn’t make sense to create a duplicate aid system where losses from specific climate events can’t be clearly tied with emissions, with scientific certainty, and that there’s a lot of energy that goes into that system that doesn’t make sense. And I think that clearly paring down these negotiations and making them about very specific deals in specific industries really resonates with me. Jigar, were there any that stood out to you of how to change the way we’re engaging in this negotiations process?

Jigar Shah: I don’t know that I had a lot of great insights on the negotiation process, but I totally agree with the circus. Honestly, I haven’t gone to a cop since I was forced to when I ran the [inaudible 00:53:07] and good riddance, the Biden administration tried to get me to go to COPs, and I was like, “Hell no.” I don’t know why I would go. Because this is the thing, I totally agree. I’m not a negotiator. I don’t know that I necessarily even care about the text that’s coming out of the negotiations. I’m pretty sure I’ve never really read an article in the last 10 years around what’s happening in the text and what’s happening in this and that and whatever. I think in general, it is orthogonal to what I’m doing on the cleantech side.

I totally agree with Michael, which is that these processes, which are deeply consultive and very difficult diplomatic efforts are really valuable on land use. Just so important. When you think about what we do with the rainforest or palm oil in Indonesia or some of these other things that are occurring, even in the United States, when you think about what’s happening under our current administration, I do think that our protection of land is going down in a really big way. And I do think that that conversation matters a lot. And so I hope that they take him up on that offer. I think the other challenge you have, and agree with him on the loss and damage piece, is that it is most certainly the case that we are changing the way that the globe operates, whether it’s weather patterns or sea level rise or other things. And there are going to be places around the world that are less and less habitable. Even in the United States, you can’t even get home insurance anymore in the state of Florida.

And so you’re in this weird spot where we need real solutions to these challenges. And just having a transfer of money from the United States to XYZ country doesn’t solve the underlying problem, which is around insurance and how insurance markets work. We had this conversation a little bit with our friend from JPMorgan where I was like, “Well, if these are all these issues, why are you not sending a letter to all of the homeowners saying your house is definitely going to be a problem in seven years?” And she’s like, “Well, I haven’t gotten permission to do that yet.” I get it. But I just think that there’s a way to have these conversations and a way to have a positive influence on reducing the worst possible impacts on humans around the world. And I don’t think that that comes through in any way that is actionable through the current COP process.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, and the funds that have been set up have just been absolutely unworkable. You talk to any developing country. And the definition of developing country may need to be shifted a little bit as well, but those countries are not getting what they need and in the format that they need it. So they’re saying, a lot of smaller countries are saying, “Yeah, we would love to be able to build clean resources. We can’t build any resources right now because the fund doesn’t work for us.” So trying to figure out how to restructure that in a way that’s really workable, it’s caused a lot of people a lot of gray hair. But I think that’s something that would be really important. And Liebreich says countries should be focused on their own decarbonization and their own economic growth and benefit. Well, maybe if developing countries did that and put some muscle into it, then they would have the extra cash to be able to help to both be a leader and innovate, but also to have some extra funds to be able to show the pathway for countries that don’t have the resources that they need.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah. He basically argues that we should get rid of that entire rich-poor framework because as he argues, that many developing countries, they have skyscrapers, space programs, global companies, wealthy elites, and meanwhile, these supposedly rich countries are still full of people with stagnant wages, living in a cost-of-living crisis. And the best thing, as you said, Katherine, that we can do is having rich countries lead by example and that decarbonize their own economies while preserving standards of living. And he says I think, “If they fail at home, then no amount of climate finance will matter abroad.” And I generally agree with that.

Jigar Shah: Just to be clear though, Stephen, I don’t think the vast majority of the world believes in that, even though I think they need to make that shift. I’m a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute. They have all these people who focus on blended finance and climate finance and all this stuff. It’s been something that people worked on for 20 years. Part of why I joined as a senior fellow is to convince people that frankly, mainstream capital flows are flowing at such large rates right now that it dwarfs blended finance.

When you think about what happened in Pakistan the last two years, not a single drop of blended finance or climate finance or development bank finance went into Pakistan. All of that money was for-profit money, all of it for the last two years. And so you’re just starting to see that as Katherine’s suggesting, that a lot of these well-intentioned programs just have not worked. They have not crowded in other capital, they have not done the skills transfer that I think people expected them to do. And so at some point, we just have to throw out things that didn’t work.

Stephen Lacey: Okay. So imagine you are a young person looking at how they can make the biggest impact right now. Could be in activism, could be in business, could be anywhere. What do you think would be the highest impact way they could spend their time on something climate related? Katherine, where would you devote your focus?

Katherine Hamilton: It’s such a funny question because at Cornell, that’s exactly what they asked me. And they had students from every type of school, every discipline, and I kind of said, “Do what you do from where you are. There are a bunch of you that are engineers, engineer. There’re a bunch of you that are scientists and researchers, do that. There’s some of you who are communications people, focus on the narrative.” Or writers writing to me is the biggest, best skill you can have. But really, you can get to it from wherever you are, find your pathway from what you love and what you’re good at. So I know that’s not a definitive answer, but I think it’s something that I can’t say to everybody, “Do policy.” That’s not right for everybody.

Jigar Shah: So I think I use the same exact answer that Katherine uses when I get asked that question. But I think maybe to give you an answer from a slightly different perspective, look, I think that there has been a 30 or 40-year effort to solve problems that are really thorny by throwing money at the problem. And I, for a long time, didn’t think that worked. But now, I definitively know that it doesn’t work. And we need to be raising a group of children today that can rethink how we accomplish our goals. That whatever discipline they want to come at it from, it can’t just be throwing money at the problem. You can’t just raise taxes more and say, “Now, this time, it’ll solve it.” Whether it’s childcare or healthcare or energy policy or climate policy or whatever it is, it can’t just be, “Here’s another feed in tariff at 47 cents a kilowatt-hour.” Or “Here’s another thing.”

It has to be, what is it at the core of our systems are holding back the ability for us to innovate within the current system? And I think that we, particularly in the West, have this ability to rise to the occasion in this moment and figure it out. I don’t want to have a top-down state like China, right? I respect China greatly, they do their thing, they have had a tremendous amount of a success in building nuclear plants, building hydro dams, whatever. I think that the way in which they accomplish that are not the trade-offs that I would want to be in that society under. I think the West has to figure out what that more balanced approach looks like. Climate happens to be the area that I’m focused on. So then there’s labor and justice and some of these other things, but I think that this is a universal problem where we’ve been thinking in a group way for 40 years and we have to break out of it.

Stephen Lacey: Those are both good answers. To get more specific, if someone who was say interested in activism or politics, creating political change, were to ask me that question, I would say find a way to do serious on-the-ground work. Find a way to make your work about influencing planning boards, zoning boards, all the local politics of building clean energy and sustainable infrastructure, because we have a deep local problem when it comes to building an energy infrastructure. And you can sort of raise awareness about climate change all you want, but if people are continually resisting this stuff, if local regulatory boards are not finding ways to build this stuff, it doesn’t matter how you talk about it, it’s just not going to get built. And more and more projects are getting caught up in this web of resistance on the local level, even among communities that theoretically should support it. And I think it’s just a growing and deep problem. And that’s where I would say is focus your attention on solving that problem.

Jigar Shah: And I think that that is still related though to the systems issue. To Katherine’s point, when you think about writing and how important writing is, we’ve lost all of our local journalism. No one’s holding a city of 3,000 people accountable for their actions. So those people can do whatever the hell they want to do. And so even if the climate solution that we’re proposing is half the price of the old solution, they’re like, “Well, but the old solution is run by my cousin and so we’re going to do it that way.” I just think that when you think about what is broken at the local level, is that the best ideas are not the ones that actually get to the top. That there’s just so much embedded resistance to change because people are like, “But that person’s been running that dealership for 40 years and he doesn’t want to add electric vehicle repair technicians.” Or whatever it is. It’s one of those things where we have somehow gotten just so sclerotic.

Stephen Lacey: Well, I think we can wrap it there. This was a good one, I think a long overdue conversation, the right week to have this conversation. Jigar, good to see you. Thanks for joining us the night after your birthday. I’m saying that with air quotes. Appreciate you doing this after a late night.

Jigar Shah: Well, I’m glad to do it, and I just want to make sure everybody recognizes that I’m still as optimistic as ever. The fact that there are no trade-offs today and that we are now the cheapest solution and the fastest solution gives me great hope that I think that this is our time.

Stephen Lacey: Absolutely. And Katherine, I know you are working on this also every day with Common Charge and thinking about how to frame this in ways that are really relevant to people’s lives, so keep at it.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-09-26T110045.891.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 20:01:01.586398

International Rescue Committee CEO David Miliband, who reported losing $600 million in U.S. grants, said aid is being spread too thin.","NEW YORK (AP) — A passing comment in a hotel hallway at one of the many conferences on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly’s annual high-level meetings this past week may have turned into a solution.

A global antipoverty nonprofit executive, recently returned from Zambia, mentioned that a hospital there had just one incubator, warmer and resuscitator for the fifty-some babies born daily.

The conversation could’ve ended there with an empathetic response. But in this case, leaders of a corporate-nonprofit alliance providing medical equipment to those in need heard the story. And in this case, Children International President Susana Eshleman said help may come by year’s end.

“It’s very encouraging and inspiring to be here,” she said. “It feels like a shot in the arm sometimes when the work that we’re doing is hard and the global situation, given all the recent developments, is particularly hard.”

In a year marked by significant foreign aid pullbacks from the U.S. and other wealthy countries, the exchange provides a glimpse into the unique connective tissue that still draws foundations, nonprofits, corporations and international actors to what attendees call UNGA week.

The meetings at Manhattan ballrooms and intimate townhouse dinners solidify relationships and hasten coordination, made even more impactful by the sheer number of parties. This year, attendees described more pragmatic, focused and galvanizing discussions than before, placing a greater emphasis on the roles companies and philanthropies must play in shaping an uncertain future.

Conversations, in private and on stages, would generally open with the impact of aid cuts on a particular organization, but quickly move to the group’s pivots and current needs. Former President Bill Clinton began the Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting with a list of the world’s issues currently worrying him. But he ended it with the message: “Be caught trying.”

Big philanthropy embraces partners outside of government

Philanthropists’ interest in engaging with the private sector was evident in some of the heaviest hitters’ announcements.

At his global forum on Wednesday in The Plaza Hotel, billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg unveiled a new partnership with the African Development Bank Group to bring more investment to the continent.

“There’s certainly no shortage of challenges to discuss over there,” said Bloomberg, referencing the U.N. headquarters. “But the truth is, in a world that’s more interconnected and fast-moving than ever, the biggest problems can’t be solved by national governments alone.”

At the Clinton Global Initiative, which retooled this year’s meeting to focus on working groups, ballrooms across the New York Hilton Midtown were packed with hundreds of front line workers, policy experts, foundation donors and NGO representatives divided into groups of 10 to discuss specific problems and potential solutions.

The working groups yielded numerous new initiatives, ranging from a social enterprise fund from Kiva Microfunds alongside corporate foundations to a new Global Network for National Service.

At Rockefeller Foundation headquarters, former heads of state, major foundations’ leaders and global health experts gathered around a table Monday to reimagine international development systems weakened by foreign aid cuts.

The Rockefeller Foundation committed $50 million to the effort. Rajiv Shah, the foundation’s president, said that includes upgrading a critical famine early warning system, created by the U.S. Agency for International Development, and diversifying its financing so no one political party can take it away.

The Clinton Health Access Initiative announced its partnership with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Unitaid, and Wits RHI to provide Gilead Sciences’ HIV prevention drug lenacapavir in 120 low- and middle-income countries. The Gates Foundation announced a similar deal with Indian pharmaceutical manufacturer Hetero Labs.

Bill Gates also announced the foundation would pledge $912 million to the Global Fund’s replenishment campaign to fight AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.

But, for all the talk of non-governmental funders’ importance, philanthropic leaders emphasized they cannot do it alone. Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said he hopes their commitment to the Global Fund spurs the U.S. and other countries to step up.

“There is no possible way any philanthropy, any combination of philanthropies, can fill the gap,” Suzman said Wednesday.

International Rescue Committee CEO David Miliband, who reported losing $600 million in U.S. grants, said aid is being spread too thin. He called on his sector to more effectively deliver assistance with new technologies and find alternative financing streams.

“We’ve got to embrace innovation. And we’ve got to persuade newly wealthy countries — like those in the Gulf would be one example — that there’s a real potential to have lifelong impact on the people we’re helping,” Miliband said. “And we also have to appeal to philanthropy in the countries where we’re working.”

Nonprofits hit Manhattan with new energy after setbacks

Whether they work in health, climate, migration or any other issue facing funding setbacks, nonprofit leaders reported a different feel to this year’s programming.

Conversations carried a heightened urgency and like-minded groups were forced to better coordinate their goals. Some advocates trod lightly between rallying their cause and avoiding any missteps that might suggest opposition to U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. Concerns about obtaining visas prompted some to travel with fewer staff than usual.

There was real worry that “we wouldn’t have UNGA,” according to USA for UNHCR Executive Director Suzanne Ehlers.

Her nonprofit had already begun developing a $15 million campaign to fund refugee women’s scholarships. But with everything “thrown up in the air,” she said, many questioned the point of coming.

“And here we are,” said Ehlers, who announced the campaign this week. “It’s actually more consequential than ever, I would say.”

The challenge is identifying who has financial resources in this new aid landscape, said Charity Wallace, a past adviser to former first lady Laura Bush. Her consulting firm, Wallace Global Impact, focuses on cross-sector solutions to world problems.

“Frankly, some people bemoan, as if it was still February and we wish that USAID still existed,” said Wallace, adding that many now see “they have to step up in a different way” in this different reality.

Matt Freeman, executive director of Stronger Foundations for Nutrition, said previous UNGA weeks have been filled with concurrent events where advocates fight for the same limited audience. He sensed a stronger spirit of collective action this year.

“That’s been really heartwarming,” he said. “Because you could imagine in a moment of scarcity that everyone’s elbows become sharper and they’re fighting for the pie.”

Kitty van der Heijden, the deputy executive director of partnerships at the United Nations Children’s Fund, said her week on the sidelines had been a mix of disappointment and excitement. She said UNICEF, which faces at least a 20% cut in revenue next year, will cut staff and look for other ways to save money.

On one hand, she said there was both “withdrawal from governments” and “depression” the state of the multilateral system. On the other hand, she said she saw many philanthropic and private sector actors “really trying to lead now in difficult times.”

“I have no time for depression,” she added. “I only have time to build more partnerships, to be out there, to deliver, because I know that we can. And we cannot do it alone.”

Utility-scale storage leads the charge Most of that Q2 growth came from utility-scale projects, which added 4.9 GW – enough to power 3.7 million homes during peak demand.
The Southwest Power Pool, which hadn’t seen new battery storage projects in three years, saw a comeback with three installations in Oklahoma.
“Energy storage is being quickly deployed to strengthen our grid as demand for power surges and is helping to drive down energy prices for American families and businesses,” said Noah Roberts, ACP’s vice president of energy storage.
“After 2025, utility-scale storage projects must comply with new, stringent battery sourcing requirements to receive the ITC,” Weis said.","The US battery storage market just had its biggest quarter ever. In Q2 2025, a record 5.6 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity came online, according to the latest US Energy Storage Monitor report from the American Clean Power Association (ACP) and Wood Mackenzie.

Utility-scale storage leads the charge

Most of that Q2 growth came from utility-scale projects, which added 4.9 GW – enough to power 3.7 million homes during peak demand. As electricity demand climbs and prices rise, more states are turning to large-scale batteries to keep the grid stable and affordable.

Texas, California, and Arizona each added more than 1 GW of new capacity. The Southwest Power Pool, which hadn’t seen new battery storage projects in three years, saw a comeback with three installations in Oklahoma. Meanwhile, Florida and Georgia are now forecast to deploy more storage than expected after major new procurements by utilities.

“Energy storage is being quickly deployed to strengthen our grid as demand for power surges and is helping to drive down energy prices for American families and businesses,” said Noah Roberts, ACP’s vice president of energy storage. “Despite regulatory uncertainty, the industry is on track to produce enough grid batteries in US factories to meet 100% domestic demand.”

Home batteries are booming

The residential battery storage market also surged, adding 608 megawatts (MW) in Q2, up 132% year-over-year and 8% from Q1. California, Arizona, and Illinois led the growth as more homeowners paired batteries with rooftop solar and adopted higher-capacity systems.

CCI market grows slowly

The community, commercial, and industrial (CCI) segment grew by a smaller 38 MW, up 11% year-over-year. California and New York made up more than 70% of Q2’s CCI capacity, while Illinois gained ground. But community-scale storage remains limited due to high costs and policy barriers.

Outlook: Resilient growth, but headwinds ahead

The ACP/Wood Mac report forecasts 87.8 GW of US storage by 2029, with residential and utility-scale projects in the lead. But growth could dip 10% in 2027 as new federal rules take effect on where battery cells can be sourced.

“Pricing and FEOC [Foreign Entity of Concern] uncertainty, and slow community storage development are expected to limit CCI growth below 1 GW by 2029,” said Allison Feeney, a research analyst at Wood Mackenzie. She added that residential storage will likely outpace solar thanks to strong incentives, especially in markets like California and Puerto Rico.

Allison Weis, Wood Mackenzie’s global head of storage, said Trump’s big bill act preserved the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for batteries, but stricter sourcing rules after 2025 could reduce the five-year outlook by 16.5 GW.

“After 2025, utility-scale storage projects must comply with new, stringent battery sourcing requirements to receive the ITC,” Weis said. “While domestic supply is ramping up, shortages are possible, and developers may still rely on Chinese cells to fill gaps.”

The report warns that projects failing to hit certain milestones by the end of 2025 could face new permitting and regulatory risks, underscoring the urgency to build now under current rules.

On the same day, McLean County in central Illinois got a similar letter recalling federal funding awarded last year to help design a final 9-mile segment of a bike and pedestrian trail along Route 66.","CHICAGO (AP) — President Donald Trump's transportation department has been pulling back grants already announced for recreational trails and bicycle lanes, telling local officials their projects fail to promote road capacity or are “hostile to motor vehicles.”

The department recently sent letters to local governments in at least six states — Alabama, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Mexico — informing them it was withdrawing money awarded under the $1.1 trillion infrastructure law former President Joe Biden signed in 2021.

The reversals are among the clearest signals yet of the drastic shift from the Biden administration's emphasis on alternative transportation, such as transit and biking, to the Trump administration's focus on preserving and expanding lanes for cars and trucks.

While the new grants Trump's transportation department announced this year reflect that change, it's practically unprecedented for an administration to claw back grants awarded by a predecessor without a compelling reason, such as potential environmental harms. However, the latest recalled projects didn't have fully funded grant agreements in place, which would have made reversing them far trickier.

The transportation department's press office didn't respond to emails requesting comment.

Connecticut won a $5.7 million federal grant last summer to help design segments of a 44-mile (71-kilometer) recreational trail connecting several communities along the Naugatuck River.

Rick Dunne, executive director of the Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments, said the grant’s final details were being negotiated when the U.S. Department of Transportation sent a letter this month to inform local officials that the project wouldn't move forward. The agency wants “multimodal grant programs” to focus on “projects that promote vehicular travel,” the letter explained.

“They're defining quality of life for Americans as enhancing automobile operations,” Dunne said.

The same reason was given in a letter sent to Albuquerque, New Mexico, pulling $11.5 million in funding for a leg of a rail trail cutting through the city's core. It was among the first active transportation projects awarded under the infrastructure law, with funding announced in 2022, but it was still going through the approval process.

“We are going to stand up for Albuquerque and prevent the Trump Administration from pulling money from a project the people of Albuquerque want,” Mayor Tim Keller said in a press release. “We will see you in court.”

Kevin Mills, vice president of policy for the Rails to Trails Conservancy, called the cuts “an affront to the priorities set by Congress and Americans’ demands for safer, more convenient walking and biking routes.”

DOT also withdrew a $20 million grant awarded in 2022 to transform three streetscapes in Boston. The reversal was based in part on the project's electric vehicle charging stations, which the administration said contradicted its preference for promoting “traditional forms of energy and natural resources,” the Boston Globe reported.

Some of the withdrawn projects were relatively small in dollars and scope but still targeted for reversal due to the department's changing priorities.

One applied to just a single block in San Diego County, California, where the community wanted to test whether it could improve safety without disrupting traffic flow. It sought to employ “creative roadway features” such as roundabouts in place of traffic signals, with plans to expand the approach to other intersections if the model proved successful, said Donna Durckel, spokesperson for the county's Land Use and Environment Group.

But Trump's transportation officials flagged it as “hostile to motor vehicles” in a letter sent Sept. 9 because the project included a so-called road diet that would have reduced the stretch from four lanes to two.

On the same day, McLean County in central Illinois got a similar letter recalling federal funding awarded last year to help design a final 9-mile segment of a bike and pedestrian trail along Route 66. County engineer Jerry Stokes said the project wouldn't affect motor vehicle travel but would promote safety by getting bicyclists and pedestrians off the road.

Yixian Sun highlighted a differing perspective: “I don’t think Chinese actors are unwilling to transfer or share their technologies to their Global South partners.
Echoing Hove’s “co-evolution” framing, Sun said this “shouldn’t be a one-way process where Chinese companies pass know-how to their Global South partners.","In the past decade, China has regularly shattered clean technology records at home. Simultaneously, it has emerged as a major partner for countries of the Global South seeking to boost renewable energy capacity and pursue low-carbon development.

Domestic clean-tech manufacturers have underpinned China’s vast expansions of solar and wind power, battery capacity and electric vehicles (EVs), and they are now increasingly seeking, and finding, new markets overseas. In 2024, exports of these four technologies from China to the regions of the Global South totalled over USD 72 billion, accounting for almost half of all wind, solar and EV exports.

For many countries, these imports have brought a much-needed boost to sustainability efforts, expanding access to electricity and driving booms in renewable capacity. But ambitions among Global South nations to move beyond a trade-only relationship in these goods are being regularly voiced, including in bilateral meetings with Chinese counterparts and in international summits.

The hope is that China can be not just a source of imports for green tech, infrastructure and services, but also a provider of the technology and knowledge that can enable increased manufacturing and innovation within countries’ own borders.

At a diplomatic level, China has long been sensitive to such requests, promoting scholarships to study in China, technical cooperation platforms and “Luban Workshops” for vocational training in partner countries. Expansions of all such initiatives were pledged to nations as China hosted the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organization Plus meeting in Tianjin, for example. But they may not be enough, and such transfer of technology and knowledge is a complex, and often contentious, topic.

During China’s own rapid industrialisation since Reform and Opening Up began in 1978, Chinese companies themselves benefited from exchanges with European and American partners, as well as in the more recent development of its world-leading solar, wind and EV sectors. But analysts have told Dialogue Earth of doubts around the incentives and capacity for China’s green tech giants to share their expertise in the clean energy space. Concerning the Global South, meanwhile, they have highlighted relevant initiatives demonstrating the potential of such transfers, but also raised questions about countries’ capacity and leverage to scale up this engagement.

Defining tech transfer

Technology and knowledge transfer have long been sought by countries of the Global South, but have gained renewed attention as global efforts to build up clean energy capacity have surged. These desires are coalescing with calls from developing countries for Global North, as well as Chinese, partners and investors – often their raw material buyers – to support their industrialisation and moves up value chains.

Recommended

Issues around these transfers from China have been a key point of discussion at recent meetings co-organised by Dialogue Earth. These include a panel event held in Berlin, Germany, alongside the Heinrich Böll Foundation, and an international conference of China researchers, analysts and civil society figures, hosted by the SGAIN project at the University of Bath in England.

“There is no doubt that the sustainability transition of Global South countries will need support from China in terms of both financing and technology cooperation,” Yixian Sun, the SGAIN project’s principal investigator and the Bath conference’s lead organiser, told Dialogue Earth. “Hence, sharing, but more importantly co-developing, knowledge and technologies between China and its southern partners is a necessary step in the global sustainability transition.”

China’s own experience benefitting from such partnerships was highlighted by several attendees at the conference, with BMW’s cooperation with CATL in the early 2010s a prominent example raised by one speaker. CATL is now the world’s largest battery maker.

Anders Hove, a senior research fellow on China at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, described to Dialogue Earth how partnerships with western manufacturers in China’s auto industry “evolved from simple joint venture requirements in the nineties to more sophisticated policies that forced foreign automakers to ensure localisation of core technologies like batteries, electric motors and control systems”.

These exchanges have been a sensitive point in China’s trade relations with the US and the European Union, with allegations that “forced technology transfer” has been demanded of foreign investors – something that China’s 2019 Foreign Investment Law sought to explicitly prohibit.

Rather than a simple “one-way” movement, Hove emphasised that these relationships should be seen as “co-evolution” between partners. He raised the example of the development of China’s solar industry through collaboration with western partners, to now account for over 80% of global manufacturing: “[It] showed how German and American technicians worked with local manufacturers, creating a back-and-forth co-evolution process rather than one-way transfer.”

Hopes and doubts in Southeast Asia

China’s solar industry has emerged at the forefront of its clean-tech manufacturers’ overseas expansion, with significant growth in global exports of panels and other components during the past decade. In recent years, Chinese solar manufacturers have also relocated some of their production, notably to Southeast Asia, helping to establish Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia among the top producers and exporters outside China. These relocations have been widely read as a means for manufacturers to evade US tariffs on Chinese-made solar equipment – a trade that is now severely threatened by the Trump administration.

However, with facilities in Southeast Asia focused largely on final assembly, the extent to which knowledge and technology transfer has taken place in these investments was questioned by experts consulted by Dialogue Earth.

According to Hove, “all the know-how remains in China, all parts come from China, and the whole supply chain is still located there. There’s essentially no knowledge diffusion happening, even though there’s solar manufacturing”.

This was echoed by Jessica Liao, an associate professor at North Carolina State University whose research focuses on Chinese foreign policy and Southeast Asia. She described local capacity-building through investments as “limited”. But she also said that calls for such support have been a “rising priority” among Southeast Asian nations.

Liao pointed to Chinese investments in EV manufacturing in Thailand and the nickel industry in Indonesia as areas in which Southeast Asian countries are hoping for support to move up value chains. Nickel is a crucial component in EV batteries and Indonesia already accounts for nearly half of its global production, but the country is also hoping to establish itself among the world’s leading battery producers. CATL recently broke ground on a USD 6 billion facility in West Java.

However, Liao questioned the potential for transfers to occur in these sectors: “Most of this manufacturing is really not the knowledge- or technology-intensive part of the EV buildup. So, we haven’t seen any clear case where the host countries are benefitting from the more upstream knowledge, the core knowledge of any of those clean-tech industries.”

As the region’s largest market and economy, Indonesia may be better positioned than its Asean neighbours to benefit from these processes, holding, in Liao’s words, “more bargaining power”. She said that Malaysia may also have some advantages due to its manufacturing capacity, skilled workforce, and large Chinese diaspora populations with a history of doing business with China. But, she added, “most Asean countries have a modest market size and a lot of regulatory and institutional barriers, so it’s difficult for a Chinese investor to see to what extent there can be knowledge transfer”.

Lessons from Brazil

As South America’s leading industrial hub and home to a well-established clean energy market, Brazil has been a top destination for Chinese green-tech manufacturers’ overseas expansion – and arguably a frontrunner in knowledge and technology transfer partnerships.

Chinese auto giant BYD, the world’s largest EV maker, recently announced that its first Brazil-made vehicles had rolled off its production line in the north-eastern state of Bahia. Fellow manufacturer Great Wall Motors cut the ribbon on an EV factory in São Paulo in August. One of China’s largest wind turbine manufacturers, Goldwind, has also launched a base in Bahia to assemble in Brazil, which is the world’s fifth largest wind power market.

João Cumarú, a Brazil-China specialist and international advisor at Consorcio Nordeste, a development body for Brazil’s north-east region, told Dialogue Earth that knowledge and technology transfer have emerged as “one of the central pillars of the bilateral agenda”.

“During his last visit to China, President Lula pointed out that investments shouldn’t be only about infrastructure – they also need to include education, technology and training people, so Brazil can strengthen its own value chains,” Cumarú added.

In addition to the existing investments in EV and wind turbine manufacturing, Cumarú said there is “a lot of interest in Chinese expertise with critical minerals, especially in refining and processing”, which could help Brazil take advantage of its own reserves.

Several initiatives to directly foster knowledge and technology transfer in green sectors have already been established between the two countries. Both Cumarú and Sun highlighted the China-Brazil Center for Climate Change and Innovative Energy Technology (CCB) as one example. Created in 2009 via a partnership between the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and Tsinghua University in Beijing, the centre promotes academic exchanges and joint development in bioenergy, solar and wind power, and electricity transmission. Cumarú also spoke of cooperation projects in the agricultural sector and sustainable aviation fuel, as well as CBERS, the decades-old China-Brazil satellite programme.

In Cumarú’s view, effective exchanges in these areas depend on strong government support: “You need stable policies, clear rules on intellectual property and incentives for joint ventures. Mechanisms like the China-Brazil High-Level Coordination Committee can help to set the agenda and make sure things actually move forward.” Finance, too, “is another piece of the puzzle”, and support for such programmes from federal agencies and institutions, such as Brazil’s development bank BNDES, is necessary. “Without resources, cooperation risks staying only on paper.”

Policy signals and preparedness

On the prospects for knowledge and technology transfer between China and Global South countries, experts told Dialogue Earth of barriers in host countries, but also the incentives for Chinese companies, and authorities, to engage.

Recommended

Anders Hove spoke of “concerning signals” in China’s export controls that may limit the potential for exchanges around technologies such as batteries, which he said have been designated as “sensitive technology”. On balance, he said, “It’s more than half dependent on Global South countries developing their own absorptive capacity, but China’s government policies on technology export controls are equally crucial.”

Jessica Liao, meanwhile, highlighted Chinese companies’ motivations: “Their incentive is really not to help the local economy or local industrialists to have the independent capacity to do it … their primary concern is to help solve their domestic overcapacity problem. Why [would] they have any incentives to reproduce all those as surplus in Southeast Asia again?”

Measures such as export controls signal to clean-tech companies that their core technology should “stay home”, Liao added. These companies “walk a tightrope” to balance government support while pursuing their overseas expansion, she said, “aware that this expansion should really just be at the low end of production”.

Yixian Sun highlighted a differing perspective: “I don’t think Chinese actors are unwilling to transfer or share their technologies to their Global South partners. In many cases, they haven’t done so because there are no viable mechanisms for this, with transfer not only too costly in today’s market, but also challenging due to cultural differences.”

Sun, like all other fellow interviewees, spoke of capacity constraints and a lack of coherent strategies in partner countries: “The challenges in many host countries actually lie in the lack of well-designed policies to promote this, as well as the lack of human resources to absorb relevant technological know-how.”

Hove similarly described human resources as an important factor in technology and knowledge transfer: “You can’t put skills and knowledge in a container. Even if there was some textbook or Wikipedia file that could be transferred, that wouldn’t solve the fundamental human resource challenge that developing countries face.”

The potential of overcoming such constraints and creating the environment for these exchanges may be reflected in the experiences of Brazil – though both Sun and Cumarú said tracking concrete initiatives for knowledge and technology transfer is not straightforward, neither is measuring their impact, which tends to occur in the longer term.

Echoing Hove’s “co-evolution” framing, Sun said this “shouldn’t be a one-way process where Chinese companies pass know-how to their Global South partners. Instead, it should be a mutual learning process, where Chinese actors engage with their Southern partners to develop or improve clean technologies”.

The department recently sent letters to local governments in at least six states — Alabama, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Mexico — informing them it was withdrawing money awarded under the $1.1 trillion infrastructure law former President Joe Biden signed in 2021.

The reversals are among the clearest signals yet of the drastic shift from the Biden administration’s emphasis on alternative transportation, such as transit and biking, to the Trump administration’s focus on preserving and expanding lanes for cars and trucks.

While the new grants Trump’s transportation department announced this year reflect that change, it’s practically unprecedented for an administration to claw back grants awarded by a predecessor without a compelling reason, such as potential environmental harms. However, the latest recalled projects didn’t have fully funded grant agreements in place, which would have made reversing them far trickier.

The transportation department’s press office didn’t respond to emails requesting comment.

Prioritizing roads, not trails

Connecticut won a $5.7 million federal grant last summer to help design segments of a 44-mile (71-kilometer) recreational trail connecting several communities along the Naugatuck River.

Rick Dunne, executive director of the Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments, said the grant’s final details were being negotiated when the U.S. Department of Transportation sent a letter this month to inform local officials that the project wouldn’t move forward. The agency wants “multimodal grant programs” to focus on “projects that promote vehicular travel,” the letter explained.

“They’re defining quality of life for Americans as enhancing automobile operations,” Dunne said.

The same reason was given in a letter sent to Albuquerque, New Mexico, pulling $11.5 million in funding for a leg of a rail trail cutting through the city’s core. It was among the first active transportation projects awarded under the infrastructure law, with funding announced in 2022, but it was still going through the approval process.

“We are going to stand up for Albuquerque and prevent the Trump Administration from pulling money from a project the people of Albuquerque want,” Mayor Tim Keller said in a press release. “We will see you in court.”

Kevin Mills, vice president of policy for the Rails to Trails Conservancy, called the cuts “an affront to the priorities set by Congress and Americans’ demands for safer, more convenient walking and biking routes.”

DOT also withdrew a $20 million grant awarded in 2022 to transform three streetscapes in Boston. The reversal was based in part on the project’s electric vehicle charging stations, which the administration said contradicted its preference for promoting “traditional forms of energy and natural resources,” the Boston Globe reported.

No project too small to cut

Some of the withdrawn projects were relatively small in dollars and scope but still targeted for reversal due to the department’s changing priorities.

One applied to just a single block in San Diego County, California, where the community wanted to test whether it could improve safety without disrupting traffic flow. It sought to employ “creative roadway features” such as roundabouts in place of traffic signals, with plans to expand the approach to other intersections if the model proved successful, said Donna Durckel, spokesperson for the county’s Land Use and Environment Group.

But Trump’s transportation officials flagged it as “hostile to motor vehicles” in a letter sent Sept. 9 because the project included a so-called road diet that would have reduced the stretch from four lanes to two.

On the same day, McLean County in central Illinois got a similar letter recalling federal funding awarded last year to help design a final 9-mile segment of a bike and pedestrian trail along Route 66. County engineer Jerry Stokes said the project wouldn’t affect motor vehicle travel but would promote safety by getting bicyclists and pedestrians off the road.

The Powering the Offshore Act Bill-149, introduced on Friday, updates legislation related to offshore wind, tidal energy, and the Nova Scotia-New Brunswick connection.

The act changes three pieces of energy legislation, including the Electricity Act, the Public Utilities Act, and the Marine Renewable Energy Act.

‘We’re unleashing Nova Scotia’s untapped potential to make our province a clean energy and economic powerhouse,” Energy Minister Trevor Boudrau said in the press release. “This means good jobs, stronger communities, and more opportunities right here at home, and it means we can pay for the investments our province needs in areas like healthcare, highways and homes.”

This comes as the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Energy Regulator is starting the first phase of a licensing process to tap into Nova Scotia’s offshore wind to produce 62 gigawatts of clean energy.

“Our goal is to move this along in an appropriate fashion to make sure it’s done right, but certainly our goal is to move it quickly as well,” Boudreau said.

The announcement came nine days after Prime Minister Mark Carney said that Ottawa was prepared to work with Nova Scotia to ramp up its ambitious plans for the so-called Wind West project, which is aimed at providing power to the rest of Atlantic Canada and beyond.

Nova Scotia estimates the initial capital cost of Wind West at around $60 billion. The province said it would expect a 4 per cent royalty from offshore production and is seeking federal investment tax credits and low-interest financing through the Canada Infrastructure Bank.

The province also announced this summer that four offshore areas had been designated for offshore wind development. The areas include French Bank, Middle Bank and Sable Island Bank — all south of Nova Scotia’s Eastern Shore — and Sydney Bight, northeast of Cape Breton.

Holyoke will become the first city in the northeast United States to adopt Veolia’s Hubgrade technology for wastewater treatment, which uses AI-enabled predictive technology, robotics, digital twins and 3D virtual reality systems to analyze system performance. It will recommend operational adjustments to Veolia’s experienced team at the site and the Holyoke Department of Public Works, which can use Hubgrade insights to reduce energy consumption and chemical use, extend the useful life of expensive equipment, and cut costs.

Holyoke Mayor Joshua A. Garcia said: “Holyoke remains committed to pioneering sustainable environmental solutions that support our community’s growth and protect our natural resources. This partnership with Veolia exemplifies our dedication to innovation, efficiency, and environmental stewardship – creating a cleaner, healthier future for all residents.”

David Connors, President of Veolia Municipal Water’s Contract Operations in New England, said: “Veolia applauds the City of Holyoke for selecting Veolia as the best option to help Holyoke transform its wastewater system for greater sustainability, improved performance and future growth. Veolia is indeed the recognized leader in America’s water industry, and as active partners with the communities we serve, we are excited to deploy the Hubgrade technology that will drive ongoing improvements.”

Veolia has served Holyoke since 2005, and the new contract will continue Veolia’s partnership with the City and its Department of Public Works through 2035, with the opportunity for an additional five-year extension. Holyoke’s leadership reached a unanimous decision to maintain the contractual relationship with Veolia following a competitive bid process.

The renewed collaboration between Veolia and Holyoke will see an even greater focus on modernization and operational efficiency – including an enhanced geographic information system to digitize the location of wastewater infrastructure, routine digital camera inspections of the system’s assets, shared energy-saving measures and a new centrifuge that will improve efficiency in hauling costs.

As part of the agreement, Veolia will continue operations and management of the conventional activated sludge plant, capable of treating as much as 17.5 million gallons of wastewater each day. Veolia will also continue to maintain 40 miles of dedicated sewer mains and 77 miles of combined sewer and stormwater mains. The Holyoke system features 13 combined sewer overflow outfalls, three interceptors, and seven remote pumping stations – all of which are held to rigorous regulatory standards by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

Joseph Tackett, CEO of Veolia’s Municipal Water Contract Operations, said: “Partnering with Holyoke’s Department of Public Works on efficient and effective upgrades will help the City fulfill its potential for economic growth and environmental security. We appreciate the committee’s unanimous decision to renew with Veolia and its recognition of our committed staffers who serve the city every day, and we’re grateful for the opportunity to continue proving our commitment to Holyoke’s future.”

Veolia has a long-established reputation for high-quality operation of water and wastewater systems across New England, including facilities in Springfield, Westborough, and Taunton, Massachusetts. Veolia’s service to the region exemplifies its global GreenUp strategy, striving to lead the ecological transformation of the planet by accelerating water quality improvement, hazardous waste treatment and disposal, decarbonization and technological innovation.

State to use $52 million in frozen funds to expand network

Michigan is moving forward with its revised electric vehicle charging plan after receiving federal approval. The US Department of Transportation approved the state’s plan under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, allocating $52 million remaining from an original $110 million. The Trump administration froze the $52 million in February.

One of the biggest challenges for electric vehicles is the limited number of charging stations. Michigan plans to fund a total of 83 stations. Two are already operational and four more are under construction. The rest are still being planned.

General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), a leading U.S. automaker, is making strategic adjustments as it navigates evolving consumer demand and policy changes in the electric vehicle (EV) market.

In early September 2025, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) announced temporary production cuts at its Spring Hill, Tennessee EV plant, halting assembly of Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq SUVs through December and scaling back production into early 2026. The move follows weaker-than-expected demand after the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit at the end of September.

The announcement came shortly after GM reported record U.S. EV sales in August, with over 21,000 units sold across popular models like the Chevy Equinox EV, Cadillac Lyriq, and GMC Sierra EV. While sales momentum has slowed, the corporation remains confident in its long-term EV growth, supported by demand for affordable models such as the Chevy Equinox EV under $35,000 and the upcoming Chevy Bolt EV near $30,000.

Strategically, the firm is bolstering its competitive edge through a partnership with Hyundai to co-develop new vehicles, including compact SUVs, sedans, pickups, and an electric van for North America. The collaboration focuses on shared R&D and sourcing of key materials like batteries and steel to improve efficiency and cost competitiveness, further cementing GM’s place among the best manufacturing stocks to watch in the EV space.

Subsidies helped Chinese EV makers achieve early mass production, invest in R&D, and build domestic brand loyalty.
Chinese EVs, being cost-effective yet feature-packed, are increasingly popular choices for these prize draws.
While Chinese EV prices are likely to remain competitive for the foreseeable future, there are pressures on the horizon.
Chinese electric vehicles are affordable because their manufacturers leverage an exceptionally efficient supply chain, government support, large-scale production, and export-oriented flexibility.","In the last decade, Chinese electric vehicle (EV) brands have transformed from niche market participants into global contenders, disrupting the auto industry with models that cost thousands—sometimes tens of thousands—less than their Western counterparts.

In some markets, Chinese EVs are even priced competitively with used cars, yet they often boast advanced features like autonomous driving assistance, AI-powered infotainment, and rapid-charging battery technology.

If you’ve ever entered a “win a car” giveaway or browsed car competitions online, you may have noticed that Chinese EVs are increasingly showing up as prizes alongside high-end models from Tesla or Volkswagen. That’s no accident—their low cost makes them attractive for both consumers and promotional campaigns. But how exactly can these vehicles be so affordable? The answer lies in China’s unique supply chain ecosystem, strategic government policy, and innovative production methods.

1. Vertical Integration and Supplier Clusters

One of China’s biggest competitive advantages in EV manufacturing is its highly integrated supply chain. In industrial hubs like Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Changzhou, dozens of suppliers for batteries, motors, chips, and even seat upholstery operate within a few miles of each other.

This clustering reduces transportation costs, shortens lead times, and fosters faster communication between manufacturers and parts suppliers. In many cases, the EV manufacturer and its component suppliers share R&D facilities, allowing for synchronized design and production cycles.

By contrast, Western automakers often import parts from multiple countries, which adds shipping costs, tariffs, and weeks—if not months—to production schedules. When your entire supply chain fits into a few industrial parks, economies of scale kick in quickly.

2. Battery Manufacturing at Scale

Batteries are the single most expensive component of an EV, sometimes accounting for 30–40% of total production costs. China is the world leader in battery production, home to giants like CATL and BYD, which supply not only domestic brands but also global automakers like BMW and Tesla.

These battery manufacturers benefit from both vertical integration and massive production volumes, driving down the cost per kilowatt-hour. Additionally, China dominates the global refining of key battery minerals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel. By controlling upstream raw material processing and downstream assembly, Chinese brands keep battery costs significantly lower than their foreign rivals.

3. Government Subsidies and Strategic Policies

For over a decade, the Chinese government has provided generous subsidies to EV manufacturers and consumers. While some of these programs have been scaled back recently, their long-term effects remain. Subsidies helped Chinese EV makers achieve early mass production, invest in R&D, and build domestic brand loyalty.

Furthermore, government-led infrastructure projects—like nationwide high-speed charging networks—reduce the consumer’s “range anxiety,” boosting demand and enabling further economies of scale. Many local governments also offer incentives for companies to set up manufacturing plants, providing cheap land leases, tax breaks, and low-interest loans.

4. Lower Labor and Compliance Costs

China’s labor costs are higher than they were a decade ago, but they are still lower than in Europe, Japan, or the U.S., especially for skilled manufacturing work. Coupled with longer working hours and fewer production bottlenecks, this allows for more flexible and cost-efficient production cycles.

In addition, environmental and regulatory compliance—while tightening in recent years—still imposes lower direct costs on manufacturers than in highly regulated markets like California or the EU.

5. Design-to-Cost Philosophy

Many Chinese EV makers use a “design-to-cost” approach from day one, which means every feature, material, and process is evaluated for its cost-effectiveness before production begins. This doesn’t necessarily mean lower quality—many Chinese EVs now rival or exceed Western models in tech features—but it does mean avoiding costly overengineering in areas the target market doesn’t value.

For example, while a European luxury EV might use premium leather and complex seat adjustment mechanisms, a Chinese brand might use high-quality synthetic materials and simpler mechanisms that still feel premium but cost less to produce.

6. Marketing Through Prize Campaigns

Interestingly, one way these brands expand their reach in foreign markets is by partnering with promotional campaigns, including car competitions and raffles. You’ve probably seen ads where you can “win a campervan” or “win a car” by purchasing tickets or entering a giveaway.

Chinese EVs, being cost-effective yet feature-packed, are increasingly popular choices for these prize draws. For the promoter, it’s a high-value prize that’s more affordable than a European or American equivalent. For the EV manufacturer, it’s free publicity and a way to put more cars on the road, creating organic word-of-mouth marketing.

7. Export-Ready Production Lines

Chinese automakers design their factories with export in mind. Many production lines are flexible enough to produce both left-hand and right-hand drive vehicles, and to meet various international safety standards. This flexibility allows them to quickly respond to demand in different countries without costly retooling.

They also leverage partnerships with foreign distributors to bypass some of the high costs of setting up independent dealer networks abroad.

8. The Future: Will Prices Stay Low?

While Chinese EV prices are likely to remain competitive for the foreseeable future, there are pressures on the horizon. Rising raw material prices, potential trade tariffs, and competition from other low-cost producers (such as in Southeast Asia) could squeeze margins. Additionally, as global safety and emissions standards become more stringent, compliance costs may rise.

However, Chinese manufacturers are already working on innovations like sodium-ion batteries, which could further slash costs. If these technologies succeed, we could see even cheaper EVs entering both domestic and global markets—possibly showing up even more often in promotional prize campaigns and giveaways.

Chinese electric vehicles are affordable because their manufacturers leverage an exceptionally efficient supply chain, government support, large-scale production, and export-oriented flexibility. By integrating production, controlling battery technology, and streamlining design, they are able to keep costs low without compromising on innovation or quality. This combination is reshaping the global EV market and challenging long-standing industry leaders.",https://evpowered.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Xpeng-G6-SUV-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 15:59:37.852764

Layered Credit Advantage - Hydrogen produced is expected to qualify for the federal 45V Tax Credits, while the clean power generated can reduce the lifecycle carbon intensity of New Rise Reno's fuels, boosting the value of its 45Z and LCFS credits, or be sold into the local energy grid to meet rising demand for renewable energy.

Scalable Roadmap - The project is expected to begin with a 100-kW pilot and expand to modular 250-kW units, building toward multi-megawatt capacity.

XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (""SAF""), announces that it has signed a Letter of Intent (""LOI"") with Posh Robotics (""Posh"" dba Posh Energy), an advanced clean energy company founded by Stanford alumni and backed by Y-Combinator, through its subsidiary New Rise Renewables Reno, LLC (""New Rise Reno"") to explore deploying Posh Energy's Flex-Fuel Gensets at the New Rise Reno renewable fuels facility.

Posh's Flex-Fuel Gensets are expected to be installed at New Rise Reno to convert byproducts from SAF and renewable diesel production into clean, renewable electricity. Its proprietary reforming and fuel cell platform can process propane-rich byproduct streams and transform them into zero-carbon electricity. In the coming weeks, XCF and Posh plan to publish a white paper outlining how Flex-Fuel Gensets can transform byproducts from SAF and renewable diesel production into scalable sources of renewable electricity.

By integrating Posh's Flex-Fuel Gensets, XCF expects to unlock a combination of tax incentives that enhances both facility economics and sustainability metrics. Hydrogen produced by the system is expected to qualify for the federal 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit, while electricity generated from that hydrogen is expected to produce Renewable Energy Credits (""RECs""). When used to power on-site operations, the RECs can be retained and retired to lower the lifecycle carbon intensity of New Rise Reno's SAF and renewable diesel, thereby boosting the value of the 45Z and LCFS credits.

Alternatively, the electricity and RECs can be sold into the Nevada power grid to serve the growing clean energy demands of the region's expanding data center hub. Located in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, where some of the world's largest technology companies operate major facilities, New Rise Reno could supply renewable power through wheeling arrangements that help operators meet both regulatory requirements and corporate sustainability goals.

The project is expected to be rolled out in two phases:

Pilot Deployment: Installation of a 100-kW Flex-Fuel Genset to validate performance using New Rise Reno's byproduct streams.

Modular Scale-Up: Expansion of the project through a modular approach targeting a total capacity of up to 10-MW, providing significant upside in both credit capture and revenue growth.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global commented:

""XCF's mission to lead the transition to carbon-neutral aviation will be achieved not only by producing SAF, but by reducing carbon emissions throughout the supply chain to create a future-proof energy ecosystem. Teaming up with Posh Energy highlights how next-generation fuels and power can converge to deliver impact at scale. Converting byproducts into renewable electricity strengthens our sustainability profile while unlocking new revenue streams that enhance profitability, growth, and long-term shareholder value.""

Wesley Zheng, Co-founder and CEO of Posh Energy commented:

""Posh Energy's Flex-Fuel Gensets are designed to convert challenging, non-standard fuel streams into reliable renewable power. Working with XCF at New Rise Reno gives us a first-of-its-kind opportunity to demonstrate how our platform can help decarbonize industrial facilities while supplying clean energy to meet the rising demand from grids and data centers.""

The LOI is non-binding, and project execution remains subject to mutual due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

This announcement helps build on the success seen at the Statehouse this year.
Strong progress was made on energy policy, incentivizing the players in the energy conversation to come together and take our state’s economy to the next level.
Mike Braun recently reinforced his commitment to making Indiana a national energy leader by harnessing an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy while prioritizing the development of nuclear energy.
Our economy continues to grow.","Indiana is booming. Smart leadership, sound policy and one of the most productive workforces in the nation have made us a paradigm of success. Wages for families are increasing. Investment in our local communities continues to pay off in the form of more tax revenue to fund critical services. These are just some of the examples of the groundwork we are laying for a more prosperous future for Hoosiers.

Take a look at Fort Wayne and Allen County. New investments in 2024 alone have pushed salaries 18% higher than the county’s average wage. This helps give families a leg up and keeps Indiana-grown talent in Indiana for the long term. Much of this investment is helping build the U.S. economy for the 21st century.

Keeping the momentum going means we must work together to achieve smart growth. Recently, there has been a great deal of attention paid to Indiana’s efforts to grow our energy capacity to power our industrial economy for the long-haul. These conversations are essential to ensure we advance solutions to our most pressing challenges so we can continue to make our economy thrive.

Story Continues Below

Fortunately, Indiana’s private sector partners are on the forefront of this growth and taking proactive steps to address energy demand. Google’s partnership with CTC Global is a great example of organizations working together to enhance our grid and help tackle our need for more energy. This partnership will work to identify areas to deploy advanced conductors across our electric grid. These technologies carry more power than standard transmission lines but can be used on existing infrastructure, meaning that more electricity can flow to homes and businesses when they need it, while keeping prices stable.

This announcement helps build on the success seen at the Statehouse this year. Strong progress was made on energy policy, incentivizing the players in the energy conversation to come together and take our state’s economy to the next level. Indiana Michigan Power’s agreement around interconnection rules for large-load customers put our state on a path to draw more investment to our communities. Solutions like these can only be found when we work together and put the needs of our communities first.

At the national level, the Trump administration has made it clear that returning the United States to being the global energy leader is a top priority. Not only is energy production and delivery essential for our national security but it also helps ensure that the United States, with Indiana leading the way, is well equipped to beat China in the AI race. To make this a reality, we must welcome investment here in Indiana and implement policy that backs it up.

Gov. Mike Braun recently reinforced his commitment to making Indiana a national energy leader by harnessing an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy while prioritizing the development of nuclear energy. A recent Purdue University study said that Indiana has the opportunity to deploy 24/7 carbon free electricity with the proliferation of small modular reactors. These reactors can be built in less time than traditional reactors, their construction will bring thousands of jobs to our state and they can secure Indiana’s role as an energy innovation leader.

Our neighbors in the Midwest continue to over-tax and over-regulate development, but here in Indiana, it is a different story. Our economy continues to grow. More talent is flocking here. Wages for families are on the rise. By working together, citizens, businesses and government, we can harness the opportunity before us and build a stronger state for generations to come.•

This investment surge, timed with the rebate rush, is creating a more robust ecosystem that could outlast the incentives.","As the federal electric vehicle tax credit of up to $7,500 nears its expiration on September 30, 2025, a surge in EV purchases is reshaping the automotive market in unexpected ways. Dealerships across the U.S. are reporting unprecedented demand, with buyers scrambling to secure incentives that could save them thousands on models like the Tesla Model Y or Chevrolet Bolt. This last-minute rush, fueled by the impending deadline, has led to a temporary boom in sales, but industry analysts suggest it may lay the groundwork for sustained growth in electric mobility even after the rebates vanish.

Data from recent reports indicate that EV sales have spiked by as much as 30% in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the previous year, according to figures compiled by automotive research firms. This frenzy isn’t just about immediate savings; it’s prompting manufacturers to ramp up production and innovate in pricing strategies to maintain momentum post-incentive.

The Irony of Incentive Sunset: How Short-Term Panic Fuels Long-Term Shift

Experts argue that the end of the tax credit, enacted through recent Republican-led tax legislation, could paradoxically accelerate EV adoption by forcing the industry to address core barriers like cost and infrastructure. As noted in a detailed analysis by CNN Business, while short-term sales may dip, the pre-deadline surge is educating a broader consumer base about EV benefits, from lower operating costs to environmental advantages. Automakers, facing potential slumps, are already pivoting toward more affordable models without relying on government subsidies.

In states like California and New York, where EV penetration is highest, the rebate’s demise is seen as a test of market maturity. A report from the Times Union highlights that only about 3% of vehicles in New York are currently electric, but the rush is pushing dealerships to offer competitive financing and trade-in deals, potentially normalizing EVs in everyday budgets.

Market Dynamics Post-Rebate: Automakers’ Strategic Responses

Beyond the U.S., global trends offer clues to the future. In Singapore, the extension of EV early adoption schemes with reduced rebates through 2025 has not deterred buyers, as detailed in coverage by The Straits Times, where maximum incentives dropped but adoption rates held steady due to falling battery costs and improved charging networks. Similarly, U.S. manufacturers like Ford and GM are investing heavily in battery technology to cut production expenses, aiming to make EVs price-competitive with gasoline cars by 2027.

This shift is echoed in insights from Forbes, which posits that the credit’s end could “reshape the electric vehicle market” by testing whether consumers value EVs intrinsically, without fiscal crutches. Industry insiders point to falling lithium prices and economies of scale as key factors that could drive down sticker prices by 15-20% in the coming years.

Infrastructure Investments: The Unsung Hero of Sustained Growth

A critical element in this transition is the expansion of charging infrastructure, which has long been a hurdle for widespread adoption. Recent federal funding, separate from the tax credit, is accelerating the build-out of fast-charging stations, with companies like Seattle-based Electric Era raising fresh capital to deploy battery-integrated systems, as reported by GeekWire. This investment surge, timed with the rebate rush, is creating a more robust ecosystem that could outlast the incentives.

Consumer confidence is also building through real-world exposure. The pre-expiration buying bonanza is introducing EVs to demographics previously hesitant, such as rural drivers concerned about range. According to Cox Automotive, post-incentive strategies focusing on “cost, confidence, and convenience” will be pivotal, with automakers likely to emphasize total ownership savings over upfront discounts.

Global Parallels and Future Projections: Lessons from Abroad

Looking abroad, the UK’s introduction of discounts up to £3,750 on electric cars starting in July 2025, as announced by GOV.UK, suggests that targeted incentives can bridge gaps without long-term dependency. In India, events like the Global Clean Mobility Summit 2025 are poised to boost innovation, per EV Mechanica, highlighting how policy shifts can catalyze technological leaps.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-afb56ace-0503-4eff-ad97-4a6a83437de9.jpeg,N,,2025-09-26 18:02:40.565532

GEAPP added that it plans to invest $7.5 billion over the next five years to expand clean energy solutions across the continent.

The contribution forms part of a wider collective drive. GEAPP, created in 2021 by the IKEA Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bezos Earth Fund, operates in more than 30 countries. It combines philanthropic and public financing to leverage development banks and private investors.

The alliance said such contributions aim to provide coherence and visibility to global efforts, showing that modest funding can create significant impact when aligned with large-scale strategies.

Despite growing mobilization, Africa’s energy needs remain vast. The International Energy Agency estimated in 2024 that developing countries outside China must multiply clean energy investments sixfold to reach $1.6 trillion annually by the early 2030s to meet climate commitments.

In this context, contributions like GEAPP’s are critical, particularly when they integrate into collective initiatives that pool resources and align objectives. The trajectory of Africa’s electricity access will depend in part on the convergence of such efforts.

Race to Funding the Government, and Climate Assistance, Before Oct. 1

Congress is once again nearing a fiscal cliff which could lead to a government shutdown. Recently, the House pushed through a government funding extension (commonly called a “continuing resolution”) that was quickly voted down in the Senate. Senate Democrats then put forward a bill that, in addition to extending funding for the government, would have also extended key healthcare subsidies due to expire and reasserted Congress’ power of the purse. That bill was also voted down, deepening the stalemate between the two sides less than a week before the September 30 deadline.

As we often say here at FCNL, a government shutdown would be a disaster for everyone, but especially for the most vulnerable folks here at home and abroad. For the climate, a funding lapse would block critical international climate assistance from flowing to the communities in the Global South that most need support in adapting to the climate crisis. We’re continuing to push for Congress to pass a bipartisan funding bill that extends government funding and ensures no unnecessary delays in getting climate assistance out the door. Any government funding bill must include binding legislative measures that reassert Congress’ power of the purse and guarantee federal funds are fully and directly delivered to the initiatives to which Congress has designated them.

FCNL Advocacy Teams around the country are meeting with congressional offices this month to urge them to protect international climate finance in the FY26 appropriations bill with strong safeguards to ensure Congress’ appropriations are fully implemented.

Administration Is Attempting to Block Maryland’s First Offshore Wind Project

In a motion filed with the U.S. District Court in Maryland, the Interior Department asked a judge to revoke approval for a major offshore wind project near Ocean City, Maryland. The 114-turbine, 80,000-acre project is slated to begin construction over the next few years. Administration officials argue that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management made an “error” when assessing the turbines’ impacts on other activities like search-and-rescue operations and commercial fishing in the region.

This move by the administration marks a major setback to an industry already under significant pressure. The wind industry is racing against a narrowing window to secure clean energy tax credits. More than a decade in the making, the Ocean City windfarm was projected to deliver power to over 700,000 homes in a state already struggling with skyrocketing energy demand.

EPA Plans to Scrap Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has moved to end a program requiring large greenhouse gas polluters to publicly disclose the role their facilities play in driving climate change. The program began in 2009 and covers emissions from 47 source categories at 8,000 facilities across the country. Ending the program would be a major blow for scientists studying how best to address greenhouse gas pollution from major facilities. This is, unfortunately, just the latest in a string of proposals that EPA has made in recent months to pull back from its mandate to safeguard the country from climate change and the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions.

That includes energy loans, grid and transmission support, and other climate programs when funds weren’t yet obligated.

Clean energy jobs grew much faster than the rest of the U.S. workforce in 2024.
Why it matters to households and workers Clean energy hiring has outpaced the rest of the economy.","The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) says it will send back more than $13 billion that had been set aside for clean energy programs. The agency hasn’t listed every program yet, but the decision ties to a new law that cancels “unobligated” money from recent climate and energy initiatives.

What changed — in plain terms

The move follows the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (H.R. 1), which became law on July 4, 2025. Parts of the law rescind unused balances from several Inflation Reduction Act programs across agencies. That includes energy loans, grid and transmission support, and other climate programs when funds weren’t yet obligated.

What the DOE and the White House say

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the money “was slated to go out to subsidize wind, solar, batteries, and electric vehicles.” He framed the step as giving money back to taxpayers and refocusing on “more affordable, reliable, and secure” energy. President Donald Trump has also criticized global climate efforts and subsidies for clean energy.

Officials did not release a detailed list of affected projects. Reporters asked for specifics, but the department didn’t share names of individual grants or awards.

What outside reporting and research say

Independent coverage confirms the plan to pull back more than $13 billion and notes that the department hasn’t identified each program that will lose funding. The reporting also captures Wright’s criticism of international climate policy and his current plan to skip the UN climate talks in Brazil.

Programs that could be touched

Analyses of the new law point to a broad set of IRA-era programs where unobligated money could be rescinded, including parts of the DOE loan authority and some transmission and industrial decarbonization efforts, as well as non-DOE programs at EPA, DOT, USDA, and GSA. The Senate parliamentarian left some program authorities intact, but money that wasn’t obligated may still be clawed back.

How big is clean energy work today?

Clean energy jobs grew much faster than the rest of the U.S. workforce in 2024. The sector added almost 100,000 jobs and reached about 3.56 million workers. These roles span energy efficiency, solar, wind, EVs, batteries, and grid work. But new federal pullbacks could slow future growth, several groups warn.

What supporters argue

Cost focus: Backers say rolling back subsidies can lower federal spending and keep energy “affordable and reliable.”

Policy reset: They argue that international climate deals haven’t delivered major global emissions cuts, so it’s time to change course.

Energy security: The administration highlights oil and gas output and grid reliability as near-term priorities.

What critics say

Jobs risk: Pulling funds may slow hiring and projects in solar, wind, EVs, batteries, and efficiency. Recent job gains are at stake.

Global standing: Critics warn the U.S. could cede clean-tech leadership to competitors like China.

Power bills: Some grid operators and analysts worry that freezing renewables while propping up costly coal can raise electricity costs.

How this fits into the new law

The budget law is broad. It touches climate and energy across many agencies, not just DOE. Public summaries and trackers note that it rescinds unobligated IRA funding and, in some cases, removes or narrows program authority. But because each agency had different timelines, the on-the-ground impact will vary by program and by whether an award was already committed.

What we still don’t know

Exact list of cuts: DOE hasn’t published a full list of projects or accounts that will lose money.

Schedule: The timeline for returning funds and its step-by-step process remains unclear.

Legal challenges: It’s not yet clear whether lawsuits will test parts of the rescissions, especially where stakeholders expected near-term awards. (Inference based on prior budget rescission disputes.)

Why it matters to households and workers

Clean energy hiring has outpaced the rest of the economy. Many of those jobs are in energy efficiency, which includes common work like HVAC upgrades and building retrofits. If funding slows, some projects may pause or shrink, which could affect local contractors and suppliers. On the other hand, supporters say reducing federal subsidies might ease fiscal pressure and steer investment toward technologies they view as more dependable today.

The state found about 12,000 locations that no longer needed service, according to Broadband Expanded.","COLUMBIA — The state Broadband Office is preparing to hook into the information superhighway the last remaining South Carolina homes and businesses without high-speed internet access.

The public has until just before midnight Friday to comment on the state’s plan, which state broadband chief Jim Stritzinger called “the anchor leg of the broadband investment relay race here in South Carolina.” The office will then submit for final approval the plan for spending its share of a $42 billion federal grant program.

The milestone is one to celebrate. The final round will complete an effort that began in 2020.

By the 2030 deadline, the combined public-private effort will have connected more than 200,000 locations statewide, Stritzinger said in a statement.

Still, how the state plans to link up about half of its final locations raises concerns about affordability and reliability, some broadband groups say.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of broadband and the state’s digital divide. Without high-speed internet, people couldn’t work or attend classes amid closures. In rural areas where healthcare access is thin, patients are increasingly turning to virtual visits with doctors. But being diagnosed by a physician over a video call is nearly impossible without a good connection.

Legislators recognized broadband was a critical need, not a luxury.

In response, they designated $490 million over two years toward extending access statewide, the bulk of it from federal COVID aid packages. The biggest single chunk — $400 million approved in May 2022 — came from the $2.5 billion that flowed to state coffers from the American Rescue Plan Act.

People across SC connected to high-speed internet with $400M: ‘It completely transformed us’

With that $400 million, combined with $263 million in private investment, state-contracted companies added high-speed internet access to more than 117,000 homes, businesses and community buildings, such as schools and libraries.

When that money ran dry last year, there were about 20,480 locations still without a connection, according to the latest data from the state Broadband Office — down from an earlier estimate of about 32,000.

Infrastructure funds for broadband

The state then turned its attention to a federal grant program — Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) — funded through the federal Infrastructure Investment spending package passed by Congress in November 2021.

That program, pushed by U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., brought $551.5 million into the state, but under the final plan up for review, the state says it needs only a fraction — 7.5% — of it.

According to the Broadband Office, which the Legislature officially created in 2021, the state’s early investments of pandemic relief funds toward broadband, starting with $50 million in June 2020, provided a head start. Private companies also have expanded their service areas and made investments that helped fill in gaps.

What will become of the remaining funds is unknown.

States were supposed to be allowed to use leftover funds to pay for things other than broadband deployment. But the federal telecommunications agency has not yet released guidance since the Trump administration revised the rules in June.

“There’s a lot of fear right now that (the National Telecommunications and Information Administration) may try to call that money back, which would be a big shame,” Drew Garner, the director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute for Broadband in the Chicago area, told States Newsroom affiliate Stateline.

South Carolina is far from the only state with a potential surplus:

In Oklahoma, critics noticed the updated plan would not be using $225 million of the state’s allocated funds.

In Nevada, that number is nearly $250 million.

Arizona — $481 million left over

Kentucky — $623 million

Mississippi — $633 million

Louisiana — $750 million

North Carolina — $1 billion

And the list goes on, according to the Benton Institute, which has been tracking these plans.

Most of the state plans do not mention how they would like to spend the remaining funds.

But Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, in a letter sent earlier this month, asked the U.S. Department of Commerce, which administers the program, to allow states to spend it on artificial intelligence efforts and education and workforce initiatives. Louisiana also previously sought to spend the funds on rural healthcare.

Program changes

The program changes implemented by the Trump administration, which put a focus on driving down costs as much as possible, also has led to other shifts, said Alex Karras, a researcher with the Broadband Expanded project at New York Law School.

Namely, more states have turned to satellite internet companies that cost less to build but tend to have more uneven service than underground fiber optic cable, favored for its speed and durability.

That includes Elon Musk’s Starlink, which states could award about $10 billion worth of projects nationwide, according to The Wall Street Journal. There’s also Amazon’s Project Kuiper, which has yet to start service as it has struggled to get satellites into space, the Journal also reported.

Under South Carolina’s state plan, the two tech giants are in line for $7.9 million worth of contracts, covering 49% of the remaining unserved homes and businesses. While these locations are scattered across the state, there are clusters in the rural areas surrounding Greenville, Columbia, Florence and Orangeburg, as well as Cherokee, Darlington, and Hampton counties, that will rely on the satellites for service, according to a map put out by the Broadband Office.

It’s a bird, it’s a plane. No, it’s broadband!

While not as fast as fiber-optic cables, the satellites could reach parts of the state where installing cables is difficult, Stritzinger has previously said.

And though satellite internet makes up a large chunk of this latest investment round, it accounts for just 5% of the locations where the state has worked to add service, according to data from the Broadband Office.

Whether satellite internet technology will be able to consistently meet the minimum speed requirements under the federal program remains in question. In a Starlink test program, only 17.4% of users were getting high enough speeds over the first three months of 2025, according to an analysis by Ookla, a company that measures internet speeds.

However, the analysis noted, the company’s speeds have increased significantly over the past several years. The challenge will be maintaining that speed as the company adds more customers.

“If four out of five subscribers aren’t getting broadband speeds today, what do people think is going to happen when you add in hundreds of thousands of new users?” Sascha Meinrath, a professor at Penn State and co-author of a recent study questioning whether Starlink, the internet division of SpaceX, can meet the program’s requirements, told Spotlight Pennsylvania.

Also under the program rule changes, while internet providers must still offer low-cost residential service options, states no longer have the power to dictate the rates.

Amazon has yet to publicize the rates it plans to charge when its satellite system is operational. In the test program, Starlink gave free equipment, valued at $350, to each user who agreed to sign up for a one-year plan that cost $120 per month for higher speeds and $80 per month for lower ones.

A grant program offering low-income families a $100 discount to buy equipment and a $30 monthly discount on their internet bill ended last year without additional funding from Congress.

Remaining locations

While states have been finalizing their plans this month, rollout of the BEAD program was delayed after the Trump administration asked states to recheck their list of unserved locations to search for duplications and other unnecessary service areas.

For South Carolina, that proved to be a useful exercise. The state found about 12,000 locations that no longer needed service, according to Broadband Expanded.

The vast majority of those — about 6,790 locations — already received service via high-speed fiber installed during other projects funded by COVID relief dollars or a state-funded grant program.

Another 3,370 locations already had privately funded internet access. And about 1,800 were mistakes and duplications on the map.

A smaller portion of the locations were found to be structures that didn’t actually need service — garages, barns, grain silos, demolished or uninhabitable buildings.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/internet-access-2048x1366.jpeg,N,,2025-09-26 16:00:16.118717
,Louisiana and Evs,2025-09-26 18:23:03+00:00,SuperTalk Mississippi Media,Former EPA official: Don't blame data centers for rising electric bills - SuperTalk Mississippi,Andrew Fanara,,,,,https://www.supertalk.fm/former-epa-official-dont-blame-data-centers-for-rising-electric-bills/,"For starters, consider Georgia, where the plan to build multiple new data centers is actually keeping electricity prices steady – bucking the national trend of rising power rates.
But with the explosion of Artificial Intelligence, which will be powered by data centers, these facilities are rapidly expanding into new parts of the country.
However, a planned data center or one under construction does not impact current electric prices.
If those data centers want to also use the electric grid as a backup, again, they must pay their fair share for maintaining that infrastructure.
It’s also worth saying that the rush to falsely blame data centers as the single greatest contributing factor to rising electric bills is not benign.","Rarely, if ever, do our nation’s most complex public policy problems have a singular cause. Such is the case of rising power bills across the country, and the misleading narrative that electricity is becoming more costly solely because of the growth of the data center industry.

For starters, consider Georgia, where the plan to build multiple new data centers is actually keeping electricity prices steady – bucking the national trend of rising power rates. In fact, Georgia Power, the state’s regulated utility, just got approval to freeze its rates for three years. This rate freeze is possible because data centers are pumping vast sums into the state’s economy and creating sufficient revenues for Georgia Power to stabilize rates for everyone else.

It is also worth noting, that for all the talk about data center development driving up rates across the country, current data centers are actually clustered in a small handful of states like: Virginia, Texas, California, Illinois, Florida, and New York. But with the explosion of Artificial Intelligence, which will be powered by data centers, these facilities are rapidly expanding into new parts of the country.

However, a planned data center or one under construction does not impact current electric prices.

For example, Louisiana just approved what might one day be the largest data center on the planet for Meta (Facebook’s parent company). In the frenzied lead up to the vote by the state’s Public Service Commission to approve electric service for the facility, the false narrative of data centers and higher electric prices took hold. It led to inaccurate headlines like “Louisiana’s electricity costs rise amid data center boom” even though the state only has a handful of data centers, with no impact on Louisiana’s energy prices.

Also, in some states where electricity costs are going up, it’s because of external factors that have created roadblocks preventing new sources of generation. For example, PJM, the mid-Atlantic grid operator that encompasses 13 states and the District of Columbia, has become a regime incapable of bringing sufficient new electrons onto the grid.

Now, anger at PJM’s failings is bipartisan, with nine Governors – Democrats and Republicans – in the PJM footprint recently sending the grid operator a letter stating, among other things, that: “…PJM’s multi-year inability to efficiently connect new resources to its grid and to engage in effective long-term transmission planning has deprived our states of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in investment…”

PJM’s dysfunction means that its available capacity today is about the same as it was in 2024. So, it’s no surprise that with the rise of electric demand, including from data centers, that PJM’s electricity prices are skyrocketing to alarming levels and creating economic hardships for millions of customers.

Another factor driving up energy costs is that electrification means more Americans are plugging in their electric vehicles, converting to electric stoves, furnaces and water heaters, and using an ever-increasing number of electrified devices. Also, we cannot ignore the fact that parts of the country are experiencing weather extremes, forcing people to use large amounts of electricity to stay comfortable year-round. This drives up energy bills and customers are understandably frustrated.

Other reasons energy prices are rising is because after years of insufficient investment, states now need to spend billions on grid improvements like new transmission lines and distribution wires to people’s homes and businesses. Because of this long-term lack of investment in our electric grid, we are dealing with a series of electricity bottlenecks across the country that drives up electricity costs. Data centers, utilities, regulators and grid operators need to come together on this crisis, to ensure that electricity can move more efficiently across the nation.

It’s also worth noting, that because the construction of data centers is so appealing to states looking to create jobs and fill tax coffers, many will be built. But, again, that doesn’t mean they need to drive-up electricity rates. In Georgia, an additional reason they could implement a three-year rate freeze, was because the electric utility, working with state regulators and their data center customers, was able to create a special rate class for data centers to ensure they cover their share of grid maintenance, and those costs are not passed onto customers.

Other options to protect customers from rate hikes due to data center expansion, include using AI to coordinate with the utilities so that when demand spikes – say during a heatwave – those data centers can be throttled down to use less electricity. Data centers can also have their own generation onsite to reduce demand and lower electricity prices. If those data centers want to also use the electric grid as a backup, again, they must pay their fair share for maintaining that infrastructure. But with coordination and common sense, utilities and data centers can profit without exposing customers to risk.

It’s also worth saying that the rush to falsely blame data centers as the single greatest contributing factor to rising electric bills is not benign. After all, if lawmakers and regulators seek to lower energy costs, by throwing up roadblocks to data center construction, they will be trying to solve a problem by addressing the wrong cause. In the end, the result will be poorly crafted public policy that hamstrings the tech sector and our economy but fails to help the American people cope with rising electricity costs.

New York Solar Energy Industries Association (NYSEIA) applauds Governor Hochul for taking action to accelerate renewable energy project development and construction.","As part of New York’s all-of-the-above energy strategy, Governor Kathy Hochul today announced a coordinated set of actions to accelerate the deployment and construction of reliable and clean energy across New York State that will help stabilize energy prices. Recognizing the near-term need for power to meet increasing electricity demand as well as economic development needs and the importance of adapting to shifting federal policies, Governor Hochul is launching a new solicitation for renewable energy and directing state agencies to work together to responsibly advance shovel-ready renewable energy projects as quickly as possible. These efforts are designed to support New York ratepayers by using sunsetting federal clean energy tax credits to bring down costs.

“While the federal government takes us backward on energy policy, New York will not be thwarted in its commitment to clean energy. By directing our state agencies to move projects across the finish line, we are seizing every opportunity to leverage federal incentives, reduce costs for ratepayers, and build a more resilient, sustainable and reliable energy grid,” Governor Hochul said. “Together, these actions are expected to unlock billions in private investment, create thousands of good-paying jobs, and build a durable energy economy that benefits New Yorkers for decades to come.”

New York's current pipeline of large-scale renewable energy is comprised of 102 solar, land-based wind, hydroelectric and offshore wind projects operating and under development that will deliver over 9.7 gigawatts of clean power to the grid when completed – enough energy to power over 3 million New York homes. The development of projects as a result of this solicitation is expected to spur over five billion dollars in clean energy investments and create more than 2,500 family-sustaining jobs in the energy economy across New York.

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “New York is all about progress and we are not stopping. We are going to continue building out our energy economy and growing our already robust land-based renewables portfolio. This solicitation will serve as another building block to help ensure a continuous pipeline of viable large-scale projects as part of New York’s versatile clean energy future.”

2025 Land-Based Renewable Energy Solicitation (Tier 1 RFP)

NYSERDA today launched the 2025 Land-Based Renewable Energy Solicitation seeking to procure eligible large-scale wind, solar, and other renewable energy projects to support advancement of clean energy deployment while delivering reliable energy to all New Yorkers.

The solicitation is designed to advance late-stage large-scale renewable energy projects ready to commence construction in New York. It incorporates best practices and lessons learned from prior procurements, including key provisions on component cost indexing, labor provisions, stakeholder engagement requirements, disadvantaged community commitments, and agricultural land preservation to ensure an equitable energy transition that benefits all New Yorkers. To expedite contracting, NYSERDA has also streamlined bid requirements, with full details outlined in the solicitation documents.

The process for submitting proposals into the land-based renewables solicitation will be conducted in two steps:

Eligibility applications are due on October 21, 2025.

Final proposals from eligible participants are due on December 4, 2025, by 3 p.m.

For details, please visit the Large-Scale Renewables Solicitation page. Conditional award notifications are expected to be issued to proposers in February 2026, followed by an announcement of selected projects once the awarded contracts have been executed.

Directive to Focus on Projects that May Qualify for Existing Federal Tax Credits

State agencies will intensify efforts to advance shovel-ready renewable energy projects, with a focus on qualifying projects that seek to access existing federal tax credits that will expire. This whole-of-government approach will responsibly streamline permitting, interconnection, financing, and contracting processes to ensure that as many projects as possible reach construction quickly, providing clean power to New York homes and businesses.

New York State Public Service Commission Chair and CEO Rory M. Christian said, “We stand ready to assist our sister agencies in the development of appropriate clean energy projects in New York State. Governor Hochul’s very timely announcement will help ensure a continuous development of renewable energy projects that will help spur the creation of much needed clean energy which will strengthen the reliability of our electric grid while creating good-paying jobs.”

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Amanda Lefton said, “Renewable energy development is one of the most important keys to reducing harmful pollution, generating green jobs, and creating more sustainable communities here in New York and across the country. Governor Hochul’s directive announced today will help further accelerate clean energy momentum already underway by comprehensive policies, programs, and investments that continue to make New York State a national leader in zero-emission energy production. DEC continues to work with our partner agencies to ensure efficient permitting processes that support these efforts.”

State Senator Kevin Parker said, “Accelerating renewable energy projects is critical to ensuring New York families have access to clean, affordable, and reliable power when they need it most. Every day we move forward means more jobs created, more communities protected from rising costs, and more progress toward a healthier environment. While uncertainty in Washington threatens to slow the clean energy transition, New York is proving that we will not wait we will lead. I remain committed to making sure our state continues to deliver for working families and disadvantaged communities, advancing projects that strengthen our energy future and our economy.”

Assemblymember Deborah Glick said, “Thank you, Governor Hochul, for recognizing that New Yorkers need an expanded grid with reliable, clean energy and lower costs. With our current federal government working hand in glove with the fossil fuel industry, it is important for New York to fully utilize the remaining federal tax credits to realize as many renewable energy projects as possible. This will not only be better for the environment, but will provide cleaner, more reliable, and less expensive energy and reduce our reliance on the more volatile and polluting fossil fuel industry.”

State Senator Peter Harckham said, “This is exactly the kind of forward-thinking climate action New York needs. Renewable energy projects are a major economic opportunity waiting to be unlocked. Expediting the Land-Based Tier 1 Renewable Energy Solicitation will mean more good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, lower utility bills for ratepayers and cleaner air for all. Thank you to Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for moving this critical work forward.”

New York League of Conservation Voters President Julie Tighe said, “While the federal government retreats, New York continues to march forward with reliable, affordable clean energy. NYSERDA’s plan to accelerate the construction and deployment of renewables is a critical step forward that will cut pollution, create good-paying jobs, and make our communities healthier and our grid more resilient. We applaud Governor Hochul for prioritizing the clean energy transition and showing the country what strong state leadership looks like.”

New York State AFL-CIO President Mario Cilento said, “Today’s announcement marks another significant step toward ensuring energy reliability and moving us closer to achieving New York’s renewable energy goals. We look forward to continuing to work with NYSERDA to ensure these projects adhere to robust labor standards and protections, creating pathways to solid union careers as we continue to advance toward a clean energy future.”

New York State Building Trades President Gary LaBarbera said, ""The continued advancement of clean energy development in New York State represents significant progress in establishing our green economy and the good paying union careers that come with it. The deployment of these projects will not only help us reach our standard-setting climate goals and deliver reliable clean energy to all New Yorkers, but it will also open up countless opportunities for hardworking people to pursue the middle class and support their families. We applaud NYSERDA for their ongoing work to streamline these crucial energy initiatives and look forward to our continued collaboration in pushing these projects forward.""

Alliance for Clean Energy New York Executive Director Marguerite Wells said, “Wind and solar projects are ready to meet the moment and provide affordable power to New Yorkers. We applaud Gov. Hochul for advancing these clean energy technologies at a time when we need them most. Against a backdrop of rising costs and the ever-present realities of climate change, renewables can revitalize upstate economies, provide much-needed power, and do so in an efficient and cost-effective manner.”

Natural Resources Defense Council Managing Director of Power Kit Kennedy said, “Building clean energy projects quickly and fairly is crucial for cutting electricity costs and creating quality jobs for New Yorkers. Every action that New York State takes to speed up renewable energy deployment helps achieve these goals. With the federal government in full retreat and denial, New York’s climate leadership is more important than ever.”

New York Solar Energy Industries Association Executive Director Noah Ginsburg said, “As the federal government eliminates support for affordable clean energy, states need to act quickly to protect electric ratepayers and the clean energy workforce. New York Solar Energy Industries Association (NYSEIA) applauds Governor Hochul for taking action to accelerate renewable energy project development and construction. These actions will ensure that New York leverages federal funding for clean energy projects today while setting the stage for cost-effective permitting and interconnection tomorrow.”

Advanced Energy United New York Policy Lead Kristina Persaud said, “We commend Governor Hochul for delivering clean, reliable, and affordable energy to New Yorkers. Large-scale renewable projects don’t just keep energy costs in check—they also strengthen our electric grid and create good jobs across the state. This procurement keeps New York on track to meet our nation-leading clean energy targets and reaffirms the Empire State’s commitment to building a clean, affordable energy future.”

For more than fifty years, NYSERDA has been a trusted and objective resource for New Yorkers, taking on the critical role of energy planning and policy analysis, along with making investments that drive New York toward a more sustainable future. The launch of this solicitation continues to fuel the advancement of innovative technologies and solutions that will benefit New York residents as well as businesses.",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/thumbnails/image/wind_offshore_1280.jpg?h=b5f6a62e&itok=3cPRJe2X,N,,2025-09-26 17:00:52.242780

The US plans to impose a 25% duty on imported heavy trucks starting on Wednesday, Trump announced in a post on Truth Social, without providing more details. Daimler Truck shares fell as much as 4.9% in Frankfurt, while Traton’s stock dropped 3.1%. Both companies operate assembly sites in Mexico that may be affected by the levies.

Shares of Sweden’s Volvo AB — which makes Volvo and Mack trucks locally — rose as much as 3.45% in Stockholm. The company may be better positioned than its peers because it relies less on manufacturing in Mexico, according to Bernstein analysts led by Harry Martin.

Trump’s latest moves add to mounting trade hurdles hitting the transport sector, with 15% duties on cars imported from the European Union weighing on the likes of Porsche AG and Volkswagen’s Audi. The truckmakers have in recent years made significant investments in new technologies including batteries and hydrogen fuel cells.

The US is Daimler Truck’s largest market, where the company generates about 40% of its global sales with brands such as Western Star, Thomas Built Buses and Freightliner. The latter dominates the country’s heavy-duty truck segment. Daimler Truck operates plants in North Carolina and Oregon but also ships in vehicles from Mexico, exposing it to potential cross-border disruptions sparked by tariffs. The company said it’s closely monitoring the situation but too early for a more detailed comment.

Traton had seen deliveries and orders slump on tariff uncertainty in the US even before Trump’s announcement. The truckmaker in July flagged poor demand in North America and earlier this year cut a shift at an International Motors plant in Mexico. The company declined to comment on the tariffs.

The local content of Volvo’s US trucks is between 60% and 70%, the company said in an email, adding that it still needs to import some components that aren’t made in the country.

“What we have to go on at this stage is merely a Truth Social post,” Volvo said. “We should wait to see the actual legislative proposal before we can fully assess its potential effects.”",https://equipmentfinancenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/440973220-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 16:00:25.321353

Carrboro, a small town north of Raleigh, sued the utilities giant in December 2024, claiming it is causing and accelerating climate change. Duke has attempted to conceal the dangers of climate change from the public, it said, despite understanding the dangers of fossil fuel emissions since 1968. It claimed Duke is misleading the public over the causes and consequences of climate change and has “materially slowed the transition away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy,” failing to timely retire coal plants, increasing reliance upon natural gas and refusing to make meaningful investments in clean energy.

The company is one of the planet’s most significant emitters of fossil fuel emissions, Carrboro said, and has caused decades of delay in implementing measures necessary to transition away from fossil fuels. The impacts of the climate crisis will cost the town millions of dollars in damages, it said, as temperature impacts and more extreme precipitation will require roads to be replaced more frequently, and more devastating storms will necessitate new anti-flooding and anti-erosion infrastructure. As temperatures go up, Carrboro will have to pay Duke, its electricity provider, millions to cool buildings, it said.

Carrboro has failed to meet the threshold to prove injury, counsel for Duke said.

“I can’t say I have a trespass injury by the clouds, right?” asked attorney Hampton Bruton, pointing toward Carroboro’s trespass by climate change claim. Duke’s regulation by the local utilities commission should also be factored in, Duke’s attorneys said.

“The fact that Duke Energy is a regulated utility means that the very decisions that Carrboro is complaining about today, the fact that Duke Energy continues to use fossil fuel products — they would say longer than they should have — implicates decisions by utilities commissions and the General Assembly here in North Carolina and in similar bodies across the country where those types of decisions about generation fuel mix are being made,” said Duke attorney Sterling Andrew Marchand.

Matthew Quinn, counsel for the plaintiffs, argued for the case to remain in state court and survive Duke’s motion to dismiss. The state is able to establish its own regulatory standards more restrictive of emissions than federal guidelines, he said, assuring Business Court Judge Mark Davis that the case won’t inch too closely to federal emissions law, including the Clean Air Act.

“The source of Duke’s liability is their deception. It’s not emissions,” said Quinn, calling Carrboro’s case a common law tort.

“We are not second-guessing energy policy. Our claim is a basic claim for money damage based on common law,” Quinn said, emphasizing that Duke’s messaging that climate change doesn’t exist — and, more recently, that it is now a renewable energy company — is deceptive.

Factoring in emissions is critical, counsel for Duke argued, to determine if Carrboro was injured, and if Carrboro isn’t going to do that because it involves federal legislation, then the town can’t blame Duke for climate change. Carrboro can’t claim that Duke deceived the global population or America, they argued, and that its communications swayed them to use more fossil fuels.

“Because they’ve attributed their injuries to global climate change, which, again, concerns things besides emissions, concerns things outside the United States, outside of North Carolina, they’ve attributed their injury to something they cannot trace back to a deception by Duke,” said Bruton.

Duke’s status as a regulated utilities producer shouldn’t exclude it from liability, Quinn said.

“If you engage in a deception campaign, you know bad things are going to happen,” he said. “And under the law of the state of North Carolina, you don’t have to foresee the precise way in which an injury is going to occur.”

Even if Duke had not made these statements, the state’s utilities commission could still have chosen to go with the same fuel mix that they did, Marchand said.

“You can’t connect billions of decisions across the world back to statements on Twitter,” he said.

Duke has downplayed the seriousness of fossil fuel emissions, launched public relations campaigns arguing that fossil fuel emissions don’t pose a serious risk, opposed all solutions to curbing fossil fuel emissions and promoted its transition from coal-fired generation to natural gas as being cleaner, while knowing it worsens the crisis, the town argued in its complaint.

Duke’s communications made people “highly skeptical” about fossil fuels being dangerous, Quinn said.

“It cannot possibly be true that you can deceive everybody all the time about fossil fuels and not suffer related consequences,” he said.

In July, the state legislature passed a bill into law repealing a 2021 requirement that electric regulators must take steps to reduce their carbon dioxide output 70% from 2005’s levels by 2030, in order to reach carbon neutrality. The law, which primarily impacts Duke Energy, faced pushback from opponents for delaying clean energy sources. Supporters said it would decrease costs incurred trying to meet target goals.

“We are committed to our customers and communities and will continue working with policymakers, regulators and other state leaders to deliver reliable and increasingly clean energy while keeping rates as low as possible,” Duke Energy said in a statement after the hearing. Counsel for Carrboro declined to comment.

Davis asked the parties to submit additional briefing. He did not say when he planned to rule.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/09/raleigh-courthouse.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-09-26 18:04:23.228427

And it happens to be electric.” Key To Profitability The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability.
The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year.
Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox.
While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered.","SOCIAL CIRCLE, Ga. (AP) — It seems like a terrible time to build an electric vehicle plant in the United States, but Rivian Automotive leaders say they’re confident as the company starts long-delayed work on a $5 billion facility in Georgia.

The money-losing California-based company broke ground Sept. 16 east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump’s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits.

Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

CEO RJ Scaringe said that Rivian will sell its R2 sport utility vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because it’s a superior vehicle.

“The description I’ll say for R2 is it isn’t an electric vehicle,” he said. “I describe R2 as an incredible five-passenger off-road machine. And it happens to be electric.”

Key To Profitability

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making the smaller R2 next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly.

But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity.

Scaringe said the Georgia operation, able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028, is the “foundation for our growth.”

Rivian plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company said it’s limiting production in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So, they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

The Challenges

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025’s first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors’ slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%.

By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful startup automaker.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis recently canceled Ram’s electric truck program.

Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles in suburban Detroit.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

State Incentives

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average.

Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, said he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” but acknowledged that “the road to get here has not been smooth.”

He voiced confidence that Rivian can deliver “an innovation revolution” benefiting Georgians.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt.

Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre site near Social Circle, about 45 miles east of Atlanta.

As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology.

And then-President Joe Biden’s administration agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration’s hostility toward EVs, Scaringe said that Rivian has built “a very close relationship” with the U.S. Department of Energy and that the company’s goals align with some of Trump’s big ones, including “U.S. manufacturing, U.S. technology, U.S. technology that supports global business, and leading in all those areas.”

Kemp said he has urged Energy Secretary Chris Wright to back Rivian.

Opposing Views

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away.

He said his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs.

President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) has overhauled tax credits and sharply shortened eligibility windows for solar and wind projects as part of an “energy dominance” agenda focused on oil, gas, coal and nuclear, in a sharp departure from the green energy-focused policies under his predecessor Joe Biden.

“There’s likely to be consolidation due to a variety of federal moves of late, including the recently passed tax bill (OBBBA) which eliminates investment tax credits,” said Gregg Felton, CEO of Connecticut-based Altus Power.

Clean energy deals surged to 63 with a combined value of around $34 billion in the first half of 2025, according to KPMG, versus roughly 57 deals worth about $7 billion in the second half of 2024.

Compounding the worries, the Inflation Reduction Act, which had allowed projects to use or sell credits to lower construction costs, was rolled back earlier this year, while loan guarantees for green projects were scrapped in late December.

The compressed deadlines and reduced support could force smaller players to merge, form joint ventures, or sell assets to survive, said John Villali, senior research director at IDC Energy Insights.

Sunnova Energy NOVAQ.PK recently lost a $2.92 billion loan guarantee.

Savvy buyers await

Private equity firms and utilities are already circling.

In late August, CBRE Investment Management agreed to acquire ClearGen, a clean energy developer and manager backed by Blackstone BX.N with more than 250 projects across 14 states.

Disruptions are industry-wide but nimble developers and market-aware investors will still find opportunities, ClearGen CEO Rob Howard said.

Larger utilities and private equity investors with stronger balance sheets and risk tolerance are lapping up the undervalued assets.

“We are on the buy side…actively dealing with greenfield developers and other energy companies,” said independent power producer Agilitas Energy CEO Barrett Bilotta.

September new-vehicle sales are expected to grow 6% year-over-year, with a SAAR of 16.2 million despite fewer selling days.

EV sales reached a Q3 record of 410,000 units, about 10% of total sales, fueled by expiring federal tax credits.

The Big Four automakers — GM, Toyota, Ford, and Hyundai — are driving market growth, while others see minimal gains or declines.

U.S. new-vehicle sales are projected to rise in September, reflecting continued market resilience despite economic uncertainty and shifting policy. Cox Automotive forecasts the seasonally adjusted annual rate, or SAAR, for September at 16.2 million units, up from 15.8 million a year earlier and slightly higher than August’s 16.1 million pace. Overall, sales volume is expected to increase 6% year-over-year, while declining 14.9% from the previous month due to fewer selling days.

The third quarter saw strong consumer demand, supported by low inflation, steady unemployment, and a healthy stock market. A significant part of this growth stems from high demand for electric vehicles, as consumers rush to make purchases before the $7,500 federal tax credit expires at the end of September.

Electric vehicle sales are on track to set a quarterly record. Cox Automotive estimates that 410,000 EVs will be sold in Q3, a 21.1% increase from the same period in 2024 and more than 30% above Q2 figures. EVs are expected to account for roughly 10% of all new-vehicle sales, surpassing the previous peak of 8.7% in Q4 2024. EV sales are expected to slow in Q4 as incentives expire, although long-term growth remains likely.

Overall, Q3 new-vehicle sales are forecast to climb 6.2% year-over-year but fall 1.6% compared to Q2. The majority of gains are expected from the four largest automakers — General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Hyundai — which are projected to post combined sales growth of 11.2%. Other automakers are expected to see minimal gains of just 0.1%. Year-to-date, the Big Four have increased sales by 9.1%, while other automakers have experienced a 2% decline.

Looking ahead, analysts anticipate that market conditions will become more challenging. EV sales are likely to drop in the final quarter, while higher import costs and new tariffs could push vehicle prices upward.

However, the strong performance in Q3 has improved the industry outlook.

Duke Energy is making permanent repairs to three substations across the region that experienced flooding during the storm.

Jeff Brooks with Duke Energy said the substations are operational, and the repairs will help strengthen the grid impacted by Helene.

A total of 2.7 million Duke Energy customers in the Carolinas lost power during the storm. Additionally, more than 350 substations were damaged, some requiring extensive repairs due to flooding. Brooks said he's never seen the scale of infrastructure damage Helene caused.

The power company is using technology to improve its systems.

“We’re upgrading polls and wires to make them stronger and more resistant to high winds. We're adding things like self-healing technology that can automatically restore power when an outage occurs, and we’re increasing capacity,” Brooks said. “This is a growing area, and we need to make sure that power stays reliable.”

Last year, the upgrade to self-healing technology kept many customers from losing power.

“Self-healing technology automatically detects an outage and then looks for other power lines to reroute power, and that technology helped to avoid more than 100,000 outages just here in Buncombe County last year, and nearly half of those were during storms,” Brooks said.

While standing in Duke Energy’s Asheville operations center Friday, Brooks said that as they reflect on a year since the storm, they remember how important it is to be there for customers.

8 Designation of Ten Chemical Substances for Initial Risk Evaluations Under the Toxic Substances Control Act, 81 Fed.","As previously covered in a Holland & Knight alert, the 2016 amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) required the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a regulatory process for evaluating the risks of existing chemicals, leading to the issuance of the 2017 Framework Rule under the first Trump Administration.1 The Biden Administration subsequently released the 2024 Framework Rule, which made substantive changes to the 2017 Rule, including, most notably, requiring EPA to 1) evaluate every ""condition of use"" associated with the chemical substance, 2) issue a single risk determination for each chemical as opposed to determining risk on a use-by-use basis and 3) make certain assumptions about the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by workers.2 Industry and labor associations challenged the 2024 Framework Rule in federal court, but litigation is currently stayed pending EPA's ongoing rulemaking to revise the Framework Rule.

Key Changes in Proposed Framework Rule

EPA's Proposed Framework Rule, published on Sept. 23, 2025, includes several substantial policy shifts from the 2024 Framework Rule, largely reverting the Framework Rule back to 2017 Rule. These changes include:

Discretion to Scope Conditions of Use. The Proposed Rule rescinds the 2024 Rule's requirement that EPA evaluate all conditions of use and exposure pathways, instead stating that the agency has ""discretion"" to determine which conditions of use to evaluate and focus on uses that pose the greatest exposure risk.

Risk Determination on a Use-by-Use Basis. The Proposed Rule restores the 2017 Rule's requirement for EPA to make a determination of unreasonable risk for each of the conditions of use within the scope of a chemical's risk evaluation, reversing the 2024 Rule's requirement to make ""a single risk determination on the chemical substance as a whole.""3

Account for Use of PPE in Evaluating Exposures. The Proposed Rule reverses the 2024 Framework Rule's approach to consideration of the use of personal protective equipment by workers, which resulted in varying interpretations across industry groups regarding whether the approach to PPE applied at the risk evaluation or risk determination stage. Instead, the Proposed Rule allows EPA to account for ""reasonably available information on the implementation and use of occupational exposure control measures such as engineering and administrative controls and personal protective equipment when evaluating exposure risks.""4

Removal of Overburdened Communities. The Proposed Rule removes the 2024 Framework Rule's addition of ""overburdened communities"" to the regulatory definition of ""potentially exposed and susceptible subpopulations.""5

Manufacturer-Requested Risk Evaluations. The Proposed Rule scales back the information manufacturers would be required to provide to EPA for a manufacturer-requested risk evaluation from what was included in the 2024 Framework Rule and clarifies that ""manufacturers that withdraw a request before it is granted do not incur fees.""6

If finalized, EPA will apply the changes in the Proposed Rule ""to all risk evaluations initiated on or after the date of the final rule and would be applied to risk evaluations that are in process as of the date of the final rule, but not yet finalized, to the extent practicable.""7 Given the potential impact of the Proposed Rule on chemical regulation across numerous industries, it is likely that EPA will receive a substantial number of public comments and may ultimately modify these proposals in the Final Rule. It is anticipated that EPA will publish a final Framework Rule sometime in 2026.

Implications for Ongoing Risk Evaluations

The Proposed Rule, once finalized, will be the third version of a Framework Rule to be implemented by EPA. While litigation on the 2017 Framework Rule resulted in a 2019 court decision that rejected that rule's exclusion of ""legacy uses and associated disposals"" from the conditions of use that EPA would include in risk evaluations, the court declined to rule on other policies (such as the requirement that EPA make risk determinations for each condition of use rather than for the whole chemical, as well as the discretion for EPA to exclude conditions of use or entire exposure pathways from the conditions of use). Similarly, although litigants raised some of the same (and additional) policy issues in litigation on the 2024 Framework Rule, that case has been stayed pending EPA's finalization of this Proposed Rule.

In the meantime, EPA has indicated its intent to revise the risk evaluation for 1,4-dioxane, one of the ""first ten"" chemicals to undergo TSCA risk evaluation,8 and remains under consent decrees to issue final risk evaluations for most of the ""next twenty"" chemicals to undergo TSCA risk evaluations.9 While EPA has stated that it would continue to comply with the 2024 Framework Rule until this proposed Framework Rule is finalized and it would only incorporate the final provisions into ongoing risk evaluations to the extent practicable, the prolonged absence of settled foundational risk evaluation policies has created some regulatory uncertainty for the industry since TSCA's amendments were passed in 2016.

Finally, it is important to note the potential implications of these and other existing chemical developments on state preemption – one of industry's top priorities when U.S. Congress enacted the 2016 TSCA amendments. The finalization of risk management rules is the statutory trigger for TSCA's more stringent and permanent state preemption provisions; however, the majority of the risk evaluations initiated by EPA to date have not completed the risk management stage. Moreover, temporary ""pause preemption"" has expired for the ""next 20"" chemicals and has not begun for the five chemicals EPA designated as high priority in December 202410. Accordingly, states could, in theory, promulgate their own regulations on these chemicals, setting the stage for a potential regulatory patchwork morass.

Next Steps and Considerations

Companies who may be impacted by the Proposed Rule should consider submitting public comments to EPA by Nov. 7, 2025.

Holland & Knight's Public Policy & Regulation Group is distinctly qualified to assist with TSCA considerations. The team includes key contributors to the drafting and negotiation of the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, a former assistant administrator for EPA's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention and a litigation team that worked on behalf of the industry challenging the 2024 Framework Rule. In addition, members of Holland & Knight's Environmental Team – who focus on TSCA and chemicals – continue to monitor ongoing developments and evaluate the potential impacts to businesses and industries.

The report forecast U.S. storage will reach 87.8 GW by 2029, driven by residential and utility-scale segments.
Otherwise, your data will be deleted if pv magazine has processed your request or the purpose of data storage is fulfilled.","The United States had a record quarter for battery energy storage deployment in Q2 2025, adding 5.6 GW of installations, said a report released by the American Clean Power Association (ACP) and Wood Mackenzie.

Utility-scale storage led the way, adding 4.9 GW in quarter and growing 62% year-over-year. This is enough to power 3.7 million U.S. homes during average peak demand hours, said ACP.

California, Texas and Arizona each added more than 1 GW of storage in the quarter, said the report. Wood Mackenzie forecast that Florida and Georgia will be major growth markets ahead due to aggressive procurements by vertically integrated utilities. For example, Georgia Power just issued a request for proposals for 500 MW of grid-scale storage.

However, supply challenges may hamper utility-scale growth, said Allison Weis, global head of storage, Wood Mackenzie. Weiss commented:

After 2025, utility-scale storage projects must comply with new, stringent battery sourcing requirements to receive the ITC. While domestic cell supply is ramping up, supply chain shortages are possible, although developers are continuing to consider supply from China to fill in any gaps. A rush to start construction under the more certain near-term regulatory framework uplifts the near-term forecast. Projects that have not met certain milestones by the end of 2025 are at risk of exposure to changing regulations. There is additional downside risk if further permitting delays threaten solar and storage projects.

The residential storage market saw a leap in installations in Q2 as well. It added 608 MW in the quarter, representing a 132% increase year-on-year. Most of the growth was driven by California, Arizona and Illinois, as attachment rates hit new highs and higher-capacity systems gained market share.

Batteries are included at an increased rate in quoted residential solar projects, said a report from EnergySage. Outside of Hawaii, which has a 100% battery attachment rate, California led the way among top-ten solar state markets, with 79% of quoted projects including batteries. This was followed by Texas (61%), Arizona (47%), Utah (44%), Florida (43%) and Illinois (25%).

“Residential storage is expected to outpace solar due to stronger policy resilience, high attachment rates in key markets like California and Puerto Rico, and continued ITC access through third-party ownership,” said Allison Feeney, research analyst, Wood Mackenzie.

The community-scale, commercial and industrial segment expanded 11% in Q2, adding 38 MW. California and New York led Q2 in the segment’s storage installations, accounting for over 70% of total capacity, while Illinois gained traction, said ACP.

The report forecast U.S. storage will reach 87.8 GW by 2029, driven by residential and utility-scale segments.

However, the report warns U.S. utility-scale storage installations could drop 10% year-over-year in 2027 largely due to uncertainty over pending Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) regulations on battery cell sourcing.

Guatemala’s Government Procurement Law requires most government purchases over $116,000 to be submitted for public competitive bidding.
Guatemala ratified the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) in November 2006 and the Inter-American Convention against Corruption in 2001.
Additionally, roughly 5.1 million individuals, or 70.8 percent of the total workforce, work in the informal sector, including some who are too young for formal sector employment.
However, many workers, especially in the agricultural sector, do not receive the full compensation package mandated in the labor law.","Bribery is illegal under Guatemala’s Penal Code. Guatemala scored 25 out of 100 points on Transparency International’s 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index and improved its ranking from 154 to 146 (out of 180 countries), globally, and 27 out of 32 countries in the region. The law provides criminal penalties for official corruption, but the Public Ministry (MP) prosecuted very few government corruption cases.

Investors report pervasive corruption in public procurement, including requests for payment of bribes in exchange for awarding public contracts. Investors and importers are frequently frustrated by opaque customs transactions, particularly at ports and borders. In 2021, Tax and Customs Authority (SAT) implemented additional customs reforms that route flagged shipments to a dedicated interagency secondary inspection team for resolution, rather than assigning the case to the original inspector. The change eliminates opportunity for an inspector to impose deliberate delays, but allegations persist that shipments are held by secondary inspection teams in order to extract corrupt payments from importers and exporters.

From 2006 to 2019, the UN-sponsored International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) undertook numerous high-profile official corruption investigations, leading to many indictments. For example, CICIG unveiled a customs corruption scheme in 2015 that led to the resignations of the former president and vice president. In 2019, then-President Morales terminated CICIG. Subsequent actions taken by Attorney General Consuelo Porras have impeded and undone the work of anti-corruption investigations including the infamous Odebrecht bribery scandal, increased and posed additional risks for potential new investors. In 2024, the Guatemalan tax authority (SAT) revealed it had uncovered a tax fraud scheme (“B410”) in which a network of 410 companies with government contracts sought to evade 800 million quetzales (approximately $105 million) in taxes between 2021 and 2023. To date, the Public Ministry has made no arrests. The administration of President Arevalo has prioritized anti-corruption efforts, including promulgation of a code of ethics for government employees, establishment of probity units at various ministries, and efforts to promote transparency through digitalization, but these have produced limited results.

Guatemala’s Government Procurement Law requires most government purchases over $116,000 to be submitted for public competitive bidding. Guatemalan government entities are required to use Guatecompras, which tracks government procurement processes. Guatemalan government entities must also comply with government procurement commitments under CAFTA-DR. In August 2009, the Guatemalan Congress approved reforms to the Government Procurement Law, which simplified bidding procedures; eliminated the fee previously charged to receive bidding documents; and provided an additional opportunity for suppliers to raise objections over the bidding process. Despite these reforms, large government procurements are often subject to appeals and injunctions based on claims of irregularities in the bidding process (e.g., documentation issues and lack of transparency). In November 2015, the Guatemalan Congress approved additional amendments to the Government Procurement Law that aimed to improve the transparency of the procurement processes by barring government contracts for:

some financiers of political campaigns and parties,

members of Congress,

other elected officials,

government workers, and

their immediate family members.

However, there continue to be multiple allegations of corruption and nepotism in the procurement process. The 2015 reforms expanded the scope of procurement oversight to include public trust funds and all institutions (including NGOs) executing public funds. The U.S. government continues to advocate for the use of open, fair, and transparent tenders in government procurement as well as procedures that comply with CAFTA-DR obligations, which would allow open participation by U.S. companies.

Guatemala ratified the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) in November 2006 and the Inter-American Convention against Corruption in 2001. In 2012, the Guatemalan Congress approved an anti-corruption law that increased penalties for existing crimes and added new crimes, such as:

illicit enrichment,

trafficking in influence, and

illegal charging of commissions.

Guatemala National Civil Police (PNC) data indicates homicides declined in 2024 to 16.1 per 100,000 inhabitants, a 3.6 percent decline compared to 2023. This decrease for a second consecutive year followed a slight uptick in 2021 and 2022 after the Guatemalan government lifted the pandemic restrictions in 2021, but numbers are still below pre-pandemic levels and follow over a decade of declining rates. The judicial system faces significant delays in case processing and investigation, including lack of transparency and systemic bureaucratic inefficiency in the Public Ministry. Police often lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents. Criminal groups operating in Guatemala are involved in a number of illicit activities, including:

armed robbery,

carjacking,

extortions,

violent street crime,

drug trafficking,

kidnapping, and

arms trafficking.

Crimes of opportunity, including theft, are frequent.

The political climate in Guatemala is generally stable but characterized by periodic civil disturbances. In November 2020, civil unrest sparked by congressional approval of the 2021 budget proposal, which added to long-standing grievances. Initially peaceful protests were marred by isolated acts of vandalism and violence, including setting fire to the national congress building, as well as acts of violence by both security forces against some protestors and by some protestors against security forces. The main source of tension among indigenous communities, Guatemalan authorities, and private companies is the lack of prior consultation and alleged environmental damage from major investment projects, including mining.

In October 2021, former President Giammattei declared a State of Siege in El Estor as dozens of protestors – including environmental defenders, indigenous activists, and outside agitators – blocked coal trucks from accessing a nickel mine and allegedly clashed with National Police (PNC) forces who attempted to clear the road for mining traffic. Protests and highway roadblocks organized by transportation workers, public health and education workers, and military veterans have caused disruption and heightened security, impacting general mobility and traffic on a recurring basis in recent years.

Despite this history of unrest, general elections in 2023 were largely peaceful and there were no major incidents of reported violence. Attempts to undermine the results of the election by antidemocratic forces, however, led in October 2023 to widespread road blockages and protests for several weeks that largely stopped economic activity across the country. These protests were led principally by indigenous communities and widely supported by urban residents upset with the antidemocratic actions. Although nationwide in scope, these protests and roadblocks were uniformly peaceful and there was a noticeable lack of conflict between protest groups and government security forces. A negotiated solution allowed economic activity to resume after several weeks and involved:

indigenous leaders,

civil society,

the incoming government, and

private sector groups.

Since the inauguration of President Arevalo in January 2024, there have been occasional incidents of large demonstrations or roadblocks to protest specific government policies, particularly in Guatemala City, but these have been resolved peacefully and have generally only lasted a few days. Damage to projects or installations is rare. However, there were instances in August 2017 and October 2018 in which unidentified arsonists burned machinery and other equipment at the site of a hydroelectric construction project near the northern border with Mexico. Additionally, activist groups at times have engaged in blockades to prevent personnel, materials, and equipment from entering or leaving disputed installations.

According to the 2021 national survey of employment and income, the Guatemalan workforce consists of an estimated 2.1 million individuals employed in the formal sector. Additionally, roughly 5.1 million individuals, or 70.8 percent of the total workforce, work in the informal sector, including some who are too young for formal sector employment. According to the 2022-2023 National Survey on Household Income and Expenditures, 17.8 percent of children ages 10 to 14 are engaged in child labor, particularly in rural areas. The informal economy represented 22 percent of GDP in 2019 according to official data. About 75.7 percent of female workers and 84.9 percent of indigenous workers were employed in the informal sector.

Approximately 30 percent of the total labor force is engaged in agricultural work. The availability of a large, unskilled, and inexpensive labor force led many employers, such as construction and agricultural firms, to use labor-intensive production methods. Roughly 14 percent of the employed workforce is illiterate. However, in developed urban areas education levels are much higher and there is a growing service sector that requires workers with higher levels of skills. Highly capable technical and managerial workers remain in short supply.

Export-processing zones are subject to regular labor laws and do not receive any special labor exemptions. The minimum wage varies according to the employer’s geographic location and economic sector. The economic sector with the lowest minimum wage is manufacturing, followed by the agricultural sector. All other sectors are subject to the highest minimum wage. The labor code and a Ministry of Labor agreement, based on ILO Convention 175, allow part time work. Employers can hire workers for six hours or fewer per workday for wages and benefits equivalent to the fraction of full time work they complete.

The Labor Code requires that at least 90 percent of employees be Guatemalan, but the requirement does not apply to high-level positions, such as managers and directors. The Labor Code sets out:

employer responsibilities regarding working conditions, especially health and safety standards;

benefits;

severance pay;

premium pay for overtime work;

minimum wages; and

bonuses.

Mandatory benefits, bonuses, and employer contributions to the social security system can add up to about 55 percent of an employee’s base pay. However, many workers, especially in the agricultural sector, do not receive the full compensation package mandated in the labor law. All employees are subject to a two-month trial period during which time they may resign or be discharged without any obligation on the part of the employer or employee. For any dismissal after the two-month trial period, the employer must pay unpaid wages for work already performed, proportional bonuses, and proportional vacation time. If an employer dismisses an employee without just cause, the employer must also pay severance equal to one month’s regular pay for each full year of employment. Guatemala does not have unemployment insurance or other social safety net programs for workers laid off for economic reasons.

Guatemala’s Constitution guarantees the right of workers to unionize and to strike, with an exception to the right to strike for security force members and workers employed in hospitals, telecommunications, and other public services considered essential to public safety. Before a strike can be declared, workers and employers must engage in mandatory conciliation and then approve a strike vote by 50 percent plus one worker in the enterprise. If conciliation fails, either party may ask the judge for a ruling on the legality of conducting a strike or lockout. Legal strikes in Guatemala are extremely rare. The Constitution also commits the state to support and protect collective bargaining and holds that international labor conventions ratified by Guatemala establish the minimum labor rights of workers if they offer greater protections than national law. In most cases, labor unions operate independently of the government and employers both by law and in practice. The law requires unions to register with the Ministry of Labor and their leadership must obtain credentials to carry out their functions. Delays in such proceedings are common. The law prohibits anti-union discrimination and employer interference in union activities and requires employers to reinstate workers dismissed for organizing union activities. A combination of inadequate allocation of budget resources for labor rights enforcement to the Ministry of Labor and other relevant state institutions, and inefficient administrative and justice sector processes, act as significant impediments for more effective enforcement of labor laws to protect these workers’ rights. As a result, investigating, prosecuting, and punishing employers who violate these guarantees remain a challenge, particularly the enforcement of labor court orders requiring reinstatement and payment of back wages resulting from dismissal. The rate of unionization in Guatemala is very low.

Both the U.S. government and Guatemalan workers have filed complaints against the Guatemalan government for allegedly failing to adequately enforce its labor laws and protect the rights of workers. In 2014, the U.S. government convened an arbitration panel alleging that Guatemala had failed to meet its obligations under CAFTA-DR to enforce effectively its labor laws related to freedom of association and collective bargaining and acceptable conditions of work. In 2017, the panel issued a decision recognizing that Guatemala had failed to adequately enforce its labor laws but that the United States did not prove this failure impacted trade between the two countries. Separately, the Guatemalan government is facing an International Labor Organization (ILO) complaint filed by workers in 2023 alleging that the government has failed to comply with ILO Conventions 87 and 98 on freedom of association and collective bargaining and calling for the establishment of an ILO Commission of Inquiry, which is the ILO’s highest level of scrutiny when all other means failed to address issues of concern. The Guatemalan government continues to provide the ILO with quarterly updates on its efforts to improve its compliance with these conventions. This complaint follows a similar complaint filed by worker organizations in 2012 alleging non-compliance with ILO Convention 87. That complaint was closed in 2018 after the Guatemalan government agreed to implement a roadmap with social partners to address shortcomings in labor law enforcement and workers’ rights protections. The government continues to implement this roadmap.",https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Seal_only-1.png,N,,2025-09-26 14:02:43.933027

“That actually drives up interest and perhaps creates the kind of momentum we need for the future.” Private governance is augmenting the influence of corporations in driving environmental and climate action.
For students entering environmental law, the future will be defined by crisis-driven opportunities, and rapid public response will open windows for reform.","In the latter half of the 20th century, landmark U.S. environmental laws were passed with overwhelming bipartisan majorities—the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, the Clean Water Act in 1972, and the Clean Air Act Amendments in 1990. This statute-driven era reflected a top-down model of governance, positioning the United States as a bellwether in global environmental policy. Today’s policy landscape looks markedly different. With gridlock at the federal level, environmental governance now emerges in waves of top-down statutes and increasingly influential bottom-up initiatives as the world’s governments, corporations, and citizens contest the future direction of environmental law.

Vanderbilt Law’s Energy, Environment & Land Use (EELU) Program and Environmental Law & Policy Annual Review (ELPAR) hosted John Cruden for the 2025 Distinguished Lecture on Climate Change Governance. The event was presented by EELU Faculty Co-Directors Michael P. Vandenbergh and J.B. Ruhl and made possible by the Sally Shellenberger Brown EELU Fund.

Mr. Cruden is Principal at Beveridge & Diamond, P.C., where he advises clients on high-stakes environmental litigation, enforcement, and compliance matters. He previously served as Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) at the U.S. Department of Justice, where he led landmark cases including the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the Volkswagen emissions scandal. His four-decade career spans service as Chief Legislative Counsel of the U.S. Army and combat duty in Vietnam, senior leadership at ENRD, and presidency of the Environmental Law Institute.

The Origins of Modern Environmental Law

Cruden tied the birth of modern U.S. environmental legislation to what he called “Cuyahoga moments”—highly visible crises that galvanized public awareness and political response. The term references the 1969 Cuyahoga River Fire caused by the river being so densely polluted with industrial waste that it ignited. It represented the first of a series of environmental disasters that sparked national outrage and laid the groundwork for the Clean Water Act, which Congress enacted over President Richard Nixon’s veto.

“A lot of our statutes were born of tragedy,” Cruden noted. Love Canal’s toxic contamination prompted the creation of Superfund, the Exxon Valdez oil spill led to the Oil Pollution Act, and deadly widespread smog accelerated the Clean Air Act. These events, he argued, defined an era when bipartisan consensus enabled sweeping legislative reforms. For nearly two decades, this “top-down” approach positioned the United States as the global leader in environmental governance. Congress, the courts, and newly created agencies—most notably the Environmental Protection Agency—worked in tandem to build a comprehensive statutory framework.

“The United States didn’t actually create much law in our lifetime. We got most of it from the Greeks and Romans and Brits,” he said. “There is an exception—we created environmental law without question. The body of law that people talk about as environmental law, it came from the United States. Now 93 percent of the countries in the world have something that looks like our National Environmental Policy Act.”

From Top-Down to Bottom-Up Governance

After the golden era of bipartisan statute-making ended in 1990, the top-down model for environmental governance effectively ended. Congressional gridlock has since prevented passage of major statutes, even as new challenges and climate social movements have emerged.

Cruden described a shift in governance toward bottom-up approaches, driven by state initiatives, corporate policies, and international frameworks. He pointed to reform of the Toxic Substances Control Act as a key example. This effort not originate in Congress, but from mounting pressure at other levels of governance. Eighteen states enacted their own chemical safety laws to protect air and water, filling what he described as a regulatory vacuum. At the same time, international developments exerted influence, particularly the European Union’s adoption of REACH—more expansive and stringent than U.S. law. “Out of the state issues, out of a little Cuyahoga moment, out of what was happening internationally, there became a consensus for change,” he explained.

“I’m thinking this is a ‘bottom-up’ because Congress tried and failed. But what happened? People underneath them, people like me and you, corporations but also NGOs and runway groups, they then were responsible for change.”

The Role of Technology and Private Governance

New tools and technologies—ranging from drones and satellites to low-cost air and water testing kits—are reshaping environmental governance by transforming how pollution can be monitored and enforced. “For a relatively small amount of money now, you can get testing data for both air and water that is pretty accurate,” Cruden noted, adding that these tools empower citizens to hold agencies and corporations accountable. “That actually drives up interest and perhaps creates the kind of momentum we need for the future.”

Private governance is augmenting the influence of corporations in driving environmental and climate action. Contrary to widespread public criticism, Cruden argued that multinational companies are shaping greener outcomes through supply chains and contracting practices. Walmart, for instance, can compel thousands of suppliers to adopt stricter environmental standards simply as a condition of doing business. CEOs at firms like DuPont and Johnson & Johnson have invested in greener product design and efficiency measures to align with consumer demand. But Cruden cautioned that corporate action is not a substitute for public law. “Two-thirds of America still believes corporations are not doing enough,” he said, emphasizing that private commitments must complement statutory enforcement and work in coordination with regulators, NGOs, and international frameworks.

Passing the Baton

The next phase of environmental law demands effective advocates who know how to frame issues in ways that resonate with both the public and policymakers, Cruden said. He pointed to the Montreal Protocol as an example of bipartisan success, where leaders like George Shultz and President Ronald Reagan framed action on ozone depletion as an “insurance policy,” a phrase that diffused debates and built trust, negotiation, and consensus.

“If there is a Cuyahoga moment, are you ready?” he asked students. “We need good communicators if we’re going to do bottom-up.”

Looking ahead, he outlined the building blocks of the next era of governance. For students entering environmental law, the future will be defined by crisis-driven opportunities, and rapid public response will open windows for reform. Statutes and enforcement remain essential, but progress will increasingly depend on the interplay of state leadership, citizen engagement, corporate responsibility, and international standards. New technologies will only be effective if paired with legal frameworks and political will.

“I want you to be knowledgeable out there. I want you to study. I want you to be able to communicate,” Cruden said. “I’m asking you to know and understand and be able to talk about why we have billion-dollar events occurring, why we have sea levels rising, why we have fires everywhere, why all of that is occurring. I’m getting to the point of my life where I’m ready to pass the baton.”",https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-sub/wp-content/uploads/sites/281/2025/09/26115844/John-Cruden-1024x614.png,N,,2025-09-26 14:02:48.040484

The Collaborative will ensure that elected leaders representing the 67 million people PJM serves have a greater voice in decisions that affect household energy bills and grid reliability.

In launching the Collaborative, the governors signed a joint statement of intent(opens in a new tab) “to promote greater state and consumer representation in the governance and decision-making processes of PJM Interconnection, in order to ensure the provision of affordable, safe, and reliable electricity for their residents and businesses.”

At the historic summit this week in Philadelphia, more than 450 stakeholders from across PJM gathered in Philadelphia gathered to address rising energy costs, grid reliability, and PJM’s governance issues.

Governor Shapiro, who has consistently pushed PJM to reform its processes and lower consumer costs, opened the Summit(opens in a new tab) by warning that if PJM fails to act decisively, Pennsylvania and other states may be forced to consider alternatives to the current PJM grid. Governor Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, Governor Wes Moore of Maryland, and Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey also addressed the Summit, advocating for real reform to PJM’s governance structure and markets.

“For nearly a century, Pennsylvanians have trusted PJM to keep the lights on,” said Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. “But PJM has been too slow to bring new generation online and too quick to saddle families with higher bills. It’s not working anymore – and it’s time to get serious about reform. If PJM won’t move fast enough, Pennsylvania and our partner states are prepared to chart a new course in the interest of hard-working families we represent. The PJM Governors’ Collaborative will create a forum for the states to discuss the issues most impacting consumers and put forth a united voice when navigating these critical discussions.”

“Rising electricity costs are stretching the paychecks of working Delawareans, from small business owners trying to budget to families just trying to make ends meet,"" said Delaware Governor Matt Meyer. ""Large new load projects like data centers are part of the story, but so are delays in bringing more power online and permitting regulations that haven’t kept up with diverse needs. With the PJM Governors’ Collaborative, we’re insisting on accountability and a stronger voice for states in how our grid is managed. Together, we can bring new generation online faster and ensure every Delaware family has a utility bill they can manage.""

""For far too long, PJM has made decisions with minimal input from the states, leaving families and businesses to bear skyrocketing energy costs and rising reliability risks,"" said Illinois Governor JB Pritzker. ""I’m proud to join this bipartisan collective to ensure states have a meaningful voice in shaping the region’s energy future. Together, we’re sending a clear message that PJM must prioritize affordability, reliability, and accountability for the people it serves.""

“As Maryland families see double-digit rate increases and Maryland businesses see the ability to compete threatened by rising energy expenses, we are calling for increased transparency and accountability to improve the grid and lower costs for our citizens,” said Maryland Governor Wes Moore. “I am proud to stand with my fellow governors and we will continue in this fight for a grid that is safe, reliable, and affordable.”

“We must build a system that works better and more transparently for the millions of people in the region that PJM serves,” said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy. “I’m glad to see our regional states coming together across party lines to demand better. This week’s historic conference and this collaborative effort will continue to strengthen our engagement on this issue as the PJM states unite in our push for reforms to deliver affordable electricity.”

""Virginia’s growth has led to the fastest expansion in energy demand since WWII,” said Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin. “Unfortunately, rather than providing energy and power strategies that deliver for Virginia’s needs by unlocking investment and fast-tracking critical projects, PJM has instead been responsible for bottlenecks and delays that crush jobs, drive up utility bills, and leave families and businesses hurting. We cannot afford a grid operator that is slow to adapt and blind to the realities of surging demand, and we won’t sit back and accept a system that puts bureaucratic process over results. That’s why I’m joining governors of other PJM states to launch the PJM Governors Collaborative. Together, we are demanding real reforms from PJM that put consumers first, accelerate new generation, and restore confidence in the future of our grid.""

Governors Unite to Demand Change

PJM governors are joining together to raise concerns about the grid management organization’s reactive approach that have driven energy costs higher for families and businesses across the 13-state region. Together, the governors are taking action to ensure states have a stronger voice in PJM’s governance and decision-making.

The governors underscored that while PJM is the nation’s largest grid operator, serving 67 million people, it also has the fewest avenues for states and consumers to influence outcomes that directly affect energy bills. They emphasized that states deserve a seat at the table to ensure PJM reforms its governance structure, speeds up interconnection of new energy projects, and prevents future price spikes.

Energy leaders have also been direct(opens in a new tab) about the need to reform PJM’s markets — a message echoed throughout the Summit as states, regulators, and utilities alike called for accountability and faster action.

Over the last decade, PJM has assumed greater responsibility for balancing supply and demand, yet has repeatedly failed to move new generation through its interconnection queue – earning a D- rating(opens in a new tab) for speed. These delays come as demand is surging, driven in part by rapid data center growth, and as the Trump Administration cuts funding for near-complete clean energy projects.

The result: record-high PJM capacity auction prices, leading to billions of dollars in added costs for consumers across the region.

Collaborative will Push Forward Ideas for Real Reform

The Summit also served as a launching pad for three major reforms, which will be the subject of future discussions among the PJM Governors Collaborative:

Improved load forecasting – to remove speculative projects that inflate prices but are unlikely to be built.

A bifurcated PJM auction – capping prices for existing power plants while allowing new plants to receive higher rates, ensuring reliability without excessive costs.

Governance changes – to give states and their citizens a stronger voice, including through the new Governors’ Collaborative.

The PJM Governors’ Collaborative will continue meeting after this week’s Summit to develop and advance shared proposals for reform.

Governor Shapiro’s Track Record of Delivering Results

Since taking office, Governor Shapiro has consistently fought to hold PJM accountable(opens in a new tab):

Created a fast-track Reliability Resource Initiative (RRI) to allow quicker interconnection of key projects. This will result in 9.3 GW of baseload power (mostly gas) to be built across the region in the next seven years.

Included the Crane Clean Energy Center in RRI, allowing it to enter service years sooner than would otherwise have been possible. This will add 3,400 jobs to Dauphin County and bring 835 MW of clean, reliable power to the grid.

Entered into a settlement with Pennsylvania following the 206 complaint that lowered the maximum price of its capacity auction for two years, likely saving consumers more than $16 billion.

Accepted the Governor’s proposal to begin planning for a sub-annual capacity market, which is expected to save consumers billions of dollars over time.

Pennsylvania has a long legacy as an energy leader and the Summit is a demonstration of Governor Shapiro’s commitment to Pennsylvanians to create energy jobs, lower costs for consumers, and ensure the Commonwealth continues to be a national energy leader for decades to come.

Foothill Transit carries over 11 million customers a year across San Gabriel Valley, Pomona Valley, and downtown Los Angeles, with 33 zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell buses currently operating out of its Pomona station – the first hydrogen station Foothill commissioned Clean Energy to construct in 2021. The Pomona station has been operating since June 2023 and Clean Energy continues to oversee its operations and maintenance.

“We’ve had a longstanding relationship as trusted partners of Foothill Transit for over two decades,” said Chad Lindholm, senior vice president at Clean Energy. “We’re proud to support their transition to clean fuels – whether it’s RNG or hydrogen. Foothill continues to set the standard for sustainability in transit, and we’re excited to help expand their hydrogen infrastructure as they move proactively toward a zero-emissions future.”

Foothill Transit is committed to expanding its low-emissions bus fleet and continues to lead the charge in sustainable transportation with California’s largest fleet of hydrogen fuel cell buses.

The new Arcadia station, which will store liquid hydrogen and dispense it in gaseous form, is currently in the design stage with construction scheduled to begin in mid-2026.

The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)—the two agencies that share oversight of LNG export terminal projects (“LNG Terminals”)—are reshaping the regulatory landscape to ease approval of new LNG infrastructure.

Traditionally, LNG Terminals have faced lengthy reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), with the preparation and revision of environmental impact statements (EIS), often stretching out for years.[1] Sponsors must clear both FERC (for construction) and DOE (for exports), creating a process that is notorious for delays. FERC has the authority for approving the “siting, construction, expansion, or operation of an LNG terminal,” while the DOE has the “exclusive authority over the export of LNG as a commodity.”[2]

Now, in response to the President Trump’s “Unleashing American Energy” agenda,[3] DOE and FERC have taken steps to cut red tape, speed approvals, and broaden discretion in environmental review. For project developers, this shift promises shorter timelines—and new strategic considerations—as the Trump administration pushes to expand U.S. LNG exports.

Rescission of NEPA Implementing Regulations

The Trump administration has moved to completely change the way that agencies apply NEPA by rescinding the existing regulations governing NEPA review.[4] NEPA’s statutory language requires that federal agencies conduct environmental reviews for all “major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”[5] When an agency determines that an action is a “major federal action,” it must prepare a detailed EIS.[6] An EIS “forces the agency to take a ‘hard look’ at the environmental consequences of its actions” and “ensures that these environmental consequences, and the agency’s consideration of them, are disclosed to the public.”[7]

Since 1978, agencies have relied on NEPA-implementing regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) when conducting environmental reviews. Many agencies, including FERC, have applied the CEQ’s regulations or referred to them in their own NEPA-implementing regulations.[8] However, Unleashing American Energy revoked the executive order that gave the CEQ the authority to issue these regulations and directed the agency to rescind them within 30 days.[9] The CEQ subsequently issued an Interim Final Rule rescinding the regulations.[10] On July 3, 2025, FERC issued a final rule revising its NEPA-implementing regulations to conform to the change.[11] The DOE followed suit with an Interim Final Rule issued the same day.[12]

While FERC’s changes simply removed all cross-references to the CEQ, the DOE’s changes were more significant. In addition to removing all references to the CEQ, the DOE revised its regulations “so that it includes only DOE’s existing categorical exclusions in appendix B, related requirements, and a provision for emergency circumstances.”[13] All of the DOE’s other NEPA procedures were removed from the Code of Federal Regulations and moved to a document titled U.S. Department of Energy National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Procedures.[14] Unlike the prior regulations, these procedures are non-binding and do not “impose legal obligations upon DOE,” and the agency is free to “adopt approaches on a case-by-case basis that differ from those described in these procedures.”[15]

Elimination of Stays on LNG Facility Construction While Rehearing Is Pending

Natural Gas Act (NGA) § 7 requires that parties opposing FERC’s approval of a construction project first request rehearing before FERC before they can seek judicial review of the approval. Under Order No. 871, FERC had previously barred construction of LNG and pipeline projects while those rehearing requests were pending.[16]

On June 18, 2025, FERC voted unanimously to at least temporarily permit construction to go forward while FERC considered rehearing requests by approving a one-year waiver of Order No. 871[17] and issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to permanently rescind that order.[18] FERC cited the “pressing nationwide near-term demand for expanded natural gas transportation capacity, as well as the reliability concerns associated with maintaining the natural gas system” as its reasons for the policy change.[19] Both the waiver and the potential permanent rescission of Order No. 871 have the potential “to expedite efficient energy development and reduce construction delays resulting from” pending rehearing requests.[20]

Expansion of Blanket Certificate Authority

FERC has issued a waiver and Notice of Inquiry for regulations pertaining to a certificate holder’s blanket certificate authority. Under NGA §7, interstate natural gas pipelines that hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity can conduct certain construction activities without first seeking case-specific authorizations, if those activities fall below a certain cost threshold.[21] The cost threshold was last increased to $41,100,000 in 2024.[22] If the construction activity falls below this threshold, the certificate holder can file a “prior notice request” for authorization with the Commission, and the Commission will provide notice of the request in the Federal Register.[23] If no one protests the request within 60 days, the certificate holder can commence construction on the project.[24]

On June 18, FERC unanimously approved a two-year waiver increasing the cost threshold.[25] The waiver order increases the threshold to $61,650,000.[26] The Commission also issued a Notice of Inquiry to consider permanent revisions to the cost threshold.[27] The Notice of Inquiry requests comments on whether FERC should include more projects within the scope of blanket certificate authorization, what the cost threshold should be, and what the rate treatment should be for these projects.[28]

Department of Energy LNG Export Study

Under section 3(a) of the Natural Gas Act, the DOE must approve natural gas export requests unless it finds that the proposed export “will not be consistent with the public interest.”[29] Exports to countries with which the United States has a free-trade agreement requiring national treatment for natural gas (FTA) are automatically deemed to be in the public interest.[30] For non-FTA countries, courts and the DOE have traditionally relied on a rebuttable presumption favoring exports.[31] However, on January 26, 2024, the Biden administration’s DOE paused approvals until it completed a 2024 study on LNG exports, which studied whether these exports were in fact “in the public interest.”[32] The study, which the DOE published on December 20, 2024, did not make any definitive findings on whether LNG exports were in the public interest, but it was negative in its evaluation of LNG exports.[33]

The Trump administration DOE reversed course when finalizing the 2024 study in a Response to Comments, striking a much more supportive tone.[34] The final report concluded “that exports of LNG from the United States will not be inconsistent with the public interest.”[35]

Courts Focus on Ensuring Approvals Are Adequately Supported

Over the last year, the judiciary has continued to evaluate agency approvals on a case-by-case basis, and the outcomes have largely turned on whether an agency supported its LNG approval with adequate reasoning and evidence. In City of Port Isabel v. FERC,[36] the D.C. Circuit considered petitions for review challenging the FERC reauthorization of two LNG terminals and an associated pipeline in Texas. The Court found that FERC did not adequately support its order and erred by failing (1) to issue supplemental EIS addressing environmental justice; (2) to treat a proposed carbon capture system (CCS) as a connected action; (3) to treat that CCS system as a reasonable alternative; and (4) to adequately explain why it decided to consider air quality data.[37] The court initially vacated the FERC’s approvals, but it reconsidered and remanded them instead.[38] FERC is now evaluating the decision and preparing to act on remand.

In Sierra Club v. Louisiana Dep’t of Environmental Quality,[39] the Fifth Circuit evaluated whether the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) erred by issuing pre-construction permits for the Commonwealth LNG, LLC (“Commonwealth”) LNG export facility in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. The Sierra Club asked for the permits to be vacated because the LDEQ’s decision was arbitrary and capricious, since the facility’s emissions will exceed National Ambient Air Quality Standards, and the LDEQ failed to require Commonwealth to use the best available control technology to limit those emissions. The court rejected the challenge, finding that state law review standards govern federal review of state environmental permitting, and that LDEQ met those standards. The project now remains scheduled for a 2026 startup.

Demand, Prices, and the Rollercoaster Market Lithium demand will rise quickly.
Without a reliable domestic lithium supply, the country risks falling behind in the global EV race, remaining dependent on supply chains controlled by rivals.","The lithium sector took center stage this week when Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC) stock soared nearly 95% on reports that the Trump administration is considering taking an equity stake in the company’s Thacker Pass mine in Nevada. If it happens, this move would be one of the biggest government actions in U.S. mining in years. It shows how important lithium is to national policy now.

Behind the headlines lies a deeper story: America’s ambition to lead the clean energy transition risks colliding with a stark supply shortage. We highlight below, with the two charts, both the opportunity and the vulnerability facing the United States in this lithium quest.

A Lithium Crisis in the Making

The United States faces a lithium crisis that makes its clean energy ambitions look more like an aspiration than an execution. Current domestic production is only 2,700 metric tons a year. That’s too small compared to the 500,000 tons needed by 2030 to hit electric vehicle (EV) goals.

To put this in perspective:

The lithium in an iPhone weighs about the same as a penny.

A Tesla Model 3 battery pack requires around 12 kilograms.

A Ford F-150 Lightning demands closer to 17 kilograms.

At present mining levels, the U.S. produces enough lithium for only about 158,000 Tesla Model 3s annually. That’s in a market where Americans bought 1.4 million EVs in 2024 alone, with demand expected to climb sharply in the coming years.

This gap reveals a harsh reality: America’s lithium supply chain is ill-prepared for its electrification goals.

From Marginal Producer to Top Four — If Thacker Pass Delivers

The government’s solution to this issue is projects like Lithium Americas’ Thacker Pass. It’s one of the largest lithium deposits in North America. If fully developed, it could boost U.S. production to around 40,000 tons each year. This would place the country among the top four producers, following Australia, Chile, and China.

That would mark a tenfold increase in output, but it is still far from enough. Even under the most optimistic forecasts, Thacker Pass would meet just 8% of projected U.S. demand by 2030, and a mere 3% of the 1.2 million tons expected by 2035.

Meanwhile, China has spent more than a decade locking up supply chains, securing lithium assets in Africa, South America, and Australia. It is also building refining infrastructure that now processes nearly 80% of the world’s lithium.

The comparison is striking: Zimbabwe produces eight times more lithium than the U.S. Even smaller producers, like Argentina, surpass American output. In this context, Washington’s sudden push for equity stakes is less about profits and more about survival in a high-stakes race for supply.

Reserves Rich, Supply Poor: The Untapped U.S. Advantage

The second chart points to America’s hidden strength: the U.S. ranks first globally in lithium reserves, with more than 100 million tonnes identified. Despite this geological advantage, those resources remain largely untapped.

Encouragingly, the U.S. now ranks third in global exploration budgets, reflecting a deliberate policy pivot. Billions of dollars are going to exploration and project development, from Nevada to North Carolina. If even a fraction of these reserves is unlocked, the U.S. could rival today’s top producers and reduce dependence on foreign supply chains.

However, converting reserves into production requires more than exploration. Projects can hit delays with permits, face environmental lawsuits, struggle with financing, and deal with local opposition. All these issues can stretch timelines into decades. This is why federal involvement is becoming more important. This includes equity stakes, subsidies, and fast-tracking permits.

Why the LAC Surge Matters

The near-doubling of Lithium Americas’ stock was not just a speculative rally. It was a market signal that U.S. lithium policy is entering a new phase.

Government backing reduces financing risk, making it easier to attract institutional investors.

Aligning policies with EV makers like General Motors, which has a big stake in Thacker Pass, ensures supply security and offtake agreements.

National security framing places lithium on the same level as oil and gas. This makes lithium a strategic commodity and allows for more state intervention.

For automakers and battery manufacturers, this could mark the start of a more stable domestic supply base. For investors, it highlights how policy can rapidly change the outlook for mining equities.

Demand, Prices, and the Rollercoaster Market

Lithium demand will rise quickly. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI) predicts that consumption of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) will surpass 2.4 million tonnes by 2030. That’s almost four times what we use now. By 2035, demand could climb past 5 million tonnes, fueled by electric vehicles and large-scale battery storage.

The industry needs hundreds of new projects to meet this surge. However, BMI points out that permitting delays, financing issues, and tech challenges are slowing supply growth.

Battery demand adds another layer of urgency. Analysts predict global battery capacity will reach nearly 4 terawatt-hours by 2030. This highlights lithium’s vital role in the clean energy shift.

The U.S. is still a minor player. Most refining and conversion happens in China, which holds about 80% of processing capacity. This imbalance shows why Washington supports projects like Lithium Americas. They want to secure a local supply.

Litium prices, meanwhile, have been highly volatile. After lithium carbonate reached over $80,000 per tonne in late 2022, prices dropped sharply. In 2023–2024, they fell by more than 80%, going below $10,000 earlier this year. BMI attributes the crash to oversupply from South America and weaker near-term EV sales in China, which created a temporary glut.

However, the consultancy stresses that volatility is cyclical, not structural. Demand is strong, and prices should bounce back. In fact, last August, prices climbed when China’s major battery player closed its major mine.

New supply can’t keep up with long-term consumption. BMI warns that without steady investment and diversification of supply, future shortages could push prices sharply higher again by the late 2020s.

For the U.S., this shows why public investment matters. It helps create a strong domestic lithium industry. This will support electrification goals and better handle global changes.

Government in the Game: Stabilizing Supply Chains

U.S. government equity in Lithium Americas offers help in these areas:

Provide a floor for project financing — Government backing reduces the risk premium for lenders or institutional partners.

Stabilize supply — A guaranteed domestic source reduces reliance on external shocks.

Mitigate short-term volatility — If Thacker Pass operates under a model combining private and public capital, it could offer a more stable supply corridor insulated from market swings.

Signal future project structures — The U.S. may increasingly demand “state-option carve-outs” or partial equity as a condition for major critical mineral projects.

In a market where excess supply can drive prices into unprofitable territory, having a strategic anchor on flagship projects becomes a competitive edge.

Lithium as a Strategic Commodity

Lithium is no longer just a commodity for battery makers — it is now a strategic asset shaping national policy. The U.S. has the reserves, capital, and political will to be a major producer. But it will take years of teamwork to turn potential into production.

The Trump administration’s willingness to consider a government equity stake in Lithium Americas suggests a broader trend: future large-scale projects may require some form of state participation to succeed.

For the U.S., the stakes could not be higher. Without a reliable domestic lithium supply, the country risks falling behind in the global EV race, remaining dependent on supply chains controlled by rivals. With it, America could not only meet its clean energy goals but also secure a critical pillar of its industrial future.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2500491163.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 14:03:24.149145

In addition, Constellation is pursuing investments in equipment and technology to increase the output from its existing nuclear plants in addition to the restart of Crane.
Earlier this year, the NRC granted approval to rename the plant as the “Christopher M. Crane Clean Energy Center”.
“I’m excited for projects like the Crane Clean Energy Center that will bring even more energy onto the grid because by creating more energy, we will create more opportunity for Pennsylvanians,” said Shapiro.","Crane Clean Energy Center, the former Three Mile Island Unit 1, remains in the spotlight one year following Constellation‘s announcement to restart the plant.

According to a release, Crane will help strengthen grid reliability, restore jobs and add a source of emission-free energy to the grid. The plant’s restart has been made possible through a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft.

Constellation has accelerated the restart to 2027, hired hundreds of workers and made what the company calls “significant progress.” Per the release, the project has provided momentum to state and federal policymakers and some of the world’s largest technology companies to partner with industry to increase investment in new and existing nuclear technology to power the digital economy and U.S. competitiveness.

“Six years ago, the closure of this plant symbolized more than a decade of policy failures that focused only on new clean energy resources that couldn’t match the reliability of nuclear energy, and both the security of our energy grid and air quality suffered,” Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation, said in a statement. “Today it symbolizes the best in American innovation and an overdue recognition that we need to value and invest in existing sources of clean and reliable energy as we also build the grid of the future.

“As we confront the challenge of rising energy demand to support America’s economic growth, it’s critical that we look to Crane as a reminder of the consequences of not learning from past mistakes,” added Dominguez.

In addition, Constellation is pursuing investments in equipment and technology to increase the output from its existing nuclear plants in addition to the restart of Crane. It could add up to 2,000 megawatts of new, clean and reliable baseload capacity to the grid.

“In Pennsylvania, we’re doubling down on our energy legacy by taking big, decisive steps to build new sources of power,” Gov. Josh Shapiro said. “As an all-of-the-above energy governor, I hope to produce even more energy here in Pennsylvania from all sources – from natural gas and solar to geothermal to nuclear.”

Workforce and site development milestones achieved in the past year include the following:

The facility is nearly 80% staffed, with 500 full-time employees on-site and dozens more pending. A second Initial License Training class will begin in early 2026 to allow reactor operators to train and obtain a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license to operate the plant.

Inspections of steam generators, main generator, emergency diesel generators, and underground piping have been completed or are near completion, alongside enhancements to the training center and control room simulator.

Technical and regulatory progress includes:

Constellation’s interconnection request to PJM, the regional grid operator, received accelerated approval, clearing the path for grid integration and allowing Constellation to accelerate the restart to 2027.

NRC licensing and regulatory filings remain on track, supported by a Restart Panel overseeing review and inspections. Earlier this year, the NRC granted approval to rename the plant as the “Christopher M. Crane Clean Energy Center”.

Continued progress with state and local environmental agencies to secure permits for water usage and environmental protection.

Progress made in economic impact and community engagement include:

An independent economic study confirmed the plant will result in approximately 3,400 direct and indirect jobs, over $16 billion added to Pennsylvania’s GDP and more than $3 billion in state and federal tax revenue.

Constellation is making good on its commitment to community investment, including more than $1 million in charitable giving over five years to support workforce development and local organizations. In 2025, the company donated $200,000 to more than a dozen local charities, nonprofit organizations and workforce development programs.

Crane’s community engagement manager Dave Marcheskie has been meeting frequently with residents and community groups to gather feedback and offer philanthropic support.

The funding comes as the U.S. prepares to cut off imports of uranium from Russia in 2028.
“There’s no company in the world or country that has successfully scaled laser uranium enrichment,” he said in an interview.
Russian cutoff challenges But even with the DOE funding for new enrichment, experts say the 2028 Russian uranium cutoff may be too challenging to meet.
Many experts are concerned that atrophy in the U.S. nuclear sector paves the way for China to usurp American leadership globally.","The Department of Energy is set to announce at least $900 million to boost uranium enrichment in the U.S. nuclear power sector, several sources close to the discussion told POLITICO’s E&E News.

The funding comes as the U.S. prepares to cut off imports of uranium from Russia in 2028. But experts fear the funding will not go far enough.

Major obstacles stand in the way to domestically enrich the uranium that’s needed to power the 94 large reactors in the U.S. today, which provide roughly a fifth of electricity on the grid.

Still, the funding, which is viewed as seed money for an enrichment revival in the U.S., could come as soon as the end of this month — and may be offered to multiple companies.

“This will be a $900 million opportunity going to one, maybe two companies,” Nima Ashkeboussi, vice president for government relations and communications at the firm Global Laser Enrichment, said in an interview. “DOE is using this money as essentially a grant to the awardee to incentivize them to accelerate and maximize capacity deployment.”

Two other sources who were granted anonymity to speak freely about sensitive federal funding confirmed the funding could go to multiple companies and could come as early as next week. The funding, according to the sources, is for the low-enriched uranium used in traditional reactors, not the next-generation fuel needed for a new wave of small reactors that are currently seeking regulatory approval.

The funding, which stems from a program put in place last year by the Biden administration, would mark a major escalation in federal efforts to boost domestic enrichment and the broad nuclear sector in the U.S., just as the World Nuclear Association said in a recent report that global uranium demand will nearly double by 2040.

“The DOE’s money is like a sourdough bread starter,” said Curtis Roberts II, vice president of communications for Orano USA, a subsidiary of a French government-owned enricher. “We can’t stand up a market without it, really.”

Since taking office, President Donald Trump has raised the ante on nuclear power, pledging to quadruple it by midcentury to “win the AI race” and meet skyrocketing electricity demand forecasts for the coming years. Trump has released several executive orders on nuclear energy since taking power, and in May he called for “10 new large reactors with complete designs under construction by 2030.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said nuclear power is the “single biggest issue” on his agenda. Wright and other nuclear supporters say the electricity source is a critical way to operate artificial intelligence projects across the country with baseload power, a term typically used to describe nuclear and fossil fuels for their ability to provide around-the-clock electricity.

Meanwhile, Microsoft is working with Constellation Energy to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, the site of a meltdown at a different reactor in 1979. And the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office is financing a loan for Holtec International to restart the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan.

Speaking at an Atlantic Council event Wednesday, Julie Kozeracki, director of strategy at the LPO, said the office “will be doing financing for nuclear.”

Large reactors back in vogue

U.S. policymaking on nuclear power in recent years often focused on the development of small modular reactors, and companies are actively seeking approvals and permits for small reactor construction and operation. But SMRs don’t currently provide any electricity to the grid, and some policymakers have recently prioritized construction of large, traditional reactors that use low-enriched uranium, or LEU.

“I think you’ve seen a sea change in the last 18 months to a year,” said Andrew Shaw, a lobbyist with Bracewell LLP. “Prior to that, everybody was talking about SMRs, but now, with this significant load growth projected, there’s a lot of new interest in AP1000s.”

AP1000s are the newest large reactors built by Westinghouse. The most recent U.S. example is the Vogtle plant in Georgia.

Global Laser Enrichment, or GLE, and Orano are two of six companies selected by DOE in December last year to “compete for future work to supply” LEU. That’s the nuclear fuel used today in large U.S. reactors. LEU differs from the next-generation fuel eyed for small reactors, which is typically referred to as high-assay, low-enriched uranium, or HALEU.

“There’s a defined market right now for LEU, whereas future demand when it comes to HALEU is pretty uncertain,” Shaw said. “You just don’t know how many of these reactors are actually going to go forward and how many will not.”

The other companies selected are a Centrus Energy subsidiary; Urenco; LIS Technologies; and General Matter, a new firm backed by conservative financier Peter Thiel and run by former SpaceX employee Scott Nolan, who attended a White House event on nuclear earlier this year. DOE signed a lease with General Matter in August that allows the company to use a former enrichment site in Paducah, Kentucky, along with the uranium at the location.

While the U.S. currently imports roughly an eighth to a quarter of its enriched uranium from Russia, a law passed last year by Congress requires the U.S. to cut off Russian imports by 2028. The law is part of a U.S. push to penalize Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

“We allowed ourselves to fall under dependence of both China and Russia for critical minerals,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Sunday, according to a White House pool report. “America buying uranium from Russia is not acceptable and so we’re working very hard … to make sure we’ve got a plan so that the United States can get back into domestic enriched uranium production as quickly as possible.”

Domestic enrichment ‘as quickly as possible’

The Trump administration nuclear strategy has come with controversy. A Trump official has pushed the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to “rubber-stamp” new reactors tested by DOE and the Defense Department.

Meanwhile, Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) has spelled out concerns that federal programs will benefit Oklo, a nuclear company with a board of directors that featured Wright before his resignation in February. Oklo is on a rapid rise, although some industry experts think its stock value is wildly inflated.

DOE did not respond to an E&E News request for comment.

Dan Leistikow, vice president of corporate communications at Centrus, said the U.S. needs to step up on enrichment.

“Centrus offers the only proven, American-made enrichment technology,” Leistikow said. “We will introduce new supply diversity and price competition to a dangerously over-concentrated market.”

While Centrus doesn’t produce LEU in the U.S., it is the only company currently producing HALEU domestically, having already secured a contract with DOE.

The company announced on Thursday plans for a significant expansion of its HALEU enrichment plant in Ohio. This project could create 1,300 jobs, Centrus says, and requires billions in private and public investment, along with federal funding decisions.

But the U.S. offices of Orano and Urenco — jointly owned by the British and Dutch governments and two German utilities — are looking to get into the game too. Urenco operates America’s only commercial-scale enrichment facility in New Mexico, and Orano has announced plans to construct a plant in Tennessee that would be the state’s largest single investment ever.

“One of [President Trump’s] goals is to bring in foreign investment,” Roberts with Orano said. “Our Project IKE is a $5 billion development with the DOE support, and so with our proposal, that money is spent here in the U.S. — all of it.”

Lee Robinson, founding member of General Matter, said U.S. nuclear plants may run into “shortage territory” on enriched uranium supply in the coming years.

“The supply of that feedstock was previously, in part, coming from Russia,” he said Wednesday at the Atlantic Council event. “The U.S. market needs to catch up to that. Otherwise, they’re not going to have options.”

The DOE announcement on the Kentucky lease awarded to General Matter says enrichment activities will launch “by the end of the decade.” General Matter did not respond to a request for comment.

Jay Yu, chief executive officer at LIS Technologies, says his company is helping to pioneer cutting-edge laser enrichment technologies that could dramatically cut costs over current gas centrifuge technology.

“There’s no company in the world or country that has successfully scaled laser uranium enrichment,” he said in an interview. “We’re going to focus on where the market is, so probably LEU.”

Yu said the approaching cutoff of Russia uranium is a “boost” to U.S. enrichers. In the last year, he said his company raised more than $45 million in capital. Meanwhile, GLE’s Ashkeboussi said staff at his company is at 115 people, up dramatically from a dozen in 2021.

Russian cutoff challenges

But even with the DOE funding for new enrichment, experts say the 2028 Russian uranium cutoff may be too challenging to meet.

Roberts with Orano said every month counts as developers prepare to deploy dozens of advanced reactors over the next decade.

“It takes a certain amount of time to license it, to build a facility to hit that,” he said. “Advanced reactors actually are going to be coming online [in the] 2028 or so time frame. So if we want to license and build, ramp up facility production, the timing is now.”

And each of the contract competitors is subject to criticism from others in the nuclear sphere. GLE, LIS Technologies and General Matter are comparative newcomers brandishing commercially unproven technology.

Many blame Centrus for America’s dearth of enrichment capacity, noting that the company hasn’t commercially enriched uranium in more than a decade despite significant government support.

Orano’s chief executive in Paris said the company will not make a financial investment decision on Project IKE until 2027.

Urenco’s New Mexico enrichment facility, the lone commercial one in the U.S., recently expanded and is able to supply about a third of enriched uranium used in the U.S. But the company has seen production go down, not up, since 2018.

That’s a stark contrast from past decades. In 1985, government-operated enrichment plants processed more than six times the uranium the nation enriches today and nearly four times what American reactors consumed.

Many experts are concerned that atrophy in the U.S. nuclear sector paves the way for China to usurp American leadership globally. China currently has 32 reactors under construction and 44 more planned, according to the World Nuclear Association, and the country has exported enriched uranium to the U.S. in recent years.

“I’m quite concerned about the role that China may have in the global nuclear market and the implications of that for the United States,” said Paul Saunders, a Russia expert and president of the nonprofit Center for the National Interest. “China has a very substantial domestic reactor construction program underway.”

“It’s not a given that the United States stays ahead,” he said.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/2c/f5/9dd4ca11419591ab21e1c430864c/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1248874494,N,,2025-09-26 16:00:01.509147

​‘Motherfucking wind farms’?” Jackson says in a mock angry voice at the end of the video.
It manages a wide range of projects, from hydroelectric dams to offshore wind farms.
For example, offshore wind farms generated 17% of the U.K.’s electricity last year.
The ad’s wind turbines were superimposed post-production using video footage of a real Vattenfall wind farm in Denmark.","Standing alone on a rocky coastline wearing a seaman-style knit hat, Samuel L. Jackson reaches into a snack bag and gazes intensely through binoculars. Wind turbines spin ominously on a watery horizon.

“Motherfucking wind farms. Loud, ugly, harmful to nature,” the ​“Pulp Fiction” actor says. Then, shaking his head knowingly and shifting his tone, he adds, ​“Who says that? These giants are standing tall against fossil fuels, rising up from the ocean like a middle finger to CO2.”

The 60-second ad, released in July, immediately went viral. It also ran on television channels in Finland, Sweden, Germany, and other European countries. It’s part of a marketing campaign launched by Vattenfall, a century-old Swedish energy giant whose clean energy portfolio includes a famous 11-turbine project built within view of President Donald Trump’s Scotland golf course.

The ad reached 600 million viewers across 33 countries within four days of its release, according to a Vattenfall spokesperson. Trump isn’t named in the video, but Jackson’s script is a comedic wink-and-nod to the president’s frequent anti-wind rants.

“So, what’s it going to be? ​‘Motherfucking wind farms’?” Jackson says in a mock angry voice at the end of the video. He then repeats the question, grinning widely and raising his eyebrows cheekily: ​“Or ​‘motherfucking wind farms’?”

Research shows that comedy plays a powerful role in making climate change information salient for public audiences. That’s especially useful now, as the Trump administration works to derail the clean energy transition, but such efforts also come at a fraught moment for comedy in America.

Satire under fire

It’s a tough time for political satire. In July, CBS cancelled ​“The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” after Colbert used the phrase ​“big fat bribe” to describe a $16 million settlement the network’s parent company, Paramount, agreed to pay Trump. CBS said the show was killed for financial reasons, but the timing led to speculations that the decision may have been politically motivated.

Then in mid-September, ABC pulled late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air ​“indefinitely” after comments he made related to the assassination of Charlie Kirk provoked a veiled threat from Trump-appointed Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr. The network’s parent company, Disney, reversed course on Monday following public backlash, and Kimmel was back on air Tuesday.

“There’s this tragedy of killing freedom of speech. … The reason this is happening is because [Trump officials] don’t have the superpower of comedy,” said Staci Roberts-Steele, a producer for the wildly successful film ​“Don’t Look Up.” The 2021 Netflix movie used satire to point out the absurdity of delaying climate action.

America now has a president pumping the brakes on the clean energy transition, most recently by attempting to scuttle numerous U.S. offshore wind farms already in development.

Trump has called wind turbines ​“ugly,” ​“terrible for tourism,” and responsible for ​“driving the whales crazy.” His dislike of ​“windmills” dates back to his unsuccessful court battle in the U.K. to stop a Vattenfall offshore wind farm from being installed within view of his Aberdeen, Scotland, golf course. All 11 turbines were eventually built in 2018.

Some Americans who saw the foul-mouthed Jackson ad on social media relished a major Hollywood movie star poking fun at Trump’s favorite anti-climate talking points. Roberts-Steele said she is glad that big European companies like Vattenfall are turning to humor to call out climate disinformation — and that the content is finding American audiences. She hopes it emboldens U.S. comedians and institutions to follow suit.

“The Europeans have been doing it much longer than us. … That’s totally true,” she lamented, adding that U.S. public relations firms and film studios have been less bold about taking big swings at climate skepticism.

“Don’t Look Up” was a rarity for Hollywood. But its chart-topping success mirrors Jackson’s ad in several ways.

Both employed comedy to tackle the topic of climate change. Casting major Hollywood actors drew loads of viewers. Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, and Jonah Hill all starred in what became Netflix’s fourth most successful movie of all time.

Hollywood hasn’t generated a major climate comedy since.

Roberts-Steele is now leading Yellow Dot Studios, a new nonprofit aimed at keeping the climate jokes coming. The studio hosts live comedy events, develops podcasts, and produces short-form videos that, among other things, mock the fossil-fuel industry.

But mainstreaming this kind of comedy isn’t easy, even with Hollywood director Adam McKay as the group’s founder and board member.

“It hasn’t yet trickled up,” said Max Boykoff, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado Boulder who studies the fusion of climate change and comedy. After years researching the topic, he’s now trying to catalyze it.

Boykoff and his students — in collaboration with CU Boulder theater professor Beth Osnes-Stoedefalke — are part of an ongoing collaboration with some of the nation’s top writers’ rooms.

They’ve been working with writers on ​“The Daily Show,” ​“The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” and Comedy Central to make climate change news funny and memorable. On Saturday, Boykoff and his students produced a climate-themed comedy show with professional comedians in New York City, timed to coincide with Climate Week NYC.

“Comedy has this power to point out the contradictions in which we live,” said Boykoff. ​“It’s through comedy that people feel like they’re not being talked down to or lectured.”

With late-night shows facing intimidation under Trump, Boykoff said the involvement of independent academics — like himself — is more important than ever. He added that Europe’s role should not be discounted either.

Europe is still laughing

The Samuel L. Jackson ad was the brainchild of the communications team at Vattenfall, a Swedish state-owned energy company that has been around for more than 100 years. It manages a wide range of projects, from hydroelectric dams to offshore wind farms. The company’s long-term goal with its outreach is to spread the idea of freedom from fossil fuels, said Monica Persdotter, vice president and head of brand.

Unlike past campaigns, she said, this one ​“took off.”

“We’ve always been very bold in the way that we present ourselves to the world, with the messages that we have, which always circles back to fossil-free energy and fossil freedom,” said Persdotter.

The ad hit Vattenfall’s core market — the U.K. and European Union — where the offshore wind sector has grown steadily for decades. For example, offshore wind farms generated 17% of the U.K.’s electricity last year.

Vattenfall operates more than 1,400 wind turbines across 14 wind farms, with a total installed capacity of approximately 6.6 gigawatts in five European countries, according to Persdotter. Several other Vattenfall wind projects are also in the works.

Meanwhile, the U.S. only has one large-scale offshore wind farm in operation. Four others are currently being built in America’s waters. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum abruptly paused construction on a fifth one, Revolution Wind, in August, but this week, the project’s developer, Ørsted, a Danish state-owned company, won a court-ordered injunction lifting the freeze.

Given the contrast between Europe and the U.S., Jackson, a widely recognizable American actor, was a powerful choice for Vattenfall’s ad.

According to Persdotter, her team got a tip that Jackson had studied marine biology in college and, at one point, considered a career in the field. The actor, she said, liked the script, making just a few stylistic tweaks to better align with his voice.

The ad was filmed along the California coast to accommodate Jackson’s schedule. The Golden State has no wind turbines installed in its waters yet — though the Los Angeles Times reports that the state, despite losing some federal funding, has not backed down from its plans to deploy the technology. The ad’s wind turbines were superimposed post-production using video footage of a real Vattenfall wind farm in Denmark.

As for the snack bag Jackson dips into — that’s a nod to the fact that wind farms can provide benefits beyond generating carbon-free electricity, for example, serving as sites for seaweed farming. The seaweed snack Jackson is munching — which he calls ​“serious gourmet shit” — isn’t commercially available yet, but Persdotter said it was harvested from experimental seaweed farming ​“lines” strung between wind turbines at Vesterhav Syd, a Vattenfall project in Denmark’s waters. (Vattenfall sent Canary Media a bag of the prototype snack, and a reporter verified that it tasted like conventional seaweed snacks.)

Last week, during a press conference in England with the U.K. prime minister, the president went on an unprompted rant about the clean energy resource, saying, ​“We don’t do wind because wind is a disaster. It’s a very expensive joke, frankly.”

Trump may not like jokes. But if the popularity of Vattenfall’s video is any indication, Europeans are clearly having a laugh at him. Roberts-Steele said Americans will keep laughing, too, as long as comedians are free to make the jokes.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Vattenfall_Campaign_image01.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=a159baa1a3c76a550c608b5e43b56b48,N,,2025-09-26 13:04:32.274950

The meeting focused on promoting the Third SIEPAC Protocol, a key instrument for modernizing regional governance, strengthening legal security, attracting greater private investment, and preparing Central America's electricity system for the challenges of energy transition and Vision 2050.

Participants highlighted the results achieved in more than a decade of operation of the MER and the regional transmission system.

Part of federal policy leaning toward nuclear energy began during the Biden administration, which named Wyoming and Idaho as part of a Tech Hub within the Intermountain-West Nuclear Energy Corridor.","IDAHO FALLS—A couple hundred nuclear energy industry officials, along with two western state governors, a Trump administration official and the head of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, gathered Monday at the Idaho National Laboratory’s sprawling 890-square-mile testing center to discuss nuclear power’s future in the West.

In a large, posh tent with clear plastic walls offering views of the surrounding high-plains sagebrush steppe, these leaders, their staff and a gaggle of media gathered for a reception a short drive away from the world’s premier nuclear energy testing ground.

“We’re standing here, not very far from where [Experimental Breeder Reactor II] proved out the fundamental technology that I believe is ultimately the future for humanity — for energy abundance, reliability and affordability,” Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of nuclear power plant developer Oklo, told the crowd. The success of 1960s-era EBR II was “one of the most phenomenal technological stories in human history and, frankly, one that’s radically under-told and underappreciated.”

After being pushed to the sidelines, nuclear energy technology is back in the spotlight, DeWitte noted. Today’s rush to feed power-hungry artificial intelligence and data computational centers has private investors and governments around the world pouring money into the next generation of nuclear energy, he said. That is already resulting in notable investments in Wyoming, including Bill Gate’s next-generation nuclear project in Kemmerer, but also raising questions about the potential for spent nuclear fuel storage and transportation in the Equality State.

Here at INL, Oklo and subcontractor Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co. will build and test the first Aurora Powerhouse — a liquid-sodium-cooled “fast reactor” generating up to 75 megawatts of electricity that backers hope to deploy around the world. Oklo’s nuclear reactor demonstration is among a dozen or so reactor and nuclear fuel tests in queue at INL that advance the industry’s technology and business models, according to INL officials. The lineup includes Radiant Industry’s “portable” Kaleidos microreactor, which the company proposes to mass-produce in Wyoming at a facility outside Bar Nunn.

Though Radiant’s proposal, along with another in Campbell County, has garnered significant opposition, Gov. Mark Gordon has joined with his counterparts in Idaho and Utah in a declaration of a unified effort to establish the tristate area as the epicenter of America’s nuclear energy resurgence.

“This is what an abundance mentality is all about,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said in his opening remarks at the Western Governors’ Association workshop at INL’s Idaho Falls campus later that day. “It’s not Utah versus Idaho versus Wyoming. We’re going to be much stronger if we’re working together, because we have some differences that are important and similarities that are important.”

Energy ‘superabundance’

As chairman of the WGA this year, Cox launched the Energy Superabundance: Unlocking Prosperity in the West initiative, which focuses on meeting skyrocketing electrical demand by bolstering nuclear energy. Nuclear power generation, Cox suggested, represents the most reliable form of electricity and a viable means of meeting increasing energy demand.

Utah, Idaho and Wyoming, Cox noted, already share infrastructure under utility Rocky Mountain Power, as well as a shared workforce and a similar “mindset” that’s attractive to the industry.

“I would love to have [Oklo] in Utah, and I can’t lie about that, but that’s good for all of us,” Cox said, adding that all three states are already on the industry’s radar.

The Department of Energy’s national laboratory in Idaho is an obvious draw, he noted. In addition to proposed nuclear microreactor manufacturing in Wyoming, TerraPower’s liquid-sodium-cooled “Natrium” nuclear power facility is expected to begin operations in 2030 outside Kemmerer. Rocky Mountain Power has tentatively agreed to take on the power plant and potentially partner with TerraPower to add more Natrium plants in Utah.

“I can just tell you, by signing that MOU together, it’s given this region much more interest from nuclear partners,” Cox said. “They’re seeing this as a game changer, and so they’re coming. I don’t care if they come to Wyoming or they come to Idaho or they come to Utah.”

The tristate initiative has the backing of the Trump administration, which has ordered the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to speed up nuclear licensing and has directed the DOE to have 10 new “large reactors” under construction by 2030 with a goal of adding 300,000 megawatts of nuclear power to the grid by 2050. One megawatt is enough electricity to power about 750 homes.

Part of federal policy leaning toward nuclear energy began during the Biden administration, which named Wyoming and Idaho as part of a Tech Hub within the Intermountain-West Nuclear Energy Corridor.

Challenges

Despite enthusiasm among private industry and state and federal officials, there are significant challenges to implementing a nuclear resurgence in the region.

Several speakers at the WGA event noted that AI and data center developers favor new power generation facilities that are, in a regulatory sense, apart from the shared electrical grid, or “behind the meter.” That complicates the utility regulatory environment and rate structures. Also, the U.S. is still reliant on other nations for nuclear components and several aspects of the fuel supply chain, which will take years to provide domestically. Others noted that the Trump administration’s demands on federal agencies — like fast-tracking and licensing a massive buildout of nuclear power plants — are at odds with recent staff downsizing.

Industry leaders are also worried about a dearth of workers for jobs that require specific training and certifications.

“We know that we need a significantly expanded workforce for the modernization and expansion of the grid,” Deloitte Specialist Executive Bill Abolt said. The nation’s long lull in building nuclear energy has left the industry with skilled experts who are retiring and an empty “pipeline” to replace them, he added. “The people that built the last nuclear power plant didn’t just stick around and wait for the next one.”

Though states have made advancements in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education and training, nuclear fields have been a blind spot, several industry officials agreed.

“At some point, you need to figure out how to get Mike Rowe involved,” INL’s Innovation and Technology Manager Chris Lohse said, referring to the television personality who touts the nobility of skilled trades and “dirty” physical labor.

Yet perhaps the industry’s biggest challenge remains its image as a dangerous liability to human health and the environment — a legacy of the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters, perpetuated in cinema and The Simpsons. Though the WGA event was stacked with those who are certain of the safety of the industry, some noted that local opposition to things like wind farms extends to nuclear energy proposals.

In fact, many residents in Bar Nunn and Gillette — communities that have long supported heavy energy industries — are not convinced they want to welcome nuclear facilities. Campbell County commissioners recently drafted a resolution to solidify their interim stance on the potential for spent nuclear fuel waste storage until putting the question to a public vote in the 2026 election. Until there’s a vote, the commission would remain opposed to such proposals.

“There is a lot of time that’s being spent engaging with communities, local governments and people on the ground who may have been upset about a wind turbine,” National Association of State Energy Officials Chief of Staff Cassie Powers said. “There does need to be some real, honest public engagement to demystify investments in nuclear.”",https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/INL-Demonstration-of-Microreactor-Experiments-DOME-DBleizeffer.jpeg?fit=1200%2C1005&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-26 16:00:04.883358

The new chair or research alliance aims to facilitate the automotive industry’s shift towards electrification by addressing the challenge of electric motor and gearbox noise.

Set to continue until 2032, the partnership will see Arts et Métiers’ Laboratory of Engineering of Physical and Numerical Systems (LISPEN) and Laboratory of Electrical Engineering and Power Electronics of Lille (L2EP) researchers applying their knowledge in electrical engineering, experimental techniques, digital computations, and vibratory mechanics.

Valeo will contribute its market know-how and incorporate its calculation, testing, and design practices into the research.

The research will concentrate on two primary objectives: first, to develop “electro-magneto-mechanical simulation tools” that can predict vibrations and noise from the design phase of motors and their control strategies.

Second, to devise electrical control solutions and methods for decreasing noise and vibration, including the use of technologies such as viscoelastic materials, piezoelectric absorbers, and meta-materials.

Valeo said that the initial collaboration, which revolved around the chair on “Nonlinear Dynamics for Future Absorbers,” brought together experts from LISPEN in Lille and Valeo.

Murphy’s Funeral Service, 703 S. Harrison St., celebrated its 50th anniversary in business. Founded in 1934 by Loren “Pat” Murphy, the home originally operated out of a small house before moving to South Harrison in 1937 when state law required professional embalming. In the early days, visitations were often still held at home, with funerals in churches, but by the 1970s most services had shifted to the mortuary. Duane Murphy became full-time in 1946 and later expanded the building in the 1970s to accommodate larger gatherings. In 1984, Charles and Illiana Hartman purchased the business, continuing its role as a fixture in the community.

1975: Major Hospital was considering a new around-the-clock emergency room coverage plan. The proposal called for doctors to be on duty 24 hours a day instead of relying only on on-call physicians, reflecting the growing demand for full-time emergency care in the community.

1965: A new educational building was under construction at Fairland Baptist Church, which connected directly with the old church building.

Because wastewater biogas capture systems are typically smaller than other types of biogas facilities, they produce only 12.5% of total U.S. biogas output despite their relative prevalence.
However, digesting local food waste with sludge at wastewater plants offers wastewater facilities a powerful opportunity to enhance biogas output while recycling organic waste into energy.","WASHINGTON – September 25, 2025 – Today, the American Biogas Council (ABC) released new data showing the extensive role municipal wastewater facilities can play to recycle organic waste into renewable energy and fertilizer using biogas systems. Today, more than 1,200 U.S. wastewater treatment plants capture biogas from their wastewater sludge and use it to produce the electricity equivalent of 7.3 billion kWh per year. The data also show significant untapped potential: About 3,800 additional wastewater facilities – over three times as many – could build biogas capture systems but have not. If every suitable wastewater facility installed biogas systems, the sector could capture 171.8 billion cubic feet of biogas each year – enough energy for 1.3 million U.S. households.

The ABC’s research provides the first comprehensive survey of U.S. biogas capture systems at wastewater plants in more than a decade. The analysis draws on data collected from more than 5,000 wastewater plants that treat at least a million gallons of wastewater a day (1 MGD).

“Biogas systems have the potential to unlock an unprecedented supply of U.S.-made energy, and wastewater facilities can help make that happen” said the ABC’s Executive Director Patrick Serfass. “Investing in biogas capture at wastewater facilities creates a win-win scenario. Waste is recycled instead of discarded, and the U.S. can tap enough new energy to power the homes of millions of Americans across the country.”

Wastewater biogas facilities convert their sludge, or biosolids, using anaerobic digestion systems, which capture biogas produced as the waste breaks down. Even though wastewater plants frequently use their biogas to generate power on-site and put only excess electricity onto the grid, they significantly ease electricity demand, which is soaring from data centers and an increase in domestic manufacturing. (Biogas systems also capture energy from waste at landfills, on farms, and at dedicated food waste biogas facilities.)

The wastewater industry pioneered the use of biogas systems in the U.S. beginning in the 1920s, at first simply to reduce the volume of sludge they needed to manage from wastewater treatment (digesting the sludge cuts its volume by about 50%). In the decades that followed more and more facilities have added anaerobic digesters, increasingly to provide biogas to generate electricity or heat for plant operations. ABC’s new research shows that the industry added roughly 100 biogas facilities per decade at wastewater facilities from 1960 to 1990.

Today, 49% of all biogas capture systems in the U.S. operate at wastewater plants, followed by farms (24%) and landfills (23%). Because wastewater biogas capture systems are typically smaller than other types of biogas facilities, they produce only 12.5% of total U.S. biogas output despite their relative prevalence. However, digesting local food waste with sludge at wastewater plants offers wastewater facilities a powerful opportunity to enhance biogas output while recycling organic waste into energy.

The data also detail how plants use captured gas: 80% generate energy, with 58% producing electricity and 22% producing heat. Only 4% of wastewater plants upgrade raw biogas to renewable natural gas (RNG), a lower proportion than in other biogas sectors.For more information on this data and more visit americanbiogascouncil.org.

In just a few years, Washington D.C. has shifted from a protector of environmental policy to an obstacle.
These shifts in policy are so shocking because of how sharply they depart from previously bipartisan environmental policy.
While the current political cycle in the United States encourages partisan thinking when it comes to environmentalism and public health, preserving our lands and pursuing public health was not always a ballot box issue.
Grassroot support for bipartisan environmentalism already exists.","In his first hundred days in office, President Donald Trump took 145 actions undoing clean air, water and climate laws. He has since ordered Environmental Protection Agency scientists to stop publishing their research, fired climate experts in droves and has subjected meteorologists to political loyalty tests. His Interior Department, once a hallmark of American environmentalism, has stripped protections from over 245 million acres of public land, while implementing new rules allowing the removal of endangered species’ habitat. These rollbacks are not isolated policies; they represent a coordinated attack on science, conservation, and the very idea that the government should safeguard public health. The Trump administration is waging a silent war on environmentalism and is actively dismantling decades of bipartisan progress. Urgent action is needed to reverse this trend.

In just a few years, Washington D.C. has shifted from a protector of environmental policy to an obstacle. Trump’s dismantling of American environmentalism has been swift and unprecedented. On his inauguration day, Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, making it the only country to have ever done so. He has abandoned clean energy projects on public land and threatened to block any on private land. In the past few weeks, he and his administration have fired thousands of employees from the EPA, the Interior Department, the Department of Energy and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

These shifts in policy are so shocking because of how sharply they depart from previously bipartisan environmental policy. While the current political cycle in the United States encourages partisan thinking when it comes to environmentalism and public health, preserving our lands and pursuing public health was not always a ballot box issue. The EPA, created to protect both human health and the environment, was established by both Democrats and Republicans and signed into law by Richard Nixon. Similarly, the Clean Air Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act both had bipartisan support, and both were signed by Republican presidents (George W. Bush and Gerald Ford, respectively).

Beyond public health, America’s modern day conservation movement was also once bipartisan. Theodore Roosevelt, one of the Republican Party’s great figures, created the modern-day National Park system, following in fellow Republican Ulysses S. Grant’s legacy. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, for its part, includes numerous conservation benefits, such as the Klamath Basin, Delaware River Basin and Lake Tahoe restorations. These examples make Trump’s reversal of policy even more jarring; they contradict not only established environmental science, but his own party’s tradition of stewardship.

Hope is not lost, however. Despite these reversals in policy, the American people remain ahead of their leaders. In a recent poll, 60% of Republicans, 59% of Independents and 86% of Democrats suggested they would have a more favorable impression towards their member of Congress if they pursued natural climate solutions. The same poll found a 91% consensus across parties to provide a financial incentive to converse natural areas, while 89% approved of building a year-round workforce to restore coastlines, forests, farmlands and other natural areas.

Grassroot support for bipartisan environmentalism already exists. Americans want to take pride in their wild spaces and live clean, safe lives. Across party lines, Americans agree that they want a nation that they can be environmentally proud of. This makes Trump’s policies not only reckless, but a betrayal of his party’s and his voters’ values. Environmentalism aligns perfectly with conservative ideals of stewardship, responsibility, and national pride.

Even fiscally, pro-environmental policy advances Republican goals. In 2023, the National Parks Service contributed $55.6 billion dollars to the American economy and supported over 415,000 jobs. This number has decreased after Trump’s recent mass firings of NPS’s staff. Worldwide, nations with stronger environmental policies have also been found to have stronger economies and efficient industries.

If the United States is to reclaim its legacy as a global leader in conservation and global health, it cannot afford to let environmentalism continue to be a casualty of partisanship. Trump’s rollbacks reveal not just an assault on policy, but a denial of shared values that once united Americans across the aisle. Protecting clean air, safe water, and public lands is not a Republican or Democratic issue – it is an American issue. The public already acknowledges this; it is time for American leaders to act accordingly. It is time for them to reach across the aisle to protect not only our public lands and health, but also our American values. Rebuilding environmental bipartisanship is not optional – it is the only way to safeguard America’s health, land and values from reckless leadership.",https://i0.wp.com/dailycampus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-274.png?fit=719%2C456&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-26 18:01:55.180325

It means lawmakers should respect local control over energy facilities and data centers and means Gov.","Pennsylvania is at the epicenter of a dangerous fossil fuel agenda — and unfortunately, Governor Josh Shapiro is paving the way.

Since taking office, Shapiro has taken no meaningful climate action. Instead, he has advanced fossil fuel interests by fast-tracking permits for so-called “reliable” energy — a phrase used to greenwash gas, biodigesters, and other methane-emitting projects. And he promotes an “all-of-the-above” energy approach, which props up oil and gas under the guise of sustainability. Too often, he sides with polluters over people.

Our state has been part of the U.S. Climate Alliance since 2019, a coalition committed to a net-zero future by advancing state-led, high-impact climate action. Yet Pennsylvania is America’s second largest extractor of fossil fuels — and no significant climate-mitigating legislation has been established during Shapiro’s tenure as governor.

If you find yourself turning to our coverage more and more, please consider making a donation to strengthen our independent, nonprofit newsroom.

President Donald Trump has a bullseye on Pennsylvania shale gas, with promises of liquified natural gas (LNG) export terminals, massive AI data centers powered by dedicated gas-fired power plants, and additional false solutions like pyrolysis (burning plastic, which creates toxic emissions) and carbon capture and sequestration (an ineffective and dangerous attempt at storing carbon underground, transported through hazardous pipelines that can poison communities with CO2 gas leaks). These projects only delay the transition to real renewable energy.

Data centers bring the threat of noise, higher electric bills, water pollution, and high water usage. And in Pennsylvania, they also bring the health harms of increased fracking and new gas-fired power plants. Amazon and Blackstone plan to use fracked gas to fuel their data centers. And proposed LNG export terminals bring incredible risks of explosion and pollution to densely populated areas on the East Coast.

A bill in the state House, HB 502, is being shoehorned into state budget legislation after failing to get out of committee. It allows a centralized board to override municipal land use decisions by issuing a “Certificate of Reliable Energy Supply.” Once that certificate is granted, municipalities are legally barred from taking any action that might “materially impede” the project — even if that action is rooted in zoning law, comprehensive planning, or legitimate public health and safety concerns.

Yet Shapiro’s administration is pushing the bill hard, threatening the autonomy and voices of the people of Pennsylvania. In fact, Article I, Section 27 of Pennsylvania’s constitution — the Environmental Rights Amendment — establishes the people’s right to clean air and pure water, and requires all levels of government, including municipalities, to act as trustees of our natural resources. By stripping towns of their authority to protect residents through zoning and planning, HB 502 prevents them from fulfilling that constitutional duty. Courts have already struck down similar overreach in the Robinson Township case.

Instead of being a champion for his constituents who are suffering health harms from fossil fuel extraction in the state, Gov. Shapiro has been busy developing alliances and deals with the gas industry, creating significant roadblocks to meaningful climate action. Now, with the announcement from President Trump of over $90 billion coming to Pennsylvania for an AI hub in our state, our communities face major threats of increased pollution and health harms from fracking, methane gas pipelines, data centers, and other oil and gas infrastructure.

We need Gov. Shapiro not to sell us out. Instead, he needs to hold polluters accountable.

That means stop pushing AI data centers powered by fracked gas. It means stop backing LNG exports and false solutions like burning plastic, carbon capture, and hydrogen production from fracked gas. It means lawmakers should respect local control over energy facilities and data centers and means Gov. Shapiro should make good on promises to address the toxic impacts of fracking and ban road spreading of toxic, radioactive drilling waste.

We’re watching closely. Pennsylvanians demand leadership that centers on genuine community collaboration, real solutions to the health crisis created by fracking, high-impact actions on the climate crisis, and on respect for frontline communities where residents are suffering.

Pennsylvania can lead the way in creating union jobs, building renewable energy, protecting communities, and ensuring every family has clean air and water.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ashburn-virginia-2048x1192.jpeg,N,,2025-09-26 13:04:35.741851

With the end of the $7,500 federal clean vehicle credit in sight, American consumers showed up in force over the last few months to claim the incentives and drive home a battery-powered car. Data shows that the country’s appetite for EVs exploded thanks largely to the expiring policy framework.

30%: EV Sales Shatter New Record Ahead Of Projected Slowdown

Americans bought nearly half a million battery-powered cars in the third quarter, rushing to claim federal tax credits of up to $7,500 before they expire on Sept. 30.

The research firm Cox Automotive projected on Thursday that EV sales will hit 410,000 for the quarter, pushing the electric share of the U.S. car market to a landmark 10% for the first time ever. Cox had expected that milestone by year’s end, but it arrived a quarter early thanks to sweeping EV policy changes under the Trump administration.

The end of the tax credits “sparked an unmistakable pre-expiration rush as consumers and dealers moved quickly to lock in benefits before the incentives phased out,” Stephanie Valdez Streaty, the director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told reporters during a sales forecast call on Thursday.

Automakers, meanwhile, are squeezing every last drop out of the federal incentives bucket before they vanish, rolling out aggressive lease and financing deals, cash-back discounts, and trade-in bonuses to sway more Tesla owners toward rivals like Lucid and Polestar.

In the third quarter, sales were down for market-leader Tesla, according to Cox Automotive data, but EV sales volumes set a new record regardless of that. That’s thanks to the likes of General Motors, Honda and Hyundai stepping up.

Chevrolet is now the number two EV seller in the country, thanks to models such as the Equinox EV, Blazer EV and Silverado EV. Cadillac has also seen a surge in EV sales with its popular Lyriq and Optiq crossovers.

But Valdez Streaty warned that a slowdown could be coming. “The quarter delivered record EV sales and market share, but the pace will ease in Q4 and beyond as the impact of the IRA tax incentive begins to fade,” she said.

Analysts have predicted a slowdown after Sept. 30, but the extent of the damage is still unknown. And automakers are already preparing to thrive in a post-tax-credit world, moving to address the key challenge for the EV industry, which is affordability.

The results of that are now just starting to show, thanks to new low-cost models such as the next-generation Nissan Leaf, the upcoming Chevy Bolt EV, Tesla’s affordable Model Y-based EV, Kia EV3 and more such models in the pipeline.

The end of the tax credits may put more pressure on automakers to drive organic growth in sales. That means launching EVs that compete on merit rather than drool-worthy monthly deals and zero down payments.

60%: Tesla Urges The EPA To Preserve The Tailpipe Emissions Regulations

Photo by: Tesla

Tesla may no longer market itself aggressively as a car company, but it’s quietly behaving like one. The automaker, which is now pivoting to AI and robotics, urged the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to preserve the tailpipe emissions regulations that the Trump administration is seeking to repeal.

In a regulatory filing submitted by Tesla and posted by the EPA on Wednesday, the automaker has argued that the EPA’s “Endangerment Finding,” which concludes that greenhouse gas emissions threaten public health and welfare, is backed by robust science and facts. The Trump EPA wants to scrap the finding, the bedrock of emissions regulations in this country, after over a decade on the books.

Under the Biden administration, the EPA finalized the most stringent emissions rules in U.S. history. The rules would have required automakers to make cars that release fewer and fewer CO2 emissions over time, encouraging them to sell more EVs to meet their emissions target. Automakers can also sell hybrids and plug-in hybrids to meet these goals.

Tesla said rolling back these regulations would disrupt investments, hand automakers a free pass on emissions, and hurt U.S. competitiveness. It also said the agency hasn’t provided enough scientific or economic justification for rolling back the standards and its analysis ignores the cost savings and pollution benefits of EVs.

The biggest reason Tesla has a horse in this race? It has earned billions of dollars over the years selling carbon credits to automakers who can't meet various emissions rules. So it should want policies like the Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules, California's EV sales requirements and EPA regs to remain in effect.

90%: The Trump Administration Wants To Buy A Stake In Lithium Americas

Photo by: Lithium Americas

Weeks after the Trump administration bought a 10% stake in American semiconductor company Intel, it is now seeking to do something similar with Lithium Americas, which is building one of the country’s largest domestic lithium mining projects in Nevada.

The Thacker Pass lithium project could help the U.S. become more independent, and help boost the country’s domestic lithium production and move away from Chinese supply chains. The raw material is used in everything from electric vehicles to consumer electronics and home appliances.

The scale of the Thacker Pass projects is among the largest in the world for a single site. Currently, the U.S. produces less than 5,000 metric tons of lithium at Albemarle’s Nevada facility. Thacker Pass's first phase is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium annually, enough to power 800,000 EVs, Reuters reported.

General Motors owns a 38% stake in the mine, and reportedly has the right to purchase all of the lithium output from the project’s first phase. The Trump administration is seeking guarantees from GM that it will buy the lithium and is also pushing the automaker to give up control over parts of the projects and hand them over to the U.S. government.

What model did you choose and how was the buying process? Was claiming the credit at the point of sale (or through a lease/finance deal) smooth, or a headache?

(TSXV: UCU | OTCQX: UURAF) is beginning to capture investor imagination with a plan that moves beyond extraction and into the linchpin of the supply chain: refining. “You’re not going to have anything on the mining extraction side work or come to fruition unless you have the refining to go with it,” said Pat Ryan, the company’s CEO and Chairman, in a recent conversation. “We’re breaking that mold. We’re bringing it back to America where it needs to be, and the stock is appreciating because of it.”

Ryan’s emphasis on refining as the bridge between mines and end-use technology reflects a broader shift in how investors and governments are evaluating rare earths. Ucore has become a dual-track story: a Canadian company with a demonstration facility in Kingston, Ontario, and a U.S. deployment play with a commercial plant under development in Alexandria, Louisiana. The latter is backed by a US$22.4 million funding agreement with the U.S. Army Contracting Command-Orlando. As Ucore disclosed earlier this month, the Louisiana project now carries a Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) rating, giving its supply orders preferential treatment under U.S. law. Engineering work, site surveys, and long-lead material sourcing are already underway, with full-scale RapidSX™ equipment testing progressing toward mid-2026 commercial output.

At the heart of Ucore’s strategy is its RapidSX™ technology, which Ryan describes as a modernization of solvent extraction chemistry. “We have a computerized column-based technology,” he explained. “The work that we’ve done at the Kingston demo plant—we’ve taken over 10,000 testing metrics to check conventional solvent extraction versus our RapidSX technology—and you get the same purity, the same recovery. So the chemistry is the same, but the deployment of chemistry is so much better.” The efficiencies, he said, translate into a 70% increase in throughput on a smaller footprint with reduced waste and stronger ESG attributes. “It all just gets better from there,” Ryan said, stressing that scalability is aligned with the measured pace of the western market.

Investors have taken note of Ucore’s positioning. Institutional capital, Ryan said, “is starting to understand the U.S. story,” with end customers “lining up in droves” to secure off-take. He pointed out that a year ago many potential buyers “didn’t even know what they wanted,” but today “they understand what those rare earth oxides we’re producing—those ‘seeds of technology,’ as it’s called—they need them.” Demand clarity, coupled with supportive U.S. and Canadian funding, has helped fuel the company’s recent surge in valuation.

Despite geopolitical tensions around tariffs and trade, Ryan described the cross-border operating environment as stable, aided by parallel Canadian and U.S. government backing. “The Canadian government and U.S. government are looking at the data points that we’re collecting for both programs and saying, ‘Hey, this is great. We’ve got to move forward together for the western world.’” Looking further afield, Ucore has signed agreements with Australian companies Metallum and ABx, a move Ryan suggests could position Australia to “trailer hitch with what’s going on in North America.” While he acknowledged the possibility of Australian government involvement, his near-term focus remains squarely on North America, where Ucore intends to build the first stage of a 2,000 tonne per annum separation facility.

The combination of technological differentiation, government prioritization, and intensifying customer demand situates Ucore Rare Metals in a rare position: a refining story at the center of a global supply chain realignment. As Ryan put it, “We’ve taken our technology, we’re putting it in Louisiana, we’re building out our commercial plant there. That doesn’t mean we’re not coming back to Canada to continue the work we’re doing. It’s about Canada and the U.S. moving forward together—let’s make this work.”

U.S. Shale Slows Drilling Amid lower oil prices this year, the U.S. shale patch is in a wait-and-see mode, expecting to ride the price decline with minimal tweaks to strategies.

That’s the latest take from analytics firm Enverus Intelligence Research, which said in a new report this week that the marginal cost of U.S. oil supply is projected to rise from $70 per barrel WTI price at present, to as much as $95 per barrel by the mid-2030s. The expected $15 per barrel surge in costs would be driven by a shift from economically proven inventory to more speculative locations as the core inventory is depleting, according to Enverus Intelligence Research (EIR).

Soaring Cost, Waning Global Influence

The looming depletion of North America’s core oil and gas inventory will have implications for global energy markets, especially the U.S. ability to meet global demand, Enverus’ report says.

“North America’s dominance in supplying global oil demand growth is waning,” Alex Ljubojevic, director at EIR, said in a statement.

“Over the next decade, its contribution to consumption growth is expected to fall below 50% — a stark contrast to the previous 10 years when it supplied more than 100%,” Ljubojevic added.

Still, the Permian basin in West Texas and New Mexico and the Canadian oil sands are and will continue to be North America’s lowest-cost sources of scalable oil supply, Enverus reckons.

The oil sands would benefit from strong Western Canadian Select (WCS) prices and sunk infrastructure costs, and additional takeaway infrastructure capacity could unlock significant upsides to the estimates of Canadian oil production growth. Currently, Enverus expects Canada’s oil output to rise by 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2030, up from an expected record-high for 2025.

The U.S. shale patch, however, will have to contend with flatter growth curves going forward amid oil prices close to current breakevens and depleting core inventory, which will make companies change investment strategies.

“As core shale oil inventory in the U.S. depletes, the industry is entering a new era of higher costs and more complex development. This shift will reshape the cost curve and redefine investment strategies across the continent,” Enverus’ Ljubojevic said.

U.S. Shale Slows Drilling

Amid lower oil prices this year, the U.S. shale patch is in a wait-and-see mode, expecting to ride the price decline with minimal tweaks to strategies. U.S. oil producers are trimming capital expenditure budgets, relying on efficiency gains from current drilling activity to keep output levels.

American oil production is rising, due to the lag between oil price slides and drilling, but large shale producers are already calling the peak of oil output, despite the Trump Administration’s best efforts to support the fossil fuels industry.

For example, efficiency gains, as well as synergies from the Endeavor merger and lower service costs, allowed Diamondback Energy to reduce its 2025 capital budget by another $100 million, or about 3%, from the prior midpoint, to $3.4 - $3.6 billion.

“With volatility and uncertainty persisting, we see no compelling reason to increase activity this year,” CEO Kaes Van't Hof told shareholders in a letter in early August.

Since the Q1 letter to shareholders, Diamondback “Continue to believe that, at current oil prices, U.S. shale oil production has likely peaked and activity levels in the Lower 48 will remain depressed,” Van't Hof said.

Higher costs and continued uncertainty, including with U.S. trade policies, led to another decline in oil and gas activity in the Permian, executives from producers and services firms said in the latest Dallas Fed Energy Survey published this week.

In the survey, most executives, 57%, estimate that regulatory changes since the Trump Administration took over in January 2025 have reduced their firms’ breakeven costs for new wells by less than $1 per barrel. An additional 25% estimate reductions between $1 and $1.99 per barrel, while none of the large E&P firms have seen more than $5 per barrel cost reduction, according to the executives polled.

Moreover, most executives report they have delayed investment decisions in response to heightened uncertainty about the price of oil and/or the cost of producing oil, the survey showed.

“The administration is pushing for $40 per barrel crude oil, and with tariffs on foreign tubular goods, [input] prices are up, and drilling is going to disappear. The oil industry is once again going to lose valuable employees,” one E&P executive commented to the survey.

Another one outright blamed both the previous and current administrations for breaking the U.S. shale business.

“What was once the world’s most dynamic energy engine has been gutted by political hostility and economic ignorance,” the executive said.

The previous administration vilified the industry and cheered when Wall Street walked away from shale, they added, but noted that “Now the current administration is finishing the job.”

“Guided by a U.S. Department of Energy that tells them what they want to hear instead of hard facts, they operate with little understanding of shale economics,” the executive said.

“Instead of supporting domestic production, they’ve effectively aligned with OPEC—using supply tactics to push prices below economic thresholds, kneecapping U.S. producers in the process.”

The shale patch consolidation has been fueled by the collapse of capital availability. This consolidation, in turn, is pushing out independents and entrepreneurs who once defined the shale revolution, according to the executive.

“In their place, a handful of giants now dominate but at the cost of enormous job loss and the destruction of the innovative, risk-taking culture that made the U.S. shale industry great.”

“We have always been confident in the capabilities of our facilities as it relates to PFAS compounds.
We excelled using both OTM-50 and 0010: the EPA’s strictest and newest testing standards for PFAS.","Clean Harbors Inc., Norwell, Massachusetts, has announced study results demonstrating that the company’s commercial high-temperature, RCRA- (Resource Conservation and Recovery Act-) permitted incineration facilities safely and effectively can destroy multiple forms of per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS).

The study, “PFAS Destruction by a Hazardous Waste Incinerator: Testing Results,” and its findings were published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development. Testing was conducted in collaboration with officials from the EPA and U.S. Department of Defense at a Clean Harbors facility in November 2024, and protocols for the test were an extension of previous testing conducted in 2021 and 2022 using EPA standards.

“In recent years, scientific evidence has repeatedly proven the adverse health effects of many of these PFAS chemicals. The EPA and other federal and state regulatory authorities have begun establishing frameworks to protect human health from the impacts of these compounds,” says Mike Battles, co-CEO of Clean Harbors. “We partnered directly with the EPA for our recent testing to ensure that we not only met their latest standards but gathered the most comprehensive data to help regulators develop effective new regulations for PFAS and protect the country from its health impacts.”

Researchers sought to demonstrate that high-temperature combustion (2,000-2,200 F) safely and effectively could destruct PFAS compounds while simultaneously testing for the EPA’s new OTM-50 and 0010 emission standards. They conducted sampling and analysis for key PFAS compounds, as well as any residual volatile or semivolatile elements. Data reviewed the incinerator’s process waste feed streams, solid and liquid process residue streams and stack gases.

Key findings include:

most PFAS (99.999 percent) were destroyed completely or mineralized;

no products of incomplete destruction were observed;

upon C2F6 injection, no C2F6 was measured in the stack; and

destruction efficiencies surpassed 99.99 percent.

“These study results further validate that we can safely and thoroughly destroy a wide variety of PFAS compounds in our high-temperature RCRA-permitted hazardous waste incinerators,” says Eric Gerstenberg, co-CEO of Clean Harbors. “We have always been confident in the capabilities of our facilities as it relates to PFAS compounds. There has been misinformation around incineration and whether it is safe to destroy PFAS. We excelled using both OTM-50 and 0010: the EPA’s strictest and newest testing standards for PFAS. We are the only company to have achieved that designation. Most importantly, we demonstrated with certainty that we can effectively eliminate the threat from forever chemicals in its multiple forms and at commercial scale with consistent outcomes.”

Deer Poacher Convicted – Genesee and Wyoming Counties

On July 14, a Wyoming County man pleaded guilty and paid a penalty for numerous deer poaching incidents in Genesee and Wyoming counties, ending a nearly two-year ECO investigation.

ECO Fuerch responded to a complaint in September 2023 of a headless deer in a field in the town of Bethany, Genesee County. The complainants reported that the deer was shot between 9:30 p.m. and 6 a.m. Officer Fuerch responded to the location and observed the large, headless deer approximately 100 yards off the road with a small-caliber bullet hole in its carcass.

ECOs investigated and identified Tyler D. Jennings, 29, of Attica, as a subject. With search warrants and evidence analysis, ECOs obtained time- and date-stamped photos and text messages confirming the illegal take of 15 antlered deer, mainly large bucks, dating back to 2019. ECOs also discovered the subject shot a large buck out of season in September 2023 and tagged it with an expired 2018 tag, trespassed regularly to take deer illegally, and unlawfully shared antlered-deer tags.

On Feb. 27, 2025, Jennings was arrested and charged with four counts of illegally taking wildlife (misdemeanor), two counts of taking big game after legal hours (misdemeanor), one count of taking deer over the limit (misdemeanor), and nine counts of criminal mischief in the third degree (felony).

DEC worked with the Wyoming County District Attorney’s Office and in July, the subject pleaded guilty and was required to pay $6,000 in fines and $750 in court surcharges. DEC also revoked Jennings’ hunting privileges for five years.

On Sept. 16, ECO Francis responded to a call about a deer stuck in a soccer net on a residential lawn in the town of Islip. Officer Francis arrived at the location and observed the deer with several feet of net wrapped around one antler. The deer’s other antler was broken off near the base from the deer trying to free itself.

I’ve saved thousands on gas and maintenance, my commutes are smoother and faster and I’m doing my part to cut air pollution in my community.

Going electric is no longer a novel luxury. Simply put, it’s a smart investment in more affordable transportation and a healthier future.

Unfortunately, buying an EV is about to get more expensive. Why? Because Congressman Mark Amodei and MAGA Republicans jammed through their “One Big Beautiful Bill,” a law that strips away $7,500 in federal tax credits for Nevada families that choose to drive electric. That means Nevadans will pay more while fossil fuel corporations keep cashing in.

Families are already struggling with rising grocery prices, housing expenses and energy costs.

Those EV savings aren’t pocket change; they’re thousands of dollars each year that can make or break a working household. Right now, with gas prices in Nevada averaging about $3.92 per gallon, a typical family driving 15,000 miles a year in a gas-powered car spends more than $2,300 on fuel annually. Using Nevada’s average electricity rate of $0.13 per kilowatt hour, that same family in an EV would spend only about $585 charging at home. That’s a savings of roughly $1,700–$1,800 every year, plus another $500 annually in lower maintenance costs, since EVs don’t need oil changes or costly transmission work.

Put it all together, and families in Nevada can save around $2,200–$2,300 a year by driving electric.

Beyond family budgets, more EVs on the road mean cleaner air, fewer asthma attacks and lower risks of heart and lung disease, especially in working-class communities that often bear the brunt of air pollution.

When I think of Nevada’s progress, I see charging stations popping up along our highways and in our towns, making road trips stress-free. I see 21,000 new clean energy jobs statewide created by former President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, more than half of which were created right here in Mark Amodei’s district. That’s thousands of Nevadans building our clean energy future, billions of dollars in investment, and thousands of dollars in family savings that Amodei voted to put on the chopping block. Instead of protecting the health and livelihoods of his constituents,

Amodei chose to side with Big Oil and against Nevada workers.

Nevada should be leading the nation in EV adoption, clean energy production, and homegrown jobs. Instead, we’re racing against the clock before these savings expire at the end of the month.

My advice: take advantage of these credits while they last and remember who’s taking them away.

This Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement lasts in perpetuity and has been credited for accelerating North Carolina’s transition from tobacco toward tech.

Today, one North Carolina town is trying to draw a similar parallel between a corporation’s long-running policies and alleged damages the town has incurred. Carrboro in Orange County has sued Duke Energy for what it claims was a knowing effort to deceive the public about the threat of climate change. It is the first time a municipality has sued its local electricity utility for this reason, the town and company both believe.

Carrboro says it is poised to face higher future climate-related costs, from road repairs, to stormwater protections, to cooling public buildings on increasingly hot days. It believes Duke Energy should help pay.

The two sides met in N.C. Business Court for the first time Thursday to debate Duke’s motion to dismiss the case. Several legal concepts were discussed over the five-plus-hour hearing, but a key one revolved around whether Duke Energy could be treated like a tobacco company in the 1990s. Duke’s lawyers, obviously, said no and contended the contrast lay in the link between alleged actions and damages.

“The difference in tobacco cases was saying Lucky Strike ... told me that tobacco wouldn’t kill me or give me cancer or wouldn’t cause these problems. I then went out, I bought cigarettes, I smoked. I kept smoking a cigarette. Now I have cancer,” Hunter Bruton of the law firm Smith Anderson said. “So, you can trace it right back. There’s never a, Philip Morris lied to the public about the dangers of cigarettes, and then that caused somebody else to smoke cigarettes, and then that person was smoking cigarettes and caused us municipal harm because it smells bad in Carrboro.”

In a May filing, Carrboro compared Duke’s alleged climate change deception to cigarette companies paying scientists to undermine the connection between tobacco use and cancer. And its lawyers fought Duke’s framing of the case as one that tries to regulate the emissions of an already state-regulated monopoly.

Even a highly regulated company can be held liable for deception, attorney Matthew Quinn argued. “We’ve seen that in the various climate cases throughout the country,” he said. “We’ve also seen that in American jurisprudence, from the tobacco litigation, (methyl tertiary butyl ether) litigation, opioid litigation.”

Carrboro wants to make its case before a jury. Duke wants it to go away immediately. A judge will decide what happens next.

Who wants to talk about H-1B visas?

H-1B work visas are a sensitive topic. I’ve spoken to one major corporation who would only discuss their usage on background. And this week, a retail chain asked me if its name could be removed from an article on how the state’s largest employers use or don’t use the popular program, which pairs educated foreign workers with U.S. employers big and small. (We didn’t remove it.)

I’ve gotten few personal threats as a journalist, but one was in my inbox after we published a series a few years ago on H-1B workers in the Triangle and their families.

The H-1B debate reemerged last Friday when President Donald Trump ordered employers to pay a $100,000 fee on all future visa applications. Smaller companies in the Triangle said the price was a nonstarter. Larger companies either said they needed more time to understand the policy — which is likely to be challenged in court — or they said nothing at all.

North Carolina schools use H-1B visas to fill teacher vacancies, with some telling my colleague T. Keung Hui they will need a fee exemption or face greater staff shortages. Most H-1B visas go to the tech sector, not education, making the issue particularly relevant to the Triangle. We’ve put together a list of which North Carolina companies hire the most H-1B workers, though the data comes with a huge caveat, which you can read about in that story.

While you’re here, I encourage you to click on some of my past H-1B reporting. There are weird classified job ads that exploit green card loopholes and local visa workers who considered moving to Canada, only to see that country also become less welcoming.

What’s it like to be the spouse of an H-1B worker? What’s it like for their children? And why did IBM begin ‘scaling back’ its use of these visas long before Trump retook office?

This practice, known as solar grazing, helps lower emissions and costs while allowing farmland to serve multiple purposes.

The Hornet Solar project is one of the largest in the U.S. and hopes to serve as an example for large-scale solar grazing.

TULIA, Texas — Off of a dirt road near Tulia, Texas, a solar farm four times larger than New York City's Central Park soaks up the sun. Beneath its panels, more than 2,000 sheep and 11 dogs maintain the land.

These four-legged employees are solar grazing, a practice of using livestock, typically sheep, as natural mowers. Vesper Energy, based in Dallas, unveiled the Hornet Solar project in April 2025 as one of the largest operations in the U.S. It is now hoping to also encourage the practice of solar grazing on a large scale.

""This is our first time to do it, and it's been really interesting to see how it's working,"" said Rick Knauth, head of asset management at Vesper Energy. ""It's been a really good experience here. Everyone's happy.""

What is solar grazing?

Solar grazing is the practice of using livestock, typically sheep, as a natural mowing service at solar farms. Knauth added that the sheep are used to help keep vegetation low at Hornet Solar. The hope is to eventually go fully solar grazing, not needing the mechanical mowers that can sometimes damage equipment.

""That doesn't happen with sheep, which is another nice benefit,"" Knauth said. ""The way it is panning out here, it is cheaper, it is working fine, and there's been no negative feedback.""

Solar grazing also helps lower emissions and costs, and allows farmland to serve multiple purposes. The sheep’s wool and meat can be harvested, further helping agricultural industries, according to the American Solar Grazing Association.

“Farm incomes are down, and solar grazing allows farmers to increase and diversify revenues without taking land out of food production,” stated the American Solar Grazing Association’s website. “Sheep are naturally suited to the job of solar grazing. They enjoy the shade of the solar panels on hot days, napping and grazing where humans would struggle to reach.”

Hornet Solar, Vesper Energy aim to continue growth in power and sheep

With more than 1.36 million photovoltaic modules covering 3,900 acres and a capacity of 600 MWac, Hornet Solar has the largest capacity in Texas, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. It is the second largest in the U.S. as of September 2025, following Gemini Solar Hybrid’s 690 MW capacity in Clark, Nevada, according to cleanview.co.

With this size, the Hornet Solar flock has room for expansion. As of Sept. 23, the flock has 2,275 ewes and 244 lambs. It expects an additional 550 lambs to be born in the second week of October, and will continue to grow as rams are brought in for the fall breeding season.

Hornet Solar’s flock also has 11 guardian dogs, led by Buck. The two newest dogs in the pack are named after the project, Vesper and Solar. The guardians include Great Pyrenees, Anatolian Shepherd and Akbash breeds and mixes.

“(Buck) is a sweet dog that will approach anyone who visits the sheep,” Vesper Energy stated in a fact sheet. “Yet, he won't put up with coyotes or other predators that get near his sheep. Thousands of years of selective breeding have instilled an inherent desire to protect sheep.”

With the massive scope of this project, and the usage of solar grazing, Knauth hopes this becomes an example for others.

""I'm hoping, by how well we're doing and how it's just working out in a really uncomplicated fashion, that this could serve as an example for others who are thinking about it,"" Knauth said. ""We're serving as sort of a proving ground for large scale sheep operations.""

If built, it would have the potential to emit the third most greenhouse gases of any industrial facility in the state.

NIPSCO's proposed air permit shows the gas plant could put out the equivalent of 7 million tons of carbon dioxide a year. Only U.S. Steel Gary Works and Duke Energy's Gibson coal plant emit more.

Ben Inskeep is with the consumer and environmental advocacy group Citizens Action Coalition. He said it's a big change from NIPSCO's plans seven years ago.

""This really highlights how NIPSCO has done a complete reversal of their prior strategy that was focused on being more sustainable, focused on adding renewable energy and retiring their fossil fuel generation,"" Inskeep said.

Last year, NIPSCO made two plans for how to serve its customers — one with data centers in its area and one without. With data centers, NIPSCO expects its energy needs will more than double.

""So it seems very clear, based on those documents, based on the strategy NIPSCO has outlined, and based on where their customers are today, that it has no need for this gas plant unless it's to serve the data centers exclusively,"" Inskeep said.

NIPSCO didn't provide anyone for an interview, but said that it has entered into a contract with a data center and would share more during its third-quarter earnings call.

NIPSCO created a separate company called NIPSCO Generation LLC (GenCo) to serve data centers to protect its existing customers from higher bills.

The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission will have less oversight of the subsidiary. Inskeep said even though the commission still has to approve the gas plant, that process is likely to be quick without much time for the public to weigh in.

Elimination of buyer incentives combined with regulatory uncertainty is expected to slow domestic electric vehicle adoption as the technology advances in other global markets, a forecasting model has found.

This is according to consulting firm EY’s September 2025 “EY Mobility Lens Forecaster,” an AI-powered modeling tool developed to predict electric vehicle adoption timelines in the key U.S., China and EU markets through 2050.

For the U.S. market, EY’s forecaster projects EV adoption will begin to slow with the elimination of the federal EV tax credit on Sept. 30, as well as from tariffs and other legislative uncertainty surrounding the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which was approved by Congress in July.

The company’s forecasting model, which it launched in 2021, uses neural networks and other macroeconomic variables to evaluate long-term global consumer behavior, regulatory trends, the rollout of advanced vehicle technology and OEM strategies to predict how EV adoption might accelerate in the three global markets through 2050.

In addition, factors such as escalating trade tensions, rare earth shortages are expected to further slow EV adoption in the U.S. to a more moderate pace year over year, from 7.3% in 2024, to under 2% annually each year through 2030. EVs are projected to account for only 11% of all U.S. light vehicle sales by 2029 as a result of “policy roadblocks,” according to EY’s data. Still, EVs are on track to reach 32% of U.S. light vehicle sales by 2035.

Although the EY forecaster predicts a short-term spike in U.S. EV sales in Q3 as buyers rush to take advantage of the EV tax credit of up to $7,500, the timeline to reach 50% EV adoption won’t happen now until 2039 — five years later than previously forecast. But, sales of hybrid vehicles in the U.S. and EU markets will continue to grow.

“Hybrids will be the selection, and I think it will be the bridge to get us to full electrification,” said George Lenyo, EY Americas Automotive Leader, in an interview with Automotive Dive.

The hybrid vehicle segment in the U.S. is expected to grow rapidly over the next decade, according to EY’s data. Despite an overall cooldown in the U.S. EV market, hybrid vehicles are expected to account for 34% of all passenger vehicles sold by 2034. Sales of hybrid vehicles are expected to climb to over 3 million units in the U.S. by next year, according to EY’s data.

“The near- to mid-term future will feature a diverse mix of powertrains, shaped by regulatory shifts, tariffs, and evolving consumer behavior,” said Constantin M. Gall, EY Global Aerospace, Defense & Mobility Leader, in the release. “What’s clear is that e-mobility will remain central to the future of transportation.”

OEMs adapt to a new tariff-fueled business environment

U.S. OEMs must also navigate a new tariff-fueled business environment, which extends to their global supply chains. But to help mitigate their impact, automakers are expected to boost their domestic sourcing for EVs, including battery manufacturing, according to EY.

EY’s data shows that U.S. automakers are currently absorbing tariff costs by holding prices steady and shifting their product mix towards higher-margin vehicles to offset inflationary pressures. But it’s unclear how long this strategy will work. Tariffs are likely to result in car shoppers seeing higher prices.

But U.S. automakers have historically been successful at adapting to changes in market conditions, according to Lenyo. He expects that the Big Three should will be able to weather any slowdowns in EV sales and grow their hybrid vehicle sales in the interim.

“The domestic OEMs are extremely resilient, I think they’re very good at figuring out a solution,” Lenyo said. “The advantage that these domestic U.S. automakers have is that ability to continue to balance the investment, balance the powertrain, keeping one foot in today, but an eye towards tomorrow,” he said.

Still, along with an anticipated slowdown of EV adoption, the rapid pace of innovation will continue, and automakers may face a loss of market share if they don’t keep up with the technological advancements of their competitors, including autonomous driving, advanced hybrid and EV battery chemistries, as well as the rollout of software-defined vehicles.

Policy changes will help boost EV sales in the EU, but not until after 2027

In Europe, the Mobility Lens Forecaster indicates that economic pressures, a reduction in incentives and weaker emissions penalties will slow EV adoption from now through 2027. But stricter emissions regulations combined with the launch of more affordable EVs are expected to result in a sales rebound after 2027.

EY forecasts that EVs will account for 50% of all vehicle sales in the EU by 2032. In the interim, hybrid and plug-in hybrids are also expected to serve as a bridge towards EV adoption like in the U.S., outselling fully electric models through 2030. By 2041, EVs are expected to reach a 95% market share in the EU as a result of more advanced low-cost batteries and reduced cost of ownership, according to EY.

China will remain a dominant force in EV adoption

But as the U.S. and EU fall behind in the global EV race, EY forecasts that China will remain a dominant force in EV growth over the next decade, even as the market share of China OEMs declines due to growing competition, which is what Tesla is currently facing.

“China’s got great technology,” said Lenyo. “They’ve got governmental policies that are supportive of EV, climate that is supportive of EV, and I think they’ve got a willing consumer.”

EY predicts that pure EVs will account for over 50% of China’s light vehicle sales by 2033, due to their lower costs compared to ICE vehicles, as well as strong government support.

“New energy vehicles” in China, a broader category that includes both EVs and plug-in hybrids, are expected to reach 50% of China’s car sales this year, and account for 90% of the country’s passenger vehicle sales by 2034, five years ahead of the projected 50% EV adoption rate in the U.S. EV adoption in China will continue to climb beyond that.

“By 2050, almost every car that will be sold [in China] will be a battery electric vehicle [BEV],” said Lenyo. EY’s data estimates that BEVs will account for nearly 96% of all passenger vehicle sales in China by then.

Despite the varied EV adoption timelines across the three key markets, the auto industry’s gradual pivot to electrification will continue over the long-term, according to Lenyo. This means that automakers Ford Motor Co. and General Motors, which currently rely on the sales of full-size ICE vehicles for a bulk of their profits today, must not lose sight of their long-term EV goals to remain competitive as the market continues to evolve.

“The greatest risk and the insight that came out of the [Sept. 2025] Mobility Lens Forecast is the delay and the slowdown of the U.S. market, and how well they’re [automakers] going to continue to adapt and not fall too far behind,” Lenyo said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/9HVSvwOLcWyzSi8mQDD_IkHa9cc-wSL7-idGiaSKMck/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9TY3JlZW5zaG90XzIwMjUtMDktMTlfYXRfMTIuMzUuMDRQTS5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-09-26 12:04:24.908975

Numbers were being shared that sounded almost too good to be true and, in many cases, were. Some offers circulating were roughly half the cost of more realistic market pricing, while others reflected the higher expense of incorporating greater levels of domestic content. That’s not a small difference. It’s a gap that can decide whether a project pencils out or falls apart.

The reality is that these ultra-low price points aren’t sustainable without heavy support from the Inflation Reduction Act’s Section 45X advanced manufacturing tax credits. And come Jan. 1, 2026, compliance with Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions will be mandatory — making it even harder to deliver numbers that look appealing on a slide but collapse under the realities of compliance and delivery.

Pricing is only part of the story

Even if the numbers hold on paper, another challenge remains: Can suppliers actually deliver?

Building a solar manufacturing facility in the United States is far more complex than building in other countries. Permitting takes longer, public scrutiny is greater and, in many cases, the U.S. workforce is still developing the highly specialized skills required for high-volume solar manufacturing. These realities affect both cost and timing. At ES Foundry, we selected an existing building already rooted in the community. By repurposing space that was familiar to local stakeholders, we reduced permitting hurdles, reduced concerns about the unknown and signaled that we were committed to building alongside — not apart from — the community.

That’s why track record is critical. Announcing a multi-gigawatt factory is one thing; producing consistent, high-quality output is another. Developers, investors and offtakers should be asking how far along suppliers really are — and whether actual production matches press release announcements.

Questions that matter

Rather than focusing only on the lowest headline number, the industry should be asking whether the quoted price will hold as Section 45X incentives phase out and Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) compliance costs are factored in. The industry is beginning to recognize that not all U.S. manufacturers qualify for the 45X incentive, and that the ability to sustain low prices without this support is becoming a critical measure of viability. It’s also important to consider whether the supplier has a proven track record of delivering projects at scale and to look closely at how actual production compares to the volumes announced in press releases.

Finally, buyers should examine what contractual protections are in place if pricing shifts or compliance standards change, ensuring that projects remain both viable and bankable.

Balanced approach

The U.S. solar industry has a historic opportunity to build a competitive and resilient domestic supply chain, but chasing unsustainable pricing puts projects, investors and credibility at risk.

Realism doesn’t mean pessimism. It means acknowledging that higher levels of domestic content carry a premium, and that suppliers with real operating track records are worth more than those with just a press release.

New data centers are fueling a trillion-dollar industrial revolution. “This is the biggest infrastructure project in history.” All of this, quite literally, scars the earth. Right now, A.I.’s environmental impacts are growing, and the consequences are hitting home. “My car is gone.” “I’m OK. It’s OK.” “Everything’s gone.” Spruce Pine is like a secret. It’s a small, sleepy town in North Carolina. Very few people realize how crucial it is in the A.I. supply chain. I came here last fall as part of my work to map the hidden costs of artificial intelligence. I’ve been studying the impacts of A.I. for over a decade. I didn’t realize it, but I was about to see those costs up close and personal. But first, let me show you what I came to see. Below us is the world’s main source of high-purity quartz. As much as 90 percent of the world’s supply of this crucial mineral comes from this five-square-mile quarry. This is what it looks like before it’s mined. This is pegmatite that I picked up in Spruce Pine. It was formed in a rare deposit about 300 million years ago. So what has this ancient rock got to do with A.I.? First, the quartz from these rocks is shipped east to China and Taiwan. The purity and heat resistance make it essential in producing this. A semiconductor microchip. They perform the millions of calculations needed to run A.I. models. But to do this work, they demand vast amounts of power and water. Demand that is expected to dramatically increase in the next decade. “Well, we needed a building. We looked, basically, for factories that had been abandoned, but the —” Take Elon Musk’s company xAI, which boasts that it has built the world’s largest A.I. supercomputer, in South Memphis. Musk calls it Colossus. The local power grid couldn’t support its energy demands, so the company set up dozens of methane gas generators, releasing nitrogen oxides and formaldehyde into the air. This historically Black community was blindsided, and they’re calling for fines and an investigation. “Everyday people don’t get a deal, but Elon Musk does.” In Virginia, data centers already consume more than a quarter of the state’s total electricity. “People’s utility bills may double in the next seven to 10 years just to power data centers. Pollution is rising, and water supplies are being stretched thin.” Worldwide, data centers will soon be using as much energy as Japan and are predicted to match India’s energy usage by 2030. It’s like adding a whole new industrial nation onto the grid. But instead of limiting the environmental impacts, this is happening. “Stargate, put that name down in your books. A new American company that will invest $500 billion, at least, in A.I. infrastructure in the United States.” Just days after he pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, President Trump announced plans to build sprawling A.I. data centers across the country. “The fact that we get to do this in the United States is, I think, wonderful. OpenAI’s new data center, code-named Project Ludicrous, is being built right now in Texas. It’s larger than Central Park. There are plans to construct at least 20 of these across the country. Now generative A.I. will compete with you, for power, water and land. It’s driving up electricity bills while releasing more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. All of this comes at a cost. “We’re back with more breaking news on Hurricane Helene. Now a very powerful Category 4 storm.” Days after I visited, Hurricane Helene slammed into Spruce Pine. The deadliest U.S. hurricane since Katrina, it killed more than 200 people in the region. The plane that I’d flown in over the mines just a few days earlier, destroyed. The North Toe River, poisoned with sewage, oil, and mining runoff. People had lost everything. With all the focus on the rapid build-out of A.I. factories, what gets less attention are the real risks they pose to our environment. Of course, we can’t pin one hurricane on climate change, but the science is clear. The warming planet will produce more dangerous storms and in places that have never seen this level of severity, like Spruce Pine. This is the reality we face. Now, tech evangelists claim that A.I. will fix climate change in the future. But right now, A.I. is making the situation worse. None of this is inevitable. A.I. technologies could still benefit societies as a whole, or they could enrich a small cadre of interests. Washington has made its choice. It will be up to local communities to take up a grass-roots fight to protect their land, air and water. Because technological progress that isn’t sustainable isn’t really progress.

Buyers in the US looking to take advantage of the federal electric vehicle tax credit have one last weekend to hunt for a good deal.

Wording in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that killed the $7,500 federal EV tax credit set a hard Sept. 30 deadline for claiming the tax credit, but the IRS is giving buyers and automakers a break by allowing a “written binding contract” for the purchase of the vehicle to qualify for the credit in lieu of delivery of that vehicle by Sept. 30.

This weekend, automakers like GM (GM), Ford (F), Tesla (TSLA), and Rivian (RIVN) will try to entice Americans to go electric. Tesla even updated its website to say “order by September 30” and included a countdown clock on the site.

But despite traditional media and social sites’ ongoing coverage of the tax credit's expiration, it seems a huge percentage of Americans don’t understand how the credits work.

“While most shoppers have heard of the credit, a recent study from Cars.com shows only about a third really understand how it works,” Cars.com Detroit bureau chief Aaron Bragman said to Yahoo Finance.

“That’s important, because nearly 80% of car shoppers considering EVs say it factors into their decision to go electric, and almost half say they might speed up their plans before the deadline hits,” he added.

Here’s how the rules work.

To be eligible, the EVs need to be assembled in North America and must also prove battery materials and components do not originate from countries deemed foreign entities of concern (FEOC), which includes China, Russia, and North Korea. A full list of eligible vehicles is available on the fueleconomy.gov website.

Once that’s out of the way, there are price restrictions. For vehicles like coupes and sedans, the MSRP limit to get the tax credit is $55,000. For trucks and SUVs, the limit is $80,000.

Then, buyer income must be limited to $300,000 in adjusted gross income for joint filers or $150,000 for individual filers to qualify.

Finally, there is the lease exemption. Under the law, leasing EVs falls under the commercial EV credit of the law (known as the 45W credit for commercial clean vehicles), which doesn’t require North American assembly or income requirements.

Basically the rule says any taxpayer (and automaker) that leases a clean vehicle to customers is eligible to claim the commercial EV credit, meaning every foreign automaker from Kia (000270.KS) to Mercedes (MBGAF) qualifies, as well as very expensive EVs from any automaker.

Another part of the confusion is how the credit is paid out.

The past version of the federal EV tax credit only allowed the taxpayer to apply for a “credit” of $7,500 when filing their annual tax return. Now, for EV purchases purchased under the current law, dealers are able to deduct the amount at “point of sale,” meaning they can take the credit at the time of purchase and file with the IRS later. A similar scheme is in place with leases, with the $7,500 deducted from the buyer’s lease payments across the length of the contract immediately.

Buyers should also be on the lookout for any automaker incentives aimed at moving inventory.

“Some automakers and dealers are also offering their own discounts and financing deals, which can stack on top of the credit to bring prices down even more. And don’t forget—many states and cities offer their own incentives that will still be around even after the federal program ends,” Cars.com’s Bragman said.

Indeed, the state of New York offers a $2,000 “Drive Clean Rebate” for some vehicles, and California offers up to $7,000 in rebates for eligible buyers.

But buyers need to act now to “stack” dealer and local offers with the big federal tax credit.

“Time is running out for anyone thinking about buying or leasing an electric vehicle,” Bragman said, adding that if you want to get the federal EV tax credit savings, “Don’t wait.”

Utility-scale segment drives surge with 4.9 GW added; Texas, California, and Arizona each top 1 GW as residential storage doubles year-over-year

The U.S. energy storage sector posted its strongest quarter on record in Q2 2025, adding 5.6 GW of new capacity, according to the latest U.S. Energy Storage Monitor from the American Clean Power Association (ACP) and Wood Mackenzie. Most of that momentum came from the utility-scale segment, which logged 4.9 GW of installations, enough capacity to cover peak demand for 3.7 million homes.

Utility-scale storage dominates new capacity

Texas, California, and Arizona each added more than 1 GW of large-scale storage last quarter, reflecting the steady role batteries now play in managing grid stress. The Southwest Power Pool (SPP) also showed renewed life, with Oklahoma bringing three projects online—the region’s first since 2022.

In the Southeast, vertically integrated utilities are leaning harder into storage, with Florida and Georgia receiving major forecast upgrades thanks to aggressive procurement activity.

“Energy storage is being quickly deployed to strengthen our grid as demand for power surges and is helping to drive down energy prices for American families and businesses,” said Noah Roberts, ACP’s vice president of energy storage. He added that while regulatory uncertainty lingers, domestic manufacturing of grid batteries is scaling fast enough to meet 100% of U.S. demand in the years ahead.

Residential and CCI markets expand

The residential sector added 608 MW in Q2, more than doubling year-over-year and posting an 8% increase from Q1. Most growth came from California, Arizona, and Illinois, with higher-capacity systems gaining share as attachment rates climbed.

The commercial, community, and industrial (CCI) segment expanded modestly at 38 MW, led by California and New York, though Illinois also showed progress. Policy and cost hurdles continue to slow community storage uptake despite the growing need for neighborhood-scale solutions.

Headwinds on the horizon

Despite near-term growth, the report projects utility-scale storage could dip 10% year-over-year in 2027, largely due to uncertainty over pending Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) regulations that will dictate eligible battery cell sourcing for the Investment Tax Credit (ITC).

“All segments of the storage market are feeling both opportunity and risk,” said Allison Feeney, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “Residential storage is expected to outpace solar because of stronger policy resilience and consistent ITC access. But pricing pressure, FEOC rules, and sluggish community storage deployment could slow overall growth.”

Allison Weis, Wood Mackenzie’s global head of storage, noted that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act preserved the ITC, but compliance hurdles remain. “A rush to start construction under today’s regulatory certainty is boosting the near-term forecast. Projects that don’t meet milestones by the end of 2025 face real exposure to policy changes.”

Looking ahead

The report forecasts the U.S. market will reach 87.8 GW of cumulative storage by 2029, driven by utility and residential adoption. But headwinds could trim as much as 16.5 GW from the five-year outlook if supply shortages and permitting delays persist.",https://solarbuildermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/big-battery-storage-photo.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 12:05:39.590033

In the final version, it may barely make an appearance.

The draft rule to undo the endangerment finding leaned heavily on a new legal reading of the Clean Air Act asserting that EPA has no authority to regulate greenhouse gases for their effect on climate change. But EPA also floated an “alternative” rationale — one focused on science and drawn almost exclusively from a Department of Energy report that downplayed the risks and severity of climate change.

That report is now in limbo after DOE disbanded the so-called Climate Working Group that wrote it. The agency has come under fire — and a lawsuit — for the process that led to the establishment of the working group, which was staffed with five climate contrarians hand-picked by Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

The legal uncertainty — and last week’s report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine calling climate change “beyond scientific dispute” — may be enough to convince EPA to drop its scientific argument altogether, some experts said. EPA gains little and risks much by wading into the choppy waters of climate science in its bid to overturn the 2009 finding that greenhouse gases harm human health.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if it doesn’t play much of a role at all in the final rule,” said Jody Freeman, director of the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School. “That would be smart. If they’re not smart and they leave it in there, they’re just inviting a court to say, ‘You ignored the overwhelming science, and under arbitrary and capricious review, you can’t.’”

Jeff Holmstead, a partner with Bracewell who led the EPA air office during the George W. Bush administration, agreed that EPA could drop the scientific rationale in the final rule. The agency, he said, could explain its decision by pointing to the public comments it received for the draft rule, many of which likely mention the National Academies report.

“One option they would have is just to say ‘we’ve gotten all these comments and we’ve been persuaded that climate change is a serious problem, but nevertheless, we don’t have authority to regulate CO2 emissions from vehicles … because it’s not the kind of pollution that Congress wanted us to deal with,’” Holmstead said.

EPA proposed the endangerment repeal in July and plans to finalize it in December. In the rush to get it across the finish line, even some conservative activists seem willing to scrap efforts to question scientific consensus as part of the rulemaking.

“The scientific establishment is locking arms,” Myron Ebell, who led President Donald Trump’s first-term EPA transition team, said, referring to the National Academies report. “And perhaps the right way to proceed is to just make it on the legal argument. To do it very quickly after the comment period is closed and the comments have been addressed, get it done fairly soon and get it into court.”

‘The report is not usable’

EPA’s proposed repeal of the endangerment finding references the DOE report 28 times to challenge the scientific consensus that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health by driving harmful warming.

Scientists have widely criticized the DOE report, which relies on cherry-picked data and misleading climate claims. Former Biden officials and environmental groups also say DOE violated laws governing how agencies seek advice and recommendations from outside experts, as well as skirted requirements to vet research used in policy decisions.

EPA’s proposed endangerment repeal states that the agency “reviewed and relied upon” a draft version of the DOE report dated May 27 — two months before it was issued publicly.

Rachel Cleetus, policy director for Union of Concerned Scientists, said that indicates both agencies violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act. UCS and the Environmental Defense Fund have sued DOE and EPA, asserting that DOE violated the act in setting up the working group and EPA in using it as the basis of a policy decision.

“What [EPA is] citing is a draft version of the report, so they clearly had access to the report well before it was sprung on the public,” Cleetus said. “What that means and how much they were involved — this is why we’re asking for release of documents and records, because they’re violating [the Federal Advisory Committee Act] in a lot of different ways.”

Wright dismantled the working group and argued in court filings that it made the lawsuit moot. Report author Judith Curry has since said DOE “really didn’t dot all the I’s and cross the T’s” to make the group official.

Last Thursday, a federal judge agreed that the DOE working group should have followed laws governing how agencies solicit advice from outside experts. Judge William Young of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts dismissed DOE’s claims that the Climate Working Group qualified for an exemption to federal advisory committee laws because it existed merely to “exchange facts or information.”

”No reasonable jury could find that these words, arranged as they are, do not constitute advice or recommendations for a renewed approach to climate policy,” Young, a Reagan appointee, wrote in his opinion.

Young declined the environmental groups’ request to bar EPA from using the DOE report in its final rule to repeal the endangerment finding. DOE has said the July report is a draft and that the public comment period — which ended on Sept. 2 — served as the legally required “peer review” for important scientific reports. But the department declined to answer inquiries from POLITICO’S E&E News about plans to respond to the nearly 350 submitted comments or whether a final report would ever be published.

“DOE determined that the draft report and the public comments it solicited achieved the purpose of the [Climate Working Group], namely to catalyze broader discussion about the certainties and uncertainties of current climate science,” said DOE spokesperson Andrea Woods. “We will continue to engage in the debate in favor of a more science-based and less ideological conversation around climate science.”

Chris Frey, who headed EPA’s research office during the Biden administration, said DOE’s missteps in producing the report would compromise any government action that relied upon it.

“If you don’t develop the report in a credible way, the report itself — regardless of whatever content is in it — is not credible,” he said. “So, from a federal science policy perspective, the report is not usable. EPA should not be using it to inform its rulemaking, because it does not meet the science policy requirements that EPA has held to.”

Freeman of Harvard said the National Academies report also makes it harder for EPA to rely on the DOE report. The Clean Air Act requires EPA to disclose findings and recommendations from the National Academies in its rulemakings.

The report — which the National Academies undertook in response to EPA’s proposal to repeal the endangerment finding — reaffirmed the 2009 finding that greenhouse gases harm human health.

The National Academies, a nonprofit institution created by Congress to provide the federal government with independent scientific advice, has a statutory role under the Clean Air Act. DOE’s Climate Working Group does not.

Ticking clock

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is racing the clock to finalize its endangerment finding repeal and defend it in court. Internal EPA notes and slides seen by E&E News show the agency has given itself less than two months to submit a final rule to the White House.

By repealing the 2009 finding — which underpins nearly all climate rules — the Trump administration hopes to prevent future administrations from regulating climate pollution.

That would require the Supreme Court to uphold the repeal with a sufficiently sweeping ruling, which could be two or three years away. EPA is under pressure to finalize a repeal quickly enough to ensure the Trump administration can oversee the repeal’s defense.

Tom Lorenzen, senior counsel at Crowell & Moring, said EPA could create legal problems for itself if it relies on scientific findings that haven’t been finalized for the endangerment finding repeal.

EPA’s draft repeal and supporting documents say virtually nothing about why it chose to lean so heavily on one scientific review by five scientists over the many syntheses and scientific assessment reports that have been published over the years by global climate science bodies and U.S. government researchers. If the “alternative rationale” survives in the final rule, EPA will have to “beef that up,” Lorenzen said.

The courts afford agencies broad deference on scientific matters if they explain their reasoning, he said. But a Supreme Court ruling deferring to EPA on the science wouldn’t prevent a future Democratic administration from reinstating the endangerment finding and regulations.

“It would be entitled to the same high level of deference for its scientific and technical conclusions that this administration is entitled to,” said Lorenzen. “So that is at best a backup argument for EPA if they don’t win the legal issue.”

Freeman said that having the embattled DOE report attached to EPA’s final rule repeal would “feed an impression that the court might have, which is that this agency is not operating on the level.”

“That report is like a vibe,” she said. “And the vibe is this agency is not behaving in a credible, serious way if they’re going to invoke this report that was a draft, and then the working group disbanded inexplicably before finalizing it, and there’s this lawsuit challenging their composition under the [Federal Advisory Committees Act]. It’s atmospheric.

The Internal Revenue Service has been slow in recent weeks to approve and pay federal tax credits for electric vehicles, according to auto dealers and industry analysts — creating confusion for car dealers and hindering EV sales less than a week before the tax break is slated to disappear.

The delays began in earnest in mid-September, according to accounts shared with CNBC from three dealers in different parts of the country. Auto analysts and two national trade associations also confirmed to CNBC dealership reports of delays.

The dealerships say it forces them into a tough choice: carry the cost to keep offering the credit, or pull back and risk losing vehicle sales.

""We're continuing to pay the tax credit, though with a lot of anxiety,"" said Jesse Lore, founder of Green Wave Electric Vehicles in North Hampton, New Hampshire. ""We're out close to $100,000 right now.""

Most consumers access the tax break — worth up to $4,000 for used EVs and $7,500 for new EVs — as an upfront rebate at the point of sale. That rebate can serve as a full or partial down payment, or reduce a car's overall cost, for example.

Car dealers generally front that money to qualifying consumers after getting online approval from the IRS, and the agency then repays dealers.

Prior to mid-September, that entire process generally happened within a few days, dealers said.

Now, the IRS is taking an unusually long time to approve and pay EV tax credits, dealers said. They say they are unable to get in touch with the agency, and as a result are in limbo and without an idea of when — or if — they'll get those funds.

A White House official said in an e-mail that all valid EV tax credits applied for before the Sept. 30 deadline would be granted and paid out.

Robyn Capehart, an IRS spokesperson, wrote in an e-mail that ""any submissions through the Energy Credits Online portal have always been subject to IRS review and approval.""

""Once approved by the IRS, seller reports (also known as time of sale reports) support vehicle eligibility for the credit, even if that acceptance followed an IRS review period,"" Capehart wrote.

The White House and the IRS offered no explanation for the reported delays.

'We're in the dark'

Some dealerships have continued to issue the EV tax credit to qualifying buyers, hoping the federal government will pay them back later.

A dozen new applications Lore has submitted to the IRS since Sept. 15 are still listed as ""pending,"" he said. Three others were approved on Thursday. None have been paid yet. Lore showed screenshots of the transactions to CNBC.

Such a delay had previously rarely occurred since the tax break first became available as an upfront rebate, in January 2024, Lore said.

""We're in the dark,"" he said.

He also hasn't been able to provide customers with the time-of-sale report that they need to reconcile the tax credit on their annual tax return, Lore said.

EV tax credit delays come at 'worst possible time'

Uwe Krejci | Digitalvision | Getty Images

It's unclear why and to what extent delays are happening.

Some dealers speculated they may be tied to backlogs at the IRS due to reduced staffing and higher volume of EV sales. Others said they think it could be a purposeful move by the Trump administration in an effort to reduce EV sales.

Regardless, the roadblocks come at a bad time, dealers and analysts said.

Republicans ended the EV tax credit after Sept. 30 as part of the so-called ""big beautiful bill"" passed in July. The tax break was supposed to last through 2032.

Consumers have rushed to buy EVs before the tax break disappears, to secure the cars at a discounted price.

That helped push new and used EV sales to record highs in August, according to Cox Automotive data. September was expected to be another blockbuster month.

But some dealers have pulled back amid the uncertainty, unable to float big sums of cash to consumers.

""I know for a fact there are dealers saying, 'We're not doing it anymore. We're not getting paid,'"" Lore said. ""Others are saying [to consumers], 'We're holding the cars, and you can't drive the car home until we get paid in full.'""

Gary Pretzfeld, co-owner of AutoTrust USA in Miramar, Florida, said the IRS owes him about $80,000 to $90,000 in rebates that he has floated to EV buyers this month.

""There are definitely some dealers who can't afford to do it this way,"" Pretzfeld said.

Car dealerships are a ""really cash-intensive business,"" and payment delays threaten to tip dealers into a ""cash crunch"" at a time when they were expecting to sell huge volumes of EVs, said Scott Case, the CEO of Recurrent, an EV market research firm.

""It's a quiet, festering problem at the worst possible time,"" Case said.

The National Independent Automobile Dealers Association, a trade group that represents used car dealers, is aware of the issue, said spokesperson Richard Greene.

""The dealers and NIADA have engaged the IRS,"" Greene said in an e-mail. ""NIADA hopes the payments are processed by the IRS before the program's expiration.""

Amy Hunter Wright, a spokesperson for the National Automobile Dealers Association, a trade group, also said some members had experienced delays.

""Anecdotally, we have heard some dealers report that recent submissions have been placed in pending status since last week,"" she wrote in an e-mailed statement. ""NADA has been and continues to work with the IRS and the Department of Treasury regarding the portal and they have been cooperative.""

Why the upfront rebate is important to buyers

Jackyenjoyphotography | Moment | Getty Images

Of course, dealers aren't obligated to offer the tax credit as an upfront payment.

Consumers can still try to claim the tax break when they file their annual tax returns next year.

But the point-of-sale rebate has been a big draw for consumers, said Al Salas, CEO of Eco Auto, a dealer with operations in Massachusetts and Washington state, and which is expanding to Florida, Georgia and New Jersey.

It's a quiet, festering problem at the worst possible time.

Scott Case

CEO of Recurrent

Getting the tax break upfront reduces monthly payments for consumers who finance their purchase and reduces the total sales tax on the purchase, Salas said.

For example, a consumer who buys a used EV might pay $80 to $100 more per month on a five-year loan if they're unable to get the $4,000 tax credit upfront, Salas said.

The tax break is also harder for certain consumers to access at tax time. While the point-of-sale rebate is available to qualifying consumers regardless of their tax liability, that's not true for those who claim the tax break on their annual tax return: They must have a tax liability to claim even a partial credit.

The IRS has approved some applications Salas submitted last week, while others are pending.

""As dealers, it's a really unfortunate situation, because we are fronting the money,"" Salas said. ""And in a lot of ways, we're financing the consumer's ability to get a new vehicle.""

The IRS owes him about $50,000 of tax credits, Salas said. He expects the federal government to pay him back eventually.

So does Pretzfeld, the dealer based in Miramar, Florida.

Pretzfeld saw all EV sales submitted to the IRS for tax credit approval listed as ""pending"" starting around Sept. 15, he said.

One submitted Sept. 16 and one from Sept. 17 have been approved, and he's awaiting payment.

""The timeline is now longer, and it's murkier,"" Pretzfeld said. ""That's the part that's freaking everyone out.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108204125-1758828528395-gettyimages-1375785091-2p1a1672.jpeg?v=1758828547&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-09-26 12:04:28.430929

Mark Gordon has joined with his counterparts in Idaho and Utah in a declaration of a unified effort to establish the tristate area as the epicenter of America’s nuclear energy resurgence.
Nuclear power generation, Cox suggested, represents the most reliable form of electricity and a viable means of meeting increasing energy demand.
In addition to proposed nuclear microreactor manufacturing in Wyoming, TerraPower’s liquid-sodium-cooled “Natrium” nuclear power facility is expected to begin operations in 2030 outside Kemmerer.
Part of federal policy leaning toward nuclear energy began during the Biden administration, which named Wyoming and Idaho as part of a Tech Hub within the Intermountain-West Nuclear Energy Corridor.","IDAHO FALLS—A couple hundred nuclear energy industry officials, along with two western state governors, a Trump administration official and the head of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, gathered Monday at the Idaho National Laboratory’s sprawling 890-square-mile testing center to discuss nuclear power’s future in the West.

In a large, posh tent with clear plastic walls offering views of the surrounding high-plains sagebrush steppe, these leaders, their staff and a gaggle of media gathered for a reception a short drive away from the world’s premier nuclear energy testing ground.

“We’re standing here, not very far from where [Experimental Breeder Reactor II] proved out the fundamental technology that I believe is ultimately the future for humanity — for energy abundance, reliability and affordability,” Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of nuclear power plant developer Oklo, told the crowd. The success of 1960s-era EBR II was “one of the most phenomenal technological stories in human history and, frankly, one that’s radically under-told and underappreciated.”

After being pushed to the sidelines, nuclear energy technology is back in the spotlight, DeWitte noted. Today’s rush to feed power-hungry artificial intelligence and data computational centers has private investors and governments around the world pouring money into the next generation of nuclear energy, he said. That is already resulting in notable investments in Wyoming, including Bill Gate’s next-generation nuclear project in Kemmerer, but also raising questions about the potential for spent nuclear fuel storage and transportation in the Equality State.

Here at INL, Oklo and subcontractor Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co. will build and test the first Aurora Powerhouse — a liquid-sodium-cooled “fast reactor” generating up to 75 megawatts of electricity that backers hope to deploy around the world. Oklo’s nuclear reactor demonstration is among a dozen or so reactor and nuclear fuel tests in queue at INL that advance the industry’s technology and business models, according to INL officials. The lineup includes Radiant Industry’s “portable” Kaleidos microreactor, which the company proposes to mass-produce in Wyoming at a facility outside Bar Nunn.

Though Radiant’s proposal, along with another in Campbell County, has garnered significant opposition, Gov. Mark Gordon has joined with his counterparts in Idaho and Utah in a declaration of a unified effort to establish the tristate area as the epicenter of America’s nuclear energy resurgence.

“This is what an abundance mentality is all about,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said in his opening remarks at the Western Governors’ Association workshop at INL’s Idaho Falls campus later that day. “It’s not Utah versus Idaho versus Wyoming. We’re going to be much stronger if we’re working together, because we have some differences that are important and similarities that are important.”

Energy ‘superabundance’

As chairman of the WGA this year, Cox launched the Energy Superabundance: Unlocking Prosperity in the West initiative, which focuses on meeting skyrocketing electrical demand by bolstering nuclear energy. Nuclear power generation, Cox suggested, represents the most reliable form of electricity and a viable means of meeting increasing energy demand.

Utah, Idaho and Wyoming, Cox noted, already share infrastructure under utility Rocky Mountain Power, as well as a shared workforce and a similar “mindset” that’s attractive to the industry.

“I would love to have [Oklo] in Utah, and I can’t lie about that, but that’s good for all of us,” Cox said, adding that all three states are already on the industry’s radar.

The Department of Energy’s national laboratory in Idaho is an obvious draw, he noted. In addition to proposed nuclear microreactor manufacturing in Wyoming, TerraPower’s liquid-sodium-cooled “Natrium” nuclear power facility is expected to begin operations in 2030 outside Kemmerer. Rocky Mountain Power has tentatively agreed to take on the power plant and potentially partner with TerraPower to add more Natrium plants in Utah.

“I can just tell you, by signing that MOU together, it’s given this region much more interest from nuclear partners,” Cox said. “They’re seeing this as a game changer, and so they’re coming. I don’t care if they come to Wyoming or they come to Idaho or they come to Utah.”

The tristate initiative has the backing of the Trump administration, which has ordered the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to speed up nuclear licensing and has directed the DOE to have 10 new “large reactors” under construction by 2030 with a goal of adding 300,000 megawatts of nuclear power to the grid by 2050. One megawatt is enough electricity to power about 750 homes.

Part of federal policy leaning toward nuclear energy began during the Biden administration, which named Wyoming and Idaho as part of a Tech Hub within the Intermountain-West Nuclear Energy Corridor.

Challenges

Despite enthusiasm among private industry and state and federal officials, there are significant challenges to implementing a nuclear resurgence in the region.

Several speakers at the WGA event noted that AI and data center developers favor new power generation facilities that are, in a regulatory sense, apart from the shared electrical grid, or “behind the meter.” That complicates the utility regulatory environment and rate structures. Also, the U.S. is still reliant on other nations for nuclear components and several aspects of the fuel supply chain, which will take years to provide domestically. Others noted that the Trump administration’s demands on federal agencies — like fast-tracking and licensing a massive buildout of nuclear power plants — are at odds with recent staff downsizing.

Industry leaders are also worried about a dearth of workers for jobs that require specific training and certifications.

“We know that we need a significantly expanded workforce for the modernization and expansion of the grid,” Deloitte Specialist Executive Bill Abolt said. The nation’s long lull in building nuclear energy has left the industry with skilled experts who are retiring and an empty “pipeline” to replace them, he added. “The people that built the last nuclear power plant didn’t just stick around and wait for the next one.”

Though states have made advancements in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education and training, nuclear fields have been a blind spot, several industry officials agreed.

“At some point, you need to figure out how to get Mike Rowe involved,” INL’s Innovation and Technology Manager Chris Lohse said, referring to the television personality who touts the nobility of skilled trades and “dirty” physical labor.

Yet perhaps the industry’s biggest challenge remains its image as a dangerous liability to human health and the environment — a legacy of the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters, perpetuated in cinema and The Simpsons. Though the WGA event was stacked with those who are certain of the safety of the industry, some noted that local opposition to things like wind farms extends to nuclear energy proposals.

In fact, many residents in Bar Nunn and Gillette — communities that have long supported heavy energy industries — are not convinced they want to welcome nuclear facilities. Campbell County commissioners recently drafted a resolution to solidify their interim stance on the potential for spent nuclear fuel waste storage until putting the question to a public vote in the 2026 election. Until there’s a vote, the commission would remain opposed to such proposals.

“There is a lot of time that’s being spent engaging with communities, local governments and people on the ground who may have been upset about a wind turbine,” National Association of State Energy Officials Chief of Staff Cassie Powers said. “There does need to be some real, honest public engagement to demystify investments in nuclear.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47643/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/inl-demonstration-of-microreactor-experiments-dome-dbleizeffer1758882424.jpeg?h=f1704810&itok=7DEUI4Lr,N,,2025-09-26 11:06:28.727833

CALIFORNIA TRYING TO KEEP OIL AND GAS FIRMS FROM LEAVING THE STATE

Newsom noted that about one-fourth of new vehicles sold in California are alternative-fueled, which is the highest share in the nation. He added that the state has 60 EV manufacturers and has created an ecosystem favorable for EVs, which he said helped facilitate the rise of Elon Musk's Tesla.

He also emphasized that California plans to continue to invest in EV infrastructure and renewable energy through its cap-and-trade program, which sets greenhouse gas emissions limits and has emitters purchase ""allowances"" – which are effectively permits to emit one ton of carbon dioxide equivalents – and sell excess allowances to companies that require offsets. The program's revenue from allowance auctions helps fund projects aimed at reducing emissions.

Despite all that Newsom said about EVs, it comes as he has also moved to stop the exodus of oil and gas companies from California over what the industry views as a hostile regulatory climate.

With the support of $10 million from the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, MountainTrue has launched a new initiative to restore local waterways.
Through next December, the effort will support about 80 people cleaning up overlooked areas across 25 western North Carolina counties.
A longtime outdoor guide who ran an outfitter before Helene, he’s now the nonprofit’s river cleanup operations manager.
The Army Corps assigned much of North Carolina’s debris removal to AshBritt, a Florida-based company, with payment determined by volume of material.","Tractor trailer tires. Halloween candy wrappers. Sheet metal roofing. Ceramic dinner plates. Car parts. Shoes—a lot of shoes.

“I have a little trouble sometimes when I pick up the shoes,” admits Zack Davis as he rattles off the trash he’s been encountering in the Swannanoa River near Asheville, North Carolina. “Did those belong to somebody who was swept down the river, and did they make it out or not? It just leads the mind to wander on those things.”

Davis leads the Swannanoa River cleanup team for the Asheville-based conservation nonprofit MountainTrue. Although a year has passed since Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina—the storm made landfill in Florida on September 26, 2024, and tore through the Carolinas a day later—the region is still grappling with much of the physical and emotional wreckage left behind. That’s especially true along the Swannanoa and other waterways, which flooded to record levels and destroyed almost 1,000 homes.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is almost ready to declare its own cleanup complete. The US Army Corps of Engineers and its contractors, responsible for federally funded debris removal in North Carolina’s waterways, estimate they’ve completed 99 percent of their work, having hauled off nearly 6.6 million cubic yards of material. Yet while those efforts cleared major rivers like the French Broad, many smaller tributaries, creeks, and streams—critical for both the environment and the region’s outdoor recreation industry—weren’t part of the mission.

As federal officials step out, Davis and his colleagues are stepping up. With the support of $10 million from the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, MountainTrue has launched a new initiative to restore local waterways. Through next December, the effort will support about 80 people cleaning up overlooked areas across 25 western North Carolina counties.

Key to MountainTrue’s approach, says Jon Stamper, is harnessing local knowledge and ecological concern. A longtime outdoor guide who ran an outfitter before Helene, he’s now the nonprofit’s river cleanup operations manager. Many of those he’s hired, including Davis, are fellow rafting or fishing guides who lost their livelihoods due to the storm. (Full-time cleanup crew members receive a minimum hourly rate of $22.50 plus benefits, close to the living wage for Asheville calculated by the nonprofit Living Wage Institute.)

His team’s deep experience has helped Stamper prioritize cleanups around areas previously used for fishing and kayaking in an effort to get the outdoor recreation industry restarted more quickly. And as the effort moves into less accessible places, he says, former guides are well-suited to treating vulnerable ecosystems with an appropriately light touch.

“We are a scalpel, where [the Army Corps] might have been a chainsaw. We are on the ground, walking in the rivers, hand-picking all this to bring in trash.”

He recalls one instance where a crew encountered an intractable nest of black PVC irrigation line tangled around trees on a river island. Where less skilled contractors may have brought in an excavator and uprooted the whole mess, trees and all, the MountainTrue team used swift-water rescue techniques to set up a kayak relay system with pulleys. Workers could then cut away the plastic and send it to the riverbank by boat while saving the vegetation.

“We are a scalpel, where [the Army Corps] might have been a chainsaw. We are on the ground, walking in the rivers, hand-picking all this to bring in trash,” Stamper explains. “Our main goal here is to approach this in an ecologically sound way, to protect the rivers and not create any more damage.”

Stamper and his colleagues say they’re particularly careful about how they work given the issues they observed with the federal cleanup. The Army Corps assigned much of North Carolina’s debris removal to AshBritt, a Florida-based company, with payment determined by volume of material. That arrangement incentivized the contractor to harvest live trees and other plants from riverbanks, along with fallen logs and other organic debris that would’ve decomposed naturally and created wildlife habitat.

Will Harlan, the Asheville-based Southeast director and senior scientist with the national nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, says that the contractors’ practices also damaged rare species such as the federally endangered Appalachian elktoe mussel. He recalls standing in front of heavy machinery in the French Broad River on Memorial Day to stop workers from smashing one of the state’s biggest populations of hellbender salamanders.

“The hellbenders and mussels hung on through Helene. They’ve been living with floods and extreme weather for millions of years, and they know how to withstand even catastrophic events,” says Harlan, who isn’t affiliated with the MountainTrue cleanup. “What they can’t survive are bulldozers, backhoes, and dump trucks going up and down rivers that are being used as highways 30 times a day, crushing all the animals and habitat in their path. You can’t adapt to that.”

That Memorial Day showdown sparked a meeting between concerned residents and Chuck Edwards, the area’s representative in Congress. The Republican subsequently called the debris removal “improper” and demanded greater federal oversight.

Asked for comment on these criticisms, Army Corps spokesperson Nikki Nobles thanked residents for holding workers accountable and outlined a dedication to protecting the environment.

“Debris removal missions are often challenging due to the large quantities and various types of debris that storms can leave behind, as well as the vast geographic areas where cleanup can be needed, but USACE, operating under FEMA’s Public Assistance Program guidelines, is committed to conducting our debris removal missions within strict environmental safeguards,” Nobles wrote in a statement. “Our contractors are trained and required to minimize disturbances to streambeds, avoid reshaping natural waterway contours, and follow best management practices to prevent harm to wildlife.”

Federal contractors, Harlan adds, often didn’t consult with local landowners before starting their work. To avoid those tensions, the MountainTrue effort is putting in extensive groundwork to connect with residents and gain access to cleanup sites.

“Imagine your friend comes over and offers to mow your lawn. There’s just a weight lifted off your shoulders. But then imagine that tenfold, where somebody offers to clean all this trash from your devastated home. Maybe it feels a little better in your backyard. It gives you a little more hope.”

Cleanup team leader Donovan Green, for example, started attending meetings in the small community of Bat Cave weeks before putting her boots in the water. Although the area had become a target for online misinformation about storm response in the weeks following Helene, she says she was warmly welcomed after shaking hands in person and sharing her desire to help.

“They’ve already treated us like community, like family,” she says. “The very first day my team was out here, the sheriff and the chief of the fire department came over and said, ‘Hey, we have this homemade peach cobbler for y’all—please eat it!’”

Picking up trash supports the environment, Green continues, but it’s also a deeply meaningful gesture for people who are still rebuilding their lives. In some cases, crews can find personal items that victims of Helene thought were gone forever, like a pig-faced molcajete stone bowl Green recently reunited with a family who lost their house to floodwaters. In others, simply clearing clutter can be the support someone needs to carry on.

“Imagine your friend comes over and offers to mow your lawn. There’s just a weight lifted off your shoulders,” Green says. “But then imagine that tenfold, where somebody offers to clean all this trash from your devastated home. Maybe it feels a little better in your backyard. It gives you a little more hope.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-26 13:05:18.883525

For additional information: Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) Global Renewables Alliance","As the UN Secretary-General convenes world leaders in New York, ten years of progress under the Paris Agreement is in the spotlight.

Close to 100 countries are signalling new climate targets and numerous countries are either submitting or announcing new and updated NDCs. Currently, more than 75 percent of NDCs include quantified targets for renewable energy deployment, showing that governments are taking the pledge to triple renewables by 2030 seriously. Renewables are now recognised not only as a climate necessity, but as a foundation for energy security and prosperity.

These commitments have been welcomed by the Global Renewables Alliance and the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), among others.

NDCs are more than climate pledges, they are blueprints for economic transformation. By signalling the long-term ambition on renewables, governments provide market certainty, enabling the private sector to align strategies, mobilise investment and build a robust pipeline of projects.

At the same time, a gap remains between ambition and what is needed to align with 1.5°C. The real economy is moving ahead. Renewables already supply over 30 percent of global electricity, a record high, and that momentum will only grow. Investment in renewables reached over 700 billion dollars in 2024, record investment for over 20 years.

Yet the untapped potential is even greater. EMBER estimates 92 percent of countries have renewable potential, more than ten times their current demand.

As Kenya’s President H.E. Dr. William Ruto said at the UN Climate Summit: “... endless debate continues over fossil fuel reserves, while our immense endowments in sunlight, wind and geothermal lies underutilised...”

This momentum shows that markets and industry are delivering, but the market alone will not deliver the acceleration needed. governments must now accelerate action to match. This means governments must:

Publish renewable energy plans with specific technology targets that set clear pathways for solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower and storage, aligned with the tripling agenda.

Remove the barriers that hold back deployment, including slow planning and permitting, underinvestment in transmission, and bottlenecks in grid connection.

Maintain policy certainty and investment security by embedding renewable goals into national strategies, avoiding sudden policy changes, and providing stable frameworks for investors.

Scale finance in emerging and developing economies. 89 percent of 2035 NDCs are conditional on finance or technical assistance. Lowering the cost of capital, scaling public investment and unlocking blended finance are essential.

Plan for a future proof energy system by prioritising implementation of the COP29 Grids and Storage Pledge, making these solutions central to national energy strategies, so renewable energy targets translate into real-world delivery.

Advance action on fossil fuel phase-out, with an honest dialogue at COP to accelerate the shift.

Renewables are already the cheapest power in almost every market, driving 10 percent of global GDP growth last year and shielding consumers from fossil fuel volatility and trade insecurity. The Global Renewables Summit held this week in New York showed how governments and industry are ready to work together to scale solutions.

Claims that renewables are unreliable and uneconomic are a denial of reality, aimed solely at stalling progress. In 2024, renewables accounted for more than 90 percent of new power capacity worldwide, cutting fossil fuel costs by 460 billion dollars. The facts are clear: renewables are powering economies, creating jobs, and delivering energy security.

The task now is to turn commitments into delivery, bridge the 1.5°C gap, and ensure that renewables are scaled fairly across all regions whilst phasing out fossil fuels.

GWEC welcomed the endorsement of renewable energy demonstrated at the United Nations this week, calling on governments to ignore the noise and focus on the facts:

Wind energy delivers more than 1.1TWh of electricity – equivalent to more than 500 million homes - and is responsible for 1.5m jobs around the world.

Wind turbines are generating clean and secure renewable energy in 124 countries, and countries are delivering new plans, policies and action to install new capacity.

Renewable energy, with wind at its core, is now recognised not only as a climate necessity, but as the foundation of energy security and economic growth.

Last year, over 90 percent of newly added renewable power capacity was cheaper than new fossil fuel alternatives, with onshore wind leading the way - costing less than half the price of the lowest-cost fossil option.

“The renewables sector welcomes the recognition of renewable energy’s crucial role in the future global economy” said Ben Backwell, CEO of the Global Wind Energy Council and Chair of the Global Renewables Alliance. “NDCs are much more than climate plans, they are a roadmap for delivering clean jobs, reinvigorated economies and shared global growth. As the energy transition continues to gain momentum, the noise from those that aim to slow global progress must not deter those working for a cleaner, fairer future. These roadmaps must now be backed up with concrete measures to deliver, so that countries and communities can realise the enormous benefits of renewable energy.”

The world will now turn its attention to COP30 in Belem, Brazil.

The End of the Credit Should Bring a Focus on Research So, where does this leave us when the EV tax credit ends on the 30th?
For now, let’s pour one out for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit in its final hours.","The end of the $7,500 federal electric car tax credit on Sept. 30 arrives with strong emotions from many people. Whether it’s the defeated lawmakers and clean energy advocates who worked tirelessly to push the legislation through, or—on the other end of the spectrum—relieved rural car dealerships that have struggled to sell EVs, and are hoping they’ll now be gone for good.

For me, my career switch to journalism coincided with the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, which introduced the credit. EVs were my first beat, and what a thrill it was to cover the palpable excitement across the country. That year, Ford boldly electrified the Ford F-150 pickup, a classic symbol of American manufacturing might, now with faster acceleration but no V8 engine to rev. Amazon’s first Rivian delivery vans hit the road with funky headlights, and Sony and Honda joined forces in an unusual partnership to develop an EV in which you could watch movies and play video games.

I was spending my weekends driving the $130,000 Mercedes AMG EV, interviewing kids in rural New York state about their electric school bus, and doing donuts in a Ford Mustang Mach-E in a helmet and harness. It was a brave new world—but it didn't last.

Despite My Misgivings, the EV Tax Credit Was a Win

To be honest, EV tech was probably not ready for the hype, and that’s why, over the last few years, the cracks started to show. I had my own concerns about range, particularly in the cold Chicago weather where I lived. Living in a rented apartment, I had limited access to charging options. As I attended car shows and got drinks with auto executives, I privately felt the whole industry was catering to wealthy, single-family homeowners while ignoring large swaths of the population like me, whose lifestyles made buying and operating an EV downright difficult.

Still, the EV tax credit was a powerful tool—and it worked. (And no, not just wealthy people cashed in on the credit, because it had buyer income caps. And while we're in parentheses, let's not forget there are many oil and gas subsidies that are more costly to taxpayers than the EV credit.)

There are no articles I could write that could replace the first-hand experience of zipping down a highway in a swanky electric car with ultra-fast acceleration, a near-silent cabin, and a steering wheel that turns like butter. They are clearly an upgrade, but you have to experience it for yourself. Now, many people have, in large part, thanks to the credit. August 2025 saw record EV sales, at 10% of new cars sold, a massive jump from 3.2% in 2021.

In my view, the tax credit was supposed to help get people to love EVs, while in the background, prices would naturally come down and range would go up, making them more appealing on their own—no federal assistance necessary. The range did go up, so that part is working.

But the EV prices remain stubbornly high. It’s hard to win an argument with an EV skeptic, or a presidential administration hellbent on destroying a so-called ""EV mandate,"" with such a high up-front purchasing price. (The high-profile articles of rare EV fires also don’t help, but that would require a whole other op-ed.)

To Solve EV Adoption, We Need to Solve Battery Tech

Why do EVs cost so much? The battery. Why do we charge EVs? Their batteries. When you talk about anything related to EVs, it's all about the battery. Otherwise, they are mostly the same as any other car, with four wheels and a steering wheel (OK, and also some weird Elon Musk goodies, if you have a Tesla).

There have been rumors of lithium prices coming down and cheaper models hitting dealerships, but that's not what I see. My list of EVs under $40,000 got smaller every year after I first wrote it in 2022. Batteries remained too expensive, and car companies got sick of bleeding money, leading to the end of affordable models like the Chevy Bolt. They want a sustainable, more profitable business model. Who can blame them?

The US hasn't yet solved the battery affordability problem, and has watched helplessly as China has. Our biggest rival has become an automotive powerhouse over the past few years, with mega-brands like BYD, which makes the $9,700 Seagull and the $16,000 Dolphin with a 260-mile range, as Electrek reports. No EV for sale in the US comes close to that low price.

This is why Ford CEO Jim Farley called China’s EV business “humbling.” The country’s manufacturing prowess, EV government subsidies, and worldwide control of the mines that crank out lithium and other critical battery minerals are almost impossible to compete with.

The End of the Credit Should Bring a Focus on Research

So, where does this leave us when the EV tax credit ends on the 30th? Will we be standing in a black void, condemned to a life of inhaling gas exhaust and reminiscing on the good old days when we invented the Model T? Adoption will likely slow, but not stop, as car companies kill less popular models, like the Acura ZDX and Nissan Ariya, both of which bit the dust this month, and don't replace them with new models.

Some states will maintain their own clean vehicle credits, which help offset the loss of the federal one to a smaller degree. The real legacy of the EV push will be the public's increasing openness to hybrids and plug-in hybrids, and automakers offering more of them, which we are certainly seeing.

It’s possible the next administration will institute another tax credit to get adoption back on track, but only more affordable, powerful batteries can cement EVs as a permanent fixture in America. We need a long-term tech solution.

A breakthrough battery that's cheaper, lighter, and more powerful would change the world, not just EVs. It would revolutionize warfare, home energy, and even cell phones. Batteries are the future of energy independence, and even Elon Musk knows it—even if he seems more interested in autonomous driving software than making new cars these days.

I’ve reported on incredible companies that received grants from the Biden Administration to develop futuristic silicon and lithium-sulfur batteries, which have double the range, with less weight, and use more abundant elements than lithium. I strongly believe we’ll see it in the market in about 7 years; they’re already testing with major automakers behind the scenes, but passing safety standards and getting to dealers is a long process. When they do arrive, they won't be cheap, like all new tech.

The biggest risk of the slowing EV momentum we face is the devaluation of this research and development. If that happens, it might become the real reason electric cars don't replace gas-powered cars in our lifetimes—not the end of the federal tax credit. “To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete,” as futurist Buckminster Fuller put it. It won't be easy, to say the least.

But that's a problem for another day. (Many days, really.) For now, let’s pour one out for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit in its final hours.

“After 2025, utility-scale storage projects must comply with new, stringent battery sourcing requirements to receive the ITC,” said Weis.","A new report from the American Clean Power Association (ACP) and Wood Mackenzie shows the U.S. energy storage market set a record for quarterly growth in April through June of this year. The latest U.S. Energy Storage Monitor from the groups reports 5.6 GW of installations during the second quarter of 2025.

The groups said utility-scale energy storage had a record 4.9 GW of new installations in Q2. The groups in a news release wrote, “While early adopters continue leading in deployment, activity across the country shows clear demand for utility-scale energy storage as a solution to rising electricity prices and soaring energy demand.”

The report said that states of Texas, California, and Arizona each added more than 1 GW of energy storage. It noted that some markets, including the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), saw renewed activity. Three projects were brought online in Oklahoma, the first in that state in three years, while “Florida and Georgia saw major forecast upgrades due to aggressive procurements by vertically integrated utilities,” according to the report.

“Energy storage is being quickly deployed to strengthen our grid as demand for power surges and is helping to drive down energy prices for American families and businesses,” said Noah Roberts, ACP vice president of Energy Storage. “Despite regulatory uncertainty, the drivers for energy storage are strong and the industry is on track to produce enough grid batteries in American factories to supply 100% of domestic demand. Energy storage will be essential to the expansion of the U.S. power grid and American energy production.”

Residential, CCI Markets Expand

The report said the residential storage market expanded by 608 MW in Q2, a 132% increase year-over-year, and an 8% jump quarter-over-quarter. The groups said that growth was led by California, Arizona, and Illinois, as attachment rates hit new highs and higher-capacity systems gained market share.

Community-scale, commercial and industrial (CCI) storage expanded 38 MW, an 11% year-over-year increase.

California and New York led quarterly CCI storage installations, accounting for more than 70% of total capacity. The report said, “Community storage deployment remained limited due to high costs and policy constraints.”

Resilient Market Despite Policy Uncertainty

The report said U.S. energy storage installations will reach 87.8 GW by 2029, with growth “driven by residential and utility-scale segments amidst a constantly evolving policy environment.” The groups noted, though, that “U.S. utility-scale storage installations could drop 10% year-over-year in 2027 largely due to uncertainty over pending Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) regulations on battery cell sourcing.”

“Pricing and FEOC uncertainty, and slow community storage development are expected to limit CCI segment growth below 1 GW by 2029, though Massachusetts’ SMART 3.0 may help boost future deployment,” said Allison Feeney, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “Residential storage is expected to outpace solar due to stronger policy resilience, high attachment rates in key markets like California and Puerto Rico, and continued ITC access through third-party ownership.”

Allison Weis, Global Head of Storage at Wood Mackenzie, noted that while recent federal legislation preserved the investment tax credit (ITC) for energy storage, there are still challenges to deployment, and the the five-year buildout could be reduced by 16.5 GW.

“After 2025, utility-scale storage projects must comply with new, stringent battery sourcing requirements to receive the ITC,” said Weis. “While domestic cell supply is ramping up, supply chain shortages are possible, although developers are continuing to consider supply from China to fill in any gaps. A rush to start construction under the more certain near-term regulatory framework uplifts the near-term forecast. Projects that have not met certain milestones by the end of 2025 are at risk of exposure to changing regulations. There is additional downside risk if further permitting delays threaten solar and storage projects.”",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fig1-technicians-walking-energy-storage.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 12:05:45.883645

Indeed, figures from the American Clean Power Association (ACP) and Wood Mackenzie show that the US residential storage market added a record 458MW in the first quarter of this year, with California and Puerto Rico driving 74% of this growth.
“Historically, it’s hard to deny that the investor-owned utilities in California have viewed customer-sided solar and storage as competition,” said Luo.
“Electrification is actually, very clearly, a good thing for the utilities’ profit margins as more people needing more electricity is good for the utilities,” Luo explained.
“It’s unclear to me if the interaction in the complaint will be very collaborative, unfortunately.","These timelines, combined with the actual process of reviewing, are collectively known as Rule 21, according to Kevin Luo, policy and market development manager for CALSSA, who spoke with PV Tech Premium exclusively on the association’s complaint. He said that the utilities are required to use “reasonable efforts” to meet the timelines imposed by Rule 21, but that this has consistently not been the case.

“The approval process, to me, should be simple and straightforward,” said Luo. “The issue is that utilities are not following that rule, and starting from the year 2020, the commission has required utilities to self-report data on how long it takes them to review each project, and we have about nearly five years of data on utility performance, and there’s a clear pattern of repeated violations of those interconnection timelines.”

When asked about the decision to levy fines in particular, Luo said that responsibility for enforcing these rules and imposing fines for non-compliance should fall on the CPUC, but that this has not happened.

“It’s been a point of frustration for customers in the industry that it’s fallen to us to really move the ball forward on enforcement,” Luo explained. “What we lay out in the complaint is that state law actually requires the commission to penalise the utilities for this … they have not chosen to do so and it’s really an unfortunate reality. It’s our hope that by filing the formal complaint and moving the ball forward we can force the issue.”

As a result, CALSSA has found itself in an unusual position for a trade association, a feeling of obligation to enforce rules upon the utilities with which it works. However, Luo said that he thinks CALSSA has a “strong case”, and pointed to fines levied on utilities for violating power shut-off rules as examples of fines being used elsewhere to force utilities to comply with regulations.

Is it foul play?

For its part, SCE emphasised that its focus remains on delivering “timely and efficient interconnection”. In a statement provided to PV Tech Premium this week, SCE spokesperson Jeff Monford said that: “We are focused on providing timely and efficient interconnection, which is critical to supporting California’s clean energy goals and maintaining trust with our customers.

“We take the complaint seriously, and are working with the CPUC to thoroughly address any issues related to our interconnection processes.”

PG&E, meanwhile, has not replied to requests for comment as of the publication of this article.

When asked about the utilities’ intentions, Luo doubled down on a comment made earlier this month when CALSSA first announced the fines that the utilities’ work amounts to “suppressing what they consider to be their competition”.

“What I said before is still true in the sense that ultimately the consequence of the utilities’ violations of these interconnection timelines is the suppression of customer-side solar and storage,” he told PV Tech Premium.

“That is the ultimate consequence because what’s happening is that you’re adding extra time and extra costs to normal folks trying to install solar and storage on their roofs, on business, on schools and on farms. All these folks have other stuff going on – nobody wants to sit around and wait for an extra six months, one year or two years! – because utilities are dragging their feet on following the rules.”

The inaction of these utilities comes as California’s energy mix is undergoing a rapid period of change following the passage of the net energy metering (NEM 3.0) rules. The rules slashed prices for selling electricity generated at residential solar systems to the grid, in a bid to incentivise more installations of battery energy storage systems (BESS) in the residential sector; this saw a significant uptick in the co-location of solar and storage projects in the Californian residential sector within a year of its passage.

Indeed, figures from the American Clean Power Association (ACP) and Wood Mackenzie show that the US residential storage market added a record 458MW in the first quarter of this year, with California and Puerto Rico driving 74% of this growth.

How a decentralised energy system can threaten utilities

However, Luo noted that this rapidly changing energy mix means that utilities have started to see residential storage applications, and by extension, the solar systems to which they are often attached, as competition.

“Historically, it’s hard to deny that the investor-owned utilities in California have viewed customer-sided solar and storage as competition,” said Luo. “Even though California has ambitious climate goals and utilities are technically required to procure a certain amount of clean energy, the evidence shows that the utilities try as hard as possible to avoid including customer-side solar and storage in that renewable energy mix that the state needs in the future.”

“It’s been clear that the utilities have preferred to pursue utility-scale solar projects, mainly because those utility-scale projects require much more grid expansion – you build all these utility-scale solar and wind farms out in the desert then you need to build all the transmission lines to bring the energy to customers – and for the utilities that’s really the honey pot.”

This phenomenon is not unique to California. Earlier this year, Sean Garren of advocacy group Vote Solar spoke to PV Tech Premium about the passage of the latest Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) in Georgia, which featured a number of new fossil fuel projects at a time where the energy transition ought to be accelerating.

Garren noted that the shift from fossil fuels to renewables is also, often, a shift away from large, centralised grids to a series of smaller, decentralised power systems, which is more difficult for a single utility to control and, crucially, turn a profit on.

Working with grid operators

However, this is not to say that the relationship between utilities and residential prosumers needs to be antagonistic; indeed, Luo noted that a trend towards greater electrification is often of benefit to all parties.

“Electrification is actually, very clearly, a good thing for the utilities’ profit margins as more people needing more electricity is good for the utilities,” Luo explained. “If load on the grid is expected to increase as much as it should for the electrification that’s required to hit California’s clean energy goals, there should be more than enough profits to go around.”

“So, in theory, the utilities shouldn’t be as ardent as they are about, I guess, their dislike for customer-side solar and storage, but it seems that the profits they should get from electrification isn’t enough, they want more. That’s my own interpretation of this.”

Luo also noted that there are different priorities and relationships within the utilities, which has helped drive a wedge between utilities and others in the California energy system. He drew a distinction between “the staff from the utilities that are on the ground”, with whom CALSSA has “a lot of respect”, and decision-makers at the utilities who are “deciding how many resources their on-the-ground staff have”.

“There’s that second relationship with the higher-level folks who are deciding how many resources those staff have, and a lot of the issues are that the staff are often extremely overworked – we’ve heard about a lot of staff turnover – and [experience] very poor training,” Luo explained. “It’s unclear to me if the interaction in the complaint will be very collaborative, unfortunately.

“The fact that we’ve had to file the formal complaint itself goes to show that having conversations outside of a formal venue has not made progress.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/seia.jpeg,N,,2025-09-26 14:03:28.883869

“[This] is not in any way a normal pendulum swing of climate policy that we expect to see with any change in administration,” said Freeman, founder of the Environmental & Energy Law Program, in opening remarks to students, scholars, and leaders in business, government, and the nonprofit sector. She then moderated a panel called “Climate Law Under Siege (And the Path Forward).”

“What we are seeing is an unraveling of all federal climate policy,” she said, “the greatest retrenchment of climate law and policy we’ve ever seen in this country.”

Since taking office in January, participants noted, the administration has decimated policies that seek to protect the environment. In addition to announcing plans to reverse a 2009 Environmental Protection Agency “endangerment finding” that has been the basis for efforts to regulate greenhouse gases, the federal government has removed obstacles to oil and gas drilling on federal lands and waters, cancelled nearly $700 million in funding for offshore wind projects, eliminated offices that promote environmental justice, and significantly reduced the agencies and departments that seek to enforce federal environmental protection laws.

The backpedaling on greenhouse gases alone — part of what the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin, called an effort to “[drive] a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion” — is catastrophic to mitigating the harms from the changing climate, said Richard J. Lazarus ’79, the Charles Stebbins Fairchild Professor of Law, who teaches environmental law and natural resources law.

“In Boston, we call that ‘the ball game,’” he said.

The panel, which also included Andrew Mergen, the Emmett Visiting Assistant Clinical Professor of Law in Environmental Law and faculty director of the Emmett Environmental Law and Policy Clinic, and Carrie Jenks, executive director of the Environmental & Energy Law Program, agreed the Trump administration’s arguments against the endangerment finding were not persuasive — Lazarus called them “disingenuous.”

“A lot of this stuff is probably unlawful,” he said, noting that it “takes quite a long time for the courts to catch up.”

States and the private sector are taking some steps to promote and invest in environmental protections — there are “huge co-benefits” for climate investments, including bringing down costs for consumers and long-term investment goals, Jenks said — but the federal government is challenging those efforts as well.

The panelists acknowledged that the Clean Air Act, while hugely successful in tackling many environmental harms, has not been a perfect fit for addressing climate change. Because of those shortcomings, past presidents, including Barack Obama ’91 and Joe Biden, relied extensively on regulatory authority to address climate threats. That, Lazarus acknowledged, “created a backlash,” including in the U.S. Supreme Court, which “wants clear congressional authorization” for any regulatory actions.

Nevertheless, Jenks said, past presidents, including Donald Trump during his first presidential term, generally have sought to replace rules rather than get rid of them. The current administration isn’t doing that.

“They’re … not proposing an alternative,” Jenks said. “They’re just proposing to eliminate. They’re trying to prevent a future administration from doing something different. It’s not really a rollback; I think it’s a complete elimination.”

Mergen thinks the courts will continue to exercise their power in preventing unlawful actions and emphasized that many dedicated career civil servants remain in the government.

“Things are falling apart, but the center can hold,” Mergen said. “We don’t have a lot of time for the center to hold, but there are some very good people trying to hold the institution together, and that matters.”

The panelists said they remain inspired by the younger generation, including the students in their classes and programs, and, in response to audience questions, they offered advice for anyone hoping to change the direction of climate policy in the United States.

“You can talk, argue, write, give money, give your time, volunteer, engage, go work on campaigns, go work for states while the federal government is out of action,” Freeman said. “Figure out where your talents lie and go deploy them.”

Lazarus agreed.

“This problem is not going away … and you’re our future so you can’t give up. You’ve got to double down,” he said.

According to constitutional expert Richard Primus, the Theodore J. St. Antoine Collegiate Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School, that assumption is fundamentally flawed.
During a recent conversation with Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law Noah Feldman, Primus explained his theory that the enumerated powers were intended as a baseline for Congress’ authority — not a limit.
The argument that congressional authority is limited to the enumerated powers, Primus explained, did not triumph until the presidency of Thomas Jefferson, which began in 1801.
“It can’t be the case that the enumerated powers are that expansive, or else why would they be enumerated?","In the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8 lists 27 powers explicitly given to Congress. Throughout American history, a robust consensus has existed that these “enumerated” powers are intended to limit federal legislative authority.

According to constitutional expert Richard Primus, the Theodore J. St. Antoine Collegiate Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School, that assumption is fundamentally flawed.

During a recent conversation with Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law Noah Feldman, Primus explained his theory that the enumerated powers were intended as a baseline for Congress’ authority — not a limit. In her introduction of Feldman and Primus, Professor Jeannie Suk Gersen praised Primus’s groundbreaking perspective and noted that the two constitutional law theorists have been longstanding interlocutors.

“Once in a really long while, you read something that makes you wonder if you’ve been doing it all wrong. And that is the effect that Richard Primus’s book ‘The Oldest Constitutional Question’ had on me,” she said. “I’m really delighted to be hosting this conversation between Richard Primus and Noah Feldman … who have been engaging in earnest with each other about constitutional theory since they were teenagers.”

Feldman and Primus then began to unpack the thesis of Primus’s latest book, which attempts to debunk what scholars call “enumerationism,” the view that congressional authority is limited to the enumerated powers outlined in the nation’s founding document.

“The text of the Constitution does not say what enumerationism teaches us to say,” said Primus. “The historical story that says the framers enumerated the powers of Congress in order to limit the reach of Congress, I think, is mostly wrong.”

“It’s my view that the enumeration of powers is a wheel that turns no part of the mechanism of federalist limitation. That’s not what it does,” he said. “That’s not what it was written to do. And when we press it into service to try to limit Congress, it functions very badly because it’s not well designed for that.”

Primus argued that, for the Constitution’s framers designing a federal government, assigning Congress an explicit but non-exclusive list of powers made sense. In its infancy, Congress would have to contend with the executive and judicial branches in addition to the well-established state governments already in place.

“If you’re trying to get something powerful going, against opposition, in a world where there are other power players, it’s sometimes helpful to specify with particularity what its warrant is.”

According to Primus, historical accounts from the drafting and ratification of the Constitution support his hypothesis that the list was not intended to be comprehensive. Although some framers at the constitutional convention, such as Luther Martin and George Mason, initially called for limiting congressional power via enumeration, those efforts, Primus said, were rejected.

“We can find voices like that. But, as far as I can tell, they mostly get pushed aside. These are ideas that are articulated in the [constitutional] convention, but people stand up after that and say, ‘Yeah, that’s just not going to work. It’s not practical to enumerate all the powers that this Congress is going to need,’” said Primus. “And they give various reasons why they think it’s not. So, those calls for enumerated powers don’t get picked up and turned into enumeration.”

He also contended that, prior to ratification, the perception of enumeration as a limit on Congress mostly arose when federalist framers were attempting to sell the idea of a new Constitution to anti-federalists who opposed establishing a strong national government.

“The opposition is going to come mostly from people who think this government is too strong. So, as a rhetorical matter, the supporters of the Constitution need to try to say it’s actually not going to be as strong as you think it is,” said Primus.

While some supporters of the proposed Constitution interpreted it as giving Congress general legislative power, he contended, many of them argued otherwise to appease those hesitant to vote in favor of ratification.

“It’s not helpful to make that argument at that point, so [federalists] argue, ‘No, the powers are enumerated,’” he said. “And they especially argue it in response to the leading anti-federalist objection, which is: ‘Why does this thing have no bill of rights?’”

But if enumerationism did not come from the framers, as Feldman asked, “Where’s the smoking gun? Who’s the bad guy who invented enumerationism and pulled the wool over all of our eyes?”

“I have a sinking suspicion that I know who the answer to that is,” added Feldman, who authored “The Three Lives of James Madison: Genius, Partisan, President” in 2017. “But I’ll let you tell it. How did it become the consensus view?”

According to Primus, enumerationism emerged in earnest during the debate over whether to establish a national bank. Madison, who opposed its formation, pointed to the absence of an enumerated power authorizing Congress to create such an institution. Madison, despite being hailed by history as the “Father of the Constitution,” lost that debate about the document’s meaning. Congress passed, and President George Washington signed, legislation creating the First Bank of the United States in 1791.

The argument that congressional authority is limited to the enumerated powers, Primus explained, did not triumph until the presidency of Thomas Jefferson, which began in 1801.

“The Jeffersonians, who like making arguments, pick [enumerationism] up and it becomes orthodoxy over the course of the first several decades of the 19th century,” said Primus, “But it never is the way government actually works. It becomes an orthodoxy in speech and not in practice.”

He also noted that treating the enumerated list as a floor on its powers and not a ceiling is more consistent with how Congress has operated since the New Deal in the 1930s. As such, his theory retroactively exonerates the expansion of congressional authority beyond the powers listed in Article I, Section 8 — a century-long trend that some constitutional originalists have lamented.

“The going intuition among many constitutional lawyers has been: We must be doing something wrong,” said Primus. “It can’t be the case that the enumerated powers are that expansive, or else why would they be enumerated? And what I want to say is, ‘No, we haven’t all been doing it wrong for 100 years.’ It’s not the case that judges, appointed by presidents of both political parties for going on 100 years, have been doing it all wrong. We’ve been doing it fine.”

“What we’ve been doing wrong is talking about it the wrong way,” he said. “We’ve been expecting the enumerated powers to do a thing that they were not built to do, and then we get disappointed and upset when they don’t do them.”",https://hls.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_09_15_HLS-Beyond-Richard-Primus_LGranger_002-1-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 11:04:58.774319

Why this matters:

VOCs include a variety of chemicals that are emitted from various sources, including industrial processes. VOCs are a key precursor in the formation of ground level ozone that can degrade the air we breathe.

Recognizing the near-term need for power to meet increasing electricity demand as well as economic development needs and the importance of adapting to shifting federal policies, Governor Hochul is launching a new solicitation for renewable energy and directing state agencies to work together to responsibly advance shovel-ready renewable energy projects as quickly as possible. These efforts are designed to support New York ratepayers by using sunsetting federal clean energy tax credits to bring down costs.

“While the federal government takes us backward on energy policy, New York will not be thwarted in its commitment to clean energy. By directing our state agencies to move projects across the finish line, we are seizing every opportunity to leverage federal incentives, reduce costs for ratepayers, and build a more resilient, sustainable and reliable energy grid,” Governor Hochul said. “Together, these actions are expected to unlock billions in private investment, create thousands of good-paying jobs, and build a durable energy economy that benefits New Yorkers for decades to come.”

New York's current pipeline of large-scale renewable energy is comprised of 102 solar, land-based wind, hydroelectric and offshore wind projects operating and under development that will deliver over 9.7 gigawatts of clean power to the grid when completed – enough energy to power over 3 million New York homes. The development of projects as a result of this solicitation is expected to spur over five billion dollars in clean energy investments and create more than 2,500 family-sustaining jobs in the energy economy across New York.

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “New York is all about progress and we are not stopping.

The solicitation is designed to advance late-stage large-scale renewable energy projects ready to commence construction in New York. It incorporates best practices and lessons learned from prior procurements, including key provisions on component cost indexing, labor provisions, stakeholder engagement requirements, disadvantaged community commitments, and agricultural land preservation to ensure an equitable energy transition that benefits all New Yorkers. To expedite contracting, NYSERDA has also streamlined bid requirements, with full details outlined in the solicitation documents.

The process for submitting proposals into the land-based renewables solicitation will be conducted in two steps:

Eligibility applications are due on October 21, 2025.

Final proposals from eligible participants are due on December 4, 2025, by 3 p.m.

For details, please visit the Large-Scale Renewables Solicitation page. Conditional award notifications are expected to be issued to proposers in February 2026, followed by an announcement of selected projects once the awarded contracts have been executed.

Directive to Focus on Projects that May Qualify for Existing Federal Tax Credits

State agencies will intensify efforts to advance shovel-ready renewable energy projects, with a focus on qualifying projects that seek to access existing federal tax credits that will expire. This whole-of-government approach will responsibly streamline permitting, interconnection, financing, and contracting processes to ensure that as many projects as possible reach construction quickly, providing clean power to New York homes and businesses.

New York State Public Service Commission Chair and CEO Rory M. Christian said, “We stand ready to assist our sister agencies in the development of appropriate clean energy projects in New York State. Governor Hochul’s very timely announcement will help ensure a continuous development of renewable energy projects that will help spur the creation of much needed clean energy which will strengthen the reliability of our electric grid while creating good-paying jobs.”

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Amanda Lefton said, “Renewable energy development is one of the most important keys to reducing harmful pollution, generating green jobs, and creating more sustainable communities here in New York and across the country. Governor Hochul’s directive announced today will help further accelerate clean energy momentum already underway by comprehensive policies, programs, and investments that continue to make New York State a national leader in zero-emission energy production. DEC continues to work with our partner agencies to ensure efficient permitting processes that support these efforts.”

State Senator Kevin Parker said, “Accelerating renewable energy projects is critical to ensuring New York families have access to clean, affordable, and reliable power when they need it most. Every day we move forward means more jobs created, more communities protected from rising costs, and more progress toward a healthier environment. While uncertainty in Washington threatens to slow the clean energy transition, New York is proving that we will not wait we will lead. I remain committed to making sure our state continues to deliver for working families and disadvantaged communities, advancing projects that strengthen our energy future and our economy.”

Assemblymember Deborah Glick said, “Thank you, Governor Hochul, for recognizing that New Yorkers need an expanded grid with reliable, clean energy and lower costs. With our current federal government working hand in glove with the fossil fuel industry, it is important for New York to fully utilize the remaining federal tax credits to realize as many renewable energy projects as possible. This will not only be better for the environment, but will provide cleaner, more reliable, and less expensive energy and reduce our reliance on the more volatile and polluting fossil fuel industry.”

State Senator Peter Harckham said, “This is exactly the kind of forward-thinking climate action New York needs. Renewable energy projects are a major economic opportunity waiting to be unlocked. Expediting the Land-Based Tier 1 Renewable Energy Solicitation will mean more good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, lower utility bills for ratepayers and cleaner air for all. Thank you to Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for moving this critical work forward.”

New York League of Conservation Voters President Julie Tighe said, “While the federal government retreats, New York continues to march forward with reliable, affordable clean energy. NYSERDA’s plan to accelerate the construction and deployment of renewables is a critical step forward that will cut pollution, create good-paying jobs, and make our communities healthier and our grid more resilient. We applaud Governor Hochul for prioritizing the clean energy transition and showing the country what strong state leadership looks like.”

New York State AFL-CIO President Mario Cilento said, “Today’s announcement marks another significant step toward ensuring energy reliability and moving us closer to achieving New York’s renewable energy goals. We look forward to continuing to work with NYSERDA to ensure these projects adhere to robust labor standards and protections, creating pathways to solid union careers as we continue to advance toward a clean energy future.”

New York State Building Trades President Gary LaBarbera said, ""The continued advancement of clean energy development in New York State represents significant progress in establishing our green economy and the good paying union careers that come with it. The deployment of these projects will not only help us reach our standard-setting climate goals and deliver reliable clean energy to all New Yorkers, but it will also open up countless opportunities for hardworking people to pursue the middle class and support their families. We applaud NYSERDA for their ongoing work to streamline these crucial energy initiatives and look forward to our continued collaboration in pushing these projects forward.""

Alliance for Clean Energy New York Executive Director Marguerite Wells said, “Wind and solar projects are ready to meet the moment and provide affordable power to New Yorkers. We applaud Gov. Hochul for advancing these clean energy technologies at a time when we need them most. Against a backdrop of rising costs and the ever-present realities of climate change, renewables can revitalize upstate economies, provide much-needed power, and do so in an efficient and cost-effective manner.”

Natural Resources Defense Council Managing Director of Power Kit Kennedy said, “Building clean energy projects quickly and fairly is crucial for cutting electricity costs and creating quality jobs for New Yorkers. Every action that New York State takes to speed up renewable energy deployment helps achieve these goals. With the federal government in full retreat and denial, New York’s climate leadership is more important than ever.”

New York Solar Energy Industries Association Executive Director Noah Ginsburg said, “As the federal government eliminates support for affordable clean energy, states need to act quickly to protect electric ratepayers and the clean energy workforce. New York Solar Energy Industries Association (NYSEIA) applauds Governor Hochul for taking action to accelerate renewable energy project development and construction. These actions will ensure that New York leverages federal funding for clean energy projects today while setting the stage for cost-effective permitting and interconnection tomorrow.”

Advanced Energy United New York Policy Lead Kristina Persaud said, “We commend Governor Hochul for delivering clean, reliable, and affordable energy to New Yorkers. Large-scale renewable projects don’t just keep energy costs in check—they also strengthen our electric grid and create good jobs across the state. This procurement keeps New York on track to meet our nation-leading clean energy targets and reaffirms the Empire State’s commitment to building a clean, affordable energy future.”

For more than fifty years, NYSERDA has been a trusted and objective resource for New Yorkers, taking on the critical role of energy planning and policy analysis, along with making investments that drive New York toward a more sustainable future. The launch of this solicitation continues to fuel the advancement of innovative technologies and solutions that will benefit New York residents as well as businesses.",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/thumbnails/image/wind_offshore_1280.jpg?h=b5f6a62e&itok=3cPRJe2X,N,,2025-09-26 11:03:53.914393

The UK’s first carbon capture-enabled cement plant at Padeswood, and one of the world’s first full-scale carbon capture waste-to-energy facilities at Protos in Ellesmere Port are now ready to begin construction.

These projects will remove 1.2 million tonnes of CO₂ annually, using world-leading carbon capture technology to decarbonise two of the most emissions-intensive industries: cement and waste-to-energy. Without carbon capture, these sectors have no viable route to cut emissions.

The projects are the first anchor developments to join Eni’s Liverpool Bay Transportation & Storage network, part of the HyNet carbon capture cluster, which was approved by the Prime Minister earlier this year. HyNet spans North Wales and the North West, using new and repurposed infrastructure to safely capture and store carbon emissions underground.

Together, Padeswood and Protos will directly support 500 skilled jobs, including roles for engineers, technicians, construction workers and health & safety experts. They form part of the 2,800 jobs expected across the wider HyNet network.

These shovel-ready projects are a cornerstone of the government’s Industrial Strategy, backed by £9.4 billion in funding announced in the June Spending Review. They will not only secure long-term employment in Britain’s industrial heartlands, but also position the UK as a global leader in carbon capture technology.

By investing in proven decarbonisation solutions, the UK is preserving proud British industries while creating export opportunities for homegrown innovation. British companies will gain a competitive edge in the global green economy, driving growth and sustainability.

Michael Shanks, Energy Minister, said:

“Our clean energy mission means good jobs, regional growth, and investment for local communities.

“These trailblazing projects showcase North Wales and the North West’s workforce on the global stage – leading the charge in the clean industries of the future and powering Britain’s reindustrialisation.”

The final investment decisions, signed with the Low Carbon Contracts Company, mean construction will begin shortly. These projects provide a crucial lifeline for the cement and waste sectors, ensuring their survival in a low-carbon future.

As the UK accelerates towards net zero, the launch of these carbon capture facilities sends a clear message: clean growth, secure jobs, and industrial resilience are at the heart of Britain’s green transition.

Despite that, Mills declined to sign her Democrat-run state onto that same letter of commitment for TCI collaboration that Cooper signed on behalf of North Carolina.
TCI wasn’t the only cap-and-trade program in which the Cooper administration expressed interest.
Roy Cooper, who was attorney general when the Democrat-controlled U.S. House passed legislation to create a national cap-and-trade program in 2009, has not commented on whether he supports a federal cap-and-trade program or a federal carbon tax.
North Carolina Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger (R‑Rockingham) and other SB 266 supporters point to official government projected savings for ratepayers of $13 billion over the next two and a half decades.","The road to a U.S. Senate majority in 2027 and 2028 runs through North Carolina, where the race to replace Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), which pits former Governor Roy Cooper (D) against former RNC chairman Michael Whatley (R), is likely to be the nation’s most expensive 2026 midterm contest. Roy Cooper underscored a theme of his campaign in a September 21 post on X, blaming dysfunction in Washington for a host of ills, among them “rising energy prices.”

Roy Cooper, who has never lost an election, appears confident about his ability to convince voters that Republicans on Capitol Hill are responsible for rising gas prices and utility bills. The Cooper campaign’s effort to equate GOP policies with increasing energy costs, however, will be confounded by aspects of Cooper’s own record as governor, namely his expressed interest in regional cap-and-trade programs, both existing and proposed.

In 2021, for example, then Governor Cooper registered his official support for a regional cap-and-trade program called the Transportation and Climate Initiative (TCI). TCI proponents lobbied legislators and other state officials for years, but the plan ultimately fell apart when it became clear that no more than three states were going to join the regional program. The way in which TCI would drive up gas prices was a key reason why TCI was rejected in 10 of the 13 northeastern and mid-Atlantic states targeted for adoption, mostly blue states where Democrats run state government. TCI proponents themselves conceded that the program would necessarily raise gas prices, with projections estimating that TCI would raise the price of gas more than 30 cents per gallon in member states.

Despite the unpopularity of TCI, even in the blue states targeted for membership, Governor Cooper signed onto a letter committing to collaboration with TCI member states in order “to shape the program to reflect the evolving needs of the region and welcome other jurisdictions to join.” Meanwhile, Maine Governor Janet Mills (D), who is now running for U.S. Senate like Cooper, faced pressure to join TCI that Cooper never had to deal with. Despite that, Mills declined to sign her Democrat-run state onto that same letter of commitment for TCI collaboration that Cooper signed on behalf of North Carolina.

Some North Carolinians saw Governor Cooper’s quiet commitment to collaboration with TCI member states, which wasn’t reported in any North Carolina media outlets, as the first step toward eventually imposing cap-and-trade in North Carolina. TCI wasn’t the only cap-and-trade program in which the Cooper administration expressed interest.

A spokesman for Cooper confirmed in 2021 that membership in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), an existing regional cap-and-trade program that limits and imposes a cost on carbon emissions from electric utilities in 11 northeastern states, was under consideration. Whereas TCI would’ve capped transportation-related emissions, RGGI focuses on the emissions produced by electric utilities.

North Carolina legislators were so concerned that Roy Cooper might seek to impose cap-and-trade by executive order, just as Governor Josh Shapiro (D-Pa.) is still trying to do in Pennsylvania in the face of bipartisan opposition, that the GOP-led General Assembly enacted a budget in late 2021 with a provision preventing Cooper or any future governor from imposing cap-and-trade without legislative approval.

Roy Cooper, who was attorney general when the Democrat-controlled U.S. House passed legislation to create a national cap-and-trade program in 2009, has not commented on whether he supports a federal cap-and-trade program or a federal carbon tax. That 2009 cap-and-trade bill, which went on to die in the Democrat-led Senate, was criticized over the way in which it would’ve put upward pressure on utility bills and gas prices. Former Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) demonstrated the bipartisan opposition to that national cap-and-trade proposal when he shot a copy of the bill with a rifle in a 2010 campaign ad.

This past summer provided a more recent, North Carolina-specific example of bipartisan opposition to emissions caps that are projected to drive up energy costs. At the end of July, members of the North Carolina House and Senate enacted Senate Bill 266, legislation repealing the 70% carbon emissions reduction mandate for electric utilities that would’ve taken effect in 2030. Despite Governor Josh Stein’s (D-N.C.) opposition to SB 266, three Democrats in the North Carolina House joined with Republicans to override Stein’s veto when only one defection was needed. That veto override vote actually understates the bipartisan support for SB 266, which 11 Democrats voted for on initial passage, prior to Stein’s veto.

North Carolina Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger (R‑Rockingham) and other SB 266 supporters point to official government projected savings for ratepayers of $13 billion over the next two and a half decades. “It is written in a way to explicitly save ratepayers dollars,” said Rep. Dean Arp (R‑Union), House sponsor of SB 266, about the need to repeal the 2030 emissions reduction mandate.

In his veto statement, Governor Stein contended that repeal of the 2030 carbon emissions reduction mandate will actually raise costs, with Stein alleging that the move “shifted billions in risk onto working families.” Organizations opposing SB 266, such as the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, also point research projecting that repeal of carbon emission reduction mandates would drive up utility bills.

“By overriding this veto, the General Assembly is standing up for energy affordability and sound economic policy,” said Donald Bryson, president and CEO of the John Locke Foundation, a North Carolina-based think tank, about the enactment of SB 266. “North Carolinians deserve an energy strategy that prioritizes cost, reliability, and transparency — not one driven by expensive, arbitrary mandates.”

In addition to providing an opportunity to explain his past interest in cap-and-trade, along with his support for other regulations that raise costs for consumers, Roy Cooper’s Senate bid is likely to have him facing questions never posed by the North Carolina press corps. For example, Cooper has spoken out many times in the past against the personal and corporate income tax cuts that the GOP-run North Carolina General Assembly enacted over the past 12 years, but Cooper has never said how high he’d like to ratchet back up the rate.

Cooper has complained about the personal income tax rate cuts enacted by GOP legislators, but does Cooper want North Carolina’s top marginal rate to return to 7.75%, where it was before Republicans in the North Carolina General Assembly began flattening and cutting the rate in 2013? He hasn’t said.

Cooper opposes the ongoing phaseout of North Carolina’s corporate income tax, but has not said how high he thinks the rate should be. Would Cooper like to see the corporate tax rate return to 6.9%, where it was before legislators began reforming the tax code? Cooper hasn’t said. Cooper has also criticized the federal corporate rate cut enacted by President Trump and congressional Republicans, yet he has not specified how high he thinks the federal corporate rate should be.

Roy Cooper is undefeated in elections, but his lengthy record will likely face more scrutiny in the coming year than it has in the previous decade. That is a key reason why many Republicans are optimistic that Cooper’s 2026 U.S. Senate bid will be the political equivalent of the 2007 New England Patriots’ 18-1 season.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68d2a9f0ca95dadd755ba766/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-26 09:59:11.668178

(Reuters) -The Trump administration's rapid retreat from renewable energy has kicked off consolidation and asset sales among smaller U.S. solar and wind power companies as they scramble to stay afloat, industry insiders and analysts said.

President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) has overhauled tax credits and sharply shortened eligibility windows for solar and wind projects as part of an ""energy dominance"" agenda focused on oil, gas, coal and nuclear, in a sharp departure from the green energy-focused policies under his predecessor Joe Biden.

""There's likely to be consolidation due to a variety of federal moves of late, including the recently passed tax bill (OBBBA) which eliminates investment tax credits,"" said Gregg Felton, CEO of Connecticut-based Altus Power.

Clean energy deals surged to 63 with a combined value of around $34 billion in the first half of 2025, according to KPMG, versus roughly 57 deals worth about $7 billion in the second half of 2024.

Compounding the worries, the Inflation Reduction Act, which had allowed projects to use or sell credits to lower construction costs, was rolled back earlier this year, while loan guarantees for green projects were scrapped in late December.

The compressed deadlines and reduced support could force smaller players to merge, form joint ventures, or sell assets to survive, said John Villali, senior research director at IDC Energy Insights.

The U.S. Energy Department said on September 24, it intends to cancel more than $13 billion in funds for green energy, further darkening the outlook for such projects.

That followed axing in May of more than $3.7 billion in funding for 24 green energy projects approved under Biden, including one at an ExxonMobil refinery in Texas.

Sunnova Energy recently lost a $2.92 billion loan guarantee.

The cancellation of federal loans will likely drive M&A in the utility sector, particularly for distressed clean energy assets, said Gregg Semler, CEO of InPipe Energy.

SAVVY BUYERS AWAIT

Private equity firms and utilities are already circling.

In late August, CBRE Investment Management agreed to acquire ClearGen, a clean energy developer and manager backed by Blackstone with more than 250 projects across 14 states.

Disruptions are industry-wide but nimble developers and market-aware investors will still find opportunities, ClearGen CEO Rob Howard said.

Larger utilities and private equity investors with stronger balance sheets and risk tolerance are lapping up the undervalued assets.

""We are on the buy side...actively dealing with greenfield developers and other energy companies,"" said independent power producer Agilitas Energy CEO Barrett Bilotta.

The company plans more M&A announcements this year after having acquired a solar project in Rhode Island in August and two hydropower projects in West Virginia and Maryland in June.

Burdock also rejected the claim that offshore wind is solely a European industry, with U.S. contracts increasing over the past four years, “…it’s a U.S. industry now.” Milito noted that although it is a “nascent emerging industry,” the offshore wind industry has the potential to expand to all fifty states through additional ports, manufacturing, and infrastructure if the federal government stops interfering.","John Szoka, CEO of the Conservative Energy Network (CEN), led a panel discussion during National Clean Energy Week about the potential presented by the offshore wind industry, as well as the obstacles that need to be overcome.

Liz Burdock, president and CEO of Oceantic Network, a nonprofit focused on developing the ocean renewables market and its supply chain, emphasized the importance of offshore wind, noting that the economic benefits are paramount. The nonprofit found that in the past ten years, the U.S. has invested $24 billion in the industry’s supply chain, ranging from large shipbuilding and steel manufacturing operations to small businesses across forty states. Ports have been a particular beneficiary, with three different types needed to support the industry: manufacturing ports, staging and marshalling ports, and operations and maintenance ports. Port openings have reinvigorated dormant shipyards and brought communities like New Bedford, Massachusetts and Albany, New York, back to life. Steel manufacturing has also been a highlight, with new plants in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Texas representing investments of $500 million or more to supply the four-inch steel for foundations and towers. “So we’re looking at bringing back industries that have been sitting dormant and that are, quite frankly, aligned with this administration,” Burdock expressed. These industries are not the only ones benefiting from offshore wind. “It’s all the ancillary services that help support that activity… And so the job multiplier is huge,” Burdock said.

Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA), added that offshore wind boosts the country’s national security, “and that’s because we are competing globally when it comes to energy, and when it comes to offshore wind, it allows us to compete in many areas,” he explained. Beyond advancing the nation’s maritime dominance, it also allows us to compete with China, the dominant player in the space. Additionally, Milito pointed out that “it’s a national security interest of ours to make sure we have the power to fuel our economy,” with an increased use of electricity for data centers, electric vehicles, heat pumps, and more, requiring all the power generation we can get.

Additionally, Burdock labelled offshore wind “the workhorse of the clean power industry,” adding that “despite some of the things that you might have heard, it is base load generation.” She used the South Fork Wind project off the coast of New York as an example of just how efficient the resource can be. In the first half of 2025, it achieved a net capacity factor of 53%, compared to 53.7% for the state’s most efficient natural gas facilities. During a heat wave in June, South Fork even reached an 87.4% capacity factor, meeting emergency demand. Additionally, it is a cost-effective resource, particularly in the Northeast, where wind speeds are high. Burdock quoted Bob Blue, CEO of Dominion Energy, which is developing the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project. Blue said, “Offshore represents the fastest and most economical way to deliver almost 3 GW of electricity to Virginia’s grid, to support America’s AI and cyber preeminence in the largest data center market in the world.”

Burdock and Milito cited numerous ways that the industry is pivoting to overcome obstacles. Burdock emphasized that although these projects are typically located off the coasts of blue states, they are generating jobs in red states. She explained, “One of the criticisms of my industry is that we haven’t done a good enough job to really illustrate how those jobs are being created in the red states. We didn’t talk enough to those constituencies to make sure that they were talking to their representatives, so that they really understood what this industry meant to them from an economic standpoint.” The industry will need to pivot this messaging going forward.

Milito discussed the importance of a bipartisan path forward and returning to a time when there was no contempt for any energy resources because people recognized that we needed it all to achieve America’s goals. “We’re working with both sides of the aisle in Congress… We’re trying to bring people to the middle,” he clarified. Milito added that stop-work orders for projects do not “provide certainty and predictability to companies who want to invest in the U.S.” He described a similar situation that once faced the oil and gas industry, but regarding which they found success in the courts, offering hope for the fate of offshore wind.

In the face of the administration’s opposition to offshore wind, Burdock urged other industries to step up and say that it is bad for business overall because, “this isn’t just affecting this one industry. It’s going to affect all of the investments in major infrastructure that we have.” She summarized, “Anybody who has a fully permitted project for the federal government should be shaking in their boots right now at what is happening to this industry.” Milito offered a different approach, suggesting that there may be “continued discussions between this administration and a lot of state governments to see if there are ways to come to a compromise and work together to meet the goals of everyone.” If the administration is looking for something in return, it may be a route to seeing these projects green-lighted, even though “that’s not the way we want to see permitting and the regulatory system work.”

Another critical piece of the puzzle is addressing the misconceptions about offshore wind, which Burdock attempted to do during the panel discussion. She noted that it has been proven untrue that the industry hurts tourism or devalues homes. Commercial fishing benefits from the installations, not only because the projects have attracted biodiverse life that has not lived in the area in decades, but also because the fishermen themselves are often paid to act as guard vessels or to monitor for whales. Burdock also rejected the claim that offshore wind is solely a European industry, with U.S. contracts increasing over the past four years, “…it’s a U.S. industry now.”

Milito noted that although it is a “nascent emerging industry,” the offshore wind industry has the potential to expand to all fifty states through additional ports, manufacturing, and infrastructure if the federal government stops interfering. He concluded, “This is something that’s going to benefit all Americans, and we’ve got to make sure we get out of the way.”",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/491617187_1241656167967195_8465522526178236569_n-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 11:04:07.960037
