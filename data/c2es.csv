According to Canary Media, leaders in the state's energy sector filed an urgent request Aug. 22 asking regulators to expedite approvals for new renewable projects. Just five days later, the utilities commission approved an accelerated timeline for permitting and construction, a rare move for state energy regulators.

The plan would finalize approvals by mid-2026 for 4 gigawatts of new wind and solar power, 200 megawatts of thermal power, and 300 megawatts of battery storage. Colorado already has 5 gigawatts of wind and 4.5 gigawatts of solar installed, meaning this expansion could significantly boost the state's capacity to deliver affordable, reliable clean energy before the Trump administration's new energy-constraining laws take effect.

The clear threat of higher energy prices caused by the administration's policies has created a rare alignment of interests among utility providers and ratepayer advocates to take advantage of Inflation Reduction Act tax credits right now.

Colorado's largest utility provider, Xcel Energy, stated that the accelerated plan could save customers $5 billion over the next two decades, providing critical relief as electricity demand rises faster than it has in decades. More clean power means less reliance on volatile coal and gas prices, helping protect residents from future price spikes.

Wind, solar, and storage projects can also significantly reduce planet-overheating pollution, lower air pollution from dirty energy plants, and make communities more resilient as demand for power surges from electric vehicles and costly data centers.

Colorado's push is being watched closely across the country. California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently signed a similar executive order to help projects meet expiring federal deadlines.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis urged authorities to ""eliminate administrative barriers and bottlenecks for renewable projects,"" adding that ""getting this right is of critical importance to Colorado ratepayers; by maximizing the utilization of tax credits while they're available and reducing future tariff uncertainty, the State can avoid billions of dollars in additional energy costs for decades to come.""

The program will also include piloted and unmanned operations that focus on electric air taxis, also called an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft or eVTOL, that can help with delivering cargo and supplies.
This is not the first time the FAA has considered air taxis for future use.
The company on Friday announced plans to participate in the pilot program.
""We'll demonstrate that air taxis can operate safely and quietly,"" Archer founder and CEO Adam Goldstein said in a statement.","The Trump administration has unveiled a pilot program to accelerate the use of electric air taxis, a move aimed at establishing U.S. dominance in airspace technology.

The Department of Transportation on Friday said the Federal Aviation Administration's Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing Integration Pilot Program (eIPP) will develop ""new frameworks and regulations for enabling safe operations"" and form partnerships with private sector companies as well as with state and local governments.

""The next great technological revolution in aviation is here,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement on Friday. ""The United States will lead the way, and doing so will cement America's status as a global leader in transportation innovation. That means more high-paying manufacturing jobs and economic opportunity.""

The program will include at least five pilot projects and will run for three years after the first project is up and running, the department said. The program will also include piloted and unmanned operations that focus on electric air taxis, also called an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft or eVTOL, that can help with delivering cargo and supplies. The aircraft will also be used to test their effectiveness in emergency situations, such as airlift and medical transport.

The program would allow the testing of aircraft both unmanned and piloted, and which may be capable of carrying passengers, before they complete FAA certification, a process that can take years. Aircraft must have FAA certification before carrying cargo or passengers when flying commercially, according to federal regulations.

This is not the first time the FAA has considered air taxis for future use.

In June 2023, the FAA greenlit a plan from Joby Aviation, a California-based aviation company, to begin test flights of an electric flying taxi prototype. The company on Friday announced plans to participate in the pilot program.

""We've spent more than 15 years building the aircraft technology and operational capabilities that are defining advanced aerial mobility, and we're ready to bring our services to communities,"" Joby's chief policy officer Greg Bowles said in a statement. ""We look forward to demonstrating our aircraft's maturity and delivering early operations in cities and states nationwide.""

Another company, Archer Aviation, also said Friday that it plans to participate in the program.

""We'll demonstrate that air taxis can operate safely and quietly,"" Archer founder and CEO Adam Goldstein said in a statement. ""These early flights will help cement American leadership in advanced aviation and set the stage for scaled commercial operations in the U.S. and beyond.""

The FAA said it is accepting proposals and a minimum of five participants will be selected, according to an unpublished federal notice about the program that is set to become public on Tuesday.

""For consumers, any increase in supply costs or materials increases the overall cost of putting solar panels on your roof,"" Crouch told Insurance Business.
Why do rising insurance prices for renewable energy projects matter?
While U.S. renewable-energy investment dropped by $20 billion, the world saw overall investment grow by 10% to a record $386 billion, according to BloombergNEF.
Taking things a step further, you can help by installing solar panels on your home now before Crouch's predicted insurance crunch becomes more severe.","With the federal government rolling back billions of dollars in incentives for renewable-energy development, experts have sounded the alarm over a widely overlooked yet highly likely impact: rising insurance costs.

What's happening?

In addition to ending significant tax incentives previously available to projects ranging in scale from home solar installations to massive wind farms, increased tariffs also have made it more expensive to purchase necessary materials, Canaan Crouch, the executive vice president and environmental broker at Jencap Specialty Insurance Services, told Insurance Business.

As a result, investors have significantly scaled back on renewable-energy development in the United States. According to BloombergNEF, in the first half of 2025, such investments dropped a staggering 36% from just a year prior, a loss of more than $20 billion in funding.

Crouch warned that the impact on consumers likely would be even greater and more immediate than on utility-scale projects.

""For consumers, any increase in supply costs or materials increases the overall cost of putting solar panels on your roof,"" Crouch told Insurance Business. ""So, consumers are probably seeing a bigger impact.""

On top of these direct effects, Crouch cautioned that these industry-wide changes also would have important secondary impacts, such as in the insurance market.

For example, when a homeowner decides to install solar panels on their roof, they must find an insurance carrier that is willing to cover the project's risks. The rising cost of even such small-scale projects has made insurers more hesitant to do so.

""Stay informed about what's happening with subsidies, tariffs, and inflationary pressures, because those are the factors that directly shape the risks we're insuring,"" cautioned Crouch, per Insurance Business.

With fewer carriers willing to insure such projects, prices for such coverage will inevitably increase, Crouch predicted.

While the market has yet to reflect such pressures, Crouch warned, ""If I had to read the tea leaves, there's going to be an increase in price.""

Why do rising insurance prices for renewable energy projects matter?

The impact that government policies have on insurance prices, and the ability to get insurance coverage at all, has been an overlooked yet significant aspect of the current administration's recent changes.

If individuals and companies are unable to insure renewable-energy projects, or if the cost of doing so rises significantly, fewer homeowners will be able to install solar panels, and fewer utility-scale renewable-energy projects will be built.

The result will not only hinder efforts to transition the U.S. economy toward cleaner, renewable sources of energy but likely will harm the nation's economy as a whole.

Even as renewable-energy investments in the U.S. cratered by more than one-third, such investments globally reached record highs, per BloombergNEF. This has put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage and puts the country at risk of falling behind in the energy revolution taking place throughout much of the world.

While U.S. renewable-energy investment dropped by $20 billion, the world saw overall investment grow by 10% to a record $386 billion, according to BloombergNEF.

Simply put, renewable-energy investors put off by recent changes in U.S. policy have found other countries to invest in.

As companies and countries around the globe continue to race for supremacy in artificial intelligence, powering the massive, energy-hungry data centers that make AI possible has become a key distinguishing factor. If the U.S. continues to fall behind on building the power sources of the future, it could significantly hurt the country's ability to compete in the AI race.

What's being done about it?

For the U.S. to once again shift course and regain its momentum in the transition toward cleaner, renewable sources of energy will require change at the political level.

To help make this happen, you can use your voice by contacting your elected representatives and letting them know where you stand on issues like renewable-energy tax incentives and tariffs on materials used in renewable-energy development. And, when election season rolls around, you also can make a difference by voting for candidates who share your views.

Taking things a step further, you can help by installing solar panels on your home now before Crouch's predicted insurance crunch becomes more severe.

EnergySage offers free online tools that make it easy to compare quotes from local solar installers and to take advantage of available incentives.

What does greenhouse gas reporting do?
Since 2010, the greenhouse gas reporting program has collected emissions data from about 8,000 of the largest industrial facilities in the U.S. from 47 different source categories.
In turn, this information has historically been shared with the United Nations, but for the first time in nearly 30 years, the Trump administration missed an April deadline to submit data on U.S. climate emissions.
“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, said in a statement.","The Trump administration on Friday announced that it plans to stop requiring more than 8,000 polluters to report greenhouse gas emissions.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal would see industrial facilities like coal-burning power plants, oil refineries, and steel mills no longer have to track and report the amount of carbon dioxide, methane, and other emissions they emit—a requirement that had been in place since 2010.

The agency said that U.S. businesses could save as much as $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over the next decade as a result of the change. Some experts have argued that the societal costs of emissions from companies in the U.S. could run into the tens of trillions by 2050.

The EPA in its release said that requiring facilities to report emissions had “no material impact on improving human health and the environment.” It comes after months of work by the Trump administration to dismantle various federal programs designed to combat climate change and cuts to research funding to study the phenomenon.

The administration’s efforts to pull back on climate change is at odds with the broad scientific consensus that human-driven warming is linked to extreme weather and health risks. A study published in Nature this past week, for example, showed that 180 of the world’s biggest fossil fuel and cement producers made 213 extreme heatwaves between 2000 and 2023 more likely and more dangerous.

What does greenhouse gas reporting do?

Since 2010, the greenhouse gas reporting program has collected emissions data from about 8,000 of the largest industrial facilities in the U.S. from 47 different source categories. In turn, this information has historically been shared with the United Nations, but for the first time in nearly 30 years, the Trump administration missed an April deadline to submit data on U.S. climate emissions.

As part of the 2015 Paris Agreement, the United Nations has required industrialized countries to reduce their emissions to combat climate change. U.S. President Donald Trump announced on his first day in office that the U.S. would withdraw from this agreement for the second time (Trump pulled the U.S. out of the agreement during his first term).

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, said in a statement. “Instead, it costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities.”

“Unlike other mandatory information collections under the Clean Air Act, the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is not directly related to a potential regulation and has no material impact on improving human health and the environment. By reducing the overall regulatory burden, current regulated parties will be able to focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits,” an EPA spokesperson told Fast Company in a statement.

Certain oil and gas facilities will still be required to report emissions data as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, although the EPA’s proposal would allow these facilities to suspend reporting until 2034.

Critics point to cost of losing data

Environmental advocates criticized the proposal as hampering future policy making.

“With this move, they’re taking away the practical and material capacity of the federal government to do the basic elements of climate policymaking,” a former EPA official under the Biden administration told The New York TImes.

The proposal would eliminate data that the public, states, and local policymakers have depended on for more than 15 years, leaving Americans “in the dark” about where pollution is coming from, David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, told The Associated Press.

Before this proposal is finalized, the EPA will hold a virtual public hearing and accept public comments for 47 days after the proposal is published in the Federal Register.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/09/p-91404426-EPA-to-stop-recording-emissions.jpg",N,,2025-09-13 20:01:20.590584

“Climate, energy and affordability are like oil, water and sand,” he said.
At the same time, refinery closures and oil company threats to leave California put Newsom in a bind.
His administration unveiled concessions to keep production in the state and the California Energy Commission suspended a controversial profit cap on gasoline refiners for the next five years.
Meanwhile lawmakers took a major push to let California join a shared Western electricity market, allowing power to flow more easily across state lines.","Gov. Gavin Newsom closed out the legislative year with one of the most sweeping overhauls of California’s energy and climate policies in decades — a package that could give him a presidential debate-stage talking point on rising energy costs as the Democratic Party shifts its focus to affordability.

The six-bill deal — passed Saturday after lawmakers extended their session by an extra day because of last-minute dealmaking — was sold as a way to ease gas prices and soaring electricity bills while preserving the state’s signature climate programs.

Ratepayers are expected to get some relief through measures to cut the cost of building transmission lines, and an expanded cap-and-trade energy credit aimed at blunting rising energy bills. They also will get some protection from utilities hiking rates based on the cost of wildfire-proofing their infrastructure, such as by putting power lines underground. But they’ll also continue paying $9 billion over the next decade into a fund to compensate wildfire victims.

The package of legislation now heads to the governor’s desk for his signature.

Newsom and his allies, who negotiated the package in the final days of the legislative session, said the state needed to allow more permits to drill oil to head off more refinery shutdowns that could send gas prices soaring.

Critics said the biggest winners of the maneuvering were the oil industry and the state’s major utilities. Oil drilling measures advanced in Kern County after refiners threatened to shutter plants. Utilities gained sweeping new wildfire liability protections and the ability to join a regional power market — a step critics warned could tether California to fossil-fuel states at a time when the Trump administration is moving to roll back clean energy.

Michael Wara, a Stanford legal scholar focused on energy policy, called it “astonishing” that lawmakers managed to pass so many major bills at once, including the two-thirds vote to reauthorize cap-and-trade. California is making steady progress in shifting from fossil fuels to renewables, even as wildfires complicate the transition, and while the measures were imperfect, they were necessary, he said.

“I’ve been a part, over the last decade, of getting individual tweaks done in each of these areas — but the idea that we would get them all done at once, on time, when we needed to, is astonishing to me,” Wara said. “Are the bills perfect? No, from my perspective they’re not perfect, but they are all material improvements over the status quo.”

The future of cap and trade reinforced

At the center of the bargain was the extension of California’s cap-and-trade system — rebranded by Newsom as “cap and invest” — through 2045. The extension, hammered out in backroom talks, was one of the most divisive elements of the package.

The carbon-trading program, launched in 2013, is California’s way of putting a price tag on greenhouse gas emissions — those responsible for climate change. The program sets a strict cap on emissions for polluters and hands out a limited supply of permits companies can sell to other polluters if they cut enough emissions.

The final agreement on the program preserved rules that let oil companies avoid paying the full cost of their emissions while leaving untouched a cap on carbon prices. That setup shields polluters while leaving consumers potentially exposed to higher gas prices, experts said.

Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas stood by the energy package on Saturday, arguing the measure to boost in-state oil production and keep refineries from closing would keep prices down at the pump. “Altogether,” he told reporters, the deal “is going to result in some billions of dollars in savings.”

The California Chamber of Commerce was out front in opposing the cap and trade deal, arguing it would make energy less affordable by taking credits away from gas customers and giving them to electric utilities — hurting families, renters, and small businesses that still depend on natural gas. The powerful business group has poured at least $6.9 million into legislative races over the past decade, according to CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database.

The oil industry’s chief lobbying group, the Western States Petroleum Association, which had pushed back early on, eventually settled into neutrality. Meanwhile, environmental justice advocates remained staunchly against it, saying the program protects oil and gas companies while leaving nearby low-income communities to bear the health costs of pollution.

A group of seven environmental justice groups from across the state, including Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Asian Pacific Environmental Network Action, said the extension “institutionalizes inequality in California’s climate policy.”

“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” the groups said.

Alongside reauthorization of the program, a companion bill provided a blueprint for how the state should spend its revenues, reshaping it starting in 2026 to guarantee $1 billion a year for high-speed rail and $1 billion a year for lawmakers to direct through the budget.

Questioning the affordability premise

The sweeping climate and energy package was born of mounting pressures — some long expected, others abrupt. Affordability has become the defining fault line in Democratic politics since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, powered by a campaign fixated on cutting costs and fighting inflation.

At the same time, Democrats are leaning into the rhetoric of “abundance,” a term popularized by columnist Ezra Klein to capture the idea that more housing, clean energy and infrastructure can ease scarcity and lower costs. But some consumer advocates and Capitol insiders argue the measures won’t ultimately help consumers.

“I don’t know how any of this saves money,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. “But this is the new state of Sacramento. I think it happened because of Trump, honestly, I think this is all about abundance and Trump, and Democrats trying to make a name for themselves by dumping regulation.”

Republicans, too, slammed the package, but they called it over-regulation that would continue to keep gas and energy costs high. Sen. Kelly Seyarto, a Murrieta Republican, called Democrats’ goals of using the cap-and-trade dollars to improve transit “unrealistic” when Californians “are not going to give up driving their cars,” and said the party’s stated three goals can’t coexist.

“Climate, energy and affordability are like oil, water and sand,” he said. “People aren’t going to be able to live here.”

Newsom’s push to keep gasoline prices and energy bills in check — a message potentially aimed as much at a national audience in a future presidential bid as at Californians — meshed with Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas’s early pledge to make 2025 the Legislature’s “year of affordability.”

Meanwhile, Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and his team resisted giving ground to oil and gas interests without securing gains for environmental and social justice priorities, given the concentration of polluting industries and poor air quality in low-income communities.

Cap-and-trade renewal took on urgency as carbon auctions faltered and Trump singled out the program — originally set to expire in 2030 — as potentially unconstitutional.

A ‘giveaway to big oil’?

At the same time, refinery closures and oil company threats to leave California put Newsom in a bind. After blasting the industry as deceitful and politically manipulative for years, Newsom reversed course. His administration unveiled concessions to keep production in the state and the California Energy Commission suspended a controversial profit cap on gasoline refiners for the next five years.

While much of the governor’s original oil refinery proposal was pared back in the Legislature, drilling approvals advanced in Kern County. That was a victory for Republican Sen. Shannon Grove, who represents the county. Grove has spent a decade pushing to keep drilling and its middle-class jobs alive there.

The approved oil permits, she said, “will result in California-compliant oil that is the most regulated in the world.”

Nevertheless, Assemblymember Alex Lee, a Democrat from Milpitas, criticized the oil deal from the Assembly floor Saturday as a “giveaway to big oil.”

“The thing we need to focus on is a controlled and managed phaseout of fossil fuel, like the dinosaurs that they process, the petroleum-oil, fossil-fuel industry fuel is dying out,” Lee said. “Refineries and facilities are closing, not just in California, but in Texas and across the world.”

Lawmakers also established a state fund to monitor pollution mitigation in disadvantaged communities.

Layered onto those debates was a high-stakes battle over utility finances. Wildfire liabilities loomed over investor-owned utilities, especially Southern California Edison, now under scrutiny for its potential role in the Eaton Fire in Altadena. Newsom pressed to expand California’s $18 billion wildfire fund — a safeguard supporters said was vital to protect ratepayers if utilities sparked future blazes, but one that critics warned could ultimately drive consumer bills higher.

Meanwhile lawmakers took a major push to let California join a shared Western electricity market, allowing power to flow more easily across state lines. Supporters say it could cut costs for customers and steady the grid during crunch times like heat waves, while supporting in-state clean power producers who could sell excess electricity to neighbors.

Consumer advocates, led by The Utility Reform Network, warned the change could weaken California’s control over its clean energy agenda and hand more power to a federal government under Trump that is siding with fossil fuels. Some environmental and consumer groups shared that concern.

The shift is important because California has spent decades building one of the cleanest grids in the world and the move to open up that system to other Western states could reshape how both renewable and fossil power move across the region.

This led Ørsted to sue the Trump administration in September, in a bid to get the project moving again.
In September, the Trump administration instructed around half a dozen government agencies to draft plans to restrict U.S. wind energy development, as Trump labelled wind farms as ugly, expensive, and inefficient.
Agencies that have traditionally had little to do with wind energy have been called upon to support efforts to restrict the development of offshore wind farms.
Several agencies are expected to assess their existing policies to see if there are any that are favourable for wind energy development that could be redirected to other forms of energy, particularly fossil fuels.","The Danish wind giant Ørsted is fighting for its survival after United States President Donald Trump introduced a barrage of orders limiting the growth of the wind power sector. After declaring an energy emergency in the U.S. upon entering office in January, Trump has spent the past eight months introducing executive orders and legislation to strengthen fossil fuel production and limit the expansion of the renewable energy sector. This has led to greater investor uncertainty and has caused project delays and financial harm to green energy producers.

In January, Trump ordered a review of offshore wind permitting and leasing, and in the months since he has introduced a host of orders and laws aimed at curbing wind energy development, which have led to the halt of several major projects, In August, Europe’s largest wind power company, Ørsted, released a statement blaming President Trump for derailing its business model after its market value dropped by nearly a third. It is now fighting to get its business on track.

Ørsted received approval from shareholders for its $9.4 billion rights issue in early September. The company was forced to raise new capital after its profits fell in recent months due to project delays and investor uncertainty, among other factors. The Trump administration halted work on Ørsted’s 704-MW Revolution Windfarm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut in August, despite the company holding project permits and works being around 80 percent complete.

This led Ørsted to sue the Trump administration in September, in a bid to get the project moving again. Orsted requested that the United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismiss the stop-work order, saying it was arbitrary, capricious, unlawful, and “issued in bad faith”. Orsted and its partner Skyborn Renewables have already invested $5 billion in Revolution Wind, a project which is expected to provide power for over 350,000 homes in the region.

Norway’s wind giant Equinor was one of the companies to support Ørsted’s search for capital, offering $1 billion in funding to help keep it afloat. In a bid of confidence, Equinor said it planned to retain its 10 percent ownership of Ørsted, which it completed last December, making it the second-largest shareholder after the Danish government. The Norwegian firm said it was confident in Ørsted’s underlying business and the competitiveness of offshore wind in the future energy mix. As part of the move, Equinor plans to nominate a candidate to Ørsted’s board of directors.

Ørsted’s shares have fallen in recent months in the face of various challenges, mainly centred around U.S. policy decisions. The firm’s share prices have decreased by around 90 percent from the 2021 peak. The support from Equinor has made some in the industry question whether the two companies could be heading towards a merger.

It is not just Ørsted that has been hit hard by Trump’s attack on the renewable energy sector. President Trump has long hailed the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the most far-reaching climate policy to date, a “Green New Scam. Greatest scam in history, probably.” His blatant attack on green energy from the moment he entered office, and even before, on his campaign trail, has led to greater investor uncertainty in the sector. Many renewable energy producers and cleantech companies now fear cuts in funding and project delays, after several years of high investment and the rapid acceleration of green energy deployment.

In September, the Trump administration instructed around half a dozen government agencies to draft plans to restrict U.S. wind energy development, as Trump labelled wind farms as ugly, expensive, and inefficient. Agencies that have traditionally had little to do with wind energy have been called upon to support efforts to restrict the development of offshore wind farms. At the Health and Human Services Department, officials are now assessing whether wind turbines are emitting electromagnetic fields harmful to human health, while the Department of Defence (War) is probing whether wind projects could pose a threat to national security.

Following the instruction, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. said he was working with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth as part of a “departmental coalition team” to assess the risks from offshore wind farms. “We’re all working together on this issue,” Kennedy said during a cabinet meeting.

Several agencies are expected to assess their existing policies to see if there are any that are favourable for wind energy development that could be redirected to other forms of energy, particularly fossil fuels. The move will build on previous actions by the Trump administration to curb U.S. wind energy development in favour of oil, gas, and coal, as President Trump looks to largely undo the groundwork laid by the Biden administration for a green transition.

(AP) — California will extend a key climate program under a bill state lawmakers passed Saturday, sending the measure to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has championed it as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks.

The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013.

The program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.

Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year.

“After months of hard work with the Legislature, we have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution — all while fast-tracking California’s transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,” Newsom said after striking the deal this week.

The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects. It would also change the name to “cap and invest” to emphasize its funding of climate programs.

The Legislature approved another bill committing annual funding from the program’s revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.

Officials try to balance environmental protection with cost of living

The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state’s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.

Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program’s future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration’s attacks on climate programs, including the state’s first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.

Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said the extension balanced the state’s ambitious emission-reduction and affordability goals. The Democrat called cap and trade “the cornerstone of our climate strategy.”

But environmental justice advocates opposing the proposal say it doesn’t go far enough and lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.

“This really continues to allow big oil to reduce their emissions on paper instead of in real life,” said Asha Sharma, state policy manager at the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability.

GOP lawmakers say cap-and-trade will raise prices in California

GOP lawmakers criticized the program, saying it would make living in California more expensive.

“Cap and trade has become cap and tax,” said James Gallagher, the Assembly Republican minority leader. “It’s going to raise everybody’s costs.”

Cap and trade has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played “a very small role” in increasing electricity prices because the state’s grid isn’t very carbon intensive, the report says.

Lawmakers and lobbyists criticized the governor and legislative leaders for rushing the deal through with little public input.

Ben Golombek, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said at a hearing this week that the Legislature should have taken more time “to do this right.”

Democratic state Sen. Caroline Menjivar said it shouldn’t be par for the course for lawmakers to jam through bills without the opportunity for amendments.

“We’re expected to vote on it,” she said of Democrats. “If not, you’re seen to not be part of the team or not want to be a team player.”

Menjivar ultimately voted to advance the bill out of committee.

Energy affordability and fuel supply

The cap-and-trade bills are part of a sweeping package lawmakers approved aimed at advancing the state’s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians.

One of the bills would speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, which proponents have hailed as a necessary response to planned refinery closures and critics have blasted as a threat to air quality.

Another bill would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.

The Legislature voted to refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze. The bill would set up public financing to build electric utility projects.

Lawmakers also passed a measure allowing the state’s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states. The bill aims to improve grid reliability. It would save ratepayers money because California would sell power to other states when it generates more than it needs and buy cheaper energy from out of state when necessary, the governor’s office said.",https://www.kxan.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2025/09/68c5f1c4d41f06.27666104.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-13 19:00:44.176473

The development of a next-generation thermal fluid, called Shell EV-Plus, promises to recharge batteries from 10% to 80% in less than 10 minutes without compromising safety or cell life.

Shell fluid accelerates electric car charging

The breakthrough was made possible by a joint venture between Shell Lubricants and RML Group, a British company specializing in automotive innovation. Together they designed a 34-kWh battery pack that incorporates this thermal fluid based on gas-to-liquid (GTL) technology. (GTL) TECHNOLOGY. This combination allows higher charging currents to be tolerated with precise thermal control.

Under optimal conditions, a light, aerodynamic vehicle consuming 10 km/kWh could recover up to 24 km of range for every minute connected to the charger. This figure far exceeds the 5 km per minute typical of many current models, representing a significant improvement in range per charge time.

The key to performance lies in the ability of the Shell EV-Plus fluid to fill all spaces within the battery pack, maximizing contact with each cell and ensuring efficient heat transfer. Its non-conductive nature allows it to maintain electrical electrical safety while managing the heat generated during fast charging.

Safety and more compact design

In addition to shortening charging times, this breakthrough makes it possible to design more compact battery packs with fewer components and greater thermal stability. This translates into propulse and safer battery packs, suitable for the next generation of electric vehicles.

Shell will showcase this innovation in October during The Battery Show North America in Detroit, one of the most relevant events in the industry. The initiative reinforces Shell’s commitment to the electrification of transportation and the development of solutions that drive the mass adoption of electric vehicles worldwide.

And several new projects in Europe have started the process of eliminating our reliance on oil and gas. The fact that it is right beneath the sea only makes this new development more exciting. TotalEnergies and Air Liquide plan to develop two projects that will deliver about 45,000 t/year of green hydrogen for our ever-growing energy needs. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and only requires some special attention to become the fuel of the future.

The Netherlands has become the home of renewable energy production

That can only become a reality when the system comes online, and like Skynet in the Terminator, it could change the world forever, only this time in a positive way. TotalEnergies has signed agreements with Air Liquide to develop two projects that could aim to tap into the natural reserves of hydrogen sitting in the sea just waiting for us to find them.

The power will be generated mostly by the OranjeWind offshore wind farm in the Dutch North Sea, and plans to transport the green hydrogen via a pipeline inland towards the Hydrogen Network Rotterdam grid. It forms part of the new trajectory that the Netherlands is heading towards in sustainable energy solutions that meet and exceed the world’s energy needs.

The joint venture plans to construct and operate a 250-MW electrolyzer near the Zeeland refinery in the southern Netherlands, which could be commissioned in 2029, and reduce the site’s CO2 emissions by up to 300,000 t/year. Those are some impressive numbers that will surely drive the world’s big oil companies absolutely insane.

The world is pivoting towards hydrogen as the fuel of the future

Our reliance on fossil fuels needs to end; we are all acutely aware of that truth. Uncomfortable as it may be, the truth hardly spares a moment to consider how we might feel. But the new joint venture is a step towards a sustainable future that all of us, and our descendants, can enjoy and be an active part of. The project has been given the green light and has the world eagerly awaiting the first phase.

To make the deal even sweeter, TotalEnergies has signed a tolling agreement for 130 MW to be dedicated to producing 15,000 t/year of green hydrogen for the TotalEnergies platform in Antwerp. So the project is aiming to enter the rest of Europe as well. How will the Europeans react to a whole new mode of energy production that comes from the sea?

While the Netherlands is a small country, they have significant interests in renewable and sustainable energy production, and no matter who you ask, hydrogen is the most viable fuel source for the world’s needs. We just need a practical method of extraction and storage, and then we are off to the races, as they say. It’s a promising sign to see some of the world’s largest energy companies making significant investments in sustainable energy.

The elimination of federal tax credits for electric vehicles is a major move on its own. Paired with the removal of penalties for missing fuel economy targets under CAFE regulations, the result is a playing field with entirely new rules.

The immediate winners are the combustion-heavy brands that can now focus on selling trucks and SUVs without financial punishment. On the other side, Tesla, Rivian, and other EV specialists stand to lose billions, not because demand for their cars will collapse, but because a critical source of revenue has been pulled out from under them. At the center of the storm is an Environmental Protection Agency that appears to be working against the mission printed on its own website.

Cash Flow Reversal

Since 2022, GM has spent some $3.5 billion buying regulatory credits, says Bloomberg. Ford and Stellantis have spent billions as well. That cash went to brands like Tesla and Rivian, which had plenty of credits to sell since their cars emit zero emissions. With the end of EV tax credits and CAFE fines for breaking regulations, Ford, GM and Stellantis can pour the money they would’ve spent on credits back into their own piggy bank.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the policy shift has the “potential to unlock a multibillion-dollar opportunity,” noting that the Blue Oval is already retooling its Oakville, Ontario, plant to build Super Duty pickups instead of EVs.

GM is also cutting back on EV production, opting to overhaul factories for gasoline-fueled models. Stellantis, meanwhile, has gone so far as to revive the thirsty Hemi V8 engine, something previously thought dead in the age of electrification. With all of these changes, death might now be coming for some EV brands.

Trouble Ahead For EV Startups

Not only does the end of tax credits make purchasing an EV less palatable for many, but it also means that brands which used to benefit from selling tax credits now need to readjust to the new reality. Smaller brands, though, might be in big trouble. For example, Slate’s trucklet looks almost pointless with a starting price near $30,000 as the EV tax credit was vital to its success.

Even larger brands like Tesla and Rivian have leaned on the pure profit they’ve gained by selling regulatory credits. That money likely won’t be coming back anytime soon and that’s because the EPA seems willing to do just about anything the Trump Administration deems reasonable.

A Mission Ignored

It states plainly that its mission is “to protect human health and the environment.” Love them or hate them, electric vehicles are probably better at that than combustion cars. In fact, the EPA itself has an entire page dedicated to debunking the myths so many like to perpetuate surrounding them.

Things like “EVs are worse for the climate than gas cars,” “EVs are unreliable,” and “EVs will collapse the power grid.” Furthermore, J.D. Power is one of many sources that indicate that when all costs are considered, EVs are cheaper to buy, maintain, and own long-term when compared to combustion cars.

No one argues that people should be forced into one type of car. Choice matters. The government shouldn’t force anyone into a specific car or truck. But supporting policies that improve human health and the environment is what the EPA literally says it’s supposed to do.

By supporting Trump’s rollback of strict fuel economy standards and regulations, the agency is doing the exact opposite of its own mission statement. It’s clearing the way for automakers to build more polluting vehicles, burn more fuel, and erase billions in total consumer savings. If the EPA won’t uphold its own mission, it seems that nobody will.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs - likely for the biggest power users - to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast - twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data - and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/09/13/Big_Tech-Electricity_Cutoffs_30745_c0-167-4000-2500_s1200x700.jpg?309b4467e1f3a2a8ff765db9a91ebeb327dbd582,N,,2025-09-13 18:00:39.404137

This package of proposals will bring electricity rates down by improving coordination and efficiency across regional energy markets, reducing interest rates for large-scale transmission projects and redirecting credits from the Cap-and-Invest program to directly reduce the price of electricity for consumers. The new initiatives also support California’s clean energy transition, which requires transmission upgrades and investment to continue advancing.

Below is a statement by Daniel Barad, Western states senior policy manager at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).

“While the Trump administration’s fossil fuel fealty continues to exacerbate the climate crisis, the California legislature affirmed its commitment to a clean energy future. Today's sweeping actions will also make energy more affordable for ratepayers at a time when people are struggling to cope with rising costs of living.

“Lowering energy prices for the long haul requires forward-thinking investments in the electricity grid to benefit all Californians. Improving coordination across western energy markets will create a cleaner, more efficient and more reliable grid for decades to come. This will enable California to export more of its excess solar energy to neighboring states while cutting electricity prices at home.

“The reauthorization and restructuring of Cap-and-Invest's climate credits will lower electricity rates for all Californians and incentivize broader electrification, representing an important new chapter for the program.

“Expanding long range, high voltage transmission is essential to bringing additional clean energy projects online and retiring costly, outdated fossil fuel plants. To date, California has struggled to complete these critical projects on time. Public financing of transmission will support acceleration of these projects at a lower cost, leading to increased savings and improved electricity reliability for California ratepayers.

The Clock is Ticking

The IRS has not yet published granular details on the 2025 EV credit application process, but the general tax filing deadline remains fixed. According to the IRS's official guidance, individuals must use their online accounts to track eligibility and submission requirementsOnline account for individuals | Internal Revenue Service[ 2 ]. This lack of specificity underscores the importance of acting swiftly. Delays in purchasing or filing could result in missed opportunities, particularly as the labor market evolves under AI-driven disruptions and green transition initiatives[ 3 ].

Strategic Purchase Timelines

While exact credit amounts and eligibility criteria for 2025 remain unclear, historical data from the IRA's implementation in 2023 suggests that credits are contingent on factors such as vehicle price, battery sourcing, and domestic assemblyInflation: Why is it rising across the world and will it stay that way[ 4 ].

Broader Economic Considerations

Global inflationary trends, as highlighted by the World Economic Forum, complicate tax planning. Rising prices erode the real value of tax credits over time, making early claiming a prudent strategy. For instance, a $7,500 credit in 2025 may carry less purchasing power in 2026 if inflation persists. Additionally, skill inflation—where demand for specialized labor outpaces supply—could drive up costs for EV-related services, further incentivizing early action.

A Call for Proactive Planning

Businesses and individuals must treat EV tax credits as a dynamic asset rather than a static benefit. This means:

1. Monitoring IRS updates via online accounts to stay ahead of procedural changesOnline account for individuals | Internal Revenue Service[ 2 ].

2. Aligning purchases with projected income levels to maximize credit utilization.

3. Factoring in macroeconomic risks, such as interest rate fluctuations, which could affect borrowing costs for EV financing.

“The Trump administration is denying climate change and torpedoing clean energy projects nationwide. California can step up and continue to grow its global leadership in the fight against climate change,” said Sen. McNerney, D-Pleasanton. “SB 787 will help California meet our clean energy goals while also creating family-supporting manufacturing jobs, accelerating the deployment of affordable clean energy, and advancing economic development goals across every region of the state.”

The state Senate early today approved SB 787 on a 29-8 vote, after the state Assembly voted 53-9 in favor of the bill on Friday evening. SB 787 now goes to the governor’s desk for consideration. If signed into law, SB 787 would take effect March 1, 2027. The legislation is sponsored by the United Auto Workers (UAW).

“UAW is committed to an equitable vision for decarbonizing California’s economy. Part of that vision is growing good union manufacturing jobs in the industries of the future, while accelerating clean energy deployment and bringing down the price of energy for working class Californians,” said Mike Miller, director of UAW Region 6, which represents 100,000 members across various industries in California. “With SB 787, we’ve sponsored a bill championed by Senator McNerney that will go a long way towards reaching these critical goals in an affordable manner.

Conclusion The U.S. climate policy landscape remains a mosaic of federal incentives, state-level innovation, and international uncertainty.","The U.S. climate policy landscape in 2025 is defined by a dual trajectory: aggressive domestic decarbonization efforts and an ambiguous stance on international climate diplomacy, particularly as the COP30 summit in Belém, Brazil, approaches. While federal and state-level initiatives have accelerated clean energy adoption, the absence of explicit U.S. policy statements on COP30 participation or the ""honest dialogue"" framework—implied to address gaps in climate action—has created uncertainty for investors. This analysis explores how evolving policy dynamics could reshape subsidies, renewable infrastructure, and ESG-aligned equities, while identifying sectors poised for disruption or growth.

The Domestic Climate Momentum: A Foundation for Growth

The Biden administration's climate agenda, bolstered by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, has injected over $369 billion into clean energy projects, including tax credits for solar, wind, and electric vehicles (EVs) 2023 Annual Report | All Hands on Deck - U.S. Climate Alliance, [https://usclimatealliance.org/report/2023-annual-report/][ 1 ]. According to a 2024 Rand Corporation report, these incentives have catalyzed private-sector investments, with the U.S. Climate Alliance—encompassing 25 states—projected to meet its 2025 emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels U.S. Climate Policy Explained: What Americans Need to …, [https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/09/us-climate-policy-explained-what-americans-need-to.html][ 2 ]. This momentum has directly fueled demand for renewable infrastructure, with solar and wind capacity expected to grow by 12% and 8%, respectively, in 2025 U.S. Climate Policy Explained: What Americans Need to …, [https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/09/us-climate-policy-explained-what-americans-need-to.html][ 2 ].

However, the uneven pace of state-level action remains a risk. While California and Iowa have emerged as leaders in clean energy adoption, states like Texas continue to prioritize fossil fuels, creating a fragmented market. For investors, this disparity highlights the need to scrutinize regional policy risks and opportunities, particularly in grid modernization and storage technologies.

COP30 and the ""Honest Dialogue"": Implications for Global and Domestic Markets

Though no direct U.S. policy statements on COP30 strategy changes have been identified, the conference's focus on the ""Baku to Belém Roadmap to 1.3T""—aiming to scale international climate finance to $1.3 trillion annually by 2035—could indirectly influence domestic subsidies. If the U.S. shifts toward a more critical ""honest dialogue"" on climate finance, as suggested by COP30's emphasis on transparency and accountability, it may reevaluate its contributions to global funds or demand stricter reporting from recipients. Such a pivot could redirect federal funding toward domestic projects, particularly in disadvantaged communities, amplifying the IRA's existing equity-focused provisions U.S. Climate Policy Explained: What Americans Need to …, [https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/09/us-climate-policy-explained-what-americans-need-to.html][ 2 ].

The logistical challenges facing COP30—such as Brazil's accommodation crisis and infrastructure controversies—also underscore the risks of delayed global climate finance. For U.S. investors, this could mean heightened volatility in ESG-aligned equities, particularly in firms reliant on international partnerships or carbon credit markets.

Sector-Specific Opportunities and Risks

Renewable Infrastructure and EVs: The IRA's tax credits and state-level cap-and-invest programs are likely to sustain growth in solar, wind, and EV manufacturing. However, supply chain bottlenecks and inflationary pressures remain near-term headwinds.

Energy Storage and Grid Modernization: With the U.S. Climate Alliance targeting 100% clean electricity by 2035, investments in battery storage and smart grid technologies are critical. Federal grants under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will play a pivotal role in scaling these solutions U.S. Climate Policy Explained: What Americans Need to …, [https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/09/us-climate-policy-explained-what-americans-need-to.html][ 2 ].

ESG-Linked Equities: A potential ""honest dialogue"" on climate action could lead to stricter ESG reporting standards, pressuring underperforming firms while rewarding those with verifiable decarbonization strategies. Sectors like green hydrogen and carbon capture may see renewed interest if policy clarity emerges post-COP30.

Strategic Recommendations for Investors

Diversify Exposure: Prioritize companies with diversified revenue streams across domestic and international markets to mitigate risks from shifting climate finance priorities.

Monitor Policy Signals: Track state-level climate initiatives, as they often serve as precursors to federal action. For example, California's Advanced Clean Trucks rule has already influenced national EV adoption trends.

Engage in ESG Due Diligence: As COP30 emphasizes accountability, firms with transparent emissions data and robust sustainability frameworks will likely outperform peers.

Conclusion

The U.S. climate policy landscape remains a mosaic of federal incentives, state-level innovation, and international uncertainty. While the absence of direct statements on COP30 strategy complicates near-term forecasts, the underlying momentum in clean energy suggests that long-term investment opportunities outweigh risks. Investors who align with the IRA's market-driven incentives and prepare for potential shifts in global climate finance will be well-positioned to navigate this evolving terrain.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd24f7700bc002.png,N,,2025-09-13 15:59:36.846040
,American Energy,2025-09-13 19:02:04+00:00,spectrumlocalnews.com,EPA wants to end requirement that large polluters report their greenhouse gas emissions,Associated Press,,,,,https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/hudson-valley/politics/2025/09/13/epa-end-requirement-large-polluters-report-greenhouse-gas-emissions,"WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""burdensome"" and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.
""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" Zeldin said in a statement.
Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution.
The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.","WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""burdensome"" and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency's statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.

""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" Zeldin said in a statement.

""It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation's prosperity and hurting American communities,'' he said. ""With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA's statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.''

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.""

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""burdensome"" and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency's statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.

""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" Zeldin said in a statement.

""It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation's prosperity and hurting American communities,'' he said. ""With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA's statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.''

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.""

Expanding Renewable Energy Within a Diverse Generation Mix

Georgia Power is seeking additional renewable resources to continue to build a reliable, diversified generation portfolio through competitive RFP processes, which help maintain flexibility amid changing market conditions and enable the company to continue to provide more carbon-free energy to customers.

The CARES 2025 RFP, also approved in the 2022 IRP Final Order, was recently issued with bids due in August. CARES 2025 RFP bidders were asked to submit utility-scale solar or solar plus storage bids to meet a target of up to 2,000 MW of utility-scale solar including any remaining unfilled utility-scale resources from the CARES 2023 RFP program. These utility-scale solar projects are expected to have commercial operation dates as early as 2028.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs - likely for the biggest power users - to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast - twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data - and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/09/13/Big_Tech-Electricity_Cutoffs_30745_c0-167-4000-2500_s1200x700.jpg?309b4467e1f3a2a8ff765db9a91ebeb327dbd582,N,,2025-09-13 19:01:05.250478

Final Thoughts Solid-state batteries (SSBs) promise to revolutionize the way we power electric vehicles (EVs), consumer electronics, and renewable energy systems.","The most solid alternative to widely used lithium-ion batteries, with the benefits of improved safety, higher energy density, longer lifespan, and faster charging, is almost here.

This promising alternative is solid-state batteries (SSBs), which replace liquid electrolytes with solid electrolytes, thereby eliminating the fire risk and allowing for more compact designs, as well as supporting more charge cycles before degradation.

A recent study1 from the University of California reviewed the technology and found it capable of transforming not just electric cars but also consumer electronics and energy storage. The key to it all is chemistry and engineering.

“By removing the liquid and using stable solid materials instead, we can safely push more electricity into the battery at once, without the risks of overheating or fires.”

– Lead author Cengiz Ozkan, a professor of mechanical engineering at UCR

Unlike the liquid in traditional lithium-ion batteries, which degrade over time, pose fire risk, and limit charging speed, the solid material used in solid-state batteries offers a more stable and safer environment, enabling more efficient charging with fewer safety concerns.

With its superior qualities compared to current lithium-ion batteries, SSBs have been gaining a lot of traction among companies, but so far, the technology remains in the development stage. Not for long now, though.

Real-World Validation: Solid-State Batteries in EVs (QS/VW Demo)

This week, solid-state battery developer QuantumScape (QS +12.43%), along with its business partner PowerCo, made a live demonstration of its energy-dense solid-state lithium-metal batteries powering a vehicle.

PowerCo is the battery business of the Volkswagen Group, one of the world’s leading automobile manufacturers and the largest carmaker in Europe. VW is the owner of brands like Audi, Bentley, CUPRA, Ducati, Lamborghini, Porsche, SEAT, and Škoda. The company also produces light commercial vehicles and heavy commercial vehicles like MAN and Scania, while CARIAD is the software and technology unit for all Volkswagen Group vehicles.

VW Group and PowerCo have been long-term investors in QuantumScape’s solid-state technology and have been testing their prototype cells for years.

Now, for the first time, QuantumScape, PowerCo, and Volkswagen Group have showcased the new tech at IAA Mobility in Munich, one of the world’s largest mobility trade fairs.

Pulling the black sheet off the vehicle, they revealed a modified, fully electric Ducati V21L race motorcycle, which is wholly powered by QSE-5 solid-state cells.

The solid-state cells in the motorcycle were assembled using QuantumScape’s proprietary manufacturing platform (Cobra production process), which allows for faster heat treatment, requires less floor space, and eliminates certain material steps. The first-of-its-kind battery system, meanwhile, is designed by specialists at Audi, specifically for QS SSB cells.

The demonstration marks a big achievement not just for the companies involved but also the electric vehicle (EV) sector, as it was the first time that QuantumScape’s anode-free cells moved from the manufacturing plant into an actual vehicle for the world to see.

“Today we’ve crossed the threshold from possibility to reality.”

– QuantumScape CEO and president Dr. Siva Sivaram

The company’s partnership with PowerCo, he noted, positions QuantumScape to scale its transformative technology to gigawatt-hour (GWh) production, and together they will “help usher in a new era of electrified transportation.”

According to the official announcement, the world’s first live demonstration of QS solid-state lithium-metal batteries powering an EV represents a significant advancement in battery technology and a big step towards commercializing solid-state EVs.

With this tech, the goal is to help advance the EV revolution, which PowerCo CEO Frank Blome says “is the biggest transformation the automotive industry has ever seen.”

With traditional lithium-ion batteries reaching the limits of their possible energy density and safety as portable electronics, electric vehicles, and renewable energy grids become more widespread and demanding, QuantumScape has turned to solid-state batteries to provide greater energy density, faster charging, and enhanced safety to support the transition to a lower-carbon future.

It is currently leading the global race of solid-state battery development, all set to bring its full-fledged solid-state cells to the EV market at scale in the near future.

The recent demonstration of its tech for the world to see actually sent the share prices of the $5 billion market cap company surging. At the time of writing, QS is trading at $8.85, up a whopping 70.52% YTD, though it is still far off its all-time high (ATH) of $132.73 hit late in 2020.

QuantumScape has an EPS (TTM) of -0.91 and a P/E (TTM) of -9.76.

As for the financial outlook, it reported capital expenditures of $8.3 million in Q2 of 2025. The expenses mainly supported facilities and equipment purchases as QuantumScape prepared for higher-volume QSE-5 B1 sample production during this period.

Its GAAP operating expenses were $123.6 million, GAAP net loss was $114.7 million, and adjusted EBITDA loss was $63 million.

The company ended the quarter with $797.5 million in liquidity and extended its guidance for cash runway into 2029.

QuantumScape actually expects to ship its sample cells for testing soon, with commercial production expected to begin in the next couple of years, depending on manufacturing scaling and regulatory approvals.

The B-sample cell called QSE-5 is the first planned commercial product of QuantumScape, which is designed to meet the EV sector’s need for batteries that must excel in five crucial battery performance metrics: cost-effectiveness, energy density, charging speed, safety, and lifespan.

The innovation here is the anode-less cell design, which simplifies manufacturing and lowers material costs while delivering high energy density. Paired with advanced separators, the design gives QuantumScape advantages in safety and efficiency.

It has replaced the organic separator with a nonflammable and noncombustible solid-state separator that provides more safety. Meanwhile, eliminating the graphite/silicon anode host material increases volumetric and gravimetric energy densities.

QuantumScape claims its QS technology has an 844 Wh/L energy density and 10C continuous discharge. Also, the lithium-metal solid-state battery takes just over 12 minutes (12.2 min) to charge from 10-80%.

If the technology is scaled successfully, it could become a standard for next-gen EVs as well as other energy storage solutions. The world premiere of the technology this month marks a big milestone towards that goal, which comes after a series of achievements.

Scaling QSE-5: From Pilot Lines to GWh Manufacturing

In order to bring QSE-5 to the real-world EVs as soon as possible, QuantumScape and PowerCo have been working together for three years now. The partnership combines QuantumScape’s talent with PowerCo’s manufacturing expertise.

Just a few months ago, the two expanded their strategic partnership to accelerate the development of the QSE-5 battery, which is currently being manufactured on QuantumScape’s San Jose pilot line, marking a major step forward in the industrialization of SSB technology.

This was the result of an agreement the two reached last year, under which QuantumScape gave PowerCo a non-exclusive license to mass produce the solid-state technology.

It allows PowerCo to produce up to 5 GWh of QSE-5-based cells annually in addition to the previously agreed 40 GWh with the option to expand up to 80 GWh, including for customers outside the VW Group. The expanded capacity is reportedly enough to equip about one million EVs with solid-state tech per year. The agreement also gives it the right to license certain future QS technology.

As a result, PowerCo will be contributing an additional $131 million over the next two years in exchange for QuantumScape prioritizing QSE-5 cells. The capital will help QS in scaling its manufacturing and making higher-volume prototype cell deliveries to the battery company.

QS first made its 24-layer solid-state cells available to Volkswagen Group for testing, back in Dec. 2022. The following year, it reported surpassing performance targets during testing. Early last year, PowerCo also ran its own endurance tests on QS cells and reported “very encouraging results.”

The Volkswagen Group’s battery arm confirmed that QS’s solid-state battery cells achieved over 1,000 charging cycles with more than 95% capacity retention.

The tests were conducted at PowerCo’s Salzgitter battery labs in Germany. The tests showed that an electric car with a WLTP range of 500-600 km (311-373 miles) outfitted with QS cells can drive about 500,000 kilometers (more than 310,000 miles) without losing range.

With these impressive results, Volkswagen aims to become “a global technology driver in the automotive industry,” but there’s still a long way to go before it can commercialize a marketable solution.

That could take the rest of the decade despite the recent promising showing. That’s because the first electric motorcycle presented at the IAA Mobility was extensively modified with the battery system designed specifically to fit the needs of the solid-state batteries, allowing the Ducati to be equipped with up to 980 QSE-5 cells.

Nevertheless, Volkswagen is committed to seeing this through and will be taking “the next step towards series production,” said Thomas Schmall, Group Board Member for Technology. With Volkswagen’s unified cell concept already suitable for QS cells, the focus will now be on refining and scaling the manufacturing processes.

Schmall noted that with their new in-house unified cell, they “have created the perfect match” as it is “solid state-ready” and enables rapid technology transfer to the company’s vehicles, as soon as the solid-state battery is ready.”

Ready to make its debut in upcoming small electric cars from VW, Cupra, and Skoda, the unified cell has an energy density of around 660 Wh/l and an entirely new design where the cells are installed directly into the pack.

At the event, Volkswagen said that the unified cell will be used in up to 80% of its own EVs in the future. While the cell type will stay the same, the cell chemistry may vary, allowing it to be “equipped with various cell chemistries from LFP and Sodium-Ion to NMC and Solid-State.”

PowerCo and QuantumScape are currently working on integrating solid-state technology into the unit cell and thus into the car. At the same time, a race-ready motorcycle will be developed for testing on the racetrack.

The Global Race Towards SSB Breakthroughs

Volkswagen is clearly making a lot of strides in leading the solid-state battery technology, but it isn’t alone in this endeavor. This week, Mercedes-Benz also announced records of its own.

A ‘lightly modified’ Mercedes EQS packed with a solid-state battery covered a distance of 1,205 km (748.7 miles) on one charge. After travelling from Stuttgart, Germany to Malmo, Sweden, it still had 137 km (85.12 miles) range left.

This new record broke the previous one set by the Vision EQXX by three kilometres. The road testing has been part of the company’s comprehensive validation program for solid-state battery technology under real-world conditions on public roads.

“The solid-state battery is a true game-changer for electric mobility. With the successful long-distance drive of the EQS, we show that this technology delivers not only in the lab but also on the road. Our goal is to bring innovations like this into series production by the end of the decade and offer our customers a new level of range and comfort.”

– Markus Schäfer, Member of the Board of Management of Mercedes‑Benz Group AG, Chief Technology Officer, Development & Procurement

For its battery, Factorial Energy provided the company with lithium-metal cells that are based on Factorial Electrolyte System Technology.

The Porsche-co-owned Croatian company, Rimac, is yet another one to showcase that SSBs can boost power, bring down weight, and solve the range issues that current batteries are facing. The new battery is developed in collaboration with Mitsubishi Chemical Group and ProLogium.

Presented at Munich’s IAA Mobility 2025, Rimac claims that its pouch-cell SSB has a power density of 1,000 watts per pound, weighs 847 pounds, and retains over 95% of its energy at -20 degrees Celsius (-7 F).

Among others working on advancing the tech is Toyota (TM -0.76%), which first revealed the world’s first prototype EV that ran on SSB back in 2020, only to share a couple of years later that a Toyota hybrid is more likely to get an SSB than an EV.

The best-selling automotive brand worldwide is actually expecting to begin the mass production of its first solid-state battery by 2027-2028. Toyota claims that its solid-state battery will deliver a 20% increase in cruising range and could charge from 10-80% in under 10 minutes.

Then there’s Honda (HMC -1.27%), whose solid-state battery pilot production line is already up and running. Located in Sakura, Japan, the automaker has invested about 43 billion yen, or about $290 million, in the facility to support next-generation EV battery development.

Its solid-state cells, according to Honda, could potentially be 25% cheaper, 35% lighter, and 50% smaller than current lithium-ion batteries. The Japanese automaker aims to start mass production of all-solid-state batteries (ASSB) in the second half of this decade.

The $46.8 bln market cap Ford (F -0.68%) is yet another auto manufacturer that is actively developing solid-state batteries. For its SSB efforts, Ford has partnered with startup Solid Power.

The company first invested in Solid Power in 2019 before making an additional equity investment in 2021 to help accelerate the development of technology. In that investment round, BMW Group also participated and became an equal equity owner with Ford.

“Solid-state batteries are showing great promise,” noted the carmaker at the time, adding, “they also can be made on today’s lithium-ion battery lines, allowing Ford to reuse about 70 percent of its capital investment in lithium-ion manufacturing lines.”

Ford EV partner SK On is also researching the technology with a number of Korean universities and institutions. It is developing two types of ASSBs, one with a polymer-oxide composite and the other being sulfide-based, with their commercial prototypes not expected until 2027 and 2029, respectively.

The Chinese technology company Huawei, meanwhile, reported a breakthrough, which is based on a nitrogen-doped sulfide SSB. It can reach energy densities between 400 and 500 Wh/kg, which is two to three times more than that of conventional lithium-ion EV batteries.

The solid-state EV battery from Huawei promises a driving range of up to 3,000 kilometers (1864 miles) on a single charge. Moreover, it has the ability to be fully recharged within five minutes.

Final Thoughts

Solid-state batteries (SSBs) promise to revolutionize the way we power electric vehicles (EVs), consumer electronics, and renewable energy systems. With their higher energy density, faster charging speeds, superior safety profile, and longer lifespans, they make for an ideal successor to lithium-ion technology.

But despite billions of dollars in investments from industry giants, significant hurdles remain. From reducing costs to scaling up manufacturing and ensuring long-term reliability on the road, challenges continue to persist. And that’s why solid-state cells are still largely in the development phase, requiring extensive testing and validation before they can be deployed in the real world at scale.

Latest advancements, however, paint a promising picture. QuantumScape’s live demonstrations, PowerCo’s endurance tests, and record-setting long-distance drives from Mercedes-Benz signal that the industry is finally moving closer to overcoming these barriers.

So, as partnerships grow, pilot production lines expand, and innovative designs continue to emerge, solid-state batteries look ready to become mainstream this decade, unlocking a new era of electric mobility and sustainable energy solutions.

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”

Reno's Sun Day Solar Festival will be held from noon to 4 p.m. on Sept. 21 at Idlewild Park.","Recent months have brought sobering news for people who want to lower their energy bills with solar. The Solar for All program is on the chopping block, and tax credits that made renewable energy more accessible to working families are being repealed. These setbacks affect real people — families who were counting on solar to reduce their electricity bills, small business owners planning to invest in renewable energy and communities working toward energy independence.

But federal policy changes can't squash the power of local action.

We still have renewable energy initiatives and climate goals in municipalities across Nevada. At the state level, utility commissioners and legislators directly impact whether solar owners can earn fair credit for the electricity they generate, and whether community solar projects expand or remain stagnant. These are regulators and legislators whose decisions we can influence. We need to use our power to ensure they prioritize policies that benefit working families and local communities.

This is precisely why events like Reno's Sun Day Solar Festival on Sept. 21 are so important. Part of a nationwide movement held on the fall equinox, Sun Day will bring communities across the country together to demonstrate the power of grassroots solar advocacy. But Sun Day is also deeply local — a reminder that the renewable energy transition happens one neighborhood, one rooftop, one informed voter at a time.

Held in Idlewild Park, Reno’s Sun Day Solar Festival will offer families a chance to see solar technology in action, learn about community solar options and understand how renewable energy can reduce household expenses while supporting local jobs. Kids can participate in hands-on art projects while parents explore practical questions: How much could solar save on monthly utility bills? What financing options exist? How can residents influence local energy policies?

Federal setbacks are discouraging, but they're not the end of the story. The sun rises every day, technology improves continuously and communities that organize effectively can achieve remarkable things. Local action builds resilience that no single election can undo.

Solar energy continues to grow because it makes economic sense. Renewable energy costs have plummeted, making them competitive with traditional sources, even without subsidies. But growth isn't guaranteed to benefit everyone equally. Without thoughtful local policies, the solar energy transition could leave behind the very communities that need economic relief most.

If you're concerned about the future of solar energy — whether for economic, environmental, or energy security reasons — the most powerful response isn't to despair about federal politics. It's to show up locally, learn practically, and engage consistently.

As a solar owner, I’ve seen firsthand how solar can benefit our community. I love my rooftop solar system. With net metering, it supplies enough energy to power my home all year round with the knowledge that I am using pure renewable energy from the sun. And any excess is used by my neighbors so that they are greener, too!

Take action on Sun Day. Solar energy is for everywhere and everyone, and its future is in our hands. I’ll see you in Idlewild Park on Sept. 21.

The mid-tier Cybertruck AWD is the most value-for-money option and most of the Tesla customers are most probably opting for this variant. Cybertruck AWD’s MSRP is $79,990. After the Federal EV Tax Credit deduction of $7,500, the price of the electric pickup truck goes down to $72,490.

Existing Tesla owners can also benefit from transferring their Full Self-Driving (Supervised) package to their new Cybertruck AWD. The Cyberbeast performance variant’s price of $114,990 includes the FSD package.

Tesla Full Self-Driving (Supervised) package costs $8,000 additionally on the AWD Cybertruck. By transferring it from the previous vehicle, you can save another $8K on it if you’re eligible for it (see FSD transfer eligibility criteria below).

Buying the Cybertruck AWD Long Range version also gives you the benefit of a 0% APR (annual percentage rate). With a down payment of $5,000, the Cybertruck on financing costs $1,291 per month (60-month term with Federal Tax Credit and the FSD bundle).

Although Tesla said that the 0% APR offer would end in June, the automaker is still offering it on the Cybertruck AWD.

Tesla also discontinued the RWD variant of the Cybertruck because, after the tax credit and 0% APR offer, the Cybertruck AWD costs just a bit more with an all-wheel drivetrain, additional features, and better specs (comparison here).

Eligibility for FSD Transfer to Cybertruck

To be eligible for this offer, you must:

Have your new Tesla vehicle delivered on or after April 24, 2025, but before the program ends;

Be the legal owner and registrant of the current vehicle with Full Self-Driving (Supervised) purchased outright until Tesla can remove the FSD (Supervised) from the vehicle (about 48 hours after delivery of your new vehicle);

Have the current vehicle and the new vehicle on the same Tesla Account; and

Agree to all additional terms and conditions prior to delivery of the new vehicle

Note: The Full Self-Driving (Supervised) Transfer Program is subject to change or end at any time and cannot be applied retroactively. FSD (Supervised) cannot be transferred from a Model Y Launch Series or a vehicle under an active lease. Business, commercial and pre-owned vehicle orders are not eligible. The transferring vehicle cannot be the subject of a pending cancelation or buyback request or have any delinquent liens or balances. Additional terms and conditions apply and will be provided prior to delivery.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM's just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?"" Silverman said.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “burdensome” and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.
“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Zeldin said in a statement.
Joseph Goffman, who led EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution.
But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to “focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.” The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “burdensome” and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency’s statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Zeldin said in a statement.

“It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities,” he said. “With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA’s statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.”

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.”

By hiding pollution information from the public, “Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality and public health,” Goffman said, calling the plan “yet another example of the Trump administration putting polluters before people’s health.”

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal “a cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don’t know who the polluters are, they can’t do anything to hold them responsible.”

Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers “have depended on this data” for more than 15 years. Public accountability and pushback from investors have led many companies to reduce their climate pollution even before EPA sets stricter standards, Doniger said.

But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to “focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.”

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.

“Following a careful review, EPA proposed that there is no requirement under (the Clean Air Act) to collect GHG emission information from businesses, nor is continuing the ongoing costly data collection useful to fulfill any of the agency’s statutory obligations,” he said.

The EPA will accept public comments on the proposal for more than six weeks after the plan is published in the Federal Register, expected in coming days.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.theintelligencer.net/images/2025/09/12221540/AP25255740590738-750x500.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 12:02:39.383245

The disbanding was first reported by CNN and now NPR has confirmed that Wright wrote a letter on September 3rd to the five hand-picked members of the group, thanking them for their service.

The decision to disband the CWG came as a hearing was held this week in a lawsuit that the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists had filed against the Trump administration. As NPR reported previously, the suit alleges that Energy Secretary Chris Wright ""quietly arranged for five hand-picked skeptics of the effects of climate change"" to compile the government's climate report and violated the law by creating the report in secret with authors ""of only one point of view.""

Wright wrote in the letter that the purpose of the group and its report was ""to catalyze scientific and public debate"" and that the result ""exceeded my expectations."" Wright concluded that with that goal met the CWG could now be dissolved.

The CWG consisted of four scientists and one economist who have all questioned the scientific consensus that climate change poses huge threats to people and ecosystems and who sometimes framed global warming as beneficial.

The report was drafted to support a Trump administration effort to stop regulating climate pollution. The DOE report was cited multiple times by the Environmental Protection Agency in its recent proposal to roll back what's known as the endangerment finding, which is the basis for federal rules regulating climate pollution, including from coal and gas-fired power plants, cars and trucks, and methane from the oil and gas industry.

""The Climate Working Group was convened in secrecy, and it created a clandestine report – in brazen violation of federal law – that is being used to weaken protections against the climate pollution that makes life less safe and less affordable for all Americans,"" Erin Murphy, senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund, wrote in a statement.

The environmental groups want a court to throw out the CWG report, but at a conference in Belgium Friday, Wright praised the document for prompting ""open, back and forth dialogue.""

""That's what we want is to bring people that have different perspectives or disagree to dialogue together and argue it out,"" Wright told the crowd.

For all but a small segment of scientists, the debate Wright wants to prompt has already been settled.

Andrew Dessler, professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, coordinated the response from climate experts. He says unlike the DOE report, climate reports from groups such as the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change feature the work of hundreds of global scientists and require multiple rounds of peer review.

""When well-established scientific conclusions are challenged by arguments that ignore or contradict decades of solid evidence, these debates don't advance our understanding,"" Dessler wrote to NPR in a statement.

Bowing to the bear For automakers, California’s decisions carry immense weight.","California is once again at the center of the nation’s automotive and energy policy debate. With federal electric vehicle tax credits set to expire this September, the state is considering whether to create its own replacement program.

This would not only affect car buyers but could also reshape the national conversation on emissions rules, vehicle affordability, and the balance of power between state and federal regulators.

With its ZEV mandate and aggressive environmental policies, California is pushing automakers, consumers, and policymakers to adapt — whether they’re ready or not.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) released a report on August 19 recommending that the state consider “backfilling” the federal credits with its own point-of-sale rebates, vouchers, or other incentives to keep EV sales moving.

The details remain vague, but the intention is clear: California wants to keep its aggressive zero-emission vehicle goals on track, even as Washington scales back related programs.

Emissions mission

But California has been here before. This is not the first time the state has clashed with the federal government over vehicle regulations — and it likely won’t be the last.

California has a unique history when it comes to vehicle emissions. Decades before the federal government created the Environmental Protection Agency, California was already regulating air quality in response to its smog problem.

When the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, California was granted a waiver that allowed it to set its own stricter emissions standards. Other states were given the option to adopt California’s rules, and some states have done so. Today, 11 states follow California’s lead.

This waiver authority has made California an outsize force in shaping vehicle propulsion. Automakers cannot ignore a market of this size, which means California’s rules often become de facto national standards.

Better red than fed

California’s regulatory independence has not always sat well with Washington. Under different administrations, the federal government has either supported or resisted the state’s authority. During the Obama years, California partnered with the federal government to create a unified fuel economy and emissions program, giving automakers a single set of national rules.

Under the Trump administration, the EPA rolled back certain emissions standards, sparking legal battles with California, which insisted on enforcing its own tougher rules. The state formed alliances with other states and even some automakers to defend its position.

Today, with federal EV tax credits expiring at the end of September and policy focus shifting, California is again stepping into the driver’s seat by proposing its own financial incentives. These ongoing disputes highlight a deeper question: Should environmental and automotive policy be driven by national uniformity or by one state acting as the policy leader?

Forever ZEV?

The discussion over tax credits cannot be separated from California’s ZEV mandate. Under CARB’s plan, automakers must steadily increase the percentage of EVs they sell, with the ultimate goal of phasing out new gasoline-powered vehicle sales by 2035.

This is one of the most ambitious policies in the country, and automakers are scrambling to meet the targets. Some states, such as New York and Massachusetts, have pledged to follow California’s lead, while others remain skeptical. For consumers, this means that vehicle availability will increasingly be shaped by government mandates and not by market demand. Even if gas-powered cars remain popular, automakers will need to balance that demand with regulatory compliance.

Different strokes

The CARB report suggests that any new program would differ from the federal credits in key ways. Instead of tax credits, buyers could receive point-of-sale rebates, allowing them to benefit immediately rather than waiting until tax season.

Incentives may also vary depending on income level, vehicle type, or price, so luxury EVs could receive lower rebates while affordable models get more support.

Additionally, any new program would be tied to yearly funding availability, meaning that if budgets tighten, rebates could shrink or disappear. This approach could make the system more flexible, but it also introduces uncertainty for buyers trying to plan their purchases. In the past, the state of California and other states have run out of money in the EV fund and left buyers with nothing.

Electric slide

The promise of continued incentives may be welcome news for some California drivers, but the reality is more complicated. EVs still come with challenges beyond sticker price. Even with rebates, EVs are often thousands of dollars more expensive than comparable gasoline cars.

California has built more chargers than any other state, yet many regions remain underserved, and home charging is not always an option, particularly for renters.

EVs also tend to depreciate faster than gas vehicles due to rapid advances in technology and concerns about battery life. Insurance rates are higher on electric vehicles as well.

And let’s not forget a major expense: Electricity rates are rising at double the rate of inflation.

One of the key criticisms of EV subsidies is that they often benefit wealthier households. Data from federal programs has shown that a large percentage of credits went to buyers in higher income brackets because these households are more likely to purchase new cars, and EVs remain disproportionately concentrated in the premium market segment.

California may attempt to address this with scaled incentives, but questions remain about whether the system can truly deliver benefits to everyone. Meanwhile, working-class families who rely on affordable used cars may find themselves subsidizing programs that they cannot realistically take advantage of.

Bowing to the bear

For automakers, California’s decisions carry immense weight. The state accounts for nearly 12% of U.S. auto sales, and when you include the other states that follow its rules, the market share becomes impossible to ignore.

Manufacturers that fail to meet California’s requirements face penalties, while those that comply can earn credits to sell or trade. This system has created an uneven playing field, favoring companies with strong EV lineups.

Tesla, for instance, has profited significantly from selling ZEV credits to competitors in the past. If California establishes a robust new rebate system, it could further tilt the market toward EVs, encouraging automakers to prioritize them even more, take greater losses on each vehicle.

Off the market

At its core, this debate is about whether government policy should drive technology adoption or whether the market should dictate the pace.

California argues that aggressive incentives and mandates are necessary to address climate goals and push the auto industry forward. Critics counter that these policies distort the market, forcing automakers and taxpayers to shoulder costs that may not align with consumer demand. They also warn of unintended consequences, such as reduced affordability, lack of charging stations, and strained electrical infrastructure.

California’s proposal to replace expiring federal EV tax credits with state-funded incentives is the latest chapter in a decades-long story of the state asserting its role as the nation’s automotive regulator.

With its ZEV mandate and aggressive environmental policies, California is pushing automakers, consumers, and policymakers to adapt — whether they’re ready or not.

For some wealthier car buyers, this could mean continued financial support when purchasing an EV, but it also raises questions about long-term effectiveness. For taxpayers, it means another debate about where funds should be directed and increased taxes for residents. For the auto industry, it underscores more losses on vehicles that are designed by one state’s demands.

As history shows, when California moves, the rest of the country often feels the impact. The next few months will reveal whether the state can successfully design a program that keeps EV sales going without overburdening its citizens with more increased taxes. But one thing is certain: California still has significant power over the U.S. auto industry.",https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/california-may-defy-trump-with-new-statewide-ev-credits.jpg?id=61596754&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C80%2C0%2C80,N,,2025-09-13 12:00:17.340403

Generally speaking, we expect EV sales to then drop after September 30, because those financial incentives will be gone and people who were thinking of buying an EV soon-ish rushed to buy one before October 1.
Without that manufactured surge of 2nd quarter 2025 EV buyers, perhaps it would take longer for those next-wave buyers to go electric.
The counterargument might be that keeping the tax credit would lead to more EV buyers quarter after quarter, resulting in those word-of-mouth sales coming slightly slower but for a longer period of time and more consistently.
I’m open minded and, for example, don’t know which would actually lead to us getting to 50% EV sales sooner.","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

This is actually a simple one, so I’ll keep it quick. I’m not sure if we’ve ever presented this argument at all, and certainly not as a standalone article. Because it’s a clear sequence of points, I’m going to use a numbered list to get rolling.

In the United States, the $7,500 tax credit for purchasing new electric vehicles and the $4,000 tax credit for purchasing used electric vehicles are about to end.

That is leading to a surge in EV purchases this quarter.

Generally speaking, we expect EV sales to then drop after September 30, because those financial incentives will be gone and people who were thinking of buying an EV soon-ish rushed to buy one before October 1.

However, we’ve also argued for years that the benefits of electric vehicles for EV owners and drivers are significant and will naturally lead to more and more people switching from gas-guzzling cars to electric cars they can conveniently charge at their homes and workplaces.

So, when this surge of Q2 2025 EV buyers get their electric vehicles, love them, and discover how much better they are than their gas cars ever were, they are going to talk to their friends, family, and coworkers about this. (This happens time after time after time with new EV owners.)

As a result, even without the financial subsidies, that wave of new EV owners is going to lead to many more people becoming more aware of EVs, aware of their advantages, and open to getting EVs themselves. That could be a very large portion of the “early majority” that switches from not thinking about or genuinely considering an EV to being intrigued and attracted to going electric (like their friend, family member, or coworker did).

Some percentage of those people are going to then go on to buying an electric car.

Perhaps that last part won’t happen quickly. People need some time to let their thoughts simmer and seep in, and need some time to plan such a big purchase. Also, they may feel like they shouldn’t buy an EV right away since that would be conceding that they could have bought one a month or two earlier and gotten a big discount on it — and people often don’t like to admit that they made a mistake, even with the timing of a purchase. However, creating a surge of EV buyers thanks to the ending of two tax credits should eventually lead to a second and third wave of people influenced by them buying EVs as well.

Without that manufactured surge of 2nd quarter 2025 EV buyers, perhaps it would take longer for those next-wave buyers to go electric. The counterargument might be that keeping the tax credit would lead to more EV buyers quarter after quarter, resulting in those word-of-mouth sales coming slightly slower but for a longer period of time and more consistently. I would say I agree with that. However, there is the possibility that the net benefit of accelerating many EV purchases by even a couple of quarters is stronger since those word-of-mouth sales grow faster at a fairly high scale and then snowball and accelerate the transition. I don’t really have a strong opinion either way on this. I’m open minded and, for example, don’t know which would actually lead to us getting to 50% EV sales sooner. Of course, the best of all worlds would be phasing out the subsidies, benefiting from this surge of sales, and then getting a change of power that brings back the tax credits. Some people will disagree that this boom-&-bust-&-boom cycle would be better, and maybe they are right, but I do think this would accelerate adoption the most.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Chevy-Blazer-EV-SS.jpeg,N,,2025-09-13 12:00:21.357244

""If Americans can be convinced of the real advantages of EVs, there's nowhere to go but up,"" EnergySage concluded.","With federal tax incentives for electric vehicles on the brink of their end date, a popular marketplace detailed myths about the clean automobiles. It noted that the United States is well behind other countries in adopting EVs.

In Norway, 90% of new vehicle sales are electric. That figure is 63% in Sweden and around 30% in the United Kingdom and China, EnergySage reported. The U.S. is at 9%.

""There's a stigma against EVs here that doesn't exist in other places, and a lot of it may stem from fossil fuel propaganda,"" the site stated. It added: ""It's time to debunk these myths once and for all.""

Big Oil, of course, has much to lose if EVs win. EnergySage noted lobbyists spent $7 million in 2021 just to work against a proposal to limit vehicle pollution from new cars, which was not set to begin until 2027.

EnergySage interviewed a trio of automobile industry experts, including Jonny Lieberman, who hosts Driving with Jonny (@drivingwithjonny). He cited people who have no interest in EVs and fear problems, such as fires, in saying, ""Every time one of those is brought up, it just strikes me as propaganda by Chevron, Shell, or the petroleum industry.""

Nikki Gordon-Bloomfield, who created Transport Evolved (@transportevolved), called it a ""perfect storm of political misinformation and fossil fuel lobbying — lobbyists in America are very, very powerful.""

To counter four myths, the independent clean energy platform laid out how EVs are not much more expensive than gas-powered cars. It noted that states, municipalities, utilities, and manufacturers also offer incentives similar to the federal tax credits — $7,500 for a new EV and $4,000 for a used one — that will expire Sept. 30. Home charging and the absence of regular maintenance needs help EV drivers break even after a few years, Gordon-Bloomfield said.

Range anxiety is also mostly a thing of the past, as today's EVs can travel 300-400 miles on one charge. The average American drives 29 miles in one day, according to the Department of Transportation. And ""even in the absolute worst conditions,"" Gordon-Bloomfield said, the charging time to reach 80% battery maxes out at 90 minutes.

EVs are far less prone to catch fire than their counterparts, with 25 blazes per 100,000 EVs sold. The rate is over 60 times higher for gas-powered vehicles, at 1,530 per 100,000. Batteries also last for 10-12 years, State of Charge (@StateOfChargeWithTomMoloughney) host Tom Moloughney told EnergySage, and they can be 80-90% efficient. Internal combustion engines are 20% efficient, with the remaining 80% of dirty energy use producing waste heat and noise, per Lieberman.

Finally, the EV industry is suffering from a crisis of confidence, per the experts. Despite their instant torque, high-tech features, and quiet cabins, electric vehicles are not as trendy as gas-powered vehicles in the eyes of consumers.

""In other countries, cars are sold very differently. In America, cars are very often seen as a status symbol, they're seen as an extension of the self,"" Gordon-Bloomfield said. ""We're buying more on image than we are on actual substance.""

In fact, EVs are converting drivers from India to France to the U.S. And almost all of them say they will never go back.

This pilot is possible through the California Energy Commission’s Demand Side Grid Support (DSGS) program Option 3.

“Silicon Valley Power is committed to exploring innovative solutions that keep our community powered reliably and affordably,” said Nico Procos, Electric Utility Director of Silicon Valley Power. “This pilot demonstrates how collaboration with industry leaders like Nissan and ChargeScape can help to strengthen grid reliability, support local businesses, and benefit our customers.”

Silicon Valley is one of the world’s data center hotspots. The rise of AI has caused a surge in electricity demand coming from data centers, which many power grids were not designed to withstand, a news release noted.

“Forward-thinking utilities such as Silicon Valley Power are seeking innovative ways to quickly increase power supply to meet this new demand, in order to ensure grid reliability for all customers,” the news release added.

At Nissan’s Advanced Technology Center in Silicon Valley, this pilot will use energy stored in EV batteries from Nissan electric vehicles, managed by Fermata Energy’s bidirectional chargers, to export power during periods of grid strain. ChargeScape will coordinate with market partner Leap to discharge power from Nissan vehicles and free up supply for data center loads.

The pilot is part of ChargeScape and Leap’s broader California Virtual Power Plant.

“Through this collaboration, we’re showcasing how electric vehicles can reinforce our communities’ electrical needs and deliver meaningful benefits to drivers,” said Rich Miller, Vice President of Vehicle Connected Services at Nissan U.S.

“AI is a fundamental component of American Dynamism, and our nation’s power grids must quickly adapt to supply data centers with the energy needed to maintain America’s competitive edge in places like Silicon Valley,” said Joseph Vellone, CEO of ChargeScape. “Integrating Nissan’s EV batteries into Silicon Valley Power’s grid is a crucial first step to shoring up long-term grid reliability and rewarding the EV drivers who are part of the solution.”

“At Fermata Energy, we are demonstrating how AI-enabled V2X optimization can transform electric vehicles into intelligent grid resources,” said Hamza Lemsaddek, Chief Operating Officer of Fermata Energy. “By pairing our platform with bidirectional chargers at Nissan’s Innovation Lab, we’re proving that EVs can strengthen data center reliability, support utilities like Silicon Valley Power, and deliver real economic value back to drivers and communities.”

“Our work with ChargeScape has shown the powerful potential of harnessing the EVs already on the road today to tackle urgent grid reliability challenges,” said Jason Michaels, CEO of Leap. “Activating these vehicles as flexible, dispatchable grid resources is a game-changing tool to help utilities manage higher loads and unlock economic growth while putting dollars back in the hands of ratepayers. We look forward to expanding our partnership with ChargeScape to serve more communities.”",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-13 12:00:24.856317

Enter Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), a long-duration storage solution that promises to bridge the gap between intermittent renewables and grid reliability. While MIT's models on

scalability and economic viability remain elusive, industry trends and technological fundamentals suggest that LAES is poised to play a pivotal role in the next phase of energy infrastructure.

The Case for LAES: Clean, Scalable, and Economically Viable

LAES operates by compressing air to a liquid state using excess renewable energy, storing it in insulated tanks, and later expanding the liquid air to drive turbines and generate electricity. Unlike lithium-ion batteries, LAES avoids critical mineral dependencies and offers near-limitless scalability, as it relies on abundant, non-flammable materials like air and salt caverns for storage. According to a 2023 report by BloombergNEF, long-duration storage technologies like LAES are projected to account for 30% of global storage capacity by 2040, driven by their ability to stabilize grids with high renewable penetration.

Economically, LAES is gaining traction due to its declining costs. A 2024 analysis by Wood Mackenzie found that the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) for LAES could fall below $0.05/kWh by 2035, rivaling pumped hydro and outcompeting flow batteries in duration-sensitive applications. This aligns with the growing demand for 10–100-hour storage solutions, which are critical for seasonal balancing and extreme weather resilience.

Decarbonization Scenarios and Strategic Integration

Under aggressive decarbonization scenarios, LAES's role becomes even more pronounced. For instance, the International Energy Agency (IEA) highlights in its 2023 Net Zero Roadmap that long-duration storage will be indispensable for achieving 90% renewable grids by 2040. LAES's ability to leverage existing infrastructure—such as decommissioned gas plants for liquid air storage—further enhances its economic appeal. In the UK, a 50 MW/250 MWh LAES pilot project by Highview Power has already demonstrated 85% round-trip efficiency, validating its technical feasibility.

Market Dynamics and Investment Opportunities

While academic models like MIT's remain absent from public discourse, corporate activity signals strong confidence. Startups like LAES Co. and established players like Siemens Energy are scaling prototypes, with over $2 billion in global investments announced in 2024 alone. Meanwhile, policy tailwinds, including the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act's 10-year tax credits for long-duration storage, are accelerating deployment timelines.

For investors, the key is to identify enablers of LAES adoption. For example,

Corp (ticker: LAES), a semiconductor firm specializing in secure microcontrollers for smart energy systems, underscores the growing intersection of hardware security and grid modernization. Though not directly involved in LAES, SEALSQ's growth—projected to hit $20 million in FY 2025 revenue—reflects the broader demand for technologies that underpin reliable, decentralized energy networks.

Now Is the Time to Position

The convergence of technological maturity, falling costs, and policy support positions LAES as a strategic long-duration storage solution. While MIT's research on its scalability remains unverified, the industry's momentum is undeniable. For forward-looking investors, exposure to LAES—whether through direct infrastructure investments or enablers like secure grid technologies—offers a compelling hedge against the volatility of short-term energy markets.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd264379cbc001.png,N,,2025-09-13 15:59:46.506152

In Detail : The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) is reportedly considering tax incentives for investors in green bonds. The proposal aims to boost private sector participation in renewable energy and climate-focused projects across India.

Green bonds are financial instruments used to fund environmentally sustainable projects, including solar, wind, and energy efficiency initiatives. Incentivizing investment in these bonds could channel more capital into the clean energy sector.

By offering tax benefits, the MNRE intends to make green bonds more attractive to retail and institutional investors alike. This could increase demand and liquidity in the green bond market, supporting project financing.

The move aligns with India’s broader climate and sustainability objectives, including achieving net-zero emissions targets and expanding renewable energy capacity. Mobilizing private capital is critical to meet these ambitious goals.

Industry experts believe that fiscal incentives could accelerate the adoption of green finance mechanisms. By reducing investment costs, such measures can encourage participation from banks, funds, and individual investors in renewable energy projects.

The MNRE’s proposal also signals government commitment to developing a robust ecosystem for green financing. Incentivizing green bonds can complement other initiatives like the Renewable Energy Development Fund and carbon credit markets.

Increasing green bond investments can help fund large-scale solar, wind, and hydro projects. The additional capital inflow will also support distributed renewable energy solutions, energy storage, and decarbonization technologies.

Tax incentives could further enhance investor confidence in long-term sustainable projects.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""burdensome"" and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.
""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" Zeldin said in a statement.
Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution.
The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.","WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""burdensome"" and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency's statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.

""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" Zeldin said in a statement.

""It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation's prosperity and hurting American communities,'' he said. ""With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA's statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.''

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.""

By hiding pollution information from the public, ""Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality and public health,"" Goffman said, calling the plan ""yet another example of the Trump administration putting polluters before people's health.""

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal ""a cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don't know who the polluters are, they can't do anything to hold them responsible.""

Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers ""have depended on this data"" for more than 15 years. Public accountability and pushback from investors have led many companies to reduce their climate pollution even before EPA sets stricter standards, Doniger said.

But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to ""focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.""

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”

""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" Zeldin said in a statement.

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.","WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""burdensome"" and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency's statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.

""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" Zeldin said in a statement.

""It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation's prosperity and hurting American communities,'' he said. ""With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA's statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.''

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.""

By hiding pollution information from the public, ""Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality and public health,"" Goffman said, calling the plan ""yet another example of the Trump administration putting polluters before people's health.""

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal ""a cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don't know who the polluters are, they can't do anything to hold them responsible.""

Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers ""have depended on this data"" for more than 15 years. Public accountability and pushback from investors have led many companies to reduce their climate pollution even before EPA sets stricter standards, Doniger said.

But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to ""focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.""

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.

This focus on sustainable resources is part of the company's strategic initiatives in tyre manufacturing.

The company has reported that, in 2024, around 26% of its materials were derived from these sources, setting the stage for a steady increase by up to three percentage points by 2025.

Ultimately, Continental aims to integrate at least 40% sustainable materials by 2030.

“We’re closing the loop: Continental is ramping up its commitment to a circular economy and mapping out its path for the future,” says Jorge Almeida, Head of Sustainability at Continental Tires.

“Innovative solutions enable us to use more sustainable raw materials, such as synthetic rubber made from used cooking oil or resins based on certified renewable feedstocks originally derived from vegetable oil.”

Enhanced energy efficiency in tyres

Remaking the tyre compound involves resins that improve elasticity, grip and rolling resistance.

Continental chooses circular resins from ISCC PLUS-certified sources, incorporating products from TotalEnergies Cray Valley.

The use of resins from derivatives of vegetable oil and used cooking oil allows the company to maintain high-performance standards with a lower ecological impact.

Adjustment in tyre's elasticity affects energy demand during use, enhancing rolling resistance to reduce fuel consumption in combustion vehicles and increase range in electric vehicles.

Additionally, Continental has pioneered the use of ISCC PLUS-certified TMQ, an antioxidant developed by LANXESS.

This additive includes bio-circular acetone sourced from waste cooking oil, and life cycle assessments highlight a 30% reduction in carbon footprint compared to conventional counterparts.

Implementing mass balance in production

To promote renewable and recycled input scalability, Continental employs a mass balance approach throughout its production process.

This methodology merges fossil, renewable and recycled sources within a unified process, meticulously tracing each component’s contribution along the value chain.

“The mass balance approach enables us to efficiently manage the complexity of the raw materials portfolio and track how these raw materials are used at multiple production sites in a wide range of markets,” explains Matthias Haufe, Head of Material Development and Industrialisation at Continental Tires.

“In this way, we can steadily increase the share of renewable and recycled materials in our tyre production – and transparently document the progress we make.”

Renewable energy is no longer an indulgence from climate change considerations; it has become the rational economic choice.

A little over a decade ago, renewable energy sources were still struggling to find a meaningful place in India’s electricity supply basket on cost considerations. Solar electricity tariffs, just a decade ago, were of the order of US $0.15 (Rs 13) per unit (at an exchange rate of 1 USD = Rs 88), significantly higher than the price of new coal-based electricity.

Policymakers, utilities, and even sections of society questioned whether it made sense for a developing country to lock itself into high-cost electricity when coal was abundantly available to produce electricity at affordable tariffs. That debate now feels distant.

The cost factor

Solar electricity tariffs in India have fallen to USD 0.028 (Rs.2.50) per kWh, with record lows that are not only far less than the price of electricity from new coal-based plants but also undercut even the cheapest existing coal plants.

Wind energy tariffs after witnessing a declining trajectory untill 2017-2018, touching USD 0.028 (Rs 2.43) per kWh before rising close to USD 0.043 (Rs 3.75) per kWh.

This transformation was driven by global technology improvements, economies of scale, and appropriate policy choices—ranging from clear short and long-term targets, aggregation of demand and competitive auctions to facilitating regulatory support.

The resolution of the “cost equation” marked a turning point. As costs declined, however, other concerns came centre-stage.

Land and environmental concerns

During 2016–2024, record low tariffs were discovered for mega-solar parks in Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Karnataka. While solar parks gave a thrust to large-scale renewable energy capacity addition, it gave rise to a number of concerns in view of their large areas.

The stakeholders’ concern is about loss of land — a reliable asset and source of permanent income. Large solar parks involve displacement of communities and an impact on biodiversity and fragile ecosystems.

Decentralised renewable energy, dual-land use renewable energy options such as agrivoltaics which combine agriculture and solar energy generation, floating solar, and building integrated photovoltaics are emerging as promising options to reduce pressure on land.

Rooftop solar which was not progressing at the required pace got a fillip through PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijlee Yojana. A good number of AgriPV pilots’ projects are providing learning for scaling them up.

Variability and round-the-clock power

Coal power plants provide round-the-clock, dispatchable generation, while solar and wind are variable and intermittent. “What happens when the sun doesn’t shine, or the wind doesn’t blow?” became the next critical concern.

Green energy transmission corridors were developed to make full use of renewable energy by facilitating its delivery to demand centres. Hybrid renewable energy projects combining wind and solar, reaping the benefit of their complementarity, offered a better bouquet.

Time-of-day tariffs and enhanced flexibility of conventional power plants assumed importance. And most importantly, energy storage found a place in the discussion in a big way.

This phase underscored an important reality: the transition to clean energy is not merely about clean energy generation, but also its utilisation matching the demand profile across the year.

The energy storage imperative

Today, the dominant concern in the context of integration of renewable energy are energy storage and reliability of supply. Critics argue that without affordable energy storage, India risks overbuilding renewable capacity that cannot be fully utilised.

Just as solar costs were once thought to be prohibitively high but fell rapidly with scale, energy storage is also expected to follow a downward cost trajectory as it finds use for various applications with recognition of the value proposition BESS offers, new technologies mature, and innovation accelerates.

Global battery prices are declining faster than anticipated. Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) costs in India have declined 80 percent since 2015. The standalone BESS prices fell significantly from US $ 0.11 (Rs. 10.18) per kWh in 2022 to US $ 0.025-0.05 (Rs. 2.21 – 4.41) per kWh in 2024.

The viability gap funding announced by the government in June for developing 30 GWh of BESS capacity is expected to address the affordability concerns.

Policy Circle is now on Telegram. Click here to join the channel.

Domestic manufacturing is being incentivised in the country through the Production Linked Incentive for advanced chemistry cell battery storage and high efficiency solar photovoltaic modules. Cost-effective long-duration energy storage is the next frontier.

Beyond technology: People and transition

Alongside cost reduction and technological advancement one of the most critical concerns remains to be addressed: the human dimension of the energy transition. As coal-dependent regions confront the reality of declining coal production, concerns of jobs, livelihoods, and regional development loom large.

A “just transition” approach—ensuring that workers, communities, and vulnerable segments are not left behind—has begun to shape policy and public discourse. This shift signals the recognition that technology alone cannot drive the change; it must be embedded in a people-centric framework.

The turnaround and the outlook

India’s renewable energy journey began in the 1980s with early wind projects in Tamil Nadu. The small-scale solar applications were supported by the then Department of Non-Conventional Energy Sources. The real turning point came with the launch of the National Solar Mission in 2010, which brought solar to the centre stage and became the heart of India’s energy development and transition strategy.

From these modest beginnings, the country has now built one of the world’s largest renewable energy markets, with solar leading the way.

The scale has, in a matter of 15 years, dramatically tilted towards solar power as compared to coal-based power. Solar power had to be bundled with thermal power to make it an attractive proposition for the DISCOMs. This is no longer the case. The tariff of electricity from ground-mounted solar power plants and wind is of the order of US $ 0.028 (Rs. 2.50) per kWh and US $ 0.039 (Rs. 3.50) per kWh, respectively.

The cost of electricity from hybrid wind-solar plants in recent years has ranged from US $0.038-0.039 (Rs. 3.35 to Rs. 3.45) per kWh. A combination of solar-wind hybrid (to be used alternatively when either sun or wind are not available) along with storage is making round the clock renewable energy achievable at attractive tariffs – US $ 0.048 and 0.056 (Rs. 4.00 to 5.00) per kWh during 2023-2025.

The falling costs of storage, along with low-cost hybrid plants, make renewable electricity not only cheaper but also more reliable—helping India’s energy transition by reducing dependence on fossil fuels while ensuring round-the-clock power.

Looking ahead, solar power with longer-duration energy storage is expected to become cost-effective, emerging as an economically viable option for consumers as well as energy distribution companies. Skilling and re-skilling of workforce which is directly or indirectly dependent/ engaged in coal mining and transportation is a prerequisite for effective clean energy transition.

According to a report from Electrek, Tesla’s sales dipped as rivals like GM and Ford gained ground, with the company’s share slipping below 50% for the first time in recent memory. This trend reflects broader industry maturation, where Tesla’s once-novel appeal faces headwinds from improved offerings by competitors, including better range, faster charging, and more affordable entry points.

Posts on X (formerly Twitter) from industry observers echoed this sentiment, with users like energy analyst Jesse Jenkins highlighting August’s plug-in vehicle sales hitting 145,000 units and battery EVs achieving an 8.6% share—figures that debunk narratives of stalled EV growth. Such social media buzz underscores real-time enthusiasm, though it also reveals concerns about sustainability without ongoing subsidies.

Policy Shadows Looming Over Future Growth

The August rush appears tied directly to the impending expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act, set to phase out by month’s end as the incoming Trump administration signals a pullback on EV support. A piece in The Washington Post warns that this policy shift could trigger a sharp sales decline in the fourth quarter, with analysts forecasting a potential 20% drop as affordability takes a hit for middle-income buyers.

Beyond incentives, infrastructure remains a critical bottleneck. The International Energy Agency’s Global EV Outlook 2025 notes that while charging networks have expanded, rural and urban disparities persist, potentially capping long-term adoption. Recent web searches confirm global contrasts: worldwide EV sales grew 25% through August, per Startup News, but North America’s 6% increase lags behind Asia’s boom, where China alone saw NEV market share exceed 50%.

Market Diversification and Consumer Shifts

Drilling deeper, the sales data from Argonne National Laboratory’s monthly updates illustrates a maturing ecosystem, with plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and battery EVs (BEVs) both contributing to the record. Hybrids, in particular, surged as a bridge technology for range-anxious consumers, comprising a growing portion of electrified sales. Cox Automotive’s Q1 2025 report, which tracked a 10% year-over-year EV growth, set the stage for August’s peak, though it also flagged Tesla’s early declines.

Industry insiders whisper of strategic pivots ahead. Automakers are ramping up domestic production to qualify for any remaining incentives, while investing in battery tech to reduce costs. A IEA analysis projects that by 2030, EVs could claim 30% of U.S. sales if infrastructure investments accelerate, but regulatory rollbacks pose risks.

Sustainability Challenges and Long-Term Outlook

Environmental advocates celebrate August’s figures as a win for emissions reduction, yet supply-chain vulnerabilities loom. Rare-earth mineral dependencies and recycling hurdles could inflate prices, as noted in Virta’s global market overview. On X, posts from accounts like The Electric Viking amplify optimism, sharing videos of record-smashing sales, but they also caution against overreliance on Tesla’s ecosystem.

As the dust settles, August 2025 stands as a high-water mark, but the road ahead demands innovation beyond incentives. Automakers must navigate political winds, consumer skepticism, and technological leaps to sustain momentum. For now, the numbers speak volumes: EVs are no longer niche—they’re mainstream, if precariously so.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-212d8ec6-7fbd-47c3-91e8-66777baa6b2c.jpeg,N,,2025-09-13 12:02:54.690330

The Oradea project is Econergy's fourth solar installation to go live in Romania. Together, the company's operational and ready-to-connect projects in the country now total 447 megawatts, the news outlet reported.

This momentum means more renewable power for households and businesses. Large-scale solar farms like Oradea can lower energy costs by bringing affordable electricity to the grid. They can also strengthen grid stability, reduce reliance on imported fuels, and support job growth in regions where new energy infrastructure is being built.

Econergy plans to add a 68-megawatt battery energy storage system to the Oradea site. The system will make the project more valuable by storing excess power, helping balance the grid, and optimizing electricity sales. Phoenix Holdings partnered with Econergy on the project and has invested more than 225 million euros in renewable projects in Romania and Poland.

Eyal Podhorzer, CEO of Econergy, said: ""This achievement underscores our ability to deliver large-scale renewable projects while advancing our strategy of integrating storage solutions to maximize value for our stakeholders.""

Solar farms like Oradea are part of a wider trend reshaping energy worldwide. Similar projects in community solar and rooftop solar are giving people more ways to save money and contribute to a cleaner environment.

Installing solar panels is the ultimate home energy hack because it can bring your cost of energy down to at or near $0. EnergySage provides a free service that makes it easy to compare quotes from vetted local installers and save up to $10,000 on solar installations.

Going solar also makes using other money-saving electric appliances, like heat pumps, even cheaper to run. Mitsubishi can help consumers find the right affordable heat pump for their home.

Other projects are reshaping energy in similar ways. In Minnesota, Xcel Energy is turning a former coal plant site into the Sherco solar and storage facility, set to become the largest in the Upper Midwest by 2026.

In California, Avangrid's Camino Solar will power about 14,000 homes, while Lehigh University in Pennsylvania has added a solar thermal concentrator to supply clean energy on campus and support student research.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/uHLpGGOWAO5epECJqkGIWg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/513981ea74abfa3e59299b6a309d92be,N,,2025-09-13 13:59:58.005212

This flies in the face of the EPA's core mission—to protect the environment and public health.""
""The proposal is wildly unpopular with even industry groups speaking against it because they know the value of having this emissions data available,"" he noted.","Citing US President Donald Trump's anti-climate executive actions, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Friday unveiled a proposal to end a program that requires power plants, refineries, landfills, and more to report their emissions.

While Zeldin claimed that ""the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" experts and climate advocates emphasized the importance of the data collection, which began in 2010.

""President Trump promised Americans would have the cleanest air on Earth, but once again, Trump's EPA is taking actions that move us further from that goal,"" Joseph Goffman, who led the EPA Office of Air and Radiation during the Biden administration, said in a statement from the Environmental Protection Network, a group for former agency staff.

""Cutting the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses, and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health,"" he explained.

As The New York Times reported:

For the past 15 years, the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program has collected data from about 8,000 of the country's largest industrial facilities. That information has helped guide numerous decisions on federal policy and has been shared with the United Nations, which has required developed countries to submit tallies of their emissions.

In addition, private companies often rely on the program's data to demonstrate to investors that their efforts to cut emissions are working. And communities often use it to determine whether local facilities are releasing air pollution that threatens public health.

""By hiding this information from the public, Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality, and public health,"" Goffman said. ""It's a further addition to the deliberate blockade against future action on climate change—and yet another example of the administration putting polluters before people's health.""

Sierra Club's director of climate policy and advocacy, Patrick Drupp, stressed Friday that ""EPA cannot avoid the climate crisis by simply burying its head in the sand as it baselessly cuts off its main source of greenhouse gas emissions data.""

""The agency has provided no defensible reason to cancel the program; this is nothing more than EPA's latest action to deny the reality of climate change and do everything it can to put the fossil fuel industry and corporate polluters before people,"" he added. ""The Sierra Club will oppose this proposal every step of the way.”

Margie Alt, director of the Climate Action Campaign, similarly said that ""the Trump administration's latest pro-polluter move to eliminate the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is just another brazen step in their Polluters First agenda.""

Responding to the administration's claim that the proposal would save businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs, Alt said that ""under the guise of saving Americans money, this is an attempt on the part of Trump, Lee Zeldin, and their polluter buddies to hide the ball and avoid responsibility for the deadly, dangerous, and expensive pollution they produce.""

""If they succeed, the nation's biggest polluters will spew climate-wrecking pollution without accountability,"" she warned. ""The idea that tracking pollution does 'nothing to improve air quality' is absurd,"" she added. ""If you don't measure it, you can't manage it. Hiding information and allowing fossil fuel companies to avoid accountability are the true goals of this rule.""

BlueGreen Alliance executive director Jason Walsh declared that ""the Trump administration continues to prove it does not care about the American people and their basic right to breathe clean air. This flies in the face of the EPA's core mission—to protect the environment and public health.""

""The proposal is wildly unpopular with even industry groups speaking against it because they know the value of having this emissions data available,"" he noted. ""Everybody in this country deserves to know the air quality in their community and how their lives can be affected when they live near high-emitting facilities.""

“Knowledge is power and—in this case—health,"" he concluded. ""The administration shouldn't be keeping people in the dark about the air they and their neighbors are breathing.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=56530290&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C407%2C0%2C407,N,,2025-09-13 12:02:49.834565

The disbanding was first reported by CNN and now NPR has confirmed that Wright wrote a letter on September 3rd to the five hand-picked members of the group, thanking them for their service.

The decision to disband the CWG came as a hearing was held this week in a lawsuit that the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists had filed against the Trump administration. As NPR reported previously, the suit alleges that Energy Secretary Chris Wright ""quietly arranged for five hand-picked skeptics of the effects of climate change"" to compile the government's climate report and violated the law by creating the report in secret with authors ""of only one point of view.""

Wright wrote in the letter that the purpose of the group and its report was ""to catalyze scientific and public debate"" and that the result ""exceeded my expectations."" Wright concluded that with that goal met the CWG could now be dissolved.

The CWG consisted of four scientists and one economist who have all questioned the scientific consensus that climate change poses huge threats to people and ecosystems and who sometimes framed global warming as beneficial.

The report was drafted to support a Trump administration effort to stop regulating climate pollution. The DOE report was cited multiple times by the Environmental Protection Agency in its recent proposal to roll back what's known as the endangerment finding, which is the basis for federal rules regulating climate pollution, including from coal and gas-fired power plants, cars and trucks, and methane from the oil and gas industry.

""The Climate Working Group was convened in secrecy, and it created a clandestine report – in brazen violation of federal law – that is being used to weaken protections against the climate pollution that makes life less safe and less affordable for all Americans,"" Erin Murphy, senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund, wrote in a statement.

The environmental groups want a court to throw out the CWG report, but at a conference in Belgium Friday, Wright praised the document for prompting ""open, back and forth dialogue.""

""That's what we want is to bring people that have different perspectives or disagree to dialogue together and argue it out,"" Wright told the crowd.

For all but a small segment of scientists, the debate Wright wants to prompt has already been settled.

Andrew Dessler, professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, coordinated the response from climate experts. He says unlike the DOE report, climate reports from groups such as the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change feature the work of hundreds of global scientists and require multiple rounds of peer review.

""When well-established scientific conclusions are challenged by arguments that ignore or contradict decades of solid evidence, these debates don't advance our understanding,"" Dessler wrote to NPR in a statement. ""Instead, they can muddy the waters and distract from more productive scientific inquiry.""

Dessler says the CWG report mimics the doubt-sowing strategy the tobacco industry used to prevent regulation of its harmful products.

While the Energy Department's CWG is now disbanded, the case continues over whether its report will be included in EPA's decision on regulating climate pollution. The judge has scheduled a hearing on September 23rd for the Trump administration's motion to dismiss part of the case.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

""We're going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,"" said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. ""Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.""

Data centers are threatening grids

That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs—likely for the biggest power users—to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast—twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data—and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

""Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,"" said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation's largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM's just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

""This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM's footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,"" the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a ""bring your own generation"" requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

""And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?"" Silverman said. ""Or is there a better way to do it?""

Although the time has passed for newly contracted solar energy systems to be fully installed by 2025, there are still multiple ways to maximize savings and reduce home energy costs through Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg before this fall’s enrollment deadline for the program.

Launched this summer by a local partnership consisting of the City of Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, the Town of Davidson, and Centralina Regional Council, the limited-time campaign offers benefits uniquely geared to making renewable energy for homes, businesses and nonprofits more affordable locally.

Among the multiple reasons going solar via Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg can provide savings and resiliency:

Group Discount of up to 20%: Group-purchasing discounts have already reached a new Second Tier of progressively lower pricing.

Free and Trusted Evaluations: Those who sign up without obligation by Oct. 31 get a no-cost custom proposal as well as qualify for group discount pricing. All evaluations include projected bill savings over the next 25 years and financial analyses that include payback times and return on investment.

System-Size Discounts: Additional discounts are available for larger system sizes of up to 30 cents per watt.

Community Support: Via Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg, property owners are not “going it alone.” Campaign organizers bring over a decade of solar experience to help ensure projects meet expectations.

Duke PowerPair Program: Offering up to $9,000 for qualifying solar and battery systems for a limited time. Additional incentives from Duke are also projected to be at capacity within the next 30 days.

Duke Bridge Rate: A hybrid net metering rate plan will be available only through 2027.

Under the Solarize model, which has been successfully offered through governmental involvement in other North Carolina communities this decade, the more property owners who buy together, the greater the savings for everyone.

As a community-based group-purchasing program, Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg utilizes a “tiered” pricing structure. The more participants who buy a system, the lower the price for all. Those who act early may be eligible to receive a rebate from Renu Energy Solutions (the locally headquartered installer selected through vetting) at the end of the campaign. This structure makes the final price per watt the same for every buyer.

So far, more than 225 property owners have signed up to receive a solar energy system proposal through the campaign. Participants who signed contracts to make a purchase have already combined to buy 244.8 kW in system power, which equals 507,952 lbs. of CO2 avoided locally.

Batteries have also been added by many of these homeowners to complement their new systems. A total of 364.5 kWh in battery storage has been produced through the campaign.

The overall no-obligation signup deadline for Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg remains Oct. 31. Following this, the deadline for residential contracts to be signed is Dec. 31, 2025. (Property owners considering a system for their business or nonprofit organization through the program have later deadlines due to the time needed to consider a larger-scale system.)",https://mecktimes.com/files/2023/08/meckfavicon.webp,N,,2025-09-13 11:02:40.074774

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”

First launched in 2002, the Sierra Denali redefined expectations for full-size pickups. With a 6.0-liter Vortec V8 engine, opulent leather interior, woodgrain accents, and the groundbreaking Quadrasteer four-wheel steering, it proved that trucks could deliver both muscle and refinement. The example used for comparison, preserved at the GM Heritage Center, remains a pristine reminder of the nameplate’s original promise.

Fast-forward to 2026, and the Sierra EV Denali carries that legacy into the electric age. Equipped with up to 760 horsepower and 785 lb-ft of torque in Max Power mode, the truck boasts a GM-estimated 478-mile driving range on a full charge. Advanced features like 4-Wheel Steer with CrabWalk, Super Cruise hands-free driver assistance, and cutting-edge infotainment mark a new era of capability and convenience.

“The influence of the original Denali pickup is immediately visible in the 2026 model,” noted GM News editor Bob Sorokanich. “Where the vintage truck offered Quadrasteer for nimble handling, today’s Sierra EV Denali takes it further with CrabWalk and autonomy-ready technology.”

The side-by-side test drive, led by GM’s Shad Balch, underscored just how far Denali luxury has come—from pioneering V8-powered toughness to all-electric sophistication designed for modern drivers.

According to an issue brief from the Bipartisan Policy Center, the SPEED Act proposes significant changes to NEPA’s key provisions.
He also pointed to actions by the Trump and Biden administrations that leveraged the existing permitting process to favor certain types of energy projects.
“One top-line message against the SPEED Act is that it’s a permitting process written by and for fossil fuel polluters and extractive industries,” Golden said.
On his first day in office, Trump issued a memorandum halting approvals, permits, leases and loans for both offshore and onshore wind projects.","The One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this summer underscored deep partisan divides on energy and the environment, with critics decrying it as a handout to fossil fuel interests while President Donald Trump’s supporters heralded it for securing America’s “energy dominance.”

Given the tumult over the bill’s passage, one could be forgiven for assuming that congressional Democrats would balk at working with their Republican colleagues on the GOP’s upcoming priorities.

But that’s exactly what some legislators—and key voices in the energy industry—are trying to do following the summer recess.

Their focus in the coming weeks is permitting reform, a variety of proposals to speed up the process of approving and building major infrastructure and energy projects across the nation, such as wind and solar farms, power transmission lines and fossil fuel pipelines.

The process for those approvals can stretch on for years, significantly delaying the rollout of new energy projects. According to a 2024 fact sheet from the American Clean Power Association (ACP), it currently takes an average of 4.5 years for an energy project to get the required permits needed to build, and 7.5 years for a transmission project.

Those delays impact green energy and fossil fuel industries alike, according to Xan Fishman, vice president of the Energy Program at the Bipartisan Policy Center.

“The process is neither good for businesses in the economy, nor is it good for the environment, because in order to achieve good environmental outcomes, we actually do need to build,” Fishman said.

Frank Maisano, senior principal at the lobbying firm Bracewell, echoed that sentiment.

“Whether it’s a gas pipeline, whether it’s a natural gas combined cycle plant, whether it’s a transmission line, whether it’s a solar or a wind project, it’s absurd that you should have to spend that long trying to get a permit so that you can produce power for people at a time when we need every electron we can find or get,” Maisano said.

Now, as permitting reform comes back on the agenda, an alliance of strange bedfellows is pushing more lawmakers to tackle the issue.

When Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and then-Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.V.) introduced the Energy Permitting Reform Act in 2024, both ACP and the American Petroleum Institute (API)—trade associations for the renewable industry and oil and gas industry, respectively—endorsed the bill as a welcome step toward meeting the growing demand for electricity and strengthening American energy security.

That bill never received a floor vote in the Senate, but there now appears to be renewed interest from the energy sector and legislators to try again.

The most significant bipartisan effort currently before Congress is the SPEED Act, introduced by Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, and committee member Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine).

The bill would make significant changes to how the federal government conducts environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

That 1970 law has been described as the bedrock of environmental law. It requires federal agencies to review and disclose the environmental impacts of major projects before permitting or funding them, providing both the government and the public the chance to examine the knock-on effects those projects could have.

According to an issue brief from the Bipartisan Policy Center, the SPEED Act proposes significant changes to NEPA’s key provisions. Among those measures, the bill limits what projects would be subject to NEPA review and the scope of those reviews; raises the bar for courts to overturn the decisions of federal agencies overseeing those reviews; and establishes a 150-day deadline to sue federal agencies over their permitting decisions—a drastic reduction from the current 6-year statute of limitations.

In a committee hearing for the bill on Wednesday, Westerman said the changes the bill proposes would bring needed reform and certainty to the permitting process. He also pointed to actions by the Trump and Biden administrations that leveraged the existing permitting process to favor certain types of energy projects.

The Trump administration has taken steps to streamline permitting for fossil fuel projects in recent months, while introducing obstacles for the siting and permitting of renewable energy projects.

Under the Biden administration, the opposite was true—officials introduced rules meant to speed up the process for renewables while adding additional hurdles for projects expected to harm the climate.

“This is an opportunity for Congress to exert their Article One authority and to create a system that doesn’t change when an administration changes,” Westerman said. “A system that’s fair, a system that allows access for all projects, and a system that’s blind to the project that is being proposed.”

Golden emphasized that improvements to NEPA would benefit all forms of energy development, including renewables.

“One top-line message against the SPEED Act is that it’s a permitting process written by and for fossil fuel polluters and extractive industries,” Golden said. “This ignores the reality that wind, solar and other clean energy projects face significant delays because of NEPA litigation.

“These problems with NEPA can cut both ways, and so too should be the solutions.”

But while that message resonated with Republicans and some Democrats in the hearing, other members—including Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.)—cast doubt on whether the benefits of any permitting reform bill, even a technology-neutral one, would be felt equally across the energy sector.

“I am personally deeply skeptical that we can negotiate in good faith right now to try to accelerate permitting of any kind, while there is an ongoing bad faith attack against solar and wind,” Levin said during the hearing.

That sentiment was echoed by more of Levin’s colleagues, including Rep. Emily Randall (D-Wash.), Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-Md.), and Rep. Julia Brownley (D-Calif.), all of whom referenced the administration’s attacks on renewables as obstacles to their support for the bill.

On his first day in office, Trump issued a memorandum halting approvals, permits, leases and loans for both offshore and onshore wind projects. The administration has also taken the unusual move to issue stop-work orders for some offshore wind projects that were already fully permitted and under construction.

To some critics such as Marlyn Twitchell, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center, those moves could mean that fossil fuel interests disproportionately benefit from a streamlined permitting process the SPEED Act would create, while renewables see few tangible benefits.

“Given the administration’s war on renewable energy projects, this bill would do little but SPEED the climate crisis and the fires, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and oppressive heat that have already killed so many Americans and so severely damaged our homes, public lands, and economy,” Twitchell said in a Wednesday press release.

Other environmental groups have also voiced their opposition to the bill, arguing that the act’s provisions don’t address the primary drivers of permitting delays.

“Often missing in the conversation around NEPA is the empirical research that’s been done, and there’s a lot of that out there,” said Jarryd Page, a staff attorney at the Environmental Law Institute.

That research points to resource constraints as one of the biggest roadblocks, Page said—like not having enough staff to conduct the environmental reviews, or staff lacking adequate experience and technical know-how.

Stephen Schima, senior legislative counsel at environmental law nonprofit Earthjustice, said existing legislation from the past several years had already begun to address those needs.

“We had the Inflation Reduction Act—for the first time in history, Congress actually funded the agencies themselves to the tune of a billion dollars to actually do these reviews [and] do them more quickly,” Schima said. “They made statutory changes in the Fiscal Responsibility Act that established deadlines for environmental assessments, environmental impact statements.”

However, he said that recent actions by the Trump administration and congressional Republicans threatened to undo that progress by cutting the federal workforce and clawing back the additional resources that had been provided.

“There’s been this litany of changes, and what we’ve seen on the Republican side … in the passage of [the One Big Beautiful Bill Act] is revoking that funding, rescinding the funding that was in the IRA that was actually leading to results,” Schima said.

“What we’ve seen … is a decimation of the staff and capacity at the federal agencies themselves. We need to get the staff back. We need people in the federal government to be doing these reviews and to help shepherd projects through the permitting process.”

Inside Climate News asked Westerman on Wednesday whether he would consider incorporating additional funding and staffing for federal agencies to conduct environmental reviews as part of the SPEED Act.

Westerman suggested that technological advances might allow agencies to make further cuts, instead.

“I’m having people from AI companies tell me we can cut down NEPA permitting just using AI,” he said. “So technology may get us to the point where we don’t even need as many people.”

Even if Westerman and Golden’s bill fails to garner enough support, the appetite for a bipartisan deal on permitting is unlikely to end there.

Turn Forward, a nonprofit advocating for offshore wind energy, hasn’t taken a public stance on the SPEED Act and said that achieving a bipartisan solution on permitting reform is “going to be a lift,” but executive director Hillary Bright said that she was “optimistic” about the odds of success.

And in the Senate, Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.V.) and Ranking Member Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) are in the early stages of discussing another possible bipartisan bill, according to a staffer familiar with the matter.

The staffer said that those efforts won’t be able to move forward without the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, but news of the collaboration prompted a positive response from key industry voices.

“It doesn’t surprise me at all,” said Maisano.

“If there’s a guy who … can rally climate activists, that can bring people together and work with the Shelley Moore Capitos and the Lisa Murkowskis of the world … I would never put it past Senator Whitehouse to be in that position to be a broker of hard issues and complex issues to make solutions possible.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2193737930-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 06:58:17.759309

""If we can't say what a facility is doing, we can't hold that facility accountable,"" she added, warning that the lack of verifiable emissions data would undermine action at local, state, national, and international levels.
""These data inform our national GHG inventory, support international emissions reporting obligations, and serve as the de facto standard for many companies' climate disclosures in the absence of industry-wide methodologies.""","The United States moved on Friday to dismantle a ""burdensome"" federal programme that tracks greenhouse gas emissions across the US economy, the latest step by President Donald Trump's administration to undercut efforts against climate change.

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), launched in 2010, covers more than 8,000 facilities that together account for 85-90 percent of the country's planet-warming pollution.

The programme requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty, which allows officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

Experts say the reporting holds companies publicly accountable for their emissions. Since the GHGRP began, the US industry has collectively reported a 20 percent drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

Trump, who received hundreds of millions of dollars from the fossil fuel industry during his 2024 election campaign, has heavily promoted new oil, gas and coal extraction while moving to suppress competition from solar and wind.

""Alongside President Trump, EPA continues to live up to the promise of unleashing energy dominance that powers the American Dream,"" Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said in announcing the decision, which will undergo a public comment period before being finalised.

""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality.""

A move that could 'blind Americans' to risks of pollution

Although the programme was established through an act of Congress, the EPA argued it is not legally obliged to continue collecting the data, with the sole exception of methane emissions.

But experts say dropping the requirement, as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in US history, risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere would make it tougher to fight climate change.

A climate law passed in 2022 under former Democratic president Joe Biden established a methane fee on oil and gas operations, but Republicans' recently enacted ""Big Beautiful Bill"" requires such reporting only from 2034. Accordingly, the EPA under Zeldin says it will suspend all data collection until then.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.”

By hiding pollution information from the public, “Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality and public health,” Goffman said, calling the plan ""yet another example of the Trump administration putting polluters before people’s health.”

""Again and again, this administration is trying to hide the data to hide the harms,"" Julie McNamara of the Union of Concerned Scientists told AFP.

""If we can't say what a facility is doing, we can't hold that facility accountable,"" she added, warning that the lack of verifiable emissions data would undermine action at local, state, national, and international levels.

Democrats had anticipated the move after they obtained documents in the spring that indicated the change was planned.

""For the past 15 years, the GHGRP has collected facility-level emissions data from over 8,000 facilities, supplying vital information to policymakers, scientists, investors, and the public,"" Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said in May.

""These data inform our national GHG inventory, support international emissions reporting obligations, and serve as the de facto standard for many companies' climate disclosures in the absence of industry-wide methodologies.""

He added that the data had allowed US industry to market itself as cleaner than foreign competitors, and ending the programme would hand an advantage to China.

The EPA will accept public comments on the proposal for more than six weeks after the plan is published in the Federal Register, expected in coming days.

If you can't afford to make larger upgrades like this or if you live in a state that isn't currently distributing IRA funds, you can still take advantage of other solutions, like plug-in induction burners, which start at around $50. Portable induction burners are also a great solution for renters.

Several state-based rebate programs are available as well. For instance, North Carolina and Georgia residents can take advantage of their states' rebate programs right now, while Tennessee, Florida, and South Carolina are in the process of launching their programs, according to the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

""If you've been considering an energy upgrade — whether it's installing an induction cooktop or an entire solar system — don't wait,"" the organization urges.

“We’ve invented a new carbon molecule that will extend the life of the battery by 30%,” Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said at the University of Texas at Austin’s Energy Symposium on Friday. It’s a “revolutionary step change in battery performance.”

The invention is being tested by several EV manufacturers, Woods said. Used on the anode side of the battery, the synthetic graphite allows for faster charging, a longer lifespan and longer range for electric vehicles. Exxon this week announced the acquisition of several production assets from Chicago-based Superior Graphite, which will enable the company to scale-up manufacturing, with a goal of commercial production by 2029.

The Texas oil giant doesn’t intend to become a battery maker but it plans to use its refineries, chemical plants and laboratories to produce some of the materials to be used in the energy transition. It also has plans to extract lithium, a major battery component.

“We don’t do wind and solar, we have no issues with wind and solar, but we don’t have capability in that space,” Woods said. “But we do have capability of transforming molecules and there are enormous opportunities in that space to use hydrogen and carbon molecules to meet the growing demand.”

Exxon has long been a player in the vehicle-battery space. The company invented the lithium-ion battery in the 1970s and created the plastic film for the first rechargeable version in 1991. Almost two decades ago, Exxon created a new type of material used to separate battery components.

While Exxon is moving ahead with its battery-material business, the outlook for hydrogen, another targeted growth area, is looking more challenged. The company has warned it may delay a low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia project in Baytown, Texas, due to a lack of interest from customers.

The shortening of the timeframe available to claim hydrogen tax credits under President Donald Trump’s so-called Big Beautiful Bill may also slow market development, Woods said.

“Our big concern today around low-carbon hydrogen is whether there’s enough time within that bill to incentivize the development of the market,” Woods said.

A viable hydrogen industry based on market forces is essential to supporting multi-billion dollar investments, he said.

“We can’t do it on charity.”

Why It Matters

China has become the undisputed leader in green tech manufacturing and exports, dominating sectors from electric vehicles to solar panels and battery storage.

It has done so through aggressive state-driven industrial policy, massive public spending—totaling $625 billion last year, or nearly one-third of global clean energy investment—and by harnessing its integrated, domestic supply chains in a broader push to reduce reliance on oil imports and claim a lead in emerging technologies.

Newsweek reached out to China's National Energy Administration via email with a request for comment.

What To Know

Fossil fuel consumption in China has effectively plateaued since 2021, both in overall energy use and electricity generation, according to a report by U.K.-based think tank Ember.

Eighty-four percent of the increase in electricity demand last year was met by clean energy sources, including wind, solar and nuclear, per the report.

Wind and solar are leading the surge, with China generating 18 percent of its electricity from those sources in 2024—double the share from 2020, Ember said.

In the first six months of 2025, wind output rose 16 percent over the same period last year, while solar generation soared by 43 percent. Combined output from wind and solar hit 2,073 terawatt-hours by June, surpassing China's hydropower, nuclear and bioenergy output for the first time.

Fossil fuel use for direct end uses—like transportation, heating and industrial combustion—has stalled at just under 150 exajoules since 2018.

China has added 267.53 gigawatts of solar capacity in the first half of 2025 alone—nearly triple the rest of the world combined, according to Ember.

What People Are Saying

Jonas Nahm, assistant professor for energy, resources and environment at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, wrote on X: ""As the U.S. withdraws from green tech industries and pressures allies to follow suit, China is stepping in to power the developing world's energy transition. The scale is staggering.""

Guo Jiakun, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said at a June news conference: ""This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement. China is always a staunch doer and important contributor to global green development. Working toward peaking carbon dioxide emissions and achieving carbon neutrality is our solemn commitment to the international community.""

Nicholas Janzen is policy and partnerships director at Maine Conservation Voters. Francis Eanes is executive director of the Maine Labor Climate Council.

Just a short two years ago, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) proved that tackling climate change and growing the economy are not mutually exclusive. The law unleashed a clean energy boom nationwide, creating thousands of good-paying union jobs, lowering household energy costs, and giving communities the tools to protect themselves from extreme weather.

In Maine, the impact was clear. We’ve surpassed our ambitious heat pump goals and are weatherizing our homes, small businesses are using solar, and we started laying the groundwork for pioneering offshore wind projects that could power our state for decades.

Now, Congress is working to undo that progress. On July 4, lawmakers passed, and President Donald Trump signed, the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill.” More like the “Big Ugly Bill” to us. Instead of lowering costs like clean energy does, this bill drives them up. It’s nothing more than a Republican rate hike on everyday people.

This legislation guts the very programs that made the IRA such a success. The result will be higher home energy bills, lost jobs, and weaker competitiveness for Maine businesses, all while handing out tax breaks to billionaires and polluting oil and gas companies.

The bill phases out wind and solar tax credits unless projects break ground immediately, eliminates incentives for new and used electric vehicles, and ends funding for home energy upgrades, including rooftop solar, heat pumps, and insulation, all by the end of 2025. By slashing the very incentives that have fueled clean energy growth, it threatens to stall projects, kill jobs, and drive up energy costs for Mainers.

While the IRA fueled innovation, kept energy dollars in-state, and created family-sustaining work, the Big Ugly Bill forces families to pay more while padding the profits of the wealthiest corporations. One builds us up, the other drags us down.

Many solar projects — including a 140-megawatt array in Hartland — have already been put on hold. Union electricians are seeing hours dry up. Maine is projected to lose 1,600 clean energy jobs, and households could pay $80 more per year by 2035.

All of this comes on top of recent electricity rate hikes, driven primarily by the costs of recovering from severe winter storms intensified by climate change.

Yet our organizations know that Maine has always led and will continue to lead on climate. Even as federal policy falters, during the most recent state legislative session we strengthened emergency planning, funded climate adaptation projects, and strengthened clean electricity goals that keep energy dollars local, create union jobs, and help households save. With a new cabinet-level Department of Energy Resources, Maine is building the capacity to guide a clean energy future efficiently and effectively.

But while Maine acts, federal policy is moving in the wrong direction. Many Mainers knew the Big Ugly Bill was bad long before it passed. Dozens of organizations, businesses, labor unions, and community leaders successfully advocated to Maine’s congressional delegation, urging them to reject these clean energy rollbacks.

And while it wasn’t enough to prevent passage, Maine’s entire federal delegation heeded that call and voted against the legislation.

Even as the Big Ugly Bill drives up costs, cuts jobs, and stalls critical clean energy projects, Maine must continue to act on its own to mitigate the damage. By continuing to invest in renewable energy, strengthen climate adaptation, and support families and workers, the state can and will keep moving forward.

Two years after the Inflation Reduction Act showed what’s possible, Maine has proven that fighting climate change, creating good jobs, and saving families money can go hand in hand.

We know we can’t do it all on our own. Federal partnership is essential, but by pressing ahead, staying bold, and keeping communities at the center of our work, Maine can continue to lead.

The Big Ugly Bill is a rate hike on everyday people. Maine’s path is clear: We lead, we build, and we keep costs down for families.",https://i0.wp.com/bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-design-47.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-13 04:57:50.590670

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech's data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM's just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

Coal-fired power plant reconversion plans

The collaboration will focus on conversion of coal-fired plants to natural gas-fired generation facilities. This solution, which acts as a “crucial bridge” in the energy transition, offers a fast and economically viable response, something that renewables alone cannot yet match in terms of speed of implementation.

The rise of AI and Big Data has created a demand for power not seen in nearly two decades. Data center developers and hyperscalers need immediate, reliable and affordable power solutions. This is where the combined expertise of B&W and Denham comes into play.

“Power response time is a key factor for data center developers,” explained Justin DeAngelis, Global Head of Sustainable Infrastructure at Denham Capital. “This collaboration is a differentiating tool that will allow us to quickly meet the needs of the market.” DeAngelis added that Denham will not only invest substantially in these projects, but will also soon launch a portfolio company dedicated entirely to these solutions.

For its part, B&W brings a wealth of industry knowledge to the table. With nearly 160 years of experience, the company is an expert in converting coal-fired power plants to natural gas. Kenneth Young, president and CEO of B&W, highlighted his company’s unique ability to plan and execute complex projects, combining proven technologies with innovations to meet market demand.

The new action plan, grounded in the nation’s dual carbon goals, aims to grow the national new energy storage fleet to 180 GW by 2027.
Officials from the National Energy Administration emphasized that energy storage is now essential for stabilizing the power system and meeting growing electricity demands.
Earlier this year, China scrapped a national energy storage mandate – a policy that had previously driven as much as 75% of the country’s storage deployment.
Key measures include: Promoting the joint participation of “new energy + energy storage” in electricity market transactions as a single bidding entity.","China aims to add more than 100 GW of new energy storage (primarily battery storage, excluding pumped hydro) by 2027, according to a new action plan presented by authorities on Friday.

The “Special Action Plan for Large-Scale Construction of New Energy Storage (2025-2027)” released by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the National Energy Administration (NEA) outlines a roadmap to scale up energy storage to support the country’s rapidly expanding renewable energy capacity. The plan is expected to drive CNY 250 billion yuan (approximately $35 billion) in sector investment over three years.

China has already outpaced its previous targets. The country reached its 2025 goal of 30 GW two years early and saw explosive growth in 2024 alone, adding 37 GW / 91 GWh of new energy storage – more than doubling total capacity year-on-year. As of June 2025, China’s new energy storage fleet had surpassed 100 GW, overtaking the pumped hydro additions for the first time, according to data from the China Energy Storage Alliance (CNESA).

The new action plan, grounded in the nation’s dual carbon goals, aims to grow the national new energy storage fleet to 180 GW by 2027. It responds to the urgent need for flexible energy regulation amid rapid renewable energy expansion. Officials from the National Energy Administration emphasized that energy storage is now essential for stabilizing the power system and meeting growing electricity demands.

The plan also comes at a critical moment. Earlier this year, China scrapped a national energy storage mandate – a policy that had previously driven as much as 75% of the country’s storage deployment. Introduced in 2022, the mandate required most new solar and wind projects to include co-located storage. Over 20 provinces implemented their own mandates, with some increasing their required storage ratios from 10% to as high as 20%.

The new plan envisages a more comprehensive and market-oriented approch to scaling up new energy storage. The plan outlines strategies for expanding application scenarios and improving the utilization efficiency of storage systems. It also aims to promote application of innovative projects and strengthen the development of a comprehensive standardization system.

Finally, the plan seeks to imrpove market mechanisms for the new energy storage by promoting their participation in the wholesale and anciliary service markets and accelerating the development of a dedicated pricing mechanism.

Application scenarios and market mechanisms

The Action Plan considers the needs of building a new power system and focuses on three main areas: the power supply side, the grid side, and other emerging application scenarios.

On the power supply side, the focus is on large-scale base energy storage, integration with new energy sources, and support for coal-fired power plants. These measures aim to improve the ability of coal plants to adjust output and enhance the overall grid integration of renewable energy.

On the grid side, the emphasis is on deploying storage at key grid nodes and within distribution networks. The plan encourages the development of energy storage facilities that can serve as alternatives to traditional grid infrastructure, as well as broader use of grid-based storage solutions.

For other applications, the plan targets fast-growing areas such as industrial parks, data centers, distributed solar systems, and telecom base stations. Innovative storage models will be promoted to improve energy efficiency and support stable power supply in these scenarios.

To support the integration of new energy storage into a unified national electricity market, the Action Plan calls for accelerating the development of market mechanisms. Key measures include:

Promoting the joint participation of “new energy + energy storage” in electricity market transactions as a single bidding entity.

Encouraging regions to develop auxiliary services – such as ramping and inertia support – based on local power system needs.

Improving capacity pricing mechanisms to better reflect the value of regulatory resources like energy storage.

In addition, the Plan urges all regions to speed up the development of medium- and long-term electricity markets as well as spot markets. It also calls for market price formation mechanisms to ensure that the pricing of energy storage charging and discharging is fair and market-driven.

Looking ahead, the NEA will guide provincial and regional energy authorities to follow national planning guidelines, accurately assess their local regulatory capacity needs, and clearly define the scale and layout of new energy storage and other flexibility resources.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/China.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 02:58:34.418558

California accounts for 857 EV tax credit claims (new and used) per 100,000 returns — far above the U.S. average of 320.","The federal electric vehicle tax credit, designed to encourage EV purchases by making them more affordable, is set to expire Sept. 30. While it was initially due to expire in 2032, its brief run helped new-car buyers save $3.3 billion in tax year 2023 alone.

A recent analysis by LendingTree looked at where consumers will miss out the most when the credit ends.

In tax year 2023, Americans filed 487,990 returns claiming the new EV tax credit, totaling $3.3 billion, and 28,180 for the preowned EV credit, totaling another $95.6 million. The average credit was $6,709 for new EVs, which are eligible for up to $7,500, and $3,392 for used EVs, eligible for up to $4,000.

Based on results from tax year 2023, California stands to take the biggest hit when the credit ends.

LendingTree analysts predict Californians could miss out on an estimated $1.1 billion in EV tax credits in the tax year following the end of the credits. That includes credits for new and used EVs. Californians submitted 157,360 claims for the new EV tax credit in tax year 2023, or 32.2% of U.S. claims. For used EV credits, California also led, accounting for 23.2% of U.S. claims.

California accounts for 857 EV tax credit claims (new and used) per 100,000 returns — far above the U.S. average of 320.

Behind California, Texans could lose an estimated $272.7 million in potential savings, and Floridians stand to lose $201.4 million. Texas and Florida were also next in claims at a far lower 38,870 and 30,090.

Washington (571) and New Jersey (506) also have high per-capita claim rates. Conversely, Mississippi (44), North Dakota (51) and Louisiana (57) have the fewest claims compared to the number of individual tax returns.

Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst, said those credits are big, especially when considering how expensive vehicles are today.

“That these credits could often be taken at the point of sale makes them even more significant,” he said. “It’s one thing to have to wait until the following spring to get a rebate with your tax refund. It’s something else to be able to knock thousands of dollars off the price of a vehicle from the start. I have no doubt that those credits inspired people who may not otherwise have considered an electric vehicle to at least think about them.”

Schulz said the end of the credits means “an awful lot of potential buying power will go away for consumers.”

However, while the federal EV tax credit is phasing out, many states offer substantial incentives for EVs, including the top-ranking California and Texas.

Nationwide, only 1.7% of light-duty vehicles registered in 2023 were electric — an increase from 1.2% in 2022. California leads again, with EVs comprising 4.5% of registered vehicles. The District of Columbia (3.8%) and Hawaii (3.0%) follow. Meanwhile, just 0.2% of light-duty vehicles in Mississippi and North Dakota are electric.

New EV sales totaled 310,839 in Q2 2025, a 6.3% decrease from Q2 2024. The top three EVs sold in Q2 2025 were the Tesla Model Y (86,120), Tesla Model 3 (48,803) and Chevrolet Equinox EV (17,420). However, year-to-date Q1 and Q2 sales reached 607,089 — up 1.5% from the same period last year.",https://www.autobodynews.com/images/June_2024/EV_sales_full.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 09:58:51.137194

I’m also a sea kayak instructor and during the Camp Fire, I was in South Carolina for a training.
I have triplet daughters who were attending Butte College at the time, and they needed to be evacuated.
That’s why I thought we need a little bit of a buffer in Paradise and some protection around the community.
But in so many places, these events are foreseeable; we’re just not wired to think about them or prepare for them.","In order to better understand how communities can build back smarter after — or, ideally, before — a catastrophic fire, I spoke with Efseaff about his work in Paradise and how other communities might be able to replicate it. Our conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

Do you live in Paradise? Were you there during the Camp Fire?

I actually live in Chico. We’ve lived here since the mid-‘90s, but I have a long connection to Paradise; I’ve worked for the district since 2017. I’m also a sea kayak instructor and during the Camp Fire, I was in South Carolina for a training. I was away from the phone until I got back at the end of the day and saw it blowing up with everything.

I have triplet daughters who were attending Butte College at the time, and they needed to be evacuated. There was a lot of uncertainty that day. But it gave me some perspective, because I couldn’t get back for two days. It gave me a chance to think, “Okay, what’s our response going to be?” Looking two days out, it was like: That would have been payroll, let’s get people together, and then let’s figure out what we’re going to do two weeks and two months from now.

It also got my mind thinking about what we would have done going backwards. If you’d had two weeks to prepare, you would have gotten your go-bag together, you’d have come up with your evacuation route — that type of thing. But when you run the movie backwards on what you would have done differently if you had two years or two decades, it would include prepping the landscape, making some safer community defensible space. That’s what got me started.

Was it your idea to buy up the high-risk properties in the burn scar?

I would say I adapted it. Everyone wants to say it was their idea, but I’ll tell you where it came from: Pre-fire, the thinking was that it would make sense for the town to have a perimeter trail from a recreation standpoint. But I was also trying to pitch it as a good idea from a fuel standpoint, so that if there was a wildfire, you could respond to it. Certainly, the idea took on a whole other dimension after the Camp Fire.

I’m a restoration ecologist, so I’ve done a lot of river floodplain work. There are a lot of analogies there. The trend has been to give nature a little bit more room: You’re not going to stop a flood, but you can minimize damage to human infrastructure. Putting levees too close to the river makes them more prone to failing and puts people at risk — but if you can set the levee back a little bit, it gives the flood waters room to go through. That’s why I thought we need a little bit of a buffer in Paradise and some protection around the community. We need a transition between an area that is going to burn, and that we can let burn, but not in a way that is catastrophic.

How hard has it been to find willing sellers? Do most people in the area want to rebuild — or need to because of their mortgages?

Ironically, the biggest challenge for us is finding adequate funding. A lot of the property we have so far has been donated to us. It’s probably upwards of — oh, let’s see, at least half a dozen properties have been donated, probably close to 200 acres at this point.

We are applying for some federal grants right now, and we’ll see how that goes. What’s evolved quite a bit on this in recent years, though, is that — because we’ve done some modeling — instead of thinking of the buffer as areas that are managed uniformly around the community, we’re much more strategic. These fire events are wind-driven, and there are only a couple of directions where the wind blows sufficiently long enough and powerful enough for the other conditions to fall into play. That’s not to say other events couldn’t happen, but we’re going after the most likely events that would cause catastrophic fires, and that would be from the Diablo winds, or north winds, that come through our area. That was what happened in the Camp Fire scenario, and another one our models caught what sure looked a lot like the [2024] Park Fire.

One thing that I want to make clear is that some people think, “Oh, this is a fire break. It’s devoid of vegetation.” No, what we’re talking about is a well-managed habitat. These are shaded fuel breaks. You maintain the big trees, you get rid of the ladder fuels, and you get rid of the dead wood that’s on the ground. We have good examples with our partners, like the Butte Fire Safe Council, on how this works, and it looks like it helped protect the community of Cohasset during the Park Fire. They did some work on some strips there, and the fire essentially dropped to the ground before it came to Paradise Lake. You didn’t have an aerial tanker dropping retardant, you didn’t have a $2-million-per-day fire crew out there doing work. It was modest work done early and in the right place that actually changed the behavior of the fire.

Tell me a little more about the modeling you’ve been doing.

We looked at fire pathways with a group called XyloPlan out of the Bay Area. The concept is that you simulate a series of ignitions with certain wind conditions, terrain, and vegetation. The model looked very much like a Camp Fire scenario; it followed the same pathway, going towards the community in a little gulch that channeled high winds. You need to interrupt that pathway — and that doesn’t necessarily mean creating an area devoid of vegetation, but if you have these areas where the fire behavior changes and drops down to the ground, then it slows the travel. I found this hard to believe, but in the modeling results, in a scenario like the Camp Fire, it could buy you up to eight hours. With modern California firefighting, you could empty out the community in a systematic way in that time. You could have a vigorous fire response. You could have aircraft potentially ready. It’s a game-changing situation, rather than the 30 minutes Paradise had when the Camp Fire started.

How does this work when you’re dealing with private property owners, though? How do you convince them to move or donate their land?

We’re a Park and Recreation District so we don’t have regulatory authority. We are just trying to run with a good idea with the properties that we have so far — those from willing donors mostly, but there have been a couple of sales. If we’re unable to get federal funding or state support, though, I ultimately think this idea will still have to be here — whether it’s five, 10, 15, or 50 years from now. We have to manage this area in a comprehensive way.

Private property rights are very important, and we don’t want to impinge on that. And yet, what a person does on their property has a huge impact on the 30,000 people who may be downwind of them. It’s an unusual situation: In a hurricane, if you have a hurricane-rated roof and your neighbor doesn’t, and theirs blows off, you feel sorry for your neighbor but it’s probably not going to harm your property much. In a wildfire, what your neighbor has done with the wood, or how they treat vegetation, has a significant impact on your home and whether your family is going to survive. It’s a fundamentally different kind of event than some of the other disasters we look at.

Do you have any advice for community leaders who might want to consider creating buffer zones or something similar to what you’re doing in Paradise?

Start today. You have to think about these things with some urgency, but they’re not something people think about until it happens. Paradise, for many decades, did not have a single escaped wildfire make it into the community. Then, overnight, the community is essentially wiped out. But in so many places, these events are foreseeable; we’re just not wired to think about them or prepare for them.

Buffers around communities make a lot of sense, even from a road network standpoint. Even from a trash pickup standpoint. You don’t think about this, but if your community is really strung out, making it a little more thoughtfully laid out also makes it more economically viable to provide services to people. Some things we look for now are long roads that don’t have any connections — that were one-way in and no way out. I don’t think [the traffic jams and deaths in] Paradise would have happened with what we know now, but I kind of think [authorities] did know better beforehand. It just wasn’t economically viable at the time; they didn’t think it was a big deal, but they built the roads anyway. We can be doing a lot of things smarter.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTU5Nzc1MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MjUyMTE1MX0.Piwo1sxLWeFjt2lU_w_AuaKaAsX979GO1ZwGOvbfUKQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-09-13 00:58:16.863297

Coal Power Declines In China China often draws criticism for its embrace of coal-fired generating stations, and it is true that so far this century, it has built more of them and consumed more coal than any other nation.
In its concluding paragraph, Ember wrote, “The scale, pace, and depth of China’s transition raises questions about the future of fossil fuel production globally.
China has been the main ‘swing state’ for global fossil fuel demand for a decade.
“Its energy related fossil fuel consumption is likely to begin falling soon due to the twin trends of clean generation and end-use electrification, and made-in-China electro-technologies are displacing fossil energy across the world.","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

In a report released on September 9, 2025, Ember said: “China’s surge in renewables and whole economy electrification is rapidly reshaping energy choices for the rest of the world, creating the conditions for a decline in global fossil fuel use.” Put another way, China is now the global leader in transitioning away from burning fossil fuels, and making the US mania for dirty fuels that waste three quarters of their available energy look sillier every day.

In the foreword to the report, Ember wrote: “The world stands at a pivotal moment. Climate change, energy security, and economic development are no longer separate challenges. Increasingly, they are interwoven — and so too must be our response. For too long, emerging economies have faced what seemed like a stark trade-off between growth and sustainability. As this report highlights, China’s green ascent challenges that assumption.

“Through scale, innovation and long-term planning, China is demonstrating that decarbonization can go hand in hand with industrial upgrading, job creation, and improved quality of life. These lessons carry significance not only for China, but for the broader region — especially Southeast Asia, where energy demand is rising and development needs remain pressing.”

Let’s unpack that a bit, shall we? In the US, the belief among the fossil fuel ideologues who have now captured the government is that renewable energy simply cannot be the basis of a robust economy because, as they tell us all the time, the sun doesn’t always shine and the wind doesn’t always blow. They refuse to acknowledge that energy storage technology is now so advanced that renewables absolutely can supply reliable, dispatchable electricity to homes and businesses. What China is doing gives the lie to all that fossil fuel twaddle.

Coal Power Declines In China

China often draws criticism for its embrace of coal-fired generating stations, and it is true that so far this century, it has built more of them and consumed more coal than any other nation. But the difference between China and the US is that it has always viewed coal as a means to an end — the creation of a modern manufacturing economy — not as an end in itself.

In fact, according to Bloomberg, China’s increase in coal power peaked in 2021 and fell significantly in 2022. Then it ticked up again in 2023, but is down by 2 percent so far this year.

Ember says China invested a staggering $625 billion in renewable energy in 2024 — nearly a third of all clean energy funding in the entire world. “China’s surge in renewables and whole-economy electrification is rapidly reshaping energy choices for the rest of the world, creating the conditions for a decline in global fossil fuel use,” Ember said. If current trends hold, “it’s likely that the world’s fossil fuel demand will be in structural decline by 2030.”

An Economic Restructuring

“China has embarked on this transition for a variety of reasons. Interviews with experts conducted for this report reveal that within China there is a realization that the old development paradigm centered on fossil fuels has run its course, and is not fit for 21st century realities. The government’s aim to establish an ‘ecological civilization,’ which simultaneously delivers on economic, social and environmental goals, is the response, embedded in the Constitution since 2018,” Ember said in its report.

“The clean energy transition is constraining China’s dependence on imported fossil fuels, reducing energy costs, stimulating growth and jobs and creating export markets. In 2024, investment and production in clean energy contributed 13.6 trillion RMB ($1.9 trillion) to the national economy — a sum equivalent to about one-tenth of China’s GDP, or the total GDP of Australia — and the sector is growing three times faster than the Chinese economy overall. The depth of buy-in within business is reflected in research, development, and innovation — Chinese companies now account for about 75% of global patent applications in clean energy technology, up from just 5% in 2000.

“These investments in the clean energy future are driving dramatic cost reductions across the world in key technologies such as wind turbines, solar panels, storage batteries and electric vehicles. The benefits are increasingly being felt in emerging markets, many of which are overtaking OECD countries in wind and solar generation share and in electrification.”

China was responsible for most of the global growth in fossil fuel use for a decade, but that is no longer the case, Ember said. In its view, “the implications for governments basing their economic growth plans on exporting coal, oil and gas are plain to see,” as demand for fossil fuels falls.

As China Goes, So Goes The World

That last part is prescient. My colleague Michael Barnard this week explored the Canadian government’s decision to prioritize LNG exports from its West Coast terminals. The US is also dumping billions of dollars into building new LNG terminals in the Gulf of Mexico. But Barnard sees trouble ahead for both. In 2025, China and India signaled that LNG will not be central to their futures.

“India is showing that renewables will crowd gas out of the generation mix. China is diversifying away from LNG with massive renewables, transmission and storage, domestic production and Russian pipelines. These shifts matter because together the two countries represent the largest block of potential demand growth. If they are going in reverse, the market outlook for LNG becomes far weaker,” he wrote.

That parallels what the Ember report said. In its concluding paragraph, Ember wrote, “The scale, pace, and depth of China’s transition raises questions about the future of fossil fuel production globally. China has been the main ‘swing state’ for global fossil fuel demand for a decade.

“Its energy related fossil fuel consumption is likely to begin falling soon due to the twin trends of clean generation and end-use electrification, and made-in-China electro-technologies are displacing fossil energy across the world. The implications for governments basing their economic growth plans on exporting coal, oil and gas are plain to see.”

Cutting fossil fuel use is necessary to reducing carbon emissions and avoiding the worst consequences of a hotter planet, Bloomberg said. But the path to net zero has been complicated by various factors — from indifference and even hostility to the energy transition in some countries like the US, to concerns over the costs of its implementation in others. That has put a huge onus on the world’s biggest polluter — China — to prove to the world that clean energy is the most logical and most effective path forward not only for China but for other nations as well.

“China is disproving the notion that green goals and economic growth are at odds, according to the report,” Bloomberg said. “Instead, it has taken a path that has allowed the two to reinforce each other and create ‘self-sustaining momentum.'”

Disrupting Self-Sustaining Momentum

The fossil fuel industry established “self-sustaining momentum” decades ago, and it is the fear that anything different will send the whole world economy into a tailspin that makes people afraid to transition away from it. If China can show that clean energy and economic growth can be partners, then that fear will disappear. Once that happens, the changeover could happen swiftly.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DALL·E-2025-02-20-09.11.24-A-panoramic-image-of-a-map-of-China-covered-in-solar-panels-wind-turbines-and-transmission-lines-depicted-in-the-style-of-an-ancient-Chinese-paint-800x457.png,N,,2025-09-13 03:57:48.119301

The report highlights the remarkable progress Morocco has made in recent years in terms of clean energy transition. It describes the country’s solar plant as a “world-class utility-scale solar complex” and an example of how Africa can attract private capital to power its clean energy transition.

The NOOR Complex is one of the largest concentrated solar power plants in the world. With a total capacity of 582 megawatts, it combines concentrated solar power (510 MW) and photovoltaic technologies (72 MW). Its ability to store energy in molten salt allows Morocco to produce electricity even after sunset, which helps the country meet peak demand.

The report explains that the project was made possible through a public-private partnership between Morocco’s Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN) and a consortium led by the company ACWA Power

International financial institutions, including the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank, provided concessional loans that lowered the project’s costs by up to 25%.

According to the report, “NOOR’s success demonstrates that for pioneering, capital-intensive technologies like CSP, a cohesive national vision can be effective at mitigating project risk and scaling infrastructure.”

Since its launch, NOOR has had a strong impact on Morocco’s energy sector. It provides electricity to more than 1.1 million people and accounts for around 5% of the country’s power supply.

It also reduces Morocco’s reliance on imported energy, a key issue for a nation that used to import over 97% of its energy. In addition, the project offsets about 690,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year. The project also created thousands of jobs during construction and spurred new training programs and infrastructure in the Ouarzazate region.

However, the report notes some challenges, especially water use in the arid area where the complex is built. Later phases of the project adopted dry cooling technology to reduce this problem.

The NOOR Complex is central to Morocco’s long-term energy ambitions. The country aims to produce 52% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030, and solar energy plays a major role in that plan.

The report, jointly produced by Enzi Ijayo Africa Initiative (EIAI) and Africa Climate Insights (ACI), also places Morocco’s achievement in a wider African context. Despite holding 60% of the world’s best solar resources, Africa added less than 1% of global renewable capacity in 2024.

Financing is the biggest obstacle for the continent. “Africa must triple its annual growth rate to meet the Nairobi Declaration goal,” the report warns, referring to the 2023 pledge by African leaders to increase renewable energy capacity from 56 GW in 2022 to 300 GW by 2030.

If successful, this transition could transform the continent’s economy.

The Ontario government says it will contribute $17.5 million through the Invest Ontario Fund to help fast-track construction.
Early this year, German tech giant Siemens announced a $150-million EV battery research hub in Ontario.
Sheldon Williamson, a professor at Ontario Tech University who focuses on EV battery systems, said the refinery is a strategically important step.
“Building North America’s first battery-grade cobalt sulfate refinery on Ontario soil fills a clear gap in the battery supply chain,” he said.","Ontario is backing a $100-million investment to build North America’s first battery-grade cobalt refinery, aimed at supporting the country’s electric vehicle production at a time when the industry is struggling with slowing sales and a deepening trade war with the US.

Led by Toronto-based Electra Battery Materials, the plan is to build the refinery in Temiskaming Shores about 250 kilometres northeast of Sudbury.

The Ontario government says it will contribute $17.5 million through the Invest Ontario Fund to help fast-track construction. Once completed, the facility would produce 6,500 tonnes of cobalt sulphate a year — enough to support production of up to one million EVs.

Electra CEO Trent Mell said the project is essential to reducing reliance on offshore suppliers, particularly China, which currently refines more than 90 per cent of the world’s cobalt. It will also help safeguard economic and energy security, and ensure Canada plays a leading role in the global energy transition, he added.

The province says, once completed, the facility would produce 6,500 tonnes of cobalt sulphate a year — enough to support production of up to one million EVs.

EV market under pressure

Canada’s $100 billion EV-sector development strategy faces turbulence. Sales growth has slowed, federal EV mandates are being revised and auto-sector investments are under strain from US tariffs. Earlier this year, Swedish battery-maker Northvolt collapsed, underscoring risks in the sector.

Both Ontario and Ottawa have pledged billions to secure critical mineral projects as a counter to US trade threats, arguing it will create jobs and strengthen economic sovereignty.

The province has promised $500 million for mineral processing, while Ottawa has invested $3.8 billion in exploration, refining and recycling. Early this year, German tech giant Siemens announced a $150-million EV battery research hub in Ontario.

Still, a report from the Canadian Climate Institute warned Canada could lose out on a $12 billion-a-year critical minerals market by 2040 without at least $30 billion in new mining investment. Global demand for copper, nickel, lithium, graphite, cobalt and rare earths is expected to hit $770 billion by that year.

Experts welcomed the cobalt announcement but raised concerns about execution and market realities.

Ian London, executive director of the Canadian Critical Minerals and Materials Alliance, an industry advocacy group, said the project sounds positive but questioned whether there are buyers lined up given the struggling EV market. “Where is the customer? Who has committed to buying the cobalt and at what price?” he asked. “Otherwise, this feels like a supply-push model rather than demand-pull. You can say the refinery will support EV battery plants, but unless Volkswagen or another automaker is lined up, there’s no customer.”

London said $100 million is likely not enough to build a refinery of this scale and Ontario’s $17.5-million contribution is only a term sheet — a non-binding agreement that sets out intentions but does not guarantee funding. He cautioned while the plan sounds positive, the real question is whether the plant will actually be built.

He added the refinery could make sense if Ontario secured markets abroad, such as European battery plants, which would reduce dependence on US buyers.

London also stressed that critical mineral investments should be tied to real industrial demand. He pointed to the federal government’s “nation-building” projects, such as high-speed rail, nuclear power and energy infrastructure, that will require large amounts of copper, steel and aluminum, as areas where investment may be more urgently needed.

A recent report from the Financial Accountability Office warns Ontario’s auto industry, a key pillar of the province’s economy, could lose thousands of jobs this year because of the US trade war. The sector makes up $36 billion of Ontario’s $220.5 billion in exports, with 85 per cent of goods headed to the US and most of the 1.54 million vehicles built last year sold to American consumers.

Sheldon Williamson, a professor at Ontario Tech University who focuses on EV battery systems, said the refinery is a strategically important step. The project could strengthen Ontario’s role in the global EV supply chain by making the province more attractive to battery-makers, recycling plants and automakers looking for reliable local suppliers.

Williamson says most cobalt refining currently takes place in Asia, mainly China, leaving North American supply chains exposed to trade risks. “Building North America’s first battery-grade cobalt sulfate refinery on Ontario soil fills a clear gap in the battery supply chain,” he said.

The project shows Ontario is serious about building a domestic battery supply chain, but its success will depend on customers, partnerships and how fast the EV market evolves, he added.

The proposed rule would require that only the oil and natural gas industry continue to report GHG emissions, as this is specifically required by the Clean Air Act (PDF).
“Cutting the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution,” Joseph Goffman, a former assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation at the EPA, says in a statement.
The chemical industry emitted 181.2 million tCO2e, and the oil and natural gas industry emitted 322 million tCO2e.
According to the European Commission’s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, the total US greenhouse gas emissions for 2023 were 5,960.80 million tCO2e, which was 11.25% of the global total.","In another strike against US climate policy, Environmental Protection Agency head Lee Zeldin announced on Friday afternoon that the agency is proposing to end the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP).

This program, stemming from a law signed in 2007 by President George W. Bush, requires that all facilities in the US annually report greenhouse gas emissions above a certain threshold so that scientists and lawmakers have accurate data with which to predict future climate and enact appropriate policy to mitigate any dangers. If the EPA’s proposal is finalized, the agency says, “most large facilities, all fuel and industrial gas suppliers, and CO2 [sic] injection sites” would no longer have to report their emissions.

The proposed rule would require that only the oil and natural gas industry continue to report GHG emissions, as this is specifically required by the Clean Air Act (PDF). However, as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill signed by President Donald J. Trump in July, the Clean Air Act now says that the oil and natural gas industry doesn’t need to report its emissions again until 2034.

Criticisms of EPA’s move came quickly.

“Cutting the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution,” Joseph Goffman, a former assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation at the EPA, says in a statement. “Without it, policymakers, businesses, and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.”

Goffman further notes that “by hiding this information from the public, Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality, and public health.”

According to the EPA’s news release, the GHGRP “has no material impact on improving human health and the environment.” Zeldin says in the release that the program doesn’t improve air quality and “is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape.”

The proposal is part of a wider effort by the agency to roll back regulations and spending on climate change and other areas.

By 2030, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that direct health costs from climate change will be between $2 billion and $4 billion per year. In addition, the WHO projects that climate change will cause about 250,000 additional deaths a year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress.

According to the publicly available GHGRP data for 2023, the latest available, power plants in the US emitted 1,471.5 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e). The chemical industry emitted 181.2 million tCO2e, and the oil and natural gas industry emitted 322 million tCO2e. According to the European Commission’s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, the total US greenhouse gas emissions for 2023 were 5,960.80 million tCO2e, which was 11.25% of the global total.","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/EPA-GHG-reporting-rollback---172737:Widescreen?$responsive$&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2&fmt=webp",N,,2025-09-12 22:01:10.997352

Entergy expects its electric sales will grow by about 13% per year for the next few years, driven by data centers coming online in its service territory, Drew Marsh, Entergy chairman and CEO, said Wednesday at an energy forum hosted by Tulane University.

In recent years, Entergy’s industrial sales have spurred roughly 5% annual sales growth, according to Marsh. Ultimately, New Orleans-based Entergy’s sales could triple or quadruple by 2050, he said.

Meta plans to build a data center complex in Louisiana’s Richland Parish with an initial 2 GW of “compute,” which doesn’t include electricity for cooling and ancillary services, Marsh said. Entergy has agreed to build roughly 2 GW of gas-fired, combined cycle generation to serve the data center’s initial phase, at a cost of about $2 billion, he noted.

Under the plan approved Aug. 20 by the Louisiana Public Service Commission, Entergy Louisiana will build two generating in Richland Parish, which the company expects will be online in late 2028. A third facility will be built at the utility’s Waterford site in St. Charles Parish, which Entergy expects will be operating a year later. The power plants will total 2,262 MW and will be built to handle future carbon capture and sequestration technology, according to the company.

Meta’s data center complext could be expanded to 5 GW and Entergy may add up to 2 GW of solar to support it, Marsh said.

Meta will pay for the new generation and transmission upgrades needed to bring the data center online as well as its ongoing share of Entergy’s costs, according to Marsh. Those upgrades will boost grid reliability in the area, he said.

Entergy’s utilities serve about 3 million customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.

The additional gas-fired generation for the Meta data center project will make it challenging for Entergy to meet its goal of cutting its carbon dioxide emissions by 50% below 2000 levels by 2030, Marsh said. However, Marsh expects Entergy will be able to meet its goal of being carbon neutral by 2050, noting that Meta has agreed to explore carbon capture and storage options for the gas-fired capacity.

Entergy is “very focused” on sustainability, “but by and large, the world is not focused on sustainability — less so today than it was two years ago, to be sure,” Marsh said.

Marsh said he expects interest in sustainability will swing back around. “These are things that cycle around, and certainly younger generations have a very different expectation of what that should be, and I expect that over time, sustainability is going to move up in that pecking order,” Marsh said.

Currently, Entergy’s top priority is electricity affordability, followed closely by reliability and resilience, according to Marsh.

The United States needs more nuclear power plants and must retain its existing ones, said Marsh, who noted he is chair of the Nuclear Energy Institute.

However, building nuclear power plants is “a little bit of a challenge,” Marsh said, noting that the two new units at the Vogtle power plant in Georgia cost about $30 billion, up from an $8 billion initial estimate, and were about seven years behind schedule. “That’s not ideal.”

While nuclear safety is “very important,” it’s been “overdone” by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, according to Marsh. As a result, using equipment that meets certain NRC standards can be extremely expensive and time consuming to acquire, he said.

Marsh called for “a more truly risk-based standard that is not so stringent.”

Marsh said he supports emerging small modular reactor technology, but that its name may lead to misconceptions. “They’re not necessarily small and they’re not necessarily modular,” he said.

Ontario Power Generation’s SMR project, for example, required a 10-story hole in the ground, according to Marsh.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/BGm0Jg5e2WJ7M-pff5qSvRT_CqOJRjVlZiPK40HwSWs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9TY3JlZW5zaG90XzE2Mi5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-09-12 22:01:16.380428

Challenge: Merging modern sustainability on a heritage site Castle & Key saw the bottling expansion as the perfect opportunity to operate more sustainably.
The distillery partnered with local installer Solar Energy Solutions (SES) to engineer and construct the on-site system.
This in-house approach ensured accountability and coordination across the fast-moving Castle & Key build.
This case study is a collaboration among Castle & Key, SES and Weidmuller USA.","With roots dating back to the early 1800s by one of the forefathers of the American spirits industry, Castle & Key Distillery, located in the heart of Kentucky’s bourbon country in Frankfort, is known for more than its craft spirits.

Built in the late 1800s in a style meant to align with European architectural designs, the property features a castle, springhouse and sunken garden. It has been painstakingly restored to honor that heritage, and, since its reopening in 2018, distillery leaders have earned a reputation for forward-looking, innovative and modern sustainability practices.

As it was planning to construct a new bottling operation adjacent to its warehouse in nearby Versailles, the distillery decided to invest strategically in a large-scale solar PV project. In addition to reducing Castle & Key’s carbon footprint and lower long-term energy costs, solar power would set a precedent for renewable energy adoption in Kentucky’s spirits industry. But integrating PV services into a historic property presented unique hurdles, from aesthetic considerations and preservation requirements to the practical realities of power generation for a production facility.

The journey from concept to completion required strategic planning, close collaboration with partners and creative problem-solving. Timing was critical, as a $2 million grant from the USDA Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) would expire at year-end.

Challenge: Merging modern sustainability on a heritage site

Castle & Key saw the bottling expansion as the perfect opportunity to operate more sustainably. Currently served by Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities, two utilities that rely heavily on coal and natural gas, the distillery recognized that producing its own electricity could deliver both cost stability and meaningful environmental impact.

The distillery partnered with local installer Solar Energy Solutions (SES) to engineer and construct the on-site system.

From the outset, the project faced challenges due to aggressive deadlines. The first half of the solar array needed to be installed, energized and inspected by Dec. 31, 2024, to qualify for tax credits and maximize REAP grant funding. The timeline pressure meant that delays at any stage — whether in design, component availability or utility approval — could jeopardize millions in financial incentives.

Technical hurdles also needed to be addressed. The PV system had to be carefully engineered to integrate with the distillery’s operations, then connected to the utility grid under strict safety standards — particularly given the flammable spirits stored at the site. Permission to operate could only be granted once inspectors confirmed the system met all codes. In addition, Castle & Key wanted the system to be robust enough to perform reliably for decades, which required careful attention to component durability, maintenance needs and scalability for a second construction phase.

Solution: Leveraging proven expertise and suppliers

With 20 years in the business, SES leveraged its strengths as a vertically integrated engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm to deliver a turnkey solution. This in-house approach ensured accountability and coordination across the fast-moving Castle & Key build. Rather than a closed system, the distillery opted to remain connected to utility lines, allowing it to sell excess power generated and ensure it still had power to operate during adverse weather, such as cloudy skies or snow.

A key part of the SES solution was a partnership with Weidmuller, which has supplied PV components to the international market for 15 years. The U.S. arm, Weidmuller USA located in Richmond, Virginia, was called on to meet the year-end deadline and provide the required PV DC combiner boxes that could be delivered quickly and installed without delay. Weidmuller USA ensured SES had the necessary enclosures on-site to complete wiring, connection and testing before the critical year-end energization.

These combiner boxes bundled multiple DC strings from the solar panels, protected them with integrated fuses and surge protection, and provided a single aggregated feed to the inverters. By streamlining the system design, the Weidmuller equipment not only saved time but also provided a durable solution — coupled with a five-year warranty — built to last.

SES and Weidmuller’s technical teams coordinated closely on design specifications, which included adapting the number of strings and configurations. The boxes’ modular format allowed flexibility between this initial phase and the next-stage build-out, ensuring the system could be expanded smoothly. While this initial installation did not include string monitoring, used widely in Europe and Latin America, Weidmuller offers retrofit options that can be added later if Castle & Key wants more detailed performance monitoring. Given that solar panels are exposed to extreme weather conditions over their lifetime, string monitoring is advantageous in helping to pinpoint faulty panels or malfunctioning modules.

Ending the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which has been in place since 2009, would affect over 8,000 facilities, including power plants, electronic, chemical and mineral processing facilities and oil refineries.

The program's data are used to guide federal policy, and the data also help companies demonstrate they're hitting emissions-cutting benchmarks for the public, shareholders and investors.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in the release that the plan would save American businesses as much as $2.4 billion in regulatory costs but would still comply with the Clean Air Act. He first raised the idea of ending the reporting program in March.

""Unlike other mandatory information collections under the CAA, the GHGRP is not directly related to a potential regulation and has no material impact on improving human health and the environment,"" Zeldin said in the release.

He said it would be ""a significant step toward streamlining operations, cutting unnecessary red tape, unleashing American energy, and advancing EPA's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""

Certain fossil fuel facilities would be required to keep reporting emissions if the rule is ended, including some natural gas and offshore oil facilities, under the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted during the Biden administration. The EPA has proposed a delay of nearly a decade in implementing the data collection requirement, though, putting it off until 2034.

But environmental experts say ending the program would prevent the public from knowing how much major industrial polluters are emitting into the atmosphere.

""Cutting the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses, and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health,"" said Joseph Goffman, who served as assistant administrator for the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation during the Biden administration, in a statement.

Groffman now works with the Environmental Protection Network, a volunteer organization of former EPA employees.

Health experts are also concerned that ending the program could jeopardize public health.

""Measuring and reporting climate pollution is a critical step in reducing the deadly impacts of climate-driven extremes that cause more pollution, catastrophic weather events, health emergencies, and deaths. Ignoring this reality is a deadly choice, and not one that EPA should be making for American families,"" Will Barrett of the American Lung Association said in a statement.

GM confirmed for the Free Press that the automaker sold 12 BrightDrop vehicles to Amazon.

Amazon.com is testing General Motors' Chevrolet BrightDrop electric van, marking a significant potential client for the struggling Canadian-produced electric vans.

Amazon is testing a fleet of electric vehicles for its business, Bloomberg News first reported Sept. 12, with BrightDrop among those produced by Rivian and GM's crosstown rival Ford Motor Co.

GM confirmed for the Free Press that the automaker sold 12 BrightDrop vehicles to Amazon in 2023. Amazon reportedly promised to have 100,000 electric delivery vehicles delivering its packages within the next five years, and to reach net-zero carbon across its global operations by 2040.

“We sell Chevrolet BrightDrop vans to large global brands, rental companies and local service providers. Logistics companies often rent Chevrolet BrightDrops from our customers to meet increased, seasonal demand,” GM spokesman Sabin Blake said Sept. 12 in an emailed statement. “GM has remained committed to Chevrolet BrightDrop including an expanded dealer network, helping to increase visibility to small business customers.”

BrightDrop's commercial customers have included Walmart, Hertz, FedEx, Merchants Fleet and Verizon.

GM produces the Chevrolet BrightDrop at its CAMI Assembly plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, in Canada. Workers at CAMI Assembly are represented by Unifor Local 88.

Mike Van Boekel, the local's plant chairperson, said landing a customer like Amazon would be “great news.”

“That's a potentially big customer,” Van Boekel told the Free Press. “Those are the kinds of customers we need to attract.”

Van Boekel added that sales of BrightDrop have jumped over the past few months. About 90% of BrightDrop vans are sold in the U.S., he said.

Production shutdowns, layoffs

BrightDrop's struggles come less than a year after GM folded the commercial vans into its Chevrolet brand in a bid to boost its performance as GM tries to gain ground against competitors, including Ford and Rivian, in the electric van space.

Unifor said on April 11 that GM informed the union that CAMI Assembly would initiate temporary layoffs starting April 14 with workers returning in May for limited production. After that, production would temporarily cease with operations idling until October 2025 in order to complete retooling work to prepare the facility for production of the 2026 model year.

After production resumed, Unifor said the plant would operate on a single shift for the foreseeable future — a reduction expected to result in the indefinite layoff of nearly 500 workers.

Unifor Local 88 represents more than 1,200 workers at the CAMI Assembly Plant, where GM began BrightDrop production in early 2023.

Production of the Chevrolet BrightDrop electric vans, launched in 2021, halted in April, as a glut of vehicles began piling up on both sides of the border, as the Detroit Free Press first reported in March.

GM also told the Free Press in an email on Sept. 4 that CAMI will resume BrightDrop production on Nov. 17. Battery pack production at the plant will remain paused, however, as the automaker has produced a sufficient supply to meet immediate production plans, the company also said.

The Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the long-standing Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “has no material impact on improving human health and the environment.”

The agency is issuing a proposed rule to rescind the program, which is now open for public comment.

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” The EPA’s administrator, Lee Zeldin, said in the Friday press release. “Instead, it costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities.”

The EPA has been collecting this data since 2010; it’s used to create a national inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks, to inform the regulation of emissions and to ensure that the public has access to information on pollution.

Some research indicates the data reporting has also had some downstream impacts. A 2021 National Bureau of Economics Research paper found that power plants forced to report under GHGRP reduced their carbon emissions by about 7%, with greater reductions for publicly owned plants.

“Cutting the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses, and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health,” said Joseph Goffman, the former EPA assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation.

The EPA uses the data to track the country’s effort to stop using super-polluting, high-potency greenhouse gases called hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, a push Congress required the EPA to facilitate in 2021 under the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act. HFCs are used in refrigeration, air conditioning and fire suppression, and they trap thousands of times more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.

Without this reporting program, there will be no way for researchers, the public or the federal government to understand which facilities are creating greenhouse gases or how much an industry or company is producing. States that use the data to regulate climate emissions will also have to reevaluate how to do so, which is a reality the EPA acknowledged.

“The EPA understands that several states use the emissions estimation, reporting methodologies, and data from the GHGRP to develop or supplement state-level GHG emissions inventory programs,” the agency wrote.

The agency goes on to suggest that it’s difficult to quantify the costs to states of removing the program and that state governments can get the information themselves using “state authorities to support state programs.”

The EPA also acknowledged that the GHGRP has been used to track the congressionally mandated reduction of HFCs. But the agency appeared to completely dismiss the way that information is used.

“For gases regulated under the AIM Act, this information, if needed, could be collected as part of any program directly related to the AIM Act,” the agency wrote. There is no other information about the AIM act or any program related to it in the document.

As part of this proposed rescission of the program, EPA also proposed to completely stop collecting data from oil and gas companies about their greenhouse gas emissions, despite the fact that the collection of that information for the imposition of a fee was mandated by Congress in 2022.

Trump’s tax bill, signed into law in July, halted the implementation of that fee until 2034, which the EPA cites as the reason for ending reporting for those companies until that year, when the fee goes back into effect.",https://static.notus.org/dims4/default/8bfef4d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6563x3692+0+341/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-aji.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F15%2Fbc%2F5123c72d4dd7978f66cbaa894eb8%2Fepa-water-signing-feb-18-25049703288485.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 19:01:08.590718

John B. Larson (CT-01) wrote to U.S.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessentdemanding immediate IRS compliance with the law before homeowners face an erroneous tax increase.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit offers up to $3,200 annually for homeowners to cover efficiency upgrades. It was first enacted during the Bush Administration and expanded by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, a law Larson helped author and pass to invest in climate action and create new incentives to lower household utility bills. According to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, families using the credit were able to save an average of $882(link is external) on their taxes.

“Any suggestion that Section 25C has expired is not only legally incorrect but would also represent an unauthorized $21 billion tax hike on hard-working American families,” Larson and his colleagues wrote. “If our colleagues on the other side of the aisle truly intended to eliminate it, they should have cited the law correctly – Congress writes laws, and sloppy drafting is no excuse for the Treasury department to substitute its policy preferences for the language of the law as enacted. We urge the IRS to affirm publicly that the credit remains available in future tax years and to reject any interpretation that would unlawfully strip households of these savings.”

Full text of the letter is available HERE and below.

Dear Acting Commissioner and Secretary Bessent:

We write to ensure that hardworking, American families continue to receive the full benefit of Section 25C, the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, which remains law and in effect through December 31, 2032. As you know, this credit was enacted on a bi-partisan basis twenty years ago under the George W. Bush Administration. The credit was subsequently expanded in the Inflation Reduction Act (P.L. 117-169), which incorporated provisions of the Home Energy Savings Act, led by Ways & Means Committee Member Rep. Jimmy Gomez. The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit provides significant relief for Americans by offering up to $3,200 annually for qualifying energy-efficient home improvements – helping households lower utility bills and reduce overall living costs.

It appears that the Internal Revenue Service is taking the position, in guidance for taxpayers on its website, that the benefits of Section 25C are no longer available to taxpayers after December 31, 2025. However, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (P.L.119-21) did not modify the expiration date of the credit, which remains December 31, 2032.

To be clear, Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) do not have the authority to subsume or disregard this provision; the agency must follow statutory law as enacted by Congress. As Members of the Committee of jurisdiction responsible for drafting tax policy, we emphasize that Section 25C remains fully operative and that the IRS must continue to administer it as Congress intended. Any suggestion that Section 25C has expired is not only legally incorrect but would also represent an unauthorized $21 billion tax hike on hard-working American families.

Our colleagues in the Senate, responsible for drafting the enacted provision, chose to eschew consideration of P.L. 119-21 under regular order. Accordingly, its rushed, middle of the night advancement left the American public with no legislative history to determine Congressional intent regarding the enacted provision. If our colleagues on the other side of the aisle truly intended to eliminate it, they should have cited the law correctly – Congress writes laws, and sloppy drafting is no excuse for the Treasury department to substitute its policy preferences for the language of the law as enacted.

Thus, the law is clear: Section 25C must continue through 2032. We urge the IRS to affirm publicly that the credit remains available in future tax years and to reject any interpretation that would unlawfully strip households of these savings.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to your confirmation that Section 25C will remain in place as dictated by statute.",http://larson.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/larson.house.gov/files/evo-media-image/DSC_0309.JPG,N,,2025-09-12 20:58:16.670508

The agency said mandatory collection of GHG emissions data was unnecessary because it is “not directly related to a potential regulation and has no material impact on improving human health and the environment”.

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” said Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator.

The rule responds to a day-one executive order issued by Donald Trump aimed at removing barriers to unleashing more US energy, particularly fossil fuels. It is the latest in a series of major regulatory rollbacks undoing previous US efforts to combat climate crisis.

Earlier this summer, the EPA announced plans to repeal the “endangerment finding” that enabled the agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and stationary sources.

If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large facilities, all fuel and industrial gas suppliers and CO2 injection sites.

The Trump administration has also said it will withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, which requires countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and report their progress.

The Trump administration has also taken steps to end the collection of key environmental databases at the EPA as well as other federal agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and end greenhouse gas-monitoring satellites operated by Nasa.

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “burdensome” and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency’s statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Zeldin said in a statement.

“It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities,'' he said. ""With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA’s statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.''

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.”

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal “a cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don’t know who the polluters are, they can’t do anything to hold them responsible.""

Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers “have depended on this data"" for more than 15 years.

,EPA,2025-09-12 21:49:06+00:00,CityNews Halifax,The EPA wants to end a requirement that large polluters report their greenhouse gas emissions,News Staff,,,,,https://halifax.citynews.ca/2025/09/12/the-epa-wants-to-end-a-requirement-that-large-polluters-report-their-greenhouse-gas-emissions/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “burdensome” and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.
“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Zeldin said in a statement.
Joseph Goffman, who led EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution.
But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to “focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.” The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “burdensome” and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency’s statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Zeldin said in a statement.

“It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities,” he said. “With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA’s statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.”

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.”

By hiding pollution information from the public, “Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality and public health,” Goffman said, calling the plan “yet another example of the Trump administration putting polluters before people’s health.”

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal “a cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don’t know who the polluters are, they can’t do anything to hold them responsible.”

Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers “have depended on this data” for more than 15 years. Public accountability and pushback from investors have led many companies to reduce their climate pollution even before EPA sets stricter standards, Doniger said.

But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to “focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.”

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.

“Following a careful review, EPA proposed that there is no requirement under (the Clean Air Act) to collect GHG emission information from businesses, nor is continuing the ongoing costly data collection useful to fulfill any of the agency’s statutory obligations,” he said.

The EPA will accept public comments on the proposal for more than six weeks after the plan is published in the Federal Register, expected in coming days.

Appalachian Power has three coal-burning power plants in West Virginia.","Public anger is growing over rising electricity prices nationwide. In West Virginia, Appalachian Power customers have been paying hundreds of millions of dollars in hidden costs.

Inflation has driven up the cost of many basic necessities: food, housing and energy.

What Appalachian Power’s 1.1 million customers may not have known is that for years, they’ve been paying an extra cost on their monthly bills. Not for more electricity. But for electricity that costs more to produce than available alternatives. And from a pair of 70-year-old coal-burning power plants outside the state, in a contract state regulators never approved.

Other states have walked away from the plants.

Michigan regulators last year denied a request to have consumers pay for losses at the Kyger Creek and Clifty Creek power plants, which are part of the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation, or OVEC.

“Any amount that was being paid to OVEC above market was disallowed,” said Devi Glick, an energy analyst at the research firm Synapse Energy Economics who testified in Michigan.

Ohio lawmakers earlier this year repealed a subsidy for the plants that was found to be costing consumers hundreds of millions of dollars.

The OVEC plants are currently sending electricity to Appalachian Power’s customers in West Virginia and Virginia as part of a long-term power purchase agreement. Using Glick’s analysis, adapted from the Michigan case, it is costing them tens of millions of dollars a year.

Appalachian Power paid more per megawatt hour for OVEC power than it did for market-price power in six of the past seven years, the analysis shows.

Glick calculated that Appalachian Power customers have overpaid more than $328 million since 2018, using the same kind of analysis she provided to Michigan regulators.

West Virginia Public Broadcasting performed its own independent analysis using similar data, and found nearly identical results.

“It’s not serving the ratepayers’ best interests,” Glick said of OVEC. “It’s in the owners’ best interest to try to just string it along as long as possible, and as long as they’re allowed to.”

The Virginia State Corporation Commission, that state’s utility regulator, quietly approved Appalachian Power’s contract with OVEC in 2011, finding it to be in the public interest at the time.

Appalachian Power didn’t seek approval from the West Virginia Public Service Commission (PSC), though its service territory overlaps both states. A West Virginia PSC spokesman declined to comment and referred questions to Appalachian Power and OVEC.

Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia, is minority chairman of the House Energy and Public Works Committee. He said the OVEC contract is an example of the state’s nearly exclusive dependence on coal to generate electricity.

“I think that we need a real sober look at why West Virginia’s electric rates have gone up faster than any other state over the last 15 years,” he said. “It’s due to an overreliance on a single energy source that has become more and more expensive compared to alternatives.”

Appalachian Power asked the West Virginia PSC for a rate increase this year, but was denied amid an intense public backlash to the rising cost of power.

Hansen’s efforts to curb the growth in electricity costs have faced high hurdles in a legislature with a pro-coal Republican supermajority in both chambers.

West Virginia Public Broadcasting asked Republicans to comment for this story. None did.

Appalachian Power said the OVEC plants provide capacity and reliability to customers. Many grid experts say electricity demand will rise dramatically in the coming years due to data center demand to power artificial intelligence.

“Electricity from OVEC continues to provide a reliable baseload generation resource, at a stable cost, for our customers,” said Debra Pannell, an Appalachian Power spokeswoman. “Removing existing generation resources from the pool could drive power prices higher and decrease reliability.”

Indiana regulators accepted that position in July, when they approved costs for the OVEC plants that Michigan regulators rejected.

Still, consumer advocates say new demand can be met with natural gas, renewables and battery storage, at a lower cost. Severe winter storms in recent years have shown that coal and gas experienced some of the worst failures.

If nothing changes, the OVEC plants will remain under contract to their owners until 2040.

In Ohio, electricity customers were set to pay close to $1 billion by 2030 to subsidize the OVEC plants, until the repeal of a controversial bill earlier this year.

“We were looking at the fairness and whether it’s fair to charge consumers,” said Maureen Willis, director of Consumers Council of Ohio, which fought to scrap the subsidies. “From our perspective, it’s the investors who should bear the risk, and not the consumers.”

The OVEC plants were at the center of one of the biggest public corruption scandals in Ohio history. Key officials accepted bribes in exchange for bailing out the plants.

Ohio’s former House speaker is serving 20 years in prison as a result of his conviction in the scandal. Two former First Energy executives accused of bribing the former speaker await trial.

The state’s former top utility regulator took his own life while facing trial.

“There was just real criminal wrongdoing, people accepting really crude bribes to pass a bailout for these coal plants that were built in the 1950s,” said Tony Mendoza, a Sierra Club attorney who urged the West Virginia PSC to scrutinize the OVEC contract in 2018.

Cold War To ‘Hot Potato’

The Kyger Creek Plant in Cheshire, Ohio, and the Clifty Creek Plant in Madison, Indiana, were built to help America win the Cold War.

In 1955, they both began sending electrons to the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in southern Ohio, a federal site that enriched uranium for nuclear weapons.

After the Cold War, operations at the Portsmouth plant wound down, and the U.S. Department of Energy had no need for Kyger Creek and Clifty Creek.

OVEC’s owners, including the region’s largest electric utilities, saw them as a way to provide electricity to residential, commercial and industrial customers.

The companies negotiated a contract that would remain in effect until 2040. In it, they agreed to share power produced by the plants at ratepayers’ expense without asking each state utility regulator for approval.

Appalachian Power parent company American Electric Power, First Energy, Duke Energy, and Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities use power from the plants.

AEP has the largest share of the OVEC contract, at 39%, through three affiliates: Ohio Power, Appalachian Power and Indiana-Michigan Power.

Mendoza calls it “wild” that the utilities could lock their customers into the contract for 30 years without asking every state regulator for approval.

“Virginia had a specific requirement that you can’t enter into these long term contracts without pre-approval,” he said. “All the other states should have had that.”

Over the course of a decade, OVEC spent $2 billion on air pollution upgrades on the plants, including scrubbers to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions, and a system to control nitrogen oxide, which causes smog.

OVEC made a bet that it could pass along those costs to customers and still remain profitable by generating electricity.

The timing couldn’t have been worse.

Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, unlocked an abundant supply of cheap natural gas, including in Appalachia.

Coal-burning power plants struggled to compete with the onslaught of gas, and many have retired in the past 15 years, on both sides of the Ohio River.

“If the shale boom had happened 10 years earlier, they would have retired these plants and replaced them with gas units at the site,” Mendoza said. “So what they did is they made a massive investment in coal, kind of, right at the last time period where it made sense to do that economically.”

Glick, the industry analyst, said the plants have frequently operated at a loss – costing more to produce power than they could sell it for in the market. Customers of multiple utilities in multiple states are paying for the losses.

She said with the complicated split in ownership and varying state regulations, no one company wants to stick its neck out and propose any changes to how OVEC operates – including its largest owner, AEP.

“The best analogy is hot potato,” Glick said.

Seeds Of A Scandal

On July 30, 2020, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of Ohio sent out a news release that would be shocking in any state.

A federal grand jury had indicted the Ohio Speaker of the House, Larry Householder, in a $61 million bribery scheme involving two First Energy nuclear power plants and the OVEC coal plants.

Householder wasn’t the only one in trouble. Mathew Borges, the former chairman of the Ohio Republican Party was also indicted, as was Householder’s longtime campaign and political strategist, and two lobbyists.

In the next few years, the scandal widened. Sam Randazzo, the former chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Ohio, was indicted. Then Chuck Jones, the former president and CEO of First Energy, and Mike Dowling, the company’s former senior vice president.

All were alleged to have participated in a racketeering conspiracy to bail out the nuclear plants and the OVEC plants in legislation called House Bill 6.

Householder was convicted in 2023 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He has asked President Donald Trump for a pardon. Borges was sentenced to five years in prison. Facing as many as 20 years in prison, Randazzo, 74, took his own life in April of last year.

Trials for Jones and Dowling start next January.

The companies themselves have also faced a reckoning for their role in the scheme.

In September 2024, First Energy agreed to a $100 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over its participation in the HB 6 scandal.

In January, AEP reached an agreement with the commission to pay a civil penalty of $19 million over its role in HB 6. None of its current or former executives face charges.

In May, Ohio’s Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill to repeal the OVEC subsidies.

Just like in West Virginia, Ohio customers came out ahead in 2022. Russia invaded Ukraine early that year, sending the price of coal and gas worldwide skyward. It wouldn’t last, though.

“They lose money every year, except in really unusual events, like in 2022 when power prices are obscenely high,” Mendoza said of the OVEC plants. “It was hard not to make money if you are a power plant owner in 2022.”

In 2023 and 2024, it was back to business as usual for the OVEC plants, costing Appalachian Power customers more than $165 million combined.

“It’s like you’re using these antique cars to perform normal commuting and driving, and passing those costs on to the ratepayers,” Glick said. “And it’s not happening very efficiently.”

‘A Necessity Of Life’

In April, Trump signed a series of executive orders intended to boost the production and consumption of coal.

In May, the U.S. Department of Energy took the unusual step of ordering a coal plant in Michigan to stay on the grid through the summer instead of shutting down. In August, the department extended its order to November.

Trump’s moves have proved popular with lawmakers in West Virginia, whose support of coal is generally unwavering.

In August, Charlotte Lane, the chair of the West Virginia PSC and a former First Energy lobbyist, wrote to Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in support of his effort to roll back Biden-era limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.

The Biden EPA rule would require costly changes to the OVEC plants or shutting them down.

“The closing of the fossil-fuel, and particularly coal-fired generation, has already, and will continue to, severely reduce the reliability and resilience of the electric grid,” Lane wrote. “If allowed to go forward, the existing rule will cost customers and the economy billions of dollars, and threaten the health and welfare of customers for whom electricity is a necessity of life.”

Despite federal policy shifts to boost coal and throttle the development of renewables, the market trends are not likely to flip back in coal’s favor.

At its peak nearly two decades ago, coal generated half the country’s electricity. By last year, its share had fallen to 16%, pushed aside by natural gas and also wind and solar.

West Virginia is the nation’s No. 2 coal producer behind Wyoming, but it is more reliant on coal for generating electricity than any state.

Appalachian Power has three coal-burning power plants in West Virginia. Together, they can produce multiple times the electricity the OVEC plants contribute to Appalachian Power.

The Kyger Creek and Clifty Creek plants pay workers who mostly live in Indiana and Ohio. The property taxes they pay go to communities in those states – not West Virginia.

Hansen, the West Virginia delegate, said the state could make other choices.

“I think this issue is another example of doubling down on coal because it’s requiring ratepayers to pay for electricity generated by old, inefficient, coal-fired power plants that’s more expensive than electricity that could have been purchased off the grid,” he said.

A Missed Opportunity?

The PSC had a chance to rein in the OVEC costs in 2018, when the Sierra Club’s Mendoza challenged the expenses during an Appalachian Power fuel cost recovery case.

The Sierra Club presented evidence that Appalachian Power customers were paying tens of millions a year more than they should have for electricity from the OVEC plants. It would have been cheaper to buy electricity from PJM, the mid-Atlantic regional market that includes West Virginia and Virginia.

The Sierra Club asked the commission to disallow Appalachian Power from recovering those uneconomic costs.

In 2019, the commission declined to take any action. It hasn’t revisited the issue since and wouldn’t comment.

Mendoza said the commission expressed little interest at the time in looking at the OVEC costs, “and so we at Sierra Club have focused on other states.”

Public anger over rising electricity costs likely influenced a more recent order from the PSC. In August, it told Appalachian Power to freeze customers rates. The company had asked for a $250 million increase in base rates – nearly $24 a month for the average residential user.

The commission received more than 5,000 public comments against the proposal. School boards, county commissions and a majority of the Charleston City Council joined the chorus.

Hansen said state leaders are aware of the discontent over rising electricity costs. But, he said, their solution is to find ways to use more coal, rather than turn to cheaper sources.

“I think there were so many objections filed with the Public Service Commission that they realized they had to do something a little bit different,” he said. “But the utilities are going to continue to come back with more requests for rate increases, and they’re just following the policies that have been set by the legislature.”

Hansen and other Democrats offered a bill earlier this year that would have capped electricity rates. It never got a hearing. By contrast, Virginia lawmakers enacted a bipartisan bill this year to lower Appalachian Power bills. It was signed into law by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.

Hansen said he plans to reintroduce legislation that would more clearly define what it means for the PSC to serve the public’s interest. That, he said, holds the potential for keeping the PSC accountable for the decisions it makes – including its hands-off approach to the OVEC plants.

“I think we need that type of legislation for cases just like this to make sure that the commission is making decisions in the best interest of West Virginians,” he said.",https://wvpublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2605.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 09:58:37.393985

In its most pessimistic scenario, the Rhodium Group projected that emissions from the world's largest economy would decline slightly for the rest of the decade, then flatten out between 2030 and 2040 at just under 4.9 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The research organisation modelled low, mid, and high emissions pathways by weighing factors including economic growth, fossil fuel prices, and clean energy costs and performance.

""The first seven months of the second Trump administration and 119th Congress have seen the most abrupt shift in energy and climate policy in recent memory,"" the authors wrote in their latest annual Taking Stock report.

""After the Biden administration adopted meaningful policies to drive decarbonisation, Congress and the White House are now enacting a policy regime that is openly hostile to wind, solar, and electric vehicles and seeks to promote increased fossil fuel production and use.""

US emissions have been steadily falling since peaking in the mid-2000s at more than six billion tons, thanks to several factors.

The biggest driver has been coal's decline, replaced first by natural gas and more recently renewables. Efficiency gains in vehicles, appliances, and industry, alongside supportive policies, have also played a role.

According to the Rhodium Group, greenhouse gases are now projected to decline 26-35% by 2035 relative to 2005 levels – a ""meaningful shift"" from last year's report, which forecast a far steeper 38-56 % drop.

Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has pursued an agenda centred on boosting fossil fuels and restricting renewables.

A recent tax-and-spending law passed by Republicans in Congress repealed green energy tax credits enacted under former president Joe Biden, while the administration has also been rescinding approvals for wind projects already under construction.

Renewables will continue to grow substantially through 2030 as companies claim expiring clean electricity tax credits, the report forecast, but deployment then diverged under the three different emissions scenarios.

Transportation emissions are projected to fall more modestly, by 8-20% in 2040 compared to 2024, with zero-emission vehicle sales shares rising only slightly.

Meanwhile, oil and gas production is increasingly geared toward exports.

North Carolina’s Senate race is showing early signs of what that might look like.

Michael Whatley, the former chair of the Republican National Committee, entered the race in July. He quickly became the GOP favorite to take on Democrat Roy Cooper, North Carolina’s former two-term governor. But as I report today, Whatley’s long career as an oil and gas industry lobbyist is pulling energy policy to center stage.

North Carolina is a decidedly purple state — Trump won 51 percent of the state to Kamala Harris’ 47.8 percent in 2024, and North Carolina has voted Republican in the past four presidential elections. Democrats have won all but one governor’s race since 1992, and neither party has had a lock on a Senate seat.

And it’s a state that swings in two directions on energy policy. A 2021 law requiring utilities to cut greenhouse gas emissions has been a persistent source of friction in Raleigh. In July, Democratic Gov. Josh Stein vetoed a bill from the GOP-dominated Legislature that sought to repeal part of the emissions reduction requirement. The Legislature overrode the governor’s veto.

Since taking office — with the enthusiastic support of Whatley’s leadership of the Republican Party — Trump has taken a slash-and-burn approach to clean energy and climate policy. Now, the North Carolina race offers a potential test of public sentiment as Republican budget-cutting takes hold, electricity prices rise and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act phases down support for wind, solar and battery projects that would have contributed to the economy.

If the Whatley-Cooper showdown becomes a referendum on Trump policies, Democrats appear poised to seize on Whatley’s role as an advocate for oil companies.

The ‘dominance’ factor

In endorsing Whatley in August, Trump said he would “Champion American Energy DOMINANCE,” while saying the candidate “delivered for North Carolina, especially after the terrible floods,” referring to the 2024 destruction from Hurricane Helene.

Democrats have been working to paint him as an oil lobbyist, Washington insider and unwavering Trump loyalist.

Whatley started lobbying for energy companies in 2005, first focusing on air pollution regulations. His later work included opposing climate change rules for power plants and cars. HBW Resources, the lobbying firm he helped launch in 2009, started and managed the Consumer Energy Alliance, which Whatley led, as well as other pro-oil groups.

His advocacy for offshore drilling, particularly off North Carolina’s Atlantic coast, may be a key point of contention in the race. Whatley lobbied for a quick resumption of offshore drilling after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster and backed Trump’s 2018 proposal to open nearly all U.S. waters for potential production.

The Interior Department is working on a new five-year plan for offshore oil leasing — if the time’s right, fresh fodder for the bellwether Senate race.

Today in POLITICO Energy’s podcast: Josh Siegel breaks down how Trump’s actions against renewable energy are reverberating on Capitol Hill.

Highly paid utility executives face their customers

Customers of the utility company Xcel Energy in Minnesota are pushing back against executive pay packages following a series of electric rate increases, Jeffrey Tomich reports.

Nationally, politicians have seized upon rising electricity prices. President Donald Trump vowed during his campaign to slash electricity costs within a year. Instead, prices are going up. Across the Midwest, consumer advocates and attorneys general are pressing utility regulators to clamp down on multimillion-dollar pay packages.

In Michigan, another state where electric rates have been climbing, Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office last year called out Detroit-based utility DTE for including in rate requests more than $300,000 in costs related to leasing corporate jets.

And in Illinois, consumer advocates challenged a request by gas utility Nicor, a unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co., to include more than $25 million in executive incentive compensation in the rates of Chicago-area customers.

Emergency weather plan faces cuts

A National Weather Service plan to place meteorologists in emergency centers across the U.S. is on the ropes because of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the federal government, Chelsea Harvey writes.

The NWS has lost about 600 staff to layoffs and retirements since Trump implemented a hiring freeze Jan. 20. That’s left the agency scrambling to fill hundreds of vacant posts, and it’s not clear where the embedded meteorologists rank in priorities. The first full-time meteorologist was hired last November in Virginia.

While the program isn’t dead, former NWS staffers say turnover at the agency has hampered progress.

“I’m sure it’s changed,” said Brian LaMarre, a former NWS meteorologist who retired in April.

Trump, turbines and a bird obsession

Trump has railed against wind power for killing birds, among other things. But turbines are far from the biggest threat birds face, Michael Doyle reports.

“They kill all the birds,” Trump said of turbines in Miami Beach in February. He told a Michigan crowd in February 2020 that windmills are “destroying your fields. They’re destroying everything, killing all the birds.”

In fact, cats are the biggest killers of birds, responsible for an estimated average of 2.5 billion deaths a year in the United States. Collisions with turbines, meanwhile, account for an average 234,000 bird deaths a year, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. Electrical lines cause an average of 25.5 million deaths.

The global appetite for electric cars shows no signs of slowing down - in August alone, 1.7 million EVs found new homes, per research firm Rho Motion. This brings the total for the first eight month of the year to 12.5 million.

The August sales break down to 1.16 million fully battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and 570,000 plug-in hybrids (PHEVs).

The US sales data for August painted a picture of a market hitting a record high. But this jump is directly tied to a deadline, and it won't last much longer. American consumers rushed to dealerships to take advantage of the soon-to-expire federal tax credit. This last-minute buying spree boosted short-term numbers, but analysts expect a sharp decline in sales for the final three months of the year.

Some automakers are already planning to scale back production in anticipation of this drop-off. Volkswagen is reportedly pausing production of its ID.4 electric SUV in October, and General Motors is also said to be planning EV production cuts after the tax credit expires.

The situation north of the border in Canada tells a different story about the power of government incentives - or rather the complete lack of it. Canadian EV sales have fallen by a third so far this year after the national iZEV rebate program was paused. Combined with tougher economic conditions, it is now unlikely that automakers will be able to meet the country's EV Sales Mandate for 2026.

As a result, there is a growing expectation that the government will pause the 2026 mandate for review, highlighting how dependent the transition to electric cars remains on consistent policy support. Overall, the North American market is up by a modest 6% year-to-date, mainly thanks to that temporary US sales boom.

Meanwhile, Europe's EV market is growing more consistently, driven by strict emissions legislation rather than short-term consumer credits. The market has grown by 31% so far this year, with both BEVs and PHEVs seeing nearly identical growth rates.

Germany's sales are up 45% and the United Kingdom's up 31%. Other nations are showing even more dramatic growth; sales in Spain have doubled, and Italy has seen a 41% increase. The only major market bucking the trend is France, where sales have fallen by 9% this year.

The European market is also becoming a key battleground for international brands. Chinese automaker BYD is finding success with its Seal U, which has become one of the continent's bestselling plug-in hybrids. The company is doubling down on its European expansion, releasing another model, the Seal 6 PHEV, in September.

In the United Kingdom, sales dipped in August, but this is a normal seasonal trend before new license plates are released in September, which always causes a massive sales spike. British buyers also saw two new models become eligible for a £3,750 EV grant: the Ford Puma Gen-E and the Ford E-Tourneo Courier.

In China, the world's largest market for electric cars, the numbers require a bit of context. While the market grew a healthy 25% year-to-date, year-over-year growth for July and August was relatively slow. This isn't a sign of a weakening market, but rather a reflection of an unusually strong sales period in 2024, which was fueled by a government trade-in subsidy program.

In other news from the region, industry leader BYD has reportedly trimmed its ambitious 2025 sales target from 5.5 million down to 4.6 million vehicles, though it still expects to sell nearly a million of those outside of China.",https://st.arenaev.com/news/25/09/ev-sales-go-up-globally/-1242x621/arenaev_000.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 20:58:04.418138

The Trump administration has also said it would withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, which requires countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and report their progress.
""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.
The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program requires 47 source categories covering 8,000 facilities and suppliers, including power plants, refineries, chemical plants, and fossil fuel/industrial gas suppliers, to calculate and submit their greenhouse gas emissions annually.
The carbon capture and storage industry, which is supported by the Trump administration, said the proposal will undermine an emerging technology backed by industry.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed on Friday a rule to end a mandatory program requiring 8,000 facilities to report their greenhouse gas emissions - an effort the agency said was burdensome to business, but which leaves the public without transparency around the environmental impact of those sources.

The agency said mandatory collection of GHG emissions data was unnecessary because it is ""not directly related to a potential regulation and has no material impact on improving human health and the environment.""

The rule responds to a day-one executive order issued by President Donald Trump aimed at removing barriers to unleashing more U.S. energy, particularly fossil fuels. It is the latest in a series of major regulatory rollbacks undoing previous U.S. efforts to combat climate change.

Earlier this summer, the EPA announced plans to repeal the ""endangerment finding"" that enabled the agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and stationary sources.

If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large facilities, all fuel and industrial gas suppliers, and CO2 injection sites.

The Trump administration has also said it would withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, which requires countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and report their progress.

""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

The Trump administration has also taken steps to end the collection of key environmental databases at the EPA, as well as other federal agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and end greenhouse gas-monitoring satellites operated by NASA.

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program requires 47 source categories covering 8,000 facilities and suppliers, including power plants, refineries, chemical plants, and fossil fuel/industrial gas suppliers, to calculate and submit their greenhouse gas emissions annually. The program also covers CO2 injection sites.

The agency will still require submission of methane emissions data for large oil and gas operations for companies subject to a waste emissions charge.

The carbon capture and storage industry, which is supported by the Trump administration, said the proposal will undermine an emerging technology backed by industry.

""This announcement from EPA will not advance carbon storage - something Administrator Zeldin has publicly supported,"" said Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition. ""This proposed rule endangers millions of dollars in investments from American businesses in these technologies.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108103702-17399006312025-02-18t173452z_1472853843_rc24xcarylcg_rtrmadp_0_usa-trump-epa.jpeg?v=1739900681&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-09-12 18:02:56.840916

Leadership has shown important balance by delivering a package that will stabilize fuel prices, lower energy bills, ensure reliable clean energy and cut pollution while continuing to uplift California’s climate commitment and long-term transition to clean energy.
Finally, it will create a regionalized electricity grid that will make the best use of clean energy and guard against blackouts.","SACRAMENTO – Earlier this week, Governor Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders announced a major deal on historic climate and energy bills that will drive down electricity costs for millions of Californians, stabilize gasoline supply, and continue the state’s world-leading efforts to slash greenhouse gas emissions.

Since that announcement, environmental and energy advocates, labor, business, transit and housing advocates, wildfire survivors, local elected officials and climate leaders alike have shared their support for the bills.

Former Governor Jerry Brown: “Trump & his band of troglodytes are rooting for us to fail. We can’t let that happen. It’s time to pull together to extend our cap & invest program. This is a no brainer. We’ve done it before, let’s do it again.”

Jennifer Granholm, former U.S. Secretary of Energy: “California is keeping its foot on the accelerator toward a more affordable clean energy future, even as the Trump administration does everything possible to stomp on the brakes. This legislative session, California is poised to reauthorize the state’s landmark Cap and Invest program and pass legislation to make electricity more affordable, while ramping up family-sustaining clean energy jobs and replenishing the state’s wildfire fund. Governor Newsom and California’s legislative leaders are leading by example, and the world is watching.”

Tom Steyer, Investor and Climate Champion: “Big step forward: the cap-and-invest bill will be voted on this week. California has the chance to reaffirm its climate leadership and deliver billions in climate funding to our communities. Now we need lawmakers to finish the job.”

Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California State Director, Environmental Defense Fund: “Lawmakers must pass Assembly Bill 1207 which reauthorizes and strengthens California’s cap-and-trade program. California has proven that growing a thriving economy and taking bold climate action can go hand-in-hand. Now, it is time to build on this success. This agreement includes key reforms to bolster its power to cut climate pollution while keeping costs down for families. By aligning the future of cap and trade with the timeline of California’s ambitious emission reduction targets, California is positioned to achieve its climate goals in the most cost-effective way possible. We look forward to working with state leaders and the California Air Resources Board to ensure implementation of price ceiling changes maintains the environmental integrity of the program and balances the affordability needs of families. California is charting a roadmap for a safe and prosperous climate future and others are already following our lead. As federal leadership embraces the largest causes of climate change, California lawmakers must acknowledge if they don’t lead on climate action now, no one else will.”

Melissa Romero, Policy Advocacy Director, CA Environmental Voters: “The Legislature’s extension of cap and invest is necessary to keep California on track toward meeting its climate targets.”

Victoria Rome, California Government Affairs Director, NRDC: “Bills now in print continue California’s leadership on clean energy. While the Trump administration attacks California and undercuts jobs in wind, solar, and electric vehicles, our state leadership came together around a package of bills to lead the clean energy transition into the next decade. With AB 825’s new language, California can share clean energy resources with neighbors across the West, while keeping strong protections for state authority and consumer interests. By reauthorizing the cap and invest program, securing the wildfire fund, and shifting climate incentives from fossil fuels to electrification, California can make electricity more affordable and continue investing in programs that support community resilience. Legislators should support this package and send it to Governor Newsom’s desk right away.”

Chris Hannan, President, CA State Building and Construction Trades Council: “Through the extension of Cap-and-Invest and the dedicated high-speed rail funding secured via AB 1207 and SB 840, California is delivering the largest project labor agreement in the country, creating good union jobs for tens of thousands of Californians. Continued investment in high-speed rail goes beyond infrastructure—it’s an investment in California’s workers, our families, and our environment, reaffirming the state’s position as a leader setting the standard for the rest of the nation. We are grateful for Governor Newsom’s leadership throughout this process.”

Stephanie Wiggins, CEO, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority: “I would like to express my gratitude to Governor Newsom, Assembly Speaker Rivas, Senate President pro Tem McGuire, and the members of the Los Angeles County Legislative Delegation for advancing a comprehensive Cap-and-Invest program for the State of California. Your efforts to protect transit funding during the Cap-and-Invest negotiations will yield significant benefits in Los Angeles County. We look forward to our continued partnership as we advance our common interest to meet the State’s climate goals. Metro is delivering almost $30 billion in infrastructure in Los Angeles County that leverages billions in federal funding. A stable and robust transit investment from the State will help us to bring almost three times that investment and tens of thousand of jobs to our County over the life of the currently proposed Cap-and-Invest Program.”

California Chamber of Commerce: “California’s energy future depends on a grid that’s affordable, reliable, and clean. AB 825 is a key step toward achieving those goals, paving a practical path to participate in a broader regional power market. Those savings matter for family budgets, for small manufacturers navigating thin margins, and for the competitiveness of energy-intensive employers that anchor local economies.”

Rodney Fong, President and CEO, San Francisco Chamber of Commerce: “San Francisco businesses and families need stable energy costs and a reliable grid to thrive. This package delivers affordability and predictability while reinforcing California’s clean energy leadership. We urge the Legislature to act quickly so our communities can realize the savings and competitiveness these reforms will bring.”

Matt Peterson, President and CEO, Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator: “California needs to send clear signals to the country and the world that we remain deeply committed to a clean economy and that’s exactly what the current package of energy and climate bills do. Reauthorizing cap and invest sends a clear market signal that we are committed to accelerating equitable climate innovation, creating a low carbon future, and lowering electricity costs, all crucial for our energy transition.”

Netflix, IKEA, REI Co-op, Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., Ceres, Dignity Health, Anew Climate, The Climate Trust, CA Outdoor Recreation Partnership, Climate Action Reserve, and 20 other climate and business organizations: “Uncertainty about the Cap-and-Trade Program is harming California by forgoing revenues that would have otherwise been used to lower utility bills for ratepayers and directly invest into communities. We support a strengthened Cap-and-Trade Program because restored program certainty will further drive clean investments into California and uphold the state as a global economic powerhouse. Doubling down on California’s successful Cap-and-Trade Program is the smartest way to tackle the climate crisis by prioritizing cost-effective achievement of California’s climate targets, making California most affordable, and supporting California communities. The California Legislature and Governor should act as soon as possible to extend the Cap-and-Trade program this legislative session.”

Housing CA, Transform, Public Advocates, CA Housing Partnership, Move CA, SPUR, Abundant Housing LA, Greenbelt Alliance, Housing Action Coalition, Climate Action CA, San Diego Housing Commission, CA Council for Affordable Housing, Housing Accelerator Fund, The Transit Coalition, Transbay Coalition, Mercy Housing, City of Santa Cruz, YIMBY Action, and 30+ other transportation, housing, environmental, and equity organizations: “Funding affordable housing and sustainable transportation is fundamental to addressing climate change, encouraging economic prosperity for all Californians, and advancing equity. Specifically, we appreciate SB 840 for protecting key programs for affordable housing and transportation…These programs are a vital step toward addressing the needs of frontline communities who have seen very few greenhouse gas emissions reductions or air quality improvements. We also support the $250 million continuous appropriation to the State Air Resources Board for community air protection programs and recognize the need for additional investments and legislation that centers the concerns of environmental justice communities.”

CA Transit Association, CA Alliance for Jobs, CA State Council of Laborers, CA-NV Conference of Operating Engineers, League of CA Cities, CA State Association of Counties, Transportation CA, American Council of Engineering Companies of CA, CA Construction and Industrial Materials Association, Associated General Contractors of CA: “On behalf of the Climate Safe Infrastructure Coalition – a broad coalition of business, labor, local government and transit agencies – we write in support of the proposals to extend California’s Cap-and-Invest program. Given the importance of reauthorizing the Cap-and-Trade program and the progress made in advancing many of our coalition’s funding priorities, including through the maintenance of continuous appropriations for infrastructure, rail, transit, and housing programs, we support the Governor and Legislature acting this session to reauthorize the Cap-and-Trade program and adopt the Expenditure Plan.”

Kern County Board of Supervisors: “Over the past 15 years, Kern has attracted $89 billion in private energy investment by balancing clean energy leadership with locally managed, environmentally responsible permitting. SB 237 strengthens this balanced approach, supporting in-state oil production while California advances its transition to clean energy. We urge your support for SB 237 as a critical component of California’s energy strategy. This legislation will protect consumers from supply disruptions, provide investor confidence in the state’s energy sector, and ensure Kern County continues to lead with both environmental responsibility and energy reliability.”

Ventura County Supervisor Matt LaVere: “I applaud Governor Newsom and the California Legislature for working together on legislation to reduce energy costs statewide. This important work reflects a clear understanding that affordability is top of mind for families across the state, and lowering bills while accelerating the transition to clean, reliable energy is a win-win for all Californians.”

City of Riverside Mayor Patricia Lock Dawson: “As Mayor of the City of Riverside, I believe we can build cleaner communities while also saving people money. That’s why I am proud to support this bold legislative package, which will lower utility bills, strengthen grid reliability, invest in wildfire prevention, boost our local economy, and improve air quality for our residents. I urge the legislature to pass these historic measures and deliver a better quality of life for all Californians.”

City of Inglewood Mayor James T. Butts: “I’m proud that Inglewood has shown what can be accomplished when leadership is focused and determined, from building world class venues to creating jobs and opportunities for our residents. This agreement reflects that same spirit by lowering bills while boosting our economy through investments. I am proud to stand with the Governor on this effort and urge the Legislature to act so communities can feel the support of their government in this critical time”

City of Compton Mayor Emma Sharif: “In Compton we fight every day for resources that give our residents dignity and opportunity. High energy costs and unhealthy air have placed an unfair burden on families for too long. This agreement brings real relief by putting money back in people’s pockets and protecting the health of our neighborhoods. I thank Governor Newsom for prioritizing communities like ours, and I call on the Legislature to deliver this win for working families across California.”

City of Artesia Mayor Ali Taj: “Over the past year, Artesia families have shouldered significant challenges, from the stress of rising costs to the uncertainty of making ends meet. Through it all, I’ve witnessed our community show remarkable strength and unity. Our City Council has worked hard to provide support where it’s needed most, but local governments cannot address these issues alone. We need every level of government to step up and deliver for our residents. This agreement exemplifies how state officials can effectively rise to the challenge, and I extend my gratitude for their bold and committed leadership.”

City of Monterey Park Mayor Vinh T. Ngo: “I support Governor Newsom’s plan to ease everyday Californian expenses on household electricity costs, steady gas prices, while transitioning to cleaner, eco-friendly energy. Now the legislature must act expeditiously to get these bills to the Governor’s desk!”

City of South Gate Councilmember Gil Hurtado: “I’ve always pushed for solutions to help build a more resilient future for our communities. This deal is a great example of that. It shows what is possible when we put people first: lower bills, cleaner air, and more stability for working families. I encourage our legislative leaders to keep this momentum going and pass these bills for a stronger future for all Californians, including the residents in South Gate that I represent”

City of Baldwin Park Councilmember Emmanuel J. Estrada: “For working families, especially in communities like ours, energy affordability and clean air go hand in hand. I applaud Governor Newsom and legislative leaders for advancing a plan that prioritizes both economic fairness and environmental health.”

City of Moreno Valley Mayor Ulises Cabrera: “This historic legislative package shows what’s possible when state and local leaders work together. It addresses the immediate concerns of families struggling with high utility bills, while investing in long-term clean energy and air quality improvements. I urge the Legislature to pass this historic package that will ensure a brighter, cleaner, and more affordable future for all of our communities.”

City of West Hollywood Councilmember John M. Erickson: “Families across California are struggling with rising costs. This deal can help address some of those pressures while also ensuring that California continues positioning itself as the economy of the future.”

Advanced Energy United: “SB 540 is now AB 825, CA Leg, let’s get this done and pass arguably one of the most significant energy bills of the year. Passing this bill will end up saving ratepayers $1 billion per year, improve reliability, and reduce emissions.”

Alex Jackson, Director, American Clean Power-California: “This proposal clears the way to stand up energy markets that can save Californians real money. It means we can work with our neighbors to ensure the West has the affordable, reliable, clean power needed to meet surging demand. Every lawmaker who wants to alleviate California’s rising electric bills should support [AB 825] in floor votes later this week.”

Kelly Trombley, Senior Director of State Policy, Ceres: “Voting for energy affordability and the cap-and-invest program is a no-brainer for legislators wanting to support businesses in California. This package will deliver affordable clean energy, cut emissions, strengthen our economy and support bottom lines. California’s businesses need stability, predictability, and efficiency, which is why we’re asking legislators to vote ‘yes’ today.”

Meredith Alexander, California Coalition of Large Energy Users: “California has a critical choice to make. Passing a workable SB 540 this year will lower costs for ratepayers, improve grid reliability, and expand access to affordable clean energy. But if we don’t authorize market expansion this year, we risk losing these benefits as other Western states join a competing Arkansas-based market–which certainly will NOT create rules friendly to CA or Renewable Portfolio Standards. CA’s environmental and business leaders want a cooperative grid that supports us during heat waves, not to be stranded like Texas. I hope that CA’s leaders don’t fail us in the 11th hour.”

E2: “Amid federal clean energy rollbacks, California lawmakers must extend the cap-and-trade program this year to keep investing in communities, clean tech, and jobs—while advancing the state’s climate goals and leading the nation forward.”

Daniel Barad, Western States Policy Manager, Union of Concerned Scientists: “California lawmakers have the opportunity to improve the lives of their constituents in very real ways by passing the clean energy reliability and affordability package. Leadership has shown important balance by delivering a package that will stabilize fuel prices, lower energy bills, ensure reliable clean energy and cut pollution while continuing to uplift California’s climate commitment and long-term transition to clean energy. Lawmakers should pass this package to reauthorize the state’s cap and trade program, lower energy bills through affordability legislation, and ensure reliable clean energy by sharing resources with our neighbors in the West.”

Jamie Pew, Policy Advisor, NextGen: “We applaud Governor Newsom’s leadership on affordability policies that will keep energy costs under control and stay true to California’s climate commitments. Californians wanted their elected leaders to take action, and that’s exactly what this package does.”

Sam Uden, Co-founder and Managing Director, Net Zero California: “California lawmakers will vote this week on a suite of affordability, climate and grid resilience bills that are nothing short of transformative. This legislation will make the state a national leader in low-cost financing reforms that can make essential grid infrastructure more affordable – a model that can be replicated by states across the country. It will ensure polluters continue to pay their fair share for emissions, generating billions for programs that clean the air and create jobs. Finally, it will create a regionalized electricity grid that will make the best use of clean energy and guard against blackouts. This is what true leadership looks like.”

Hon. Reuven Carlyle, Founder of Earth Finance, Former WA State Senator and author of Washington State’s Climate Commitment Act: “This historic legislation sets the stage to formally link together two of the most effective and proven climate programs globally. California, Quebec and Washington are showing governments and communities around the world that a firm cap on pollution and investing in climate action, affordability and quality of life works. Cap & Invest funds clean air, clean water, reduces wildfires, restores salmon runs, provides transit, timber and agriculture community support and so much more. Our bonds in the West Coast run deep and this legislation shows that together we can continue to grow our economies with a lighter touch on the earth.”

Clayton Munnings, Executive Director, Clean and Prosperous California: “Cap-and-invest is the most affordable way to hit California’s ambitious 2030 climate target. By committing to extending the program beyond 2030, California sends an economic signal to the carbon market that our state is wide open for businesses that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The importance of this economic signal cannot be underestimated as California once again takes on the political mantle of climate leadership in the face of a federal Administration that wants the United States to backslide on clean prosperity.”

Western Freedom: “‘The Pathways Bill’ passed the California Legislature’s Senate Energy, Utilities, and Communications Committee and it did so with the broad support of a powerful coalition of advocates, industry leaders, labor organizations, and community voices behind it. This is what progress looks like when we unite to solve the real challenges that our grid is facing and envision a future with a more reliable, affordable, and resource diverse Western Interconnection.”

Dr. Kyle Meng, Professor of Economics, UC Santa Barbara: “This is the most important U.S. climate policy for the foreseeable future. These bills send a signal that California is doubling down on its climate commitments for the next two decades with a practical approach that meets both climate and affordability goals.”

Pasadena/Altadena Ivy Foundation and Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, Eta Lambda Omega Chapter: “The Wildfire Fund has proven to be more than an accounting tool, it is a lifeline for victims. Without it, the burden of wildfire recovery would fall directly on survivors and on the fragile network of nonprofits and local agencies that rush to fill the gap. It ensures that compensation flows even when disasters are large, frequent, or unpredictable. Our experience with the Eaton Fire demonstrated how quickly disaster can overwhelm local response systems and how vital it is for survivors to have stable, reliable recovery resources that enable them to rebuild, children to return to their school routines, and seniors to regain a sense of home.”

Clergy Community Coalition, Neighborhood Survants, Pasadena Organizing for Progress, Love Land Community Development Corporation, Vida Mobile Clinic, and Altadena residents: “The communities of the Eaton Fire are calling for an immediate extension of the Wildfire Fund to ensure that there are sufficient resources to compensate victims of wildfires like the one our community recently endured.

As victims of a tragedy, losing our homes and more has been traumatic enough. Worrying that there will not be sufficient resources to help us recover and rebuild is unimaginable. Fire victims are weary. They want to go home. They want to know that they can build back what they had. They shouldn’t have to live under the threat of another fire and another utility bankruptcy stalling and shorting their recovery.

We urge you to extend the Wildfire Fund; don’t let history repeat itself.”

Victoria Williams, Founder, Black Education Expo: “The Wildfire Fund is critical to ensure that vulnerable families are not further harmed. Without an extension, recovery will stall, compounding the trauma and disruption caused by the fire. Families need stability to focus on rebuilding not only their homes, but also their educational futures. Our community cannot afford to be left without adequate support during this crucial time.”

Raúl Ibáñez, Program Coordinator, Community Overcoming Recidivism though Education, Pasadena City College: “Our community, which includes individuals working hard to rebuild their lives after incarceration, has now been devastated once again — this time by natural disaster. For many of our students and their families, the Eaton Fire has not only destroyed homes but also threatened the fragile progress they’ve made toward stability and reintegration. In moments like these, safety nets like the Wildfire Fund are essential. We urge you to take swift and compassionate action: extend the Wildfire Fund without delay.”",https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/6C94C750-0DF8-46C6-A8E3-00EA4F1B1ADD.jpeg,N,,2025-09-12 18:02:43.591379

There are three big issues with EPA’s advanced biofuel proposal: The advanced biofuel mandate is too big.
EPA overshot how much domestic advanced biofuel and advanced biofuel feedstock will be available in 2026 and 2027.
However, foreign soy that gets imported and crushed here, would get full credit under EPA’s RFS proposal.
For an administration that prioritizes American energy dominance and affordability, this RFS proposal is way out of line.","The 2026-2027 Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency can only be met if the United States significantly INCREASES imports of foreign biofuels and feedstocks. In short, the RFS proposal is at odds with the President’s ‘energy dominance’ agenda.

There are three big issues with EPA’s advanced biofuel proposal:

The advanced biofuel mandate is too big. EPA overshot how much domestic advanced biofuel and advanced biofuel feedstock will be available in 2026 and 2027.

Here’s the backstory. EPA used old data from 2023 and 2024 — none of the available 2025 data — to arrive at the 2026-2027 RFS proposal. EPA basically just assumed the same growth trends in domestic biofuel feedstock and production from those earlier years would continue into 2026 and 2027. But things have changed, and data from this year show advanced biofuel production in the United States is declining.

The advanced biofuel mandate will require a significant uptick in imports. This ties back to the previous point. If advanced biofuel feedstock and production had kept pace with 2023 and 2024 growth trends, it MIGHT have been possible — in theory — to satisfy the full RFS advanced biofuel mandate with JUST American fuel and feedstocks.

But, as we stated above, EPA’s supply assumptions are wrong. So, the only way to meet the too-big mandate is by INCREASING the amount of advanced biofuel feedstock imported into the United States.

EPA wants to penalize advanced biofuel imports while simultaneously requiring more of them… make it make sense!

For 2026 and 2027, EPA wants to cut the RFS value of any imported biofuels and feedstocks in half, supposedly to boost demand for domestic fuels and feedstocks. But remember, the proposal itself is so big, it’s going to require more feedstock imports.

Fixing the advanced biofuel portion of the RFS doesn’t have to be complicated. In fact, AFPM has given EPA a head start. EPA leaned on an S&P Global Commodity Insights analysis of 2023-2024 data to inform its proposal. AFPM commissioned the same team at S&P Global Commodity Insights to run the same analysis, just of the latest 2025 data. And if EPA simply swaps in the new analysis for its final 2026-2027 RFS, they’d trim down the advanced biofuel portion of the mandate to reflect actual domestic advanced biofuel and feedstock supplies.

EPA should also scrap the plan to de-value imported fuels and feedstocks, especially when the mandate can’t be satisfied without them. There are other issues as well:

Not every advanced biofuel production facility or refinery in the United States has equal or economic access to domestic soybean oil. In fact, it would add significant time and cost if coastal facilities far from the U.S. Heartland were made to run solely on domestic feedstocks.

Refineries and biofuel manufacturing facilities often have long-term feedstock contracts, some of which already extend into the 2026 RFS compliance year. Feedstock origin has never been part of the RFS credit value calculus, and EPA cannot suddenly insert that into the program, particularly since major business decisions have been made in the years since the RFS was enacted based on an understanding of how the federal government viewed and valued biofuel feedstocks.

There are mile-wide loopholes in the import penalty plan. EPA’s proposal would punish U.S. fuel manufacturers who import ‘crushed’ feedstocks into the United States to make biofuels here. It would, likewise, punish imports even if they were made from U.S. soy, but crushed elsewhere, before being imported back into the United States. However, foreign soy that gets imported and crushed here, would get full credit under EPA’s RFS proposal. That’s illogical.

Just on the news of EPA’s proposal, RFS credit prices and soybean oil commodity prices jumped because the market recognizes there’s a scarcity of domestic feedstocks and fuel to fully satisfy EPA’s proposal. For an administration that prioritizes American energy dominance and affordability, this RFS proposal is way out of line.

It's EV Charging - GovTech,"Skip Descant, www.govtech.com, Skip-Descant.html",,,,,https://www.govtech.com/transportation/the-next-must-have-amenity-in-apartments-its-ev-charging,"Installing electric vehicle (EV) charging in apartment building parking lots and garages can be a costly, problematic upgrade that still holds an uncertain payoff in many parts of the country.
The United States includes some 23 million apartments, Theresa Kaiser-White, vice president for asset management and procurement at Willow Bridge Property Company, reminded panelists during a webinar Wednesday organized by Forth Mobility, on the issue of EV charging at multifamily housing.
“We are starting to see developers advancing some of their initiatives for EV charging.
Kaiser-White compared charging to television cable service “in the old days.” “You’ve got to have service,” she said.
“EV adoption has grown extremely rapidly over that few years,” Hazelton said Thursday during a Transportation Research Board panel on EV charging at airports.","Installing electric vehicle (EV) charging in apartment building parking lots and garages can be a costly, problematic upgrade that still holds an uncertain payoff in many parts of the country. But the future is pointing toward charging as an increasingly expected parking amenity.

Onsite charging for EVs has long been seen by many advocates as an essential feature of apartment living, if the technology ever has a chance of breaking into the mainstream.

The United States includes some 23 million apartments, Theresa Kaiser-White, vice president for asset management and procurement at Willow Bridge Property Company, reminded panelists during a webinar Wednesday organized by Forth Mobility, on the issue of EV charging at multifamily housing.

“We are starting to see developers advancing some of their initiatives for EV charging. And then there’s also states that are mandating EV charging,” Kaiser-White said during the panel, as she urged her colleagues in the multifamily housing sector to become more informed about how to plan for charging infrastructure, and the many different approaches this can take. That’s because on the one hand, she said, more states and regions are requiring new construction to at least be wired for chargers; and, on the other, residents are increasingly coming to expect chargers as they would any other amenity.

Kaiser-White compared charging to television cable service “in the old days.”

“You’ve got to have service,” she said. “People demand the service. And it has to be good service. It can’t be marginal.”

That service can take many forms. One approach often used is to simply let a third party install and operate the chargers, with residents paying to use them, much like they might pay to use a charger in a parking garage or retail location. In this model, the property owner or manager could, Kaiser-White said, even work out a revenue-sharing agreement.

That arrangement could raise eyebrows among residents, however, Randy McCourt, honorary member of the Institute of Transportation Engineers, said, noting multifamily housing residents “are really clamoring” for EV charging at a fair rate where third parties are not setting charging rates at an astronomically expensive level.

When a third-party vendor gets involved, “the user is feeling that’s not really good for them,” McCourt said during the panel. “I’m not sure we’ve landed on the right solution quite yet.”

The growth and transition to EVs continues to press forward, experts say. Rex Hazelton, senior associate at the Cadmus Group, a consulting firm, said EV adoption is as high as 30 percent in some parts of the country, as electric vehicles made up about 10 percent of new vehicle sales last year.

“EV adoption has grown extremely rapidly over that few years,” Hazelton said Thursday during a Transportation Research Board panel on EV charging at airports.

Hazelton said he expects to see “a slight slowdown” in the next two years, as federal purchase incentives wind down. However, electric cars will “continue to be a large portion of new vehicle sales.”

It’s not just apartment building owners, managers and developers who need to understand the nature of shared EV charging; charge-point providers and policymakers designing incentive programs also need to understand the many nuances of the multifamily housing industry.

The developer who builds a property with the plan to immediately sell is “a different business model,” and charge-point operators need to understand how the car-charging system they propose or install needs to work within this scenario, said Whitaker Jamieson, a senior specialist at Forth, during Thursday’s panel.

“That is something I have not seen, incentive providers really understanding and creating incentives that are geared toward that specific build-construction setup,” he said. “I want to see more incentive providers looking at these different build scenarios and retrofit situations, based on different market segments, based on the age of the building.”

And likewise, building planners and operators need to understand the nature of charging, various development codes, and the need to collaborate with utilities and other stakeholders before deploying EV infrastructure.

“You just can’t put chargers in and have them there,” Kaiser-White said. “You have to have a systematic approach to managing and monitoring the performance of the chargers, and the maintenance of the chargers.

“There’s a lot more to it than just sticking some chargers in the garage, and trying to satisfy the requirement, or what you believe is a need for residents,” she said.

Data generated through the program is used not only to assist federal and state officials, but also stakeholder groups, affected communities, researchers, and more.

The program—fully authorized under the Clean Air Act—imposes minimal burdens on companies, requiring only that affected sources measure and report their greenhouse gas emissions to EPA, and only applies to sources that emit more than 25,000 metric tons per year of carbon dioxide or its equivalent. The program has been a vital source of data for EPA’s Inventory on Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks, an annual report that the United States government must submit to the United Nations according to international treaty.

The proposed elimination of the program is the latest in a series of actions by EPA to systematically dismantle, delay, or undermine the many climate and clean air standards that safeguard the health and wellbeing of families and communities. These include proposals to disavow EPA’s authority to control greenhouse gases and gut federal vehicle emission standards; draft rules that eliminate strengthened protections against mercury and ozone-forming compounds, delay badly-needed methane standards for oil and gas equipment; and handouts to dozens of coal-fired power plants that allow them to avoid Biden-era limits on air toxics.

In response, Sierra Club’s Director of Climate Policy and Advocacy, Patrick Drupp, released the following statement:

“EPA cannot avoid the climate crisis by simply burying its head in the sand as it baselessly cuts off its main source of greenhouse gas emissions data. The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program has been a major success for more than 15 years, providing incredibly useful emission data without any real drawbacks to affected companies. The agency has provided no defensible reason to cancel the program; this is nothing more than EPA’s latest action to deny the reality of climate change and do everything it can to put the fossil fuel industry and corporate polluters before people. The Sierra Club will oppose this proposal every step of the way.”

But President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending bill this year delayed collection of the so-called Waste Emissions Charge until 2034, and EPA argued in a press release Friday that Trump’s law permitted it to propose suspending the reporting requirement for climate pollution until that year as well.

EPA told POLITICO’s E&E News that it still plans to propose revisions in July 2026 to reporting methodologies for emitters under subpart W of the Inflation Reduction Act — which covers onshore and offshore oil and gas development, processing, transmission, storage, and export activities.

The Friday proposal would exempt about 8,000 entities in a wide array of sectors from reporting their emissions if they exceed 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in a given year. EPA said in its press release that the proposal would save $2.4 billion in compliance costs by canceling a program that is not tied to any regulations and thus “has no material impact on improving human health and the environment.”

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement.

The agency heard from several industry groups prior to releasing the draft who argued that the reporting program benefited them by compiling comprehensive, methodologically sound data across key industries.

Carbon capture and storage developers are among them. Treasury Department rules for tax credits benefiting the industry utilize EPA data drawn from the reporting program to determine eligibility.

“This announcement from EPA will not advance carbon storage — something Administrator Zeldin has publicly supported,” said Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition. “By canceling parts of the [Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program] that are linked to the election of the 45Q tax credit, this proposed rule endangers millions of dollars in investments from American businesses in these technologies.”

Joe Goffman, who led the EPA Office of Air and Radiation in the Biden administration, said it would take years to rebuild the emissions reporting program and database if EPA mothballs it. That would set climate policy back in future administrations, he said, because good data is needed to inform regulations.

“This administration is sort of the Baskin-Robbins of climate policy destruction,” he said in an interview prior to the proposal’s release. “Every day there’s a new flavor of the day. One day it’s the power plant repeal flavor. The next day it’s the car and truck emissions repeal flavor. And the next day after that, it’s the endangerment finding withdrawal flavor.

“Today’s is proposing to shut down … or heavily curtail the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program,” Goffman said.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/37/41/831d7c2d4bc98d5a2ff3b3bc5e2c/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2231529607,N,,2025-09-12 18:03:05.622654

By contrast, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and Texas expect high growth in total electricity demand.
ICF modeled the types of energy generation resources likely to be built in the future, leveraging data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The report notes that advancing these programs could help meet over 10% of the national peak electricity demand by 2030.
Fortunately, many states, localities, utilities, and grid operators are working on solutions—including distributed energy resources and advanced transmission technologies (ATTs)—to modernize the energy grid.","The overall demand for energy from the electric grid in the United States, also known as “load,” is projected to increase 25% by 2030 and 78% by 2050, according to a new report by consulting firm ICF. After over a decade of minimal change, this growth is due to a combination of transportation- and building-sector electrification, the power needs of data centers for artificial intelligence and cloud services, and industrial manufacturing.

To help manage this increase—while keeping energy costs down and reliability high for customers throughout the U.S.—governments and utilities will need to make significant upgrades to the grid and scale innovative energy technologies.

Potential customer impacts

In the report, ICF analyzed four utilities across the country and projects that residential electricity rates for consumers will increase 15% to 40% by 2030, compared with 2025 rates. DTE Energy customers in Michigan, for example, may see an increase from just over 20 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) in 2025 to nearly 30 cents per kWh in 2030. By 2050, electricity rates could double for some utilities.

Regionally, the increase in demand is expected to vary throughout the country. For example, the Intermountain West is expecting relatively modest overall and peak electricity demand growth through 2035. By contrast, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and Texas expect high growth in total electricity demand.

Reliability at risk

Utilities reliably operate the grid by always having more electricity available than they’ll need to meet peak demand—an excess called the “reserve margin.” Reserve margins vary by region but are typically 15%-20% of peak demand. However, many parts of the U.S. will experience below-target reserve margins as soon as 2030, according to the report. And without new resources—such as solar and batteries—for utilities to tap into, new interconnection requests from growing industries, including data centers, may be denied.

New generation is needed

To meet the growing electricity demand, the U.S. will need to build about 80 gigawatts (GW) of additional capacity per year over the next 20 years. That’s up from the 40 GW average of new capacity built annually over the past five years. ICF modeled the types of energy generation resources likely to be built in the future, leveraging data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The report shows that new solar, wind, and battery storage are projected to be installed more than any other types of generation by 2050. Specifically, ICF forecasts that solar will make up around 30% of that new capacity, battery storage will be around 20%, and onshore wind just under 20%. The remaining 30% of new capacity would come from a mix of natural gas, offshore wind, nuclear power, and other resources.

Adding new generation quickly can be a challenge, hindered by supply chain constraints and efforts to make necessary upgrades to transmission and distribution systems. Nevertheless, utilities, grid operators, and local governments are looking to offset the growth in electricity demand by improving how they manage load through solutions like rooftop solar and battery storage—technologies that can generate and deliver energy on site. Other approaches to enhance load management include employing demand response programs – voluntary incentive programs that reduce or shift a customer’s electricity usage during peak periods – and promoting energy efficiency. The report notes that advancing these programs could help meet over 10% of the national peak electricity demand by 2030.

Fortunately, many states, localities, utilities, and grid operators are working on solutions—including distributed energy resources and advanced transmission technologies (ATTs)—to modernize the energy grid. Indiana and Utah are among the states advancing ATT solutions, with each state recently passing laws encouraging ATT deployment to enable their transmission system to deliver more power to customers, including through new generation. Energy researchers are also exploring how new data centers can operate more flexibly to ease the strain on the grid.

With energy demand set to grow rapidly in the U.S., it’s critical that governments and utilities adopt pragmatic and affordable solutions and scale them as fast as possible to reduce the burden on the grid and deliver benefits to consumers.

Building new combined cycle gas turbine plants, which leverage abundant, low-cost natural gas and provide baseload power is also impractical as an immediate solution.
One immediate solution exists: convert natural gas peaker plants to full-time combined cycle gas turbine plants.
The study identifies approximately 30% of U.S. peaker plants as high-potential candidates for conversion to combined-cycle plants, with another 11% showing moderate potential.
The path for increased baseload energy requires a pragmatic and innovative approach, particularly as American technology companies navigate an intensifying AI arms race with global competitors.","The artificial intelligence (AI) arms race is sparking an unprecedented surge in energy demand, with $400 billion of capital investments pouring into new data centers across the U.S. This influx is set to push electricity demand beyond existing supplies, raising critical questions about how to meet the country’s power needs through 2030. As the clock ticks down, it is essential to identify reliable and immediate sources of power.

Intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar, while relatively quick to deploy, cannot reliably meet the round-the-clock power needs of data centers without extensive and expensive energy storage and grid backup.

Advanced nuclear power, such as small modular nuclear reactors, can help provide dispatchable baseload power. Yet, regulatory approval processes are likely to delay operation of small nuclear reactors well into the 2030s.

Building new combined cycle gas turbine plants, which leverage abundant, low-cost natural gas and provide baseload power is also impractical as an immediate solution. Wait times (i.e., interconnection queues) for new combined cycle plants to connect to the grid range from 3 to 5 years, and supply chain constraints for new gas turbines have not only doubled their price but also pushed current orders well into the 2030s, restricting the feasibility of new combined-cycle natural gas plants as a practical solution.

Taken together, these options are too slow, too costly, or too unreliable to meet today’s demand. One immediate solution exists: convert natural gas peaker plants to full-time combined cycle gas turbine plants.

Peaker plants are gas-turbine powered facilities that operate intermittently, meeting peak power demands and running between 5 to 15% of the time. By adding water boilers and steam turbines to these existing plants, they can run continuously and increase their generation capacity by 50%. This conversion process enhances efficiency, extends capacity factor, and supports baseload operation, all while leveraging existing interconnection points, zoning, and infrastructure. As a result, permitting hurdles are reduced compared to new builds. With no significant supply chain constraints for boilers and steam turbines, peaker conversion can occur within a year, presenting an immediate addition of reliable and dispatchable electricity to the grid.

A recent nation-wide assessment of the U.S. gas peaker fleet sought to address this possibility by analyzing the policy environment, site feasibility, economic margins and gas turbine suitability for conversion. The study identifies approximately 30% of U.S. peaker plants as high-potential candidates for conversion to combined-cycle plants, with another 11% showing moderate potential. Converting these plants could add between 858 and 1,170 terawatt-hours to the grid, exceeding projected energy needs of planned data centers through 2030. This conversion strategy offers a practical approach to bridging the gap between energy demand and supply while utilizing existing generation assets.

Although gas peakers are already connected to the grid, they still require grid operator approval for conversion. To unlock the potential of peaker plant conversions, grid operators must streamline their approval processes. A sensible step would be for operators nationwide to offer ‘fast-track’ permissions, or conversion approval within a few weeks, akin to PJM's recent Reliability Resource Initiative. Implementing these simple reforms can unlock a surge in power generation capacity, reducing the likelihood of debilitating blackouts.

The path for increased baseload energy requires a pragmatic and innovative approach, particularly as American technology companies navigate an intensifying AI arms race with global competitors. By recognizing the unique role that gas peaker conversions can play in providing immediate baseload power, we can ensure that the U.S. maintains its edge in the global AI landscape.

Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, the United Nations has required all developed countries to provide data on their domestic emissions each year.","The Environmental Protection Agency moved on Friday to stop requiring thousands of polluting facilities to report the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases that they release into the air.

The E.P.A. proposal would end requirements for thousands of coal-burning power plants, oil refineries, steel mills and other industrial facilities across the country. The government has been collecting this data since 2010 and it is a key tool it uses to track carbon dioxide, methane and other gases that are driving climate change.

The Friday announcement comes as the Trump administration has systematically erased mentions of climate change from government websites while slashing federal funding for research on global warming.

“Alongside President Trump, E.P.A. continues to live up to the promise of unleashing energy dominance that powers the American dream,” Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, said in a statement. “The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape.”

Mr. Zeldin said that ending the program would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in compliance costs. The New York Times could not independently verify that claim; representatives for E.P.A. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Critics said the proposal could hobble federal efforts to fight climate change, since the government cannot reduce emissions if it cannot measure how much is generated and where it is produced.

“With this move, they’re taking away the practical and material capacity of the federal government to do the basic elements of climate policymaking,” said Joseph Goffman, who led the E.P.A.’s air office during the Biden administration.

For the past 15 years, the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program has collected data from about 8,000 of the country’s largest industrial facilities. That data has helped guide numerous decisions on federal policy and has been shared with the United Nations, which has required developed countries to submit tallies of their emissions.

In addition, private companies often rely on the program’s data to demonstrate to investors that their efforts to cut emissions are working. And communities often use it to determine whether local facilities are releasing air pollution that threatens public health.

The E.P.A. proposal would not directly eliminate emissions reporting requirements for certain oil and gas facilities, including pipelines transporting natural gas. That is because those reports were required by Congress as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

Instead, the E.P.A. is proposing to allow those specific oil and gas facilities to postpone emissions reporting until 2034. Congressional Republicans already delayed a related requirement for the facilities to pay a fee on their methane emissions until 2034.

Representatives for oil and gas industry trade and lobbying groups, including the American Petroleum Institute, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The proposal follows a rapid-fire series of steps by the Trump administration to weaken or dismantle environmental protections.

In July, the E.P.A. moved to repeal the scientific finding that underpins the government’s legal authority to combat climate change. And in recent weeks, the White House has directed a half-dozen agencies to thwart the country’s offshore wind industry, a key source of emissions-free electricity.

Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, the United Nations has required all developed countries to provide data on their domestic emissions each year. But the United States missed an April deadline to submit its data, and Mr. Trump began the year-long process of withdrawing from the Paris pact on his first day back in office.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/12/multimedia/12cli-emissions-btcq/12cli-emissions-btcq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 15:59:39.762451

However, that's for global sales.
But despite a number of interesting new EVs from Renault and the various Stellantis-owned French automakers, EV sales in France are down by 6 percent so far, year on year.
EV sales are still growing but barely—up just 6 percent between January and August 2025 compared to the same time period in 2024.
""Global EV sales have now reached 12.5 million units in the opening eight months of the year,"" said Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester.","Here's some good news for a Friday afternoon: For 2025 through August, global electric vehicle sales have grown by 25 percent compared to the same eight months in 2024, according to the analysts at Rho Motion. That amounts to 12.5 million EVs, although the data combines both battery EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs for the total.

However, that's for global sales. In fact, EV adoption is moving even faster in Europe, which has grown by 31 percent so far this year (Rho says that BEV sales grew by 31 percent but PHEV sales by just 30 percent)—a total of 2.6 million plug-in vehicles. In some European countries, the increase has been even more impressive: up by 45 percent in Germany, 41 percent in Italy, and by 100 percent in Spain.

But despite a number of interesting new EVs from Renault and the various Stellantis-owned French automakers, EV sales in France are down by 6 percent so far, year on year.

Tesla has seen none of this sales growth in Europe, however—as we noted last month, this region's Tesla sales collapsed by 40 percent in July.

China had bought an additional 7.6 million new EVs between January and August of this year, although this growth slowed in July and August, partially as a consequence of robust sales during those months in 2024 thanks to Chinese government policies. And as also noted last month, BYD recently saw a drop in profitability and has downgraded its sales target by 900,000 vehicles (down to 4.6 million) for this year.

Meanwhile, here in North America, things aren't quite so hot. EV sales are still growing but barely—up just 6 percent between January and August 2025 compared to the same time period in 2024. August was actually a good month for EV sales in the US as consumers rushed to dealerships to take advantage of the IRS 30D tax credit for clean vehicles, which disappears at the end of September.

That's a result of anti-EV policies put in place by President Trump and Republicans in Congress, and it's far from the only one. Other tax credits intended to foster EV adoption by businesses are also being eradicated. The Environmental Protection Agency is no longer fining automakers for failing to meet fleet averages, and the Trump administration has clawed back money earmarked for charging infrastructure.

""Global EV sales have now reached 12.5 million units in the opening eight months of the year,"" said Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester. ""The North American market has reached a record monthly high as consumers in the US accelerate purchases to take advantage of the tax credit before it expires at the end of September.

Abstract

Our study reviews the current status of global electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure development, emphasizing policy drivers, market dynamics, and technological advancements in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and other regions. By referencing recent research and survey data, the study identifies the primary challenges faced by the current charging infrastructure, including high construction costs, lack of standardization, grid load pressure, low usage efficiency, and insufficient policy support. Specifically, by the end of 2023, the global number of fast charging stations reached 50,000, with an annual growth rate of 50%; China's public charging stations exceeded 1.3 million, with a 44% annual growth rate; the United States had 150,000 public charging stations, while Canada had 30,000. In Europe, the number of public charging stations exceeded 400,000, with Germany having 120,000, the Netherlands having 150 stations per 100 square kilometers, and Norway having 20,000. The study also examines recent advancements in charging technology, such as fast charging stations above 350kW, wireless charging technology, the promotion of ISO 15118 charging standards, and the application of smart grids and energy management systems. Despite numerous challenges, the development of EV charging infrastructure is experiencing unprecedented opportunities. Moving forward, it is essential for governments, enterprises, and research institutions to enhance policy support, technological innovation, market incentives, and international cooperation to collectively improve charging infrastructure and advance the EV market.",https://authorea.com//d197for5662m48.cloudfront.net/assets/blog/default_image-be9182bca7b6523bb6c72e32e5c12398f36b92d81f6ee7882327b6145744bf1f.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 19:01:31.369676

,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-09-12 18:58:11+00:00,New Orleans CityBusiness,U.S. lawmakers are hoping to overhaul the federal permitting process | New Orleans CityBusiness,The Center Square,,,,,https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/blog/2025/09/12/speed-act-energy-permitting-reform/,"Lawmakers in Washington are worried that future could be limited by the cumbersome and costly permitting process that businesses are saddled with and are bringing a package of bills to address it.
If the proposal becomes law, the National Environmental Policy Act would be less scrutinous and easier for businesses and industries to work around.
Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., called the environmental law “broken,” noting that related litigation takes an average of 4.2 years to resolve.
“The delta here is enormous – one of the huge problems is the pace of our permitting process,” Hochman said.
The section “would effectively block most, if not all, challenges,” said Robert Glicksman, a law professor from George Washington University.","On Wednesday, Jim Burke, an energy business man and board member of the Nuclear Energy Institute, said that the future of energy development will happen along the Gulf Coast.

“There’s just an incredible concentration of assets between between here and Baton Rouge, right though Houston,” Burke said at the Tulane Future of Energy Forum.

Lawmakers in Washington are worried that future could be limited by the cumbersome and costly permitting process that businesses are saddled with and are bringing a package of bills to address it.

The U.S. House of Representatives’ Committee on Natural Resources debated that package on Wednesday, with the marquee proposal – the SPEED Act – under particular scrutiny. If the proposal becomes law, the National Environmental Policy Act would be less scrutinous and easier for businesses and industries to work around.

Federal agencies are required to carefully consider the environmental impacts of their actions before making decisions. For major projects such as highways, pipelines, or energy facilities, the law typically requires the preparation of an environmental assessment or a more detailed environmental impact statement that evaluates potential effects on the environment.

Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., called the environmental law “broken,” noting that related litigation takes an average of 4.2 years to resolve. The bill would clarify which federal actions trigger the law’s guidelines, set clearer requirements for environmental reviews, and require lawsuits to be filed within 150 days by someone who participated in the public comment process.

The bill also limits courts’ authority in NEPA cases, allowing judges only to send projects back to agencies for further review rather than halt them outright – a provision Westerman and other Republicans said would prevent projects from being killed by lawsuits.

“This is about durable reforms that create predictability for all energy sources,” said Jeremy Harrell, a lobbyist for ClearPath. Harrell described the bill as “technology-agnostic” and aimed at providing regulatory certainty for everything from fossil fuel projects to renewable energy.

Supporters also framed permitting reform as essential to U.S. economic competitiveness and national security. Lawmakers warned that permitting delays threaten critical energy infrastructure and slow the deployment of new electricity generation just as artificial intelligence is driving a surge in power demand.

“It already takes us 29 years on average to develop a new mine – second worst in the world, just ahead of Zambia,” said Thomas Hochman with the Foundation for American Innovation, adding that slow permitting puts the U.S. at risk of falling behind China in next-generation energy technologies.

Hochman also pointed to Anthropic’s estimate that America will need 50 gigawatts of new electricity for artificial intelligence by 2028, but the last two nuclear plants took 16 years to bring just 2 gigawatts online.

“The delta here is enormous – one of the huge problems is the pace of our permitting process,” Hochman said.

Much of the committee remain unconvinced, and brought their own witnesses before the committee to explain why.

Robert Glicksman, a George Washington University law professor, warned that one section of the bill would make it nearly impossible to challenge deficient reviews.

The section “would effectively block most, if not all, challenges,” said Robert Glicksman, a law professor from George Washington University. “The statute would require any litigant to prove that an agency’s failure to consider their input caused direct harm. But that’s nearly impossible.”

Perhaps most controversial is the bill’s ban on injunctions.

Glicksman said that even if a court finds an agency’s review was inadequate, the project could continue while the analysis is redone.

“That runs contrary to decades of precedent under the Administrative Procedure Act, which gives courts the authority to halt unlawful agency action,” Glicksman said.

By removing this remedy, agencies would have little incentive to take the “hard look” the National Environmental Policy Act requires, knowing projects would move forward regardless of compliance, said Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Maine.",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/09/2.-Depositphotos_oil-rig-well.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 17:00:37.317034

In this evolving landscape, companies that bridge traditional infrastructure expertise with renewable energy innovation are poised to capture significant value.

, a mechanical and electrical construction services leader, has positioned itself at the intersection of these forces through its involvement in high-impact sustainability projects and energy-efficient solutions. While direct financial metrics for 2025 remain opaque, the company's existing initiatives and industry alignment suggest a compelling growth trajectory.

A Proven Track Record in Renewable Energy Infrastructure

EMCOR's Capricorn Ridge Wind Project exemplifies its strategic focus on decarbonization. By generating 662.5 megawatts of clean energy—enough to power 220,000 homes—the project not only reduces carbon emissions but also creates 20,000 metric tonnes of carbon credits, a valuable asset in markets prioritizing environmental accountability EMCOR Group, Inc. - Wikipedia[ 1 ]. Such projects align with global trends: the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that wind energy capacity will expand by 80% by 2030, creating sustained demand for infrastructure developers and operators.

Beyond large-scale renewables, EMCOR's Facilities Services division has demonstrated agility in optimizing energy use for clients. A notable example is its HVAC replacement initiative for a retail banking portfolio, which has cumulatively saved $4.1 million in energy costs EMCOR Group, Inc. - Wikipedia[ 1 ]. These efficiency-driven solutions cater to corporate clients under pressure to meet ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) targets, a market segment expected to grow as institutional investors prioritize climate resilience.

Strategic Positioning in a Fragmented Market

EMCOR's expertise in industrial and energy infrastructure provides a critical advantage. The company's ability to execute complex mechanical and electrical systems—skills honed over decades in sectors like healthcare and data centers—translates seamlessly to renewable energy projects. For instance, the technical rigor required for solar farm grid integration or geothermal plant construction mirrors the precision demanded in traditional infrastructure, a niche where

has long excelled.

While specific market share data for 2023–2025 is unavailable, the company's historical presence in energy infrastructure and its alignment with sector-wide decarbonization goals suggest a strong foundation. Analysts at BloombergNEF note that firms with hybrid capabilities—combining traditional construction with green technology—will dominate the next phase of the energy transition, a category where EMCOR's profile fits squarely.

Growth Potential Amid Regulatory and Market Tailwinds

The absence of 2025 financial data does not negate EMCOR's long-term prospects. Policymakers in the U.S. and Europe are incentivizing renewable energy adoption through tax credits and infrastructure spending bills, creating a favorable environment for contractors. For example, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) allocates $370 billion for clean energy initiatives, directly boosting demand for project developers and service providers. EMCOR's existing renewable energy projects, such as Capricorn Ridge, position it to benefit from these fiscal stimuli.

Moreover, the company's client-centric approach—evidenced by its energy-saving HVAC programs—highlights a scalable business model. As corporations face stricter carbon reporting requirements, demand for energy efficiency services is projected to grow at a 7.5% CAGR through 2030, according to a 2024 report by McKinsey & Company. EMCOR's ability to deliver measurable cost and emissions reductions could further solidify its relevance in this expanding market.

Conclusion

Rho Motion found that EV sales in North America, which included the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, are up 6% year-to-date.

President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act slashed billions of dollars in clean energy tax credits that the Biden administration enacted through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

The megabill, signed by Trump on July 4, eliminated the IRA’s EV tax credits, which offered consumers up to $7,500 for purchasing a new EV and $4,000 for a used one. The credits are set to expire on Sept. 30.

The EV tax credits were intended to encourage consumers to purchase battery-powered vehicles. But Trump and Republicans have criticized the tax incentives and regulations meant to boost EVs as costly and coercive.

“Growth has increased due to an increase in EV sales in the U.S. in August 2025 as consumers bring forward purchases to take advantage of the tax credit before it ends on Sept. 30, 2025. We also expect September sales to be strong, followed by a large reduction in monthly sales in the final quarter of the year,” Rho Motion wrote.

With the tax credits set to expire, industry experts believe EV adoption will likely decline. Still, U.S. automakers such as Ford are adapting to these changes. For instance, the auto manufacturer announced plans to produce a midsize pickup truck priced around $30,000 by 2027.

“Sales in the rest of the world have taken off as emerging markets are leapfrogging over the gas car phase and moving directly to electric vehicles,” Ingrid Malmgren, the senior policy director of Plug-In American, said in a statement.

“EVs are here to stay,” Malmgren added. “They save drivers all over the world money by eliminating reliance on gasoline, they improve air quality in cities globally, and they provide a superior driver experience with less maintenance. They are simply better vehicles.”

Sales are up in other regions such as Europe, with a 31% year-to-date rise in sales. China is also experiencing a 25% year-to-date increase in sales.

Rho Motion noted that year-over-year growth in the Chinese market slowed in July and August in comparison to last year, when there was a significant rise in EV demand due to an increase in subsidies.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25238683773408.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-09-12 15:00:49.078108

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit provides significant relief for Americans by offering up to $3,200 annually for qualifying energy-efficient home improvements – helping households lower utility bills and reduce overall living costs. Families using the credit not only saved an average of $882 on their taxes, but also lowered their energy bills by an average of about $130 in the first year according to analysis by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit was created on a bipartisan basis in 2005, and expanded by Congressional Democrats as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

The letter reads, in part:

If our colleagues on the other side of the aisle truly intended to eliminate [the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit], they should have cited the law correctly – Congress writes laws, and sloppy drafting is no excuse for the Treasury department to substitute its policy preferences for the language of the law as enacted.

Reps. Horsford and Gomez released the following statement:

“The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit has helped Americans make ends meet and modernize their energy consumption for two decades,” Rep. Horsford said. “In Nevada, these tax credits make clean energy solutions affordable for more people, help lower energy bills, protect my constituents from extreme heat in the summer, and foster good paying jobs in our community.

“Despite Republican claims, these credits remain in effect for seven more years,” Horsford continued. “As such, the IRS must update its website to provide accurate information about the program. As President Trump raises costs on everyday goods, the American people deserve to know that programs still exist to help lower energy costs.”

“I wrote the Home Energy Savings Act, which was signed into law through the IRA, because working families deserve to get real savings on their energy bills,” Rep. Gomez said. “Despite Republican efforts to repeal this tax credit, 25C is still the law of the land through 2032, and families should keep getting the savings they were promised. I led the fight to create this credit, and I’ll keep leading the fight to protect it.”

Toyota is adjusting production at its assembly plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, to make room for a pair of upcoming electric SUVs. While the company hasn't released many official details about the duo, it has confirmed to Car and Driver that the new three-row EV SUVs will both be built in Kentucky. Toyota is also making changes at its Indiana plant by expanding production of the Grand Highlander.

""To improve manufacturing efficiencies and better serve customers based on market demand, Toyota is strategically transitioning production across our plants in Kentucky and Indiana,"" the company said in a statement. ""Toyota Indiana will continue to assemble the Grand Highlander in its west plant and add assembly of the vehicle to its east plant to accommodate increased production volume.""

Toyota declined to discuss any details about the forthcoming EV SUVs, but a recent report from Reuters suggests that they will be based on the Land Cruiser and RAV4. The news outlet claims that this is according to an anonymous source familiar with the situation. We've also already seen images of the Land Cruiser Se concept, which could preview a production version. As for the reported RAV4 EV, it could fill the gap between the recently revealed CH-R EV and an electric pickup truck, based on the image above that Toyota showed earlier this year.

Sales in the United States accelerated to reach a monthly record in August, due to the upcoming expiry of the tax credits in September, Rho Motion Data Manager, Charles Lester, said.

Emissions legislation continues to underpin sales in the top European markets Germany and the UK, while China’s growth slowed compared to high sales numbers a year ago at the start of the Chinese trade-in scheme.

“Y-o-y growth in the Chinese market slowed in July-August 2025, however, this is compared to a period where subsidies for the auto trade-in scheme increased last year, which spurred on EV demand in the country,” Lester said.

Year to date, global EV sales rose by 25%, with Chinese growth also at 25% and Europe’s sales increase at 31%.

North American EV sales rose by 6% between January and August, but there is high uncertainty from the fourth quarter onwards, in view of the end of the tax credits.

The rush to take advantage of the tax credits pushed the U.S. electric vehicle market to its highest-ever monthly sales in August, with over 175,000 units sold, Rho Motion’s EV & Battery Database showed earlier this week.

Under the OBBBA, the 30D purchase credit and the 45W leasing credit – both worth up to $7,500 on eligible EVs – will end.

Knight Frank reported that 2024 electricity production was dominated by wind, solar, hydro and nuclear energy, which collectively for almost two-thirds of the generation that year.
“With the UK Government setting an ambitious target of 95% low-carbon energy by 2030, there are significant opportunities for investors, developers and operators.","Drax’s findings are backed up by data from real estate consultancy Knight Frank, which has found a surge in all low-carbon energy industries, with significant opportunities available for investors and developers.

Drax’s report, produced by Imperial College London, shows that the carbon intensity of electricity in Britain has fallen below 100g of CO2 for the first time – and is now more than 350 gCO2/kWh lower than a decade ago.

Solar power is key to this reduction in carbon-emitting energy sources, with more than 3GW of solar generation capacity having been added in Britain since 2023.

The nation now hosts around 20GW of solar. Solar’s contribution to the country’s energy mix reached 40% of the total in May 2025, and June saw the cleanest day in Britain’s history, with grid emissions averaging only 28 gCO2/kWh.

Dr Iain Staffell, lead author of Electric Insights at Imperial College London, said: “This data shows just how quickly Britain’s electricity mix is changing. Solar generation is now making a visible dent in our national emissions, helping to drive the grid to its cleanest quarter on record.

“While these results are encouraging, we cannot underestimate the scale of the challenge. Hotter summers and rising demand for cooling are creating new pressures, and the curtailment of renewable power shows that our infrastructure is not yet keeping pace with supply.

“The next stage of our energy transition is about locking in the benefits of clean generation all year-round by expanding storage, strengthening the grid, and finding smarter ways to balance the system.”

The UK Government is notably striving for gas to account for no more than 5% of the electricity mix by the end of the decade. This is known as its ‘Clean Power 2030’ ambition.

Knight Frank research

Research by Knight Frank has backed up Drax’s report, finding that renewable energy capital is continuing to drive and accelerate the UK energy transition.

Investment in renewables is booming, the report found, with £4.4bn of mergers and acquisitions involving ready-to-build and operational renewable assets occurring in 2024 alone.

Peak capacity of transacted onshore wind, solar and battery storage reached 6GW in 2023, and just below 5GW in 2024.

Knight Frank reported that 2024 electricity production was dominated by wind, solar, hydro and nuclear energy, which collectively for almost two-thirds of the generation that year. However, to continue this trend, the company said, planning approval timescales and grid capacity must significantly improve to facilitate new projects and expand at scale.

Currently, median planning times for projects which obtained planning were 1.5 years for onshore wind, and ten months for large-scale solar ground and ground & roof projects. For those projects which have submitted planning that is not yet granted, refused or withdrawn, the median time to approval sits at one year for large-scale solar, 18 months for onshore wind and eight months for battery energy storage projects.

Construction timelines are also a significant challenge, with around 70% of projects with planning permission ‘awaiting construction’.

Knight Frank’s head of ESG and sustainability research, Flora Harley, said: “There is an encouraging picture across all low-carbon energy sources, with solar standing out as the furthest advanced and gathering pace – there has already been more solar generated in 2025 than in the entirety of 2024.

“With the UK Government setting an ambitious target of 95% low-carbon energy by 2030, there are significant opportunities for investors, developers and operators. Supportive policies such as the Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan and the Solar Roadmap will help galvanise these efforts across the UK and sustain momentum during the transition.”

,North Carolina Environment,2025-09-12 16:50:38+00:00,Reasons to be Cheerful,One City's Race to 'Solarize Everything We Possibly Can' - Reasons to be Cheerful,"Peter Yeung, Elizabeth Ouzts, Chris York",,,,,https://reasonstobecheerful.world/bordeaux-france-solar-city-race/,"“We have to solarize everything we possibly can,” says Claudine Bichet, the deputy mayor responsible for climate change and the energy transition at Bordeaux City Hall.
In 2020, Bordeaux produced just three percent of its own energy.
The future of urban solar in Bordeaux, therefore, is bright.
A survey published in May 2024 found that 87 percent of French people have “a positive opinion of solar energy,” compared with 67 percent for wind energy and 59 percent for nuclear power.
Solar energy also must be combined with other energy sources, adds Reinders, since the sun is not always shining.","Bordeaux’s submarine base was once a place of battle. Built by the Germans during the Second World War, the hulking concrete edifice in the north of the wine-loving French city was used to launch attacks against the Allied Forces. Today, however, the site is fighting a different kind of fight — the war on fossil fuels.

Its ammunition is 6,600 photovoltaic panels, which are being transported from the ground somewhat spectacularly by helicopter, reducing emissions five-fold compared to using cranes, according to city authorities. The outcome: A 13,000 square meter solar power plant, set to produce 3.4 megawatts of energy, which when completed in March 2026 will be the largest urban rooftop solar site in France.

“We have to solarize everything we possibly can,” says Claudine Bichet, the deputy mayor responsible for climate change and the energy transition at Bordeaux City Hall. “We believe in this approach and we are advancing very quickly.”

Since the election of Bordeaux’s ecologist mayor Pierre Hurmic in 2020, the ninth biggest city in France has undergone an electrifying transformation, underlining the growing potential and need for urban solar. In 2020, Bordeaux produced just three percent of its own energy. By the end of 2026, the proportion is set to reach 41 percent, largely thanks to solar but also through other renewables like wind and biomass.

That incredible transformation is in significant part thanks to the 60,000 square meters of solar panels that are being installed across the city on municipal buildings and in public spaces, from the roof of the iconic submarine base to schools, sports facilities, city hall, parking lots, cycle paths and even the city’s ring road.

It’s a shining example of harnessing sun-sourced energy and Bichet is unequivocal about the city’s goal: “We want to become France’s number one solar city.”

By the end of 2025, more than half of the targeted 60,000 square meters of solar will have been completed, according to Bichet, and she says the city is confident of reaching its ultimate goal by the end of next year.

One phase of the strategy focuses on what can go on the city’s rooftops. Bordeaux, which receives nearly 2,100 hours of sunshine per year, estimates that 354 of its municipal buildings are sufficiently exposed to the sun’s rays to produce significant amounts of solar energy.

Then there’s the transport infrastructure. Bordeaux aims to cover as much of its roads and cycle paths in solar as possible. As part of this, it has put out a call for proposals for the creation of a photovoltaic cover over two sections of the 275-kilometer ReVE cycle network, which should provide riders with shade in the summer and shelter from rain in the winter. Similarly, plans are underway to cover the city’s ring road with photovoltaic panels.

Ultimately, Bordeaux authorities see banking on solar energy as an affordable and accessible way of achieving its broader goals of shifting away from more polluting energy sources, like gas, towards electricity in the coming years, as well as cutting carbon emissions enough to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. At the same time, the overall objective is to reduce energy consumption by 25 percent across all sectors and uses.

The approaches to achieving these shifts have been wide-ranging.

For one, it is now obligatory for solar to be used on the roofs of new or renovated buildings of a certain size. The city has also encouraged private and public stakeholders to work together, launching a program in June 2024 to facilitate this called The Alliance for Solar. Dozens of businesses, social housing providers, and public and private developers have signed up, including for a project at the Bordeaux Lac exhibition center.

Bordeaux has also opened an online portal for citizens to propose renewable energy “production acceleration zones” — in effect, allowing them to highlight abandoned roads, undeveloped parking lots or vacant lots where panels can be installed.

“We have to encourage everyone,” says Bichet. “We have had meetings, shared learnings. We want to have an open door.”

Yet one particular challenge for Bordeaux, home to a UNESCO-protected historic center that includes 347 listed buildings, has been finding a way to preserve its buildings while installing solar on them. In-depth studies have been carried out to analyze technical constraints, the weight of frames and, indeed, sun exposure.

“We engaged with UNESCO and with other cities, and we did big internal work [at city hall],” says Bichet. “Heritage must develop with the challenges.”

That has not always been a smooth process. For example, not all of the submarine base’s roof will be covered in panels in order to avoid it being visible from the ground – some claimed it would be a blight on the historic building, yet others, underlining the urgency of the climate crisis, said the entire space should be used. Nonetheless, the project, even with the imposed limitations, will avoid the emissions of 800 tons of CO2 per year (the equivalent of 400 round trips between Paris and New York) and businesses located within a one kilometer radius will be able to consume this electricity at a stable price, providing benefits to locals.

Maria Wall, a professor at Lund University’s Energy and Building Design department in Sweden, commends the “very impressive” developments in Bordeaux and in particular its success in managing to roll out solar while preserving its historic heritage.

In the past, many permits for construction were rejected due to preservation protections, but after obtaining a relaxation of UNESCO rules, that’s changed. In 2024, Bordeaux processed 261 requests for solar panel permits, more than seven times the number in 2020 (37). What’s more, 100 percent of those applications in 2024 received a favorable opinion, compared to 62.2 percent in 2020, reflecting a better institutional understanding of the process.

Technological advances such as the ability to produce transparent solar panels, or ones styled like building materials such as terracotta, have made urban solar integration easier than ever, according to Angèle Reinders, a professor of design of sustainable energy systems at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands.

“These products already exist,” says Reinders, who co-authored a paper on building-integrated photovoltaics in May 2025. “In urban areas, it is already possible to make this integration seamlessly, reducing issues when it comes to building regulations and rules on use of property. If we are serious about the energy transition, then policy makers must help us overcome these permitting issues.”

Reinders also says that developing urban solar faces other restrictions that don’t pose an issue in rural areas, such as limited space and access to land. “Bordeaux’s plan to focus on municipal buildings is great and effective, since they own them,” she explains.

The future of urban solar in Bordeaux, therefore, is bright.

In France more broadly, solar appears to be the most appealing of all energy among the public. A survey published in May 2024 found that 87 percent of French people have “a positive opinion of solar energy,” compared with 67 percent for wind energy and 59 percent for nuclear power. And beginning in 2026, solar installations will be required on a significant number of buildings across the European Union, and public bodies will need to retroactively install solar on their buildings.

Solar energy also must be combined with other energy sources, adds Reinders, since the sun is not always shining. But she estimates that a city like Bordeaux could realistically source as much as 60 percent of its energy from the sun.

“Solar,” she says, “is such an abundant source of power.”",https://reasonstobecheerful.world/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_1995036410-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 14:03:26.175587

Following the tightened tax credit eligibility laws outlined in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, municipalities and communities that are sticking to renewable energy goals are under pressure to accelerate project timelines.

Trenton Allen, whose company Sustainable Capital Advisors works to provide sustainable finance for clean energy developers, alongside other activities, sees a market ready to make the most of what’s left in the short term.

He explained that many municipal clients are now prioritizing projects to ensure they can fully leverage the federal incentives, such as the investment tax credits (ITCs) for projects in the residential and commercial sectors, which are now being removed earlier than planned. Developers are moving quickly through their procurement processes to identify and prioritize projects that are most likely to be completed within the required timeframe to secure maximum incentives.

“Prioritization is incredibly important because it allows developers to focus on projects that have the best chance to get done,” said Allen. “Other projects, they’re moving to the back burner, though these are still nice to have. There really is a prioritization that we’re seeing happening with many of our clients as they try to hit these windows to maximize the incentives that are available from these projects.”

Capital markets appear ready to support a high volume of projects on an accelerated timeline through commercial banks, community banks, and community development financial institutions (CDFIs). Allen said he foresees an uptick in green bonds and other municipal finance projects, as school districts and city governments seek to utilize their own credit to fund these initiatives.

“There’s a great opportunity available here in the short run,” said Allen. “Being able to meet this moment and to accelerate as much of these projects as we possibly can is incredibly important and will strengthen our overall energy system.”

Community solar

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans to claw back all $7 billion of grants that were made available through the Solar For All program. There is likely to be ongoing litigation to decide the fate of these funds, and for now uncertainty clouds the outcome.

Solar For All provided grant funds primarily for community solar projects across the United States. Community solar offers a pathway for residents to access low-cost solar energy without having to invest in an on-site project.

Allen highlighted a successful community solar program in Washington, DC, which has significantly reduced household energy bills, by more than 50% in some cases. These savings provide real cash flow to households.

Beyond help for households struggling with their energy bills, these projects create local economic opportunities through jobs in construction and ongoing operations and maintenance. Here, Allen sees the need for policymakers to ensure a stable market that provides greater certainty to businesses investing in the projects. This is crucial in allowing them to take a long-term view on hiring and other investments – creating a market, not just a one-off project.

State support

As support for renewable energy is being phased out from the federal government’s plans, Allen sees both an opportunity and a responsibility for states to step in and fill this role.

He cited New York as a successful example, highlighting how the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) has helped overcome a major bottleneck by providing funding for early-stage, pre-development costs – the stage where many promising community-led projects fail.

State-level policies like this are key to avoiding a cliff and ensuring that the economic opportunities and energy resilience provided by solar and storage continue to strengthen communities and the overall energy grid. As the renewables sector across the United States adapts to new realities, Allen stressed the importance of using this period of acceleration to build momentum that will endure even after federal tax credits wind down.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/pexels-markusspiske-14384695-1200x800.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 20:01:44.782313

Lawmakers in Washington are worried that future could be limited by the cumbersome and costly permitting process that businesses are saddled with and are bringing a package of bills to address it.

The U.S. House of Representatives’ Committee on Natural Resources debated that package on Wednesday, with the marquee proposal – the SPEED Act – under particular scrutiny. If the proposal becomes law, the National Environmental Policy Act would be less scrutinous and easier for businesses and industries to work around.

Federal agencies are required to carefully consider the environmental impacts of their actions before making decisions. For major projects such as highways, pipelines, or energy facilities, the law typically requires the preparation of an environmental assessment or a more detailed environmental impact statement that evaluates potential effects on the environment.

Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., called the environmental law “broken,” noting that related litigation takes an average of 4.2 years to resolve. The bill would clarify which federal actions trigger the law’s guidelines, set clearer requirements for environmental reviews, and require lawsuits to be filed within 150 days by someone who participated in the public comment process.

The bill also limits courts’ authority in NEPA cases, allowing judges only to send projects back to agencies for further review rather than halt them outright – a provision Westerman and other Republicans said would prevent projects from being killed by lawsuits.

“This is about durable reforms that create predictability for all energy sources,” said Jeremy Harrell, a lobbyist for ClearPath. Harrell described the bill as “technology-agnostic” and aimed at providing regulatory certainty for everything from fossil fuel projects to renewable energy.

Supporters also framed permitting reform as essential to U.S. economic competitiveness and national security. Lawmakers warned that permitting delays threaten critical energy infrastructure and slow the deployment of new electricity generation just as artificial intelligence is driving a surge in power demand.

“It already takes us 29 years on average to develop a new mine – second worst in the world, just ahead of Zambia,” said Thomas Hochman with the Foundation for American Innovation, adding that slow permitting puts the U.S. at risk of falling behind China in next-generation energy technologies.

Hochman also pointed to Anthropic’s estimate that America will need 50 gigawatts of new electricity for artificial intelligence by 2028, but the last two nuclear plants took 16 years to bring just 2 gigawatts online.

“The delta here is enormous – one of the huge problems is the pace of our permitting process,” Hochman said.

Much of the committee remain unconvinced, and brought their own witnesses before the committee to explain why.

Robert Glicksman, a George Washington University law professor, warned that one section of the bill would make it nearly impossible to challenge deficient reviews.

The section “would effectively block most, if not all, challenges,” said Robert Glicksman, a law professor from George Washington University. “The statute would require any litigant to prove that an agency’s failure to consider their input caused direct harm. But that’s nearly impossible.”

Perhaps most controversial is the bill’s ban on injunctions.

Glicksman said that even if a court finds an agency’s review was inadequate, the project could continue while the analysis is redone.

“That runs contrary to decades of precedent under the Administrative Procedure Act, which gives courts the authority to halt unlawful agency action,” Glicksman said.

Practical considerations An obvious question to come out of Georgia Power’s decision is why support fossil fuel plants at a time where the energy transition is more urgent than ever?
However, the RMI spokesperson tells PV Tech Premium that the financial argument in favour of fossil fuels is less compelling than ever.
“This is an example of what we’re seeing nationwide, unfortunately, that is particularly in Republican-led states, there is a lot of political pressure to support expansion of fossil fuels and increased dependence on fossil fuels, flowing from this federal administration on down to the state level,” he says.
However, he also suggests that the business model used by a number of utilities does not necessarily align with greater renewable energy deployment.","However, when asked if this IRP is the sort of robust middle ground that could help set a precedent for effectively transitioning from fossil fuel-dominated resource plans to ones that rely on renewable energy, Sean Garren, chief programs officer at advocacy group Vote Solar, tells PV Tech Premium that, “you’re probably being a little generous to the Georgia Power IRP.”

“This IRP, in general, is skewed so heavily towards fossil fuels and locking us into further dependence on fossil fuels and their unpredictable prices and market dynamics,” he continues. “I think the reality is that the gigawatts of renewable capacity in Georgia Power’s latest IRP are simply an admission that renewable energy is the only technical path forward – or at least a critical piece of the only technical path forward – to serving the growing demand for energy in the US.”

This shift towards greater reliance on fossil fuels in state IRPs is present across the US; when asked about the state of IRPs in the US at present, a spokesperson from think tank RMI says that more states are expecting to use more fossil fuels in the coming years.

“Utility resource plans now include 53GW more gas capacity than wind and solar capacity in 2035,” says the spokesperson. “This is a stark contrast to our Q2 2024 IRP review, in which planned wind and solar capacity in 2035 were nearly equivalent to planned gas capacity.”

With many utilities incentivised by market dynamics and their own business models to support fossil fuel developments, rather than renewable and distributed energy projects, questions remain as to how solar and storage projects can be better integrated into state IRPs in the future.

Practical considerations

An obvious question to come out of Georgia Power’s decision is why support fossil fuel plants at a time where the energy transition is more urgent than ever? To an extent, there is an increasing demand for electricity to meet – figures from RMI show that utilities that updated their IRPs in the second quarter of this year plan to increase project load by 2% through 2035 to meet growing electricity demand – and commissioning as much new power generating capacity from as many sources as possible is a route to meeting this demand.

However, the RMI spokesperson tells PV Tech Premium that the financial argument in favour of fossil fuels is less compelling than ever.

“With demand for gas turbines reaching new heights and tariffs further threatening international supply chains, costs for new gas plants are soaring,” says the spokesperson. “We see that the cost assumptions used in planning are growing year-over-year, and exceeding the levels commonly assumed in industry benchmark studies.”

The spokesperson notes that Duke Indiana’s latest cost estimates for its Cayuga combined-cycle gas plant, for instance, are 36% higher than in previous years’ resource plans. This translates to an US$900 million increase over planned costs for just one fossil fuel plant in the state.

“We know that there’s a multi-year waitlist for new gas turbines, that the waiting time to build out new fossil gas infrastructure to deliver gas to plants is really long and constrained,” adds Garren, highlighting administrative delays associated with fossil fuel plants.

As a result, Garren says that the combination of fossil fuel unattractiveness and the low levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar means that large-scale solar deployment is the only viable option to meet growing electricity demand.

“Solar-plus-energy storage [and] solar-plus-wind, and energy efficiency and demand-side management – where you’re controlling customer demand at certain points – is getting to the place where it provides reliable 24-hour power,” says Garren.

“With that reality, and layering on the economics of solar being so cheap, as compared to any other energy resource, really, you are going to win in any open-source competition, for essentially any type of energy you need.”

Perhaps most strikingly, he suggests that utilities such as Georgia Power are actively working against these trends and the very spirit of competition by continuing to include fossil fuels in their IRPs.

“That is something that the Georgia Power IRP skews away from, open competition, because they want to put their finger on the scale for fossil generation.”

Shifting responsibility from the federal to state governments

With the impracticalities of fossil fuel plants clear, particularly in relation to solar projects, Garren suggests that the political climate of the US is driving utilities towards an otherwise surprising level of support for fossil fuel projects.

“This is an example of what we’re seeing nationwide, unfortunately, that is particularly in Republican-led states, there is a lot of political pressure to support expansion of fossil fuels and increased dependence on fossil fuels, flowing from this federal administration on down to the state level,” he says.

Much of this stems from the president himself, whose “drill, baby, drill” rhetoric has led to significant policy shifts to disadvantage clean energy projects, most notably in the form of shortened timelines for projects to receive tax credits once guaranteed by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Even without this federal-level political context, the RMI spokesperson notes that regulatory frameworks often used by utilities are “a barrier to building the smarter, cleaner, more affordable systems,” suggesting that there are administrative delays, as well as political ones, to shifting to a greater reliance on renewable energy in state-level IRPs.

However, Garren notes that this situation grants individual states greater responsibility for setting their own energy agendas, and while this has proven damaging to the clean energy transition in Georgia, there are examples of other states whose IRPs encourage a greater reliance on clean power.

“If you look at a place like Texas, which is largely skewed towards very open-source [energy generation] – ‘whatever resource can provide what we need, we’ll go with that’ – we’re talking about the fastest-growing renewable energy market in the country,” he explains, calling Texas a “shining example” of how a state government can embrace a technology-agnostic approach to energy policy, and one where the more favourable economics of renewable energy in general, and solar in particular, are evident.

Indeed, Texas’ commitment to its solar sector is well-known, boasting the most new solar capacity additions among the US states in 2024. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) expects the addition of a staggering 37.6GW of new solar capacity in the next five years – again the most in the US – and notes that close to US$60 billion has been invested in the state’s solar sector.

Steps towards the next IRP

Garren suggests that much of the reluctance to include more renewable power in a state’s IRP comes from the risk associated with tinkering with an energy mix that has, historically, relied heavily on fossil fuels.

“There’s a certain risk to doing something that feels new and innovative, like building a programme that uses 100 local solar projects instead of one massive gas plant, and I think that decision-makers are nervous about taking risks at a time in which they know that people’s bills are going to go up,” he says, suggesting that fear of being blamed for rising bill prices is affecting utilities’ decision-making.

“Even if it was a way to save people money, the challenge is you’re so afraid of getting blamed for rising rates that you tend to be reticent to take risks,” Garren ads.

However, he also suggests that the business model used by a number of utilities does not necessarily align with greater renewable energy deployment. A single centralised grid system, where a single operator is responsible for, and profiting from, grid expansion and project approval, is fundamentally different to, say several residential solar-plus-storage systems providing power generation and grid-balancing services, each on a much smaller scale.

“The reality is that building lots of big wires to connect these projects [and] investing in fossil generation that you’re going to operate for the rest of its life are all part of the utility business model that make them a great deal of money,” says Garren.

“Running a more efficient system that needs less wires [and] involves more private customers and developers that are offering different, innovative solutions is an exciting future for us as ratepayers, but it’s a daunting future for utilities that have a very cushy business model now, and are not interested in changing it.”

This has been particularly evident in California in recent weeks, where the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) has called for fines to be levied against two utilities operating in the state for not reaching approval decisions on solar and storage projects within their targeted timeframes.

Speaking at the time, Kevin Luo, policy and market development manager for CALSSA, suggested that the utilities’ business models are so threatened by the growing storage industry, in particular, in California that they see local storage projects as a direct competitor to their commercial interests, and that they are able to “get away with suppressing what they consider to be their competition”.

Ultimately, with states granted more autonomy in setting their energy policies, separating those states’ utilities from older business models that incentivise fossil fuel deployment, and reforming grids to make better use of renewable and distributed energy sources, could yield positive results in the future.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/origis.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 13:00:39.768082

Researchers in China found a way to fix a major flaw in powerful next-gen batteries called lithium-metal batteries. These batteries typically fail fast because of tiny, spiky crystals called dendrites.

Think of these dendrites like damaging rust that grows inside the battery, short-circuiting it and dramatically shortening its life. But the researchers discovered that adding a common amino acid, L-cysteine, acts like a protective shield, effectively preventing this damaging growth from ever starting.

The results are a big deal. The study, published in the journal National Science Review, found that this simple addition ""achieves a 10-times increase in the cycling lifespan"" of the battery.

To put that in perspective, if a current battery lasts for just a few hundred charge cycles, this new technology could push that number into the thousands. For an EV driver, that could mean a battery that lasts for years longer than current models, saving a lot of money on expensive replacements.

This discovery is part of a bigger push happening everywhere. Other scientists are looking at different additives, with one experiment using a key ingredient in sugar to improve battery life. Meanwhile, some companies are creating entirely new designs, like solid-state batteries that remove the flammable liquid altogether for added safety. It's all leading to real-world progress that you can see today; some new EVs can already add 300 miles of range in just 20 minutes.

A better battery isn't just about convenience; it's about making clean energy more practical. A longer-lasting EV helps your wallet and makes it easier to move away from gas cars, which means cleaner air and healthier communities.

That clean energy journey can even start on your own roof. When you're ready, installing solar panels at home means you can generate your own power, bringing your EV charging costs down to almost nothing and protecting your budget from unpredictable energy prices.

EV nickel demand maintaining compound annual growth rates of 12-15% through 2030 anchors long-term investment conviction despite current cyclical pressures.
Long-term structural trends supporting EV growth remain intact, with global EV sales projected to represent half of all vehicle sales by 2035.","The expiration of the US $7,500 EV tax credit on September 30, 2025 will immediately reduce affordability for middle-class EV buyers, slowing adoption rates.

This policy shift is expected to weaken near-term Class 1 nickel demand, the critical input for high-energy-density NMC and NCA battery chemistries.

Nickel markets are already under stress from a 198,000t surplus forecast in 2025, with inventories exceeding 230,000t and prices stuck near US$15,000/t.

High-cost operators, particularly HPAL projects requiring >US$18,000/t, face mounting margin pressures, while low-cost Class 1 producers in stable jurisdictions retain a strategic premium.

Canada Nickel’s Crawford Project exemplifies how large-scale, low-cost, ESG-aligned Class 1 supply in Canada could benefit once policy-driven volatility subsides and long-term EV demand growth resumes.

September 2025 Policy Shift & Immediate Market Implications

The expiration of the federal EV tax credit represents a material policy inflection point for battery metal markets. The ""One Big Beautiful"" spending bill, signed into law on July 4, 2025, formally ended the US$7,500 per vehicle rebate that served as a cornerstone of the Inflation Reduction Act's consumer incentive framework. This policy reversal disproportionately affects middle-class consumers who relied on these incentives to bridge affordability gaps in EV purchases.

The immediate consequence is straightforward: reduced EV sales volumes translate directly into lower Class 1 nickel consumption. High-energy-density batteries powering premium EVs require nickel-intensive chemistries like NMC and NCA, where Class 1 nickel comprises the primary input for cathode materials. Without the tax credit, EV price premiums over internal combustion engine vehicles widen significantly, creating demand elasticity pressure precisely when the market can least absorb it.

Beyond direct sales impact, the policy shift undermines confidence in charging infrastructure investment and broader EV supply chain development. Private capital allocation decisions for battery manufacturing, charging networks, and related infrastructure projects now face heightened uncertainty regarding the pace of US EV adoption. This policy-driven demand destruction compounds existing structural oversupply pressures that have already pushed nickel prices to multi-year lows.

Dollar Strength, Inflation & Commodity Pressure

The Federal Reserve maintains tight monetary policy amid persistent inflation, with headline Consumer Price Index readings at 2.7% and core CPI at 2.9%. Robust employment data has effectively eliminated market expectations for rate cuts in both July and September 2025, reinforcing the likelihood of prolonged higher rates. This ""higher-for-longer"" stance supports continued dollar strength, which depresses demand for dollar-denominated commodities like nickel by making them more expensive for international buyers.

Higher financing costs simultaneously squeeze producer working capital and increase inventory carrying costs. For nickel producers already operating near breakeven levels, elevated borrowing costs compound margin pressures and accelerate potential shutdowns among marginal operations.

Persistent Oversupply & Inventory Build

Indonesia continues expanding nickel output despite periodic quota discussions, leveraging its dominant position in the global supply chain. Combined London Metal Exchange and Shanghai Futures Exchange inventories surpassed 230,000 metric tons by mid-2025, representing a substantial increase from previous years. The International Nickel Study Group projects a surplus of approximately 198,000 tons in 2025, while S&P Global analysis corroborates this oversupply outlook.

Current pricing near US$15,000 per tonne reflects multi-year lows, with brief periods in early 2025 touching levels not observed since 2020. This pricing environment has already forced approximately 32% of global production capacity offline, yet oversupply persists due to continued expansion in low-cost Indonesian operations.

Compounding Effects

The convergence of policy-driven demand reduction, structural oversupply, and persistent dollar strength creates sustained downward pricing pressure that extends beyond typical cyclical patterns. Investor sentiment has turned increasingly defensive, with institutional capital focusing on cost curve durability and jurisdictional resilience rather than growth-oriented metrics. This fundamental shift in risk assessment prioritizes operational sustainability over expansion potential in current market conditions.

Class 1 Nickel Demand in the EV Supply Chain

Class 1 nickel, with purity exceeding 99.8%, serves as the critical input for nickel-intensive battery chemistries that define premium EV performance. NMC and NCA batteries dominate high-range electric vehicles, offering superior energy density that enables longer driving ranges while reducing weight and footprint constraints. These nickel-intensive formulations are projected to constitute nearly 1,320 megawatt-hours of battery capacity by 2030, representing approximately 80% of forecasted EV lithium-ion battery applications.

Battery-grade nickel demand from the EV sector is expected to exceed 50% of total Class 1 consumption by 2027, fundamentally altering traditional demand patterns historically dominated by stainless steel applications. This structural shift toward battery applications carries compound annual growth rate projections of 12-15% through 2030, assuming continued EV adoption momentum.

Substitution & Technology Risk

The increasing market penetration of lithium iron phosphate batteries introduces nickel intensity uncertainty across EV segments. LFP batteries, which contain no nickel, are gaining share in lower-cost EV segments due to improved energy density and cost advantages. This substitution trend reduces overall nickel content per vehicle in certain market segments, creating long-term demand elasticity concerns that compound near-term policy-driven headwinds.

Technology evolution in battery chemistry continues to influence nickel intensity calculations, with manufacturers balancing energy density requirements against cost optimization and supply chain security considerations. These technological transitions introduce additional uncertainty layers beyond policy-driven demand fluctuations.

Global Policy Contrast

China accounts for 63.5% of global nickel demand in 2025, with government strategic stockpiling programs leveraging current low prices to bolster reserves. Chinese ""anti-rat race"" competition policies provide temporary price support, while strategic stockpiling creates demand floors during oversupply periods. Europe's Critical Raw Materials Act explicitly prioritizes supply from allied nations, creating jurisdictional bifurcation in pricing and investment flows.

The contrast between sustained support in China and Europe versus US policy volatility underscores the fragmented nature of global EV policy coordination. While Chinese and European demand may partially offset US reduction, the scale of the American market makes policy-driven demand destruction material for global nickel consumption calculations.

Economics & Cost Curve Stress

Current pricing near US$15,000 per tonne has rendered approximately 32% of global nickel production capacity uneconomical, forcing widespread operational suspensions and mine closures. High-Pressure Acid Leaching projects, which typically require nickel prices above US$18,000 per tonne to generate positive cash flows, face particularly acute margin pressures. Recent shutdowns in Kosovo and the Dominican Republic illustrate the immediate impact of sustained low pricing on marginal operations.

‍

The cost curve compression affects both mining and processing operations, with integrated producers maintaining slight advantages over standalone operations. Working capital constraints intensify as producers face inventory write-downs and reduced cash generation from core operations.

Industry Consolidation Outlook

Prolonged low-price environments historically accelerate industry consolidation through distressed asset acquisitions and strategic combinations. Current market conditions favor well-capitalized, low-cost operators positioned to acquire complementary assets at attractive valuations. This consolidation process typically eliminates marginal capacity while concentrating production among financially resilient operators.

Merger and acquisition activity is expected to intensify as private equity and strategic acquirers target distressed assets with strong fundamental characteristics but challenged near-term economics. Jurisdictional considerations increasingly influence transaction structures and valuations.

Jurisdictional Bifurcation

Western-aligned jurisdictions, particularly Canada and Australia, command increasing premiums among institutional investors focused on supply chain security and ESG compliance. The Inflation Reduction Act and EU Critical Raw Materials Act explicitly incentivize sourcing from allied nations, creating sustained demand premiums for compliant producers.

Conversely, Indonesia's consolidation of global supply positions it as the ""OPEC of nickel,"" with increasing ability to influence global pricing through production management. This geopolitical concentration introduces supply security concerns for Western end-users, reinforcing the strategic value of diversified sourcing from allied jurisdictions.

Mark Selby, Chief Executive Officer of Canada Nickel, observes this dynamic:

""Indonesia is starting to flex its muscle as the OPEC of nickel, which creates opportunities for strategic Class 1 producers in stable jurisdictions like Canada to serve Western supply chains seeking alternatives to concentrated Asian supply""

Market Positioning

Canada Nickel's Crawford Project exemplifies this positioning as the world's second-largest nickel reserve and resource, designed specifically for Class 1 nickel production serving battery applications. The project demonstrates compelling economics with a Net Present Value of US$2.8 billion at an 8% discount rate and an Internal Rate of Return of 17.6%, maintaining viability even under current depressed pricing conditions.

The Crawford operation targets C1 cash costs of US$0.68 per pound with All-In Sustaining Costs of US$1.54 per pound, positioning it among the global cost curve leaders. These metrics provide substantial margin buffers against current pricing volatility while supporting long-term cash generation potential.

Environmental & Development Strategy

Environmental differentiation increasingly matters for Western supply chains, with carbon-negative production capabilities commanding premiums among ESG-focused end-users. Canada Nickel's NetZero Metals initiative aims to deliver carbon-negative nickel production through In-Process Tailings Carbonation technology, potentially sequestering up to 1.5 million tonnes of CO₂ annually. This environmental positioning aligns with increasing ESG requirements among Western battery manufacturers and automotive original equipment manufacturers.

Development execution remains critical during prolonged low-price cycles, with successful operators maintaining project momentum despite challenging market conditions. Near-term development catalysts for Crawford include Front End Engineering Design completion in March 2025, Environmental Impact Statement finalization with federal permits expected by Fall 2025, and production targeting for 2027-2028. The company's ability to advance from fifth drill hole to federal permitting in under six years demonstrates execution capabilities in a challenging regulatory environment.

Strategic Funding & District Scale

Strategic funding arrangements reduce traditional equity dilution concerns that plague many development-stage mining companies during capital-intensive construction phases. Crawford benefits from US$600 million in refundable tax credits from the Canadian government, Samsung SDI's option to acquire 10% with US$100 million funding, and US$500 million Letter of Interest from Export Development Canada as Mandated Lead Arranger. This diversified funding structure positions the project for construction decision without significant shareholder dilution.

District-scale opportunities provide additional strategic value through resource base expansion and operational leverage. Mark Selby, Chief Executive Officer of Canada Nickel, emphasizes this potential:

""Having the kind of district scale which will make Timmins the largest nickel sulfide district in the world, and then being able to take what we build at Crawford and simply cut and paste it four or five times to build what should and could be the world's largest nickel sulfide district production wise, bigger than what Norilsk produces, bigger than what Jinchuan produces today""

The broader Timmins Nickel District encompasses nine separate resources, with the Mann West deposit alone containing over one billion tons with 2 million tons of contained nickel and nearly one million ounces of platinum group metals.

Operational Advantages

Infrastructure advantages matter significantly for operational cost structures, particularly in established mining jurisdictions with existing supplier networks and workforce capabilities. Crawford's strategic positioning in Ontario leverages established mining infrastructure, local supplier networks, and residential workforce capabilities that contribute to operational cost advantages. The proximity to existing communities within an hour's drive enables a residential workforce model that enhances productivity while reducing operational complexity.

The Investment Thesis for Nickel

Policy-driven demand adjustments, exemplified by the September 2025 US EV credit expiry, create near-term headwinds for nickel consumption while leaving structural growth trajectories intact. EV nickel demand maintaining compound annual growth rates of 12-15% through 2030 anchors long-term investment conviction despite current cyclical pressures.

Cost curve pressures disproportionately affect HPAL and marginal producers, accelerating industry consolidation that favors low-cost, well-capitalized operators with strategic positioning. This consolidation process typically eliminates excess capacity while concentrating production among financially resilient players.

Jurisdictional premiums for allied-nation Class 1 supply continue expanding as Western governments prioritize supply chain security through explicit policy incentives. The Inflation Reduction Act and EU Critical Raw Materials Act create sustained demand premiums for compliant producers in stable jurisdictions.

Strategic investment opportunities emerge from the convergence of cyclical pricing pressure and structural demand growth, particularly for ESG-compliant Class 1 producers positioned to serve Western battery supply chains. Canada Nickel exemplifies how large-scale, low-cost, carbon-negative Class 1 supply in stable jurisdictions benefits from long-term structural demand despite near-term policy volatility.

Risk-adjusted positioning favors producers with demonstrated cost competitiveness, jurisdictional advantages, and strategic alignment with Western supply chain security objectives, while maintaining caution regarding high-cost operations exposed to prolonged pricing pressure and geopolitical supply concentration risks.

Policy Inflection & Investor Positioning

The September 2025 EV tax credit expiry illustrates how fiscal policy directly influences commodity demand trajectories, creating immediate market implications that extend beyond traditional supply-demand fundamentals. Near-term pressure on US EV adoption will compound existing oversupply conditions, maintaining downward pricing pressure on Class 1 nickel in an already challenged market environment.

Long-term structural trends supporting EV growth remain intact, with global EV sales projected to represent half of all vehicle sales by 2035. The current policy-driven adjustment period, combined with persistent oversupply, creates cyclical entry opportunities for sophisticated investors willing to navigate short-term volatility in pursuit of structural positioning advantages.

Jurisdictional bifurcation increasingly favors secure, ESG-compliant Class 1 supply from allied nations, creating sustained competitive advantages for strategically positioned producers like Canada Nickel's Crawford Project. Investors must balance near-term policy uncertainty against long-term positioning opportunities as markets undergo fundamental restructuring toward supply chain security and carbon intensity reduction objectives.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64523461a75e4b406281bdba/68b4499a3e9c24345f7983ad_ev.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 12:03:31.943535

Alex Dews is CEO of the Institute for Market Transformation. Opinions are the author’s own.

Since 2000 the United States has grown by 60 million people while GDP has expanded by 170%, yet energy consumption has stayed relatively flat. How did we do that? In part, we made buildings more efficient.

With electricity demand surging, especially from data centers and the growth in artificial intelligence, there is increasing concern over how to meet our power needs while balancing grid resilience, affordability and climate impacts. The supply side of this equation tends to get more attention than the demand side of the equation. How do we get more energy generation across the finish line?

But that’s not a fully informed way to look at the issue; it’s on the demand side that we can make an immediate difference, because increasing energy efficiency in buildings is a proven, scalable solution to both energy affordability and decarbonization. The bottom line is that, for significantly lower cost than new power generation, we can meet a large part of energy demand through improved building energy efficiency and energy use time shifts.

Buildings’ role in energy infrastructure

Buildings use nearly 75% of U.S. electricity and more than a third of natural gas. A McKinsey study, “Powering a new era of US energy demand,” leads with a graphic showing that buildings comprise the majority of demand, but the study does not mention buildings in its analysis or proposed solutions. Similarly, as the federal government wipes out clean energy investments, talk about climate action in this new context largely ignores the role of buildings. A recent episode of the Ezra Klein Show, entitled “Is Decarbonization Dead?” mentions buildings exactly zero times even though they are the largest single end-user of energy.

As many as 8 in ten buildings that will be in use 25 years from now are already built, and the EPA estimates that 30% of the energy used in commercial buildings today is wasted. Older buildings, in particular, represent a huge amount of overall energy use, and a major untapped opportunity to reduce demand.

Of course, supply-side discussions matter because the fuels we use to generate energy offer starkly different paths forward. We can take the path of investing in clean technology that reduces air pollution and helps mitigate the worst effects of climate change. Alternatively, we can prop up fossil fuels at great cost to our physical health and financial well-being. In addition to dirtier air, utility customers may be stuck with the bill for stranded assets if AI turns out to be a market bubble.

But demand determines how much energy we need to produce. In essence, energy efficiency should be thought of as a demand-side infrastructure solution. Greater demand raises prices for all fuel types, and it makes power outages more likely. If there’s one thing everyone agrees on, it’s that we don’t want blackouts while waiting for more power to come online.

Addressing affordability and decarbonization

For a fraction of the cost, time and difficulty of adding new power plants, we can improve the way our buildings use energy. In less than a year, building efficiency and demand flexibility — like pre-cooling buildings on summer days — can make a difference in lowering electric demand, improving affordability and keeping the lights on. By contrast, new transmission lines and power plants typically take more than a decade for design, permitting and construction.

Energy use by the building sector has remained relatively flat for the last 20 years, even while adding more square footage and electric devices. That’s because building codes and appliance standards continually improve, making newly constructed buildings more efficient.

Efficient buildings cost less to run, ­­and with smart lease structures, both the landlord and tenant can benefit. Efficient buildings are also more valuable. Six academic studies found that ENERGY STAR certified buildings earn a 5-16% rental premium, a 6-13% sales price premium and 3-6% higher occupancy.

Furthermore, upgrading less-efficient buildings creates local jobs that can’t be outsourced. These jobs can be done by people with a range of skills and experience. Policymakers can intentionally grow these jobs in areas with limited opportunities and target job training to those residents. In 2024, there were2,290,179 energy efficiency jobs contributing to the U.S. economy, constituting the majority of jobs in the clean energy sector and outnumbering all fossil fuel extraction and processing jobs, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

For anyone who cares about climate action, buildings are critical. In many urban communities, buildings represent 50%-75% of greenhouse gas emissions. That means there is simply no way to meet climate goals without reducing building energy use. And unlike clean energy, most policies that influence building energy efficiency are passed and implemented by states and localities, making them less vulnerable to changes in federal incentives. More than 50 jurisdictions have benchmarking laws that require building owners to track their energy use and 15 have passed building performance standards that set energy reduction targets.

Policymakers should engage both real estate professionals and residents in efforts to improve buildings’ energy efficiency, creating opportunities for greater civic engagement and discussion about the future each community wants to create. Building energy code advancements have been powerful tools for improving newly constructed buildings. Building performance standards, which drive upgrades to existing buildings, have the potential to reduce energy use dramatically. The National Building Performance Standards Coalition is a group of 49 local and state governments committed to passing such policies. If all members of this coalition adopted BPS policies, the energy savings by 2040 could eliminate the need for more than 100 gas power plants.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/IxAsZD6Cx2igjs5ABf6sXmCGfqg2F8N9fQHOXi3SL0k/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNDY4Mzk2NzY2LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-12 13:00:55.622159

TEMISKAMING SHORES, Ontario, September 12, 2025 – Electra Battery Materials is planning to invest nearly $100 million to establish a battery-grade cobalt sulfate refinery in Temiskaming Shores, Ontario. The refinery will be the first of its kind in North America, filling an important gap in the province’s critical mineral and battery supply chains.

Cobalt sulfate is a key input for lithium-ion batteries used across clean technology applications from electric vehicles to large-scale energy storage. This project will expand Ontario’s critical mineral processing capacity and reduce the reliance on imported materials in battery manufacturing.

We are focused on completing North America’s first cobalt sulfate refinery and unlocking the jobs and economic activity that come with it. We are grateful for the support from Invest Ontario, which will help accelerate construction and reinforces confidence in the strategic importance of our project. Establishing a domestic supply of battery-grade cobalt is essential to reducing reliance on foreign-controlled supply chains, safeguarding economic and energy security, and ensuring that Canada plays a leading role in the global energy transition.

Trent Mell

CEO of Electra

Northern Ontario is home to abundant deposits of nickel, lithium, platinum, cobalt and other strategically important raw materials. This vast mineral wealth feeds into a world-class advanced manufacturing sector in the south, making Ontario a natural destination for projects like Electra’s.

Under the leadership of Premier Ford, our government is building a strong, self-reliant economy that integrates Northern Ontario’s vast mineral wealth with Southern Ontario’s manufacturing might. Electra’s investment in Temiskaming Shores will establish an integral link in the province’s critical mineral processing supply chains and fuel the next stages of Ontario’s leadership in electric vehicle battery manufacturing.

Hon. Vic Fedeli

Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade

Subject to reaching a definitive agreement, the investment will be supported with a loan of up to $17.5 million through the Invest Ontario Fund.

Critical minerals are key to securing Ontario’s leadership in clean energy technologies, and advancing their development and processing is a priority for us. Once operational, Electra’s refinery will mark a significant step towards the province’s goal of building a complete, made-in-Ontario critical mineral supply chain.

These programs are part of DOE’s broader strategy to advance American energy independence and scientific leadership by enabling the development of fusion energy technologies on U.S. soil.

Fusion innovation research engine (FIRE) collaboratives

The DOE is awarding $128 million to seven research teams through the FIRE Collaboratives. These virtual, centrally managed teams aim to build an innovation ecosystem focused on fusion energy science and technology. The goal is to close the gap between basic scientific research in fusion and the growing demands of the commercial fusion energy industry.

The FIRE Collaboratives are designed to complement the DOE’s Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) program with private-sector innovation. By doing this, the program aims to accelerate the translation of fusion science breakthroughs into practical, scalable technologies that could lead to the development of commercial fusion power plants.

The DOE expects to invest up to $220 million in total funding for FIRE over four years. The current $31 million allocation is for Fiscal Year 2025, with future funding subject to congressional approval.

Innovation network for fusion energy (INFUSE)

In addition to the FIRE Collaboratives, the DOE is providing $6.1 million to fund 20 projects through the INFUSE program. This initiative is specifically designed to reduce barriers to collaboration between private companies and DOE’s national labs or academic institutions.

The INFUSE program supports projects in various technical areas that are crucial to fusion energy development. These include materials science, laser technology, high-temperature superconducting magnets, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for modelling and simulation. The program also focuses on enabling technologies needed to reduce costs and improve the feasibility of commercial fusion energy.

Each INFUSE project receives between $100,000 and $500,000 and is selected through a competitive peer-review process. Leadership teams at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory manage the program.

Advancing fusion as a viable energy source

Fusion energy promises to replicate the same process that powers the sun, potentially providing a near-limitless, clean, and reliable energy source. Unlike current nuclear power, fusion does not produce long-lived radioactive waste and carries a much lower risk of catastrophic failure.

The Energy Act of 2020 laid the foundation for DOE to pursue stronger public-private partnerships in fusion. Both the FIRE and INFUSE programs reflect this direction, supporting not only scientific innovation but also American manufacturing, energy security, and national defence.

While selections have been announced, funding will only be finalised after negotiations between DOE and the selected applicants. The agency reserves the right to cancel negotiations or rescind selections at any time during the process.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iStock-2160790660-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 12:04:47.320083

He plans to become an approved vendor under Illinois Shines and Illinois Solar for All, and develop residential arrays for the many friends and acquaintances who have asked him about solar.","At 15, Kyle Barber started working at the Captain coal mine in southern Illinois — ​“following in the footsteps of my forefathers,” he says.

It was 1996, and the mine was closing, so his job involved swinging sledgehammers and scrambling down dangerously steep hillsides to retrieve huge rolls of discarded chain-link fence. He knew this was not the industry he wanted to spend his life working in.

Barber had long been fascinated by clean energy; he even won a grade school contest designing a solar canopy to go over highways. After graduating from college, he connected with the southern Illinois solar company AES to learn the trade, and in 2010 founded his own solar company, EFS. In 2017, he began teaching in a solar workforce training program in Peoria, Illinois, that was created by the state’s Future Energy Jobs Act (FEJA), which went into effect that same year.

Now, Barber is spreading the gospel of solar from the Scott Bibb Center at Lewis and Clark Community College in the southwestern Illinois city of Alton, on the banks of the Mississippi River. It’s one of 14 clean energy jobs hubs created by the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), successor to FEJA. And it shows how even in the wake of dire federal cuts to clean energy programs, a well-funded and thoughtfully implemented state program can foster a robust transition to renewables on the local level.

Barber has been on the faculty at Lewis and Clark since February 2020, originally teaching classes on solar through a program funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. After the pandemic, Barber saw interest in the solar training program surge. CEJA allowed the school to bolster its offerings with wraparound social services and basic education, helping a wider range of students overcome barriers and prepare for careers in the industry.

With one of his former students, Richie Darling, Barber cofounded a nonprofit, Solar Workforce Development, to teach courses on solar installation, marketing, technology, and other aspects of the business at CEJA workforce hubs and elsewhere around the state, including Richland Community College in Decatur, where leaders are pinning their hopes on electric vehicle manufacturing.

Darling was this summer named manager of the Alton CEJA hub based at Lewis and Clark. Barber teaches classes there and also owns the residential and commercial solar company BKJ, having sold his interest in EFS.

Another of Barber’s proteges, Austin Frank, founded a solar company called ARF that installed a 100-kilowatt array on the Bibb Center roof. Thanks to federal and state incentives and labor donated by Frank’s company, the system cost the school nothing and saves the institution about $5,000 a month in energy bills, covering 40% of the building’s energy, he said. Frank has hired multiple graduates from Lewis and Clark.

“It all starts with Kyle,” said Darling. ​“It’s like vertical integration. We’re training people in solar, getting contractors set up, and then we have solar on the roof.”

Transitioning from coal

For six decades, residents of Alton breathed pollution from the nearby Wood River coal plant. The plant closed in 2016, taking around 90 jobs with it, and the facility was spectacularly imploded in 2021. Clean energy advocates have proposed a solar farm be built on the site.

Alton was founded more than 200 years ago at the confluence of the Mississippi, Illinois, and Missouri rivers. The city was once a booming industrial and commercial center, but its fortunes have declined as has its population, which now hovers near 25,000, though a smattering of trendy breweries, restaurants, and antique stores attract visitors from the St. Louis area and beyond.

The college qualified to be a workforce training hub under CEJA because the Alton area is home to a closed coal plant and because the state has deemed that the community was historically excluded from economic opportunities. CEJA prioritizes job creation and clean energy deployment in such spots, to make sure the clean energy transition benefits those who were harmed by or left out of the fossil fuel economy.

Advocates applauded the law’s impact at a celebration of the Alton hub at Lewis and Clark last month. ​“Now because of CEJA,” said Francisco Lopez Zavala, climate policy program associate of the Illinois Environmental Council, hubs like the community college ​“are helping to build Illinois’s clean energy future, which in turn makes our air easier to breathe, our communities healthier, and our grid more resilient.”

Under CEJA, students are paid to take the clean energy and related basic skills courses. At Lewis and Clark, students can choose from four tracks: solar, energy efficiency, HVAC/ heat pumps, and a Climate Works pre-apprenticeship program affiliated with labor unions. Since launching last fall, the school’s program has graduated 57 students in 10 cohorts — five focused on solar, one on energy efficiency, one on HVAC, and three in pre-apprenticeship. Ninety-five percent of enrolled students have graduated, and eight companies, including ARF, have already hired graduates.

CEJA also sets aside money to reduce barriers for students, who can apply for funding for everything from car repairs and bus passes to electric bills and child care. This opportunity lasts for a full year after graduation. Each hub has a navigator organization that administers the aid; in Alton’s case, that’s Senior Services Plus, a social service agency that helps people of all ages.

During the August event, current students enthused about the program and the opportunities it creates. In one of the HVAC classes, Michael Mahon Jr. said he wants to set a good example for his daughter, and John Bone said he wants to solve the problems of greenhouse gases and ozone.

Chase Ellinger said that he is excited about the chance for a real career after bouncing between minimum-wage jobs in warehouses, bars, and landscaping. ​“I want to make a better world and contribute to something for real,” he added.

Other students were learning how to build energy-efficient tiny houses in a workshop on the college grounds.

Up on the roof of the Bibb Center, Frank’s employees were installing the latest addition to the solar array. Frank started his career in construction, working with his father. After a number of customers asked them about solar, ​“we were like, ​‘Holy cow, this is the next big thing. We’ve got to get educated,’” Frank said. He enrolled in Lewis and Clark’s solar training program before it was funded by CEJA.

Following his graduation, he founded ARF Solar in 2021 and became an approved vendor for the Illinois Shines and Illinois Solar for All programs created by FEJA and expanded by CEJA. Illinois Shines provides incentives for residential, commercial, and community solar, and Illinois Solar for All offers even more robust support for deploying solar in lower-income or environmental justice areas and hiring employees who meet equity-focused criteria.

ARF has installed systems on fire stations and other municipal buildings around southern Illinois, as well as schools and churches. Frank is also hoping to branch into community solar, which allows individuals to subscribe for access to energy from a shared array.

“The state had my back,” Frank said. ​“It created a program for small contractors like myself to come in and have a safe space where we’re able to grow.”

Opening doors

People with criminal records are among those prioritized for CEJA’s equity-minded incentives, and at Lewis and Clark, multiple students and graduates said the solar training could provide a crucial job opportunity especially given barriers they’ve faced due to their pasts.

“I come from a background of poverty, addiction, and mental illness. I didn’t have anyone to teach me how to do life things,” program graduate Taryn Sensmeyer told visitors. ​“By the time I found recovery, I had created a lot more barriers to entry,” including ​“my colorful criminal history.”

She heard about the program from a friend who described it as ​“this weird thing you are totally going to love,” and she said the friend was right.

“I thought I’d just be showing up to learn how to install solar panels, but I got comprehensive knowledge of the whole industry and a deep passion for the environment.”

She’s now participating in an apprenticeship that will prepare her to become a journeyman electrician.

“For the first time, I can put food on the table without any outside help,” Sensmeyer said. ​“It’s had a ripple effect on everyone I come in contact with.”

Zachary Resmann, a current student in Barber’s class, grew up on an Illinois dairy farm and worked in solar sales. But he felt he was being taken advantage of by out-of-state solar companies flocking to the Illinois market to cash in on incentives, especially for community solar. He joined the CEJA program in hopes of becoming a contractor himself, and his background qualifies him to tap into the law’s equity funds and services. He plans to become an approved vendor under Illinois Shines and Illinois Solar for All, and develop residential arrays for the many friends and acquaintances who have asked him about solar.

“Solar power is power by the people for the people,” said Resmann, who founded the company Resolute Energy Solutions, which helps customers interested in solar, energy efficiency, and other services get quotes and connect with suppliers. ​“With four kids and a felony, it was hard to get hired. This has changed my life and given me hope.”

With such demand plus state incentives and training programs, Barber is confident the solar industry has strong prospects in Illinois, despite federal rollbacks.

“Under CEJA, there is truly no limit to the number of jobs, companies, projects we can create,” he told visitors to Lewis and Clark in August. ​“There is no magic; it’s just hard work and determination to create a cleaner and brighter future here in Illinois.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/IMG_1289.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=8b744f91f46c8bce9510c3207849d6c7,N,,2025-09-12 11:00:50.184368

Supported under ARENA’s Advancing Renewables Program, the initiative focuses on refining Daylight Photoluminescence (DL) imaging to detect panel faults, down to the individual cells, with greater precision and at lower costs.

In contrast to the current practice of performance monitoring through various methods like inverter-level current-voltage data, visual inspection, and other imaging techniques, this assessment will be easier to use than traditional approaches, explained ARENA.

While photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) tests are conducted in carefully designed, light-tight enclosures, Lab360’s DPL imaging technique reduces the need for heavy equipment and simplifies operations. It also scores over the other approach of night-time EL (nEL) imaging, the agency adds.

“This technology (Lab360 DPL imaging) has the potential to significantly reduce the cost and complexity of solar farm diagnostics. By spotting issues early and reducing the need for heavy equipment and associated labour, this innovation helps operators get the most out of their solar panels and supports Australia’s clean energy future,” said ARENA CEO Darren Miller.

Backed by ARENA, Lab360 plans to combine DPL hardware with a commercial drone and related software to create its final product. It has exclusive rights to key UNSW patents and aims to commercialize the technology through this project by developing better luminescence-based testing for large solar farms.

“Once rolled out commercially, first in Australia and then globally, it will be central to ensuring that photovoltaic panels are a reliable and sustainable cornerstone of the future energy mix, by enabling better monitoring, early fault detection and long-term performance of solar assets,” said Lab360 CEO Thorsten Trupke.",https://media.assettype.com/taiyangnews%2F2025-09-12%2F8t8deibx%2FLab360.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-09-12 13:00:43.644061

Strategic Investment Details

TotalEnergies has inked agreements with NextDecade Corporation to acquire a 10% direct stake in the joint venture developing Train 4 of the Rio Grande LNG (RGLNG) facility, strategically positioned in South Texas. Beyond this direct investment, the French energy major will hold an additional indirect stake of approximately 7% through its existing 17.1% shareholding in NextDecade, bringing its total exposure in Train 4 to around 17%.

The Final Investment Decision, reached in collaboration with NextDecade (holding 40%) and prominent partners including Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP, 36.9%), Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC (7.9%), and UAE’s Mubadala (5.2%), green-lights the development of the fourth liquefaction train with an estimated project cost exceeding $7 billion. The financing structure, comprising approximately 40% equity and 60% debt, reflects the industry’s confidence in long-term LNG demand fundamentals.

Expanding US LNG Footprint

This fourth train, boasting a substantial capacity of approximately 6 million tons per annum (Mtpa), will elevate the Rio Grande facility’s total capacity to an impressive 24 Mtpa upon commissioning in 2030. For context, this expansion positions Rio Grande LNG among the largest LNG export facilities globally, competing directly with established players like Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass and Cameron LNG terminals.

“We are very pleased with the FID of RGLNG Train 4. This project from which we will offtake 1.5 Mtpa strengthens our LNG export capacity from the United States,” commented Stéphane Michel, President of Gas, Renewables & Power at TotalEnergies. “It gives TotalEnergies access to competitive LNG thanks to its low production costs.”

The significance of this investment becomes clearer when examining TotalEnergies’ broader US LNG strategy. The company’s involvement in Train 4 will boost its American LNG export capacity to over 16 Mtpa by 2030, substantially enhancing its ability to serve global markets while maintaining its impressive 10% worldwide market share.

Market Context and Competitive Landscape

The global LNG market has experienced unprecedented growth, with demand projected to increase by 3-4% annually through 2030. This surge is driven primarily by Asia-Pacific markets, where countries like China and India are transitioning from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas for power generation and industrial applications.

TotalEnergies’ strategic positioning comes at a critical juncture. The company currently ranks as the world’s third-largest LNG player, managing a global portfolio of 40 million tons annually in 2024. This places it behind industry leaders Shell and Qatar Energy but ahead of major competitors like Chevron and BP in terms of LNG trading volumes and integrated operations.

The Rio Grande project’s competitive advantages are particularly noteworthy. Located in South Texas, the facility benefits from direct access to the prolific Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale formations, ensuring abundant, low-cost feedstock supply. Additionally, the facility’s proximity to major shipping channels provides efficient access to both Atlantic and Pacific markets, a crucial factor in today’s geographically diverse LNG trade.

NextDecade Partnership Strengthens

Matt Schatzman, NextDecade’s Chairman and CEO, emphasized the strategic value of deepening the partnership with TotalEnergies: “We are pleased to have TotalEnergies, our largest LNG customer and equity partner for Phase 1 of Rio Grande LNG, extend their commitment to our project through Train 4. LNG exported by TotalEnergies from our project will provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy to customers around the world.”

This relationship extends beyond mere commercial arrangements. TotalEnergies previously secured a comprehensive Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA) with NextDecade for a 20-year offtake commitment of 1.5 Mtpa from Train 4, demonstrating long-term confidence in both the project’s viability and NextDecade’s operational capabilities.

The French energy giant’s existing involvement in Rio Grande LNG Phase 1 further underscores this commitment. TotalEnergies holds a 16.7% interest in the initial phase, which encompasses three liquefaction trains currently under construction, with commercial operations expected to commence in 2027. From Phase 1 alone, TotalEnergies will offtake 5.4 Mtpa, establishing Rio Grande as a cornerstone of its North American supply portfolio.

Global Energy Transition Implications

The investment aligns seamlessly with TotalEnergies’ broader energy transition strategy. The company has articulated ambitious plans to increase natural gas’s share in its sales mix to approximately 50% by 2030, positioning gas as a crucial bridge fuel in the global transition away from higher-carbon energy sources.

This strategic emphasis on natural gas reflects broader industry recognition of LNG’s role in reducing global carbon emissions, particularly in regions currently dependent on coal for power generation. Studies indicate that switching from coal to natural gas for electricity generation can reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 50%, making LNG a vital component of near-term decarbonization efforts.

TotalEnergies has committed to reducing carbon emissions across its operations while working to eliminate methane emissions associated with the entire gas value chain. The company’s partnership with NextDecade includes provisions for implementing advanced methane detection and reduction technologies at the Rio Grande facility, setting new industry standards for environmental performance.

Infrastructure and Logistics Advantages

The Rio Grande LNG facility’s strategic location offers significant logistical advantages that enhance its competitive positioning. Situated along the Port of Brownsville ship channel, the facility provides direct access to deep-water shipping lanes capable of accommodating the latest generation of ultra-large LNG carriers.

This infrastructure advantage becomes increasingly important as LNG shipping costs represent a significant component of delivered LNG prices. The facility’s location enables efficient access to key demand centers in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, with typical voyage times of 15-20 days to major Asian markets and 7-10 days to European destinations.

Financial and Market Outlook

The LNG market’s robust fundamentals continue to attract substantial capital investment despite cyclical pricing volatility. Industry analysts project global LNG demand could reach 700-800 million tons annually by 2040, driven by ongoing coal-to-gas switching in developing economies and the fuel’s role as a backup for renewable energy systems.

TotalEnergies’ integrated approach across the LNG value chain positions it advantageously in this growing market. The company operates interests in liquefaction facilities across multiple geographic regions, maintains access to over 20 Mtpa of regasification capacity in Europe, and operates extensive trading and LNG bunkering operations.

Conclusion

TotalEnergies’ commitment to Rio Grande LNG Train 4 represents more than a strategic investment—it exemplifies the evolving dynamics of global energy security and the increasing importance of diversified supply chains. As the world navigates the complex transition toward cleaner energy systems, projects like Rio Grande LNG provide essential infrastructure for delivering reliable, lower-carbon energy to markets worldwide.

The project’s 2030 commissioning timeline positions it well to capture anticipated growth in global LNG demand while supporting TotalEnergies’ ambition to maintain and potentially expand its leadership position in the global LNG market. For NextDecade, the continued partnership with TotalEnergies validates its development strategy and provides crucial financial and operational support for one of America’s most ambitious LNG projects.

As global energy markets continue to evolve, strategic partnerships like this one between TotalEnergies and NextDecade will likely become increasingly important in developing the infrastructure necessary to meet growing global energy demand while supporting the transition to cleaner energy sources.

LIUNA members build and operate power plants for utilities across the Upper Midwest, including Minnesota Power.","The Trump administration’s targeting of clean energy is complicating the path to 100% clean electricity in northern Minnesota.

As of now, Minnesota electric utilities are on track to comply with a 2023 state law requiring them to sell only carbon-free power to customers by 2040. But the road ahead looks more challenging — and more expensive — thanks to Republicans’ rollback of several Biden-era efforts to accelerate the transition from polluting power plants.

The One Big Beautiful Bill, signed by President Donald Trump in July, eliminated or severely restricted hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants, loans and tax credits for renewable energy and other low- or zero-emission technologies. The administration has also effectively halted once-routine federal permitting for large-scale wind and solar projects and rescinded permits for some previously approved projects.

The federal turmoil comes at a particularly sensitive time for Minnesota Power, the investor-owned utility serving 150,000 customers across northern Minnesota.

The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission could vote as soon as next month on a proposed merger between Allete, the utility’s parent company, and an investment group led by a subsidiary of BlackRock, the private equity giant.

Earlier this year, BlackRock lost a $17 billion book of business with a Dutch pension fund that was concerned it wasn’t doing enough to address climate risk. At a news conference last week outside Allete’s downtown Duluth headquarters, DFL State Sen. Jen McEwen and environmental advocates questioned BlackRock’s sustainable bona fides, citing its extensive investments in heavy industry and fossil fuels.

Minnesota Power and its prospective buyers beg to differ. BlackRock and CPP Investments say they have committed nearly $5 billion toward Minnesota Power’s infrastructure plans — support the utility says it needs to meet the state’s carbon-free electricity mandate.

“Advancing the clean-energy future requires significant investment and the long-term, experienced investors we have chosen as partners will give us the access to capital needed for this energy transition,” Minnesota Power spokesperson Amy Rutledge told the Minnesota Reformer last month.

Skeptics say it’s far from certain that the buyers will make good on that promise. A judge warned in July that the new owners could pursue “financial engineering” that weakens the utility’s financial position and its transition plan. And Minnesota Power’s long-range strategy relies heavily on new wind power, the technology hurt most by recent federal policy changes. Meanwhile, the utility proposes adding enough new gas-fired generation to power several hundred thousand homes, a deficit it would need to make up through renewable energy purchases from outside its system — potentially at significant cost to ratepayers.

“We still think, for better or worse, that [wind and solar] will be the cheapest way to build new power generation … but the cheapest way to build new power generation will become more expensive, and that is highly inflationary,” Pete Wyckoff, Minnesota Department of Commerce deputy commissioner of energy resources, said in an interview.

Industrial growth could move the clean electricity goalposts

Minnesota Power already generates 50% to 60% of its power from wind, solar and hydroelectric facilities, up from just 5% in 2005. It aims to meet a state mandate for 80% clean energy by 2030 and hit 90% renewables while phasing out coal by 2035.

In a 15-year resource plan filed with the Public Utilities Commission this year, Minnesota Power proposed adding at least 400 megawatts of wind power and 100 megawatts of energy storage capacity to 700 megawatts of renewable resources already under development. The plan would also add about 1,000 megawatts of gas-fired capacity by 2030 and at least 100 megawatts of industrial demand response — paying energy-intensive customers to ramp down their loads when the grid is stressed.

If industrial customers like taconite mills, lumber processors or a possible data center in Hermantown push power demand higher than expected, Minnesota Power could add up to 1,800 megawatts of additional wind, 200 megawatts of additional energy storage and 200 megawatts of solar.

That “Growth Plan” could serve up to 1,100 megawatts of new load over the next decade-plus, the utility says.

Minnesota Power hasn’t said how much of that load could come from large-scale data centers, but Xcel Energy and the state’s largest wholesale electric cooperative say they expect up to 2,300 megawatts of new data center demand by the early 2030s. Data centers could consume as much 12% of U.S. electricity output in 2028, the U.S. Department of Energy said in December.

“We work closely with all our existing and new customer requests on their upcoming energy needs,” Julie Pierce, Minnesota Power vice president of strategy and planning, said in an email. “[We have] a long history of serving some of the largest industrial customers in the country and Northeast Minnesota would welcome additional industry to locate in this part of the state.”

Even if new industrial demand fails to materialize, Minnesota Power’s heavy reliance on wind power — and, to a lesser extent, solar — looks like a vulnerability these days.

President Trump routinely rails against “windmills,” which he blames for spoiling the view from a golf resort he owns in Scotland. Though he supportscarbon-free resources like nuclear and geothermal power, Energy Secretary and former fracking executive Chris Wright is a hardened renewables skeptic who spouts blatant misinformation about solar power and has characterized wind power as a technology in decline despite double-digit global growth.

Minnesota Power is confident it can continue clean energy progress

If Pierce and her team worry that a hostile federal government could derail Minnesota Power’s energy transition plans, they’re not showing it.

“Implementation of new energy projects is a long journey and [we] have a history of navigating permitting and policy changes,” Pierce said.

Minnesota Power has enough capacity to serve customers in the near term and is “committed to meeting the requirements of the Minnesota 2040 law,” she added.

One question the utility will need to answer definitively in the coming years is what to do with the coal-fired Boswell Energy Center, its nearly 1,000-megawatt Iron Range workhorse. Its latest resource plan calls for adding an 85-megawatt solar array in the next few years, converting the smaller of its two operating units from coal to gas by 2030, and developing non-coal options for the larger unit by 2035.

That could mean a range of “firm” carbon-free power sources, such as enhanced geothermal, gas with carbon capture technology, long-duration energy storage and advanced nuclear, Minnesota Power says.

Utilities elsewhere are bullish on small modular reactors, which proponents say are safer and cheaper to deploy than conventional large reactors like those at Xcel’s Prairie Island and Monticello power plants. Boswell is one of hundreds of aging coal power plants in the United States, most of which the U.S. Department of Energy says could feasibly host small nuclear reactors.

“Minnesota Power supports an all-of-the-above energy strategy and is pleased to see the progress being made [on small reactors] … we look forward to learning more as the critical first implementations of this technology are completed,” Pierce said.

Efforts to lift Minnesota’s moratorium on nuclear power development face an uphill climb in the state legislature. The biggest hang-up is the complicated legacy of the “temporary” nuclear waste storage facility on the Prairie Island Indian Community’s doorstep that has effectively become permanent.

State leaders who otherwise support clean energy are skeptical that advanced nuclear will help Minnesota utilities decarbonize by 2040. The most recent U.S. commercial nuclear project took more than a decade to build and ended up billions of dollars over budget, DFL Rep. Larry Kraft noted in an interview.

“Even if things go well, it’s not going to help us for 10 years, and we need to largely decarbonize by then,” Kraft said. “People place too much emphasis on that discussion.”

All roads run through North Dakota?

Among the dozens of Trump administration executive actions that could complicate Minnesota Power’s path is a sweeping July order that requires Interior Secretary and former North Dakota governor Doug Burgum to personally approve permit applications on federal lands. Experts say the order is broad enough to hinder many projects on private lands.

Bergum’s home state got 36% of its electricity from wind in 2023. It’s home to much of Minnesota Power’s existing renewables, which power Minnesota via a 465-mile transmission line. North Dakota is also where the utility hopes to energize a new, 200-megawatt wind farm in about two years.

That project, called Longspur Wind, is “midway through its permitting process with state and local agencies” and positioned to meet the deadline to qualify for federal clean energy tax incentives, Pierce said. Those incentives could reduce the net cost of its power by 2.75 cents per kilowatt-hour, or about 15% of the average retail power price paid by Minnesota customers.

Minnesota Power’s close working relationship with state and local officials in North Dakota should work to its benefit as it seeks approval for Longspur, Kevin Pranis, marketing manager for the Minnesota and North Dakota chapter of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, said in an interview. LIUNA members build and operate power plants for utilities across the Upper Midwest, including Minnesota Power.

“Allete has been doing business in North Dakota for years, so it helps to be a known quantity,” he said. In an ironic twist, Pranis said that good will stems in part from Allete’s ownership of BNI Energy, a North Dakota-based coal miner.

But Longspur could be a rare bright spot in a more challenging environment for renewable energy development toward the end of the decade.

“We think we have a busy two years of projects, but after that it’s less clear,” Pranis said, citing the loss of federal tax incentives and the “weaponization of the permitting process.”

“If your construction start is more than three years out, you’re working through some big questions,” he said. Still, “with our [climate] goals in Minnesota, we’re just going to keep rolling ahead.”",https://d5c1j5k5drfk7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25169563230246-2-2000x1333-1.webp,N,,2025-09-12 11:00:55.216693
,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-09-12 12:06:19+00:00,The New Lede,Rooftop solar is in a slump. Are dark days ahead? - The New Lede,Brian Bienkowski,,,,,https://www.thenewlede.org/2025/09/rooftop-solar-california-utilities-clean-energy/,"In the first quarter of 2025, the trend continued: residential solar installs declined 13% compared to the first quarter of 2024.
“California leaders have basically turned their back on rooftop [solar energy],” Dave Rosenfeld, executive director of the Solar Rights Alliance, said.
The messaging has been a key factor in the current slump hitting rooftop solar, according to solar advocates.
Lyser said NEM 3.0’s intent was to prompt more solar storage — not kill rooftop solar — by making midday solar exports less valuable and evening power more lucrative.
“And rooftop solar customers trend much wealthier compared to other customers, and so we do see this as an equity issue,” she added.","A decade ago Greg Sparks and his wife put 20 solar panels on the roof of their home in California’s Sacramento Valley, hoping that using sunlight to power their electrical needs would reduce their utility bills and help the planet.

“My assumption was that (electrical utility) rates will go up,” Sparks said. “And it was just the right thing to do.”

The panels paid off. Sparks estimates his neighbors now pay about $250 a month for electricity, while his monthly bill is zero. Sparks is one of roughly 1.8 million homeowners who have helped make California a national leader in the adoption of residential solar, typically installed on rooftops.

From 2015 to 2023, California’s small-scale solar capacity, generated largely from residential rooftops and shared community panels on rooftops and solar farms — rose roughly six-fold, according to data from California’s three largest electric utilities. Nationally, small-scale solar capacity grew nearly five-fold over that time frame.

But while supporters champion the benefits of residential solar, including a reduction in reliance on polluting fossil fuels and lower bills, critics say the systems that save money for individual homeowners cause costs to rise for those without the systems as increased rooftop solar creates challenges for utilities that must maintain the stability of a power grid infrastructure with fewer paying customers.

Now, the popularity of residential solar is seeing a steep reversal due to shifting state and federal policies driven by powerful utility interests. And while some say the decline is simply a mild adjustment, others fear the market for residential solar may be on the brink of a long-term slide.

Forty-two states saw a decrease in residential solar installs last year, with residential solar capacity down 39%, according to the most recent report from the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). In the first quarter of 2025, the trend continued: residential solar installs declined 13% compared to the first quarter of 2024. More than 100 solar companies filed for bankruptcy in 2024.

The decreases in home solar installs started before the Trump administration took office in January, but are expected to accelerate given the administration’s moves to gut key clean energy programs and wipe out tax credits for residents installing solar panels, according to analysts. “It’s not looking good. I don’t know how long I’ll take for it to recover,” Grace Wu, an assistant professor in the environmental studies program at University of California, Santa Barbara, said.

California, the leader in adoption, now is leading the reversal. The state accounted for roughly 48% of last year’s nationwide decrease in residential solar installations.

The backpedaling is angering environmental advocates who say every possible solar panel is needed to reduce harmful greenhouse gases generated by traditional energy sources.

“California leaders have basically turned their back on rooftop [solar energy],” Dave Rosenfeld, executive director of the Solar Rights Alliance, said. “As a result, we’re going backwards.”

A charged debate

Overall, solar energy capacity continues to grow in the US, but most of that growth is generated by utilities installing their own solar panels. In 2024, US utilities increased installed solar capacity 60% compared to 2023. Solar power production increased by 25% in 2024 over the previous year, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).

The agency forecasted earlier this year that other energy sources will remain at the same capacity over the next couple years while renewables, specifically solar, will “drive the growth of US power generation.”

Last year, 24 states generated more than 5% of their electricity from solar — California generated the most at 32.4%. These two divergent paths for solar energy generation — increasing at utilities and lagging at homes — is fueling a national debate over the path forward, and nowhere is the debate more charged than in California, the state with the most solar energy, capacity, potential and controversy.

The debate largely boils down to who should pay — and how much. California utilities and regulators argue that incentives for residents with home solar cost residents without solar more than $8.5 billion in electric bills last year. But solar advocates say that number is wrong and there actually is a $1.5 billion net benefit.

Amid the debate, utility rates are rising. The average cost of electricity for US consumers is 5.5% higher today than last year, and an estimated 59 electric and gas utilities raised or are proposing to raise utility bills this year — representing a nearly $38.3 billion increase for consumers.

A July analysis from the non-partisan think tank Energy Innovation predicts new federal policies will increase rates another 9% to 18% by 2035.

In August, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced it was ending a key federal program known as Solar for All, which had earmarked about $7 billion for installation of rooftop solar at an estimated 900,000 lower- and middle-income households.

“California leaders have basically turned their back on rooftop [solar energy].” Dave Rosenfeld, Solar Rights Alliance

Calling the program a “boondoggle,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the agency no longer has the authority or the funds to administer the program. The move followed the passage of the Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which makes significant cuts to solar incentive programs — including ending a tax credit that allowed homeowners who installed solar to deduct 30% of the system’s cost from their taxes.

For Shelly Lyser, the program manager for electricity pricing & customer programs at California’s Public Advocates Office, whose mission is to lower bills for California utility customers, rooftop solar is an important part of the energy mix, but she said rooftop customers need to pay the cost of their service on the grid.

“We believe in having a program where you can have rooftop solar where customers are getting incentives that encourages development … but isn’t six times as expensive as other renewables,” she said.

A long battle

The battle over residential solar began more than a decade ago. In 2012, the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), an association that represents US investor-owned electric companies, had an executive meeting that focused on how to keep making money as more and more residents installed rooftop solar. One bullet point from a presentation made the challenge clear: “How do you grow earnings in this environment?”

That EEI meeting was the unofficial beginning of a campaign: More than a decade ago utilities, often working through EEI, started to change their messaging about rooftop solar. They pushed this message through PR firms, lobbied regulators and lawmakers using model legislation and funded community organizations to amplify talking points about how residential solar shifts costs to those without solar at their home. (EEI did not return requests for a comment.)

The messaging has been a key factor in the current slump hitting rooftop solar, according to solar advocates.

One of the key wins for the utilities came in 2022 in a policy called NEM 3.0 (short for net energy metering). Under NEM 3.0, California regulators slashed rates paid to customers with solar installations for their excess energy by around 75% from previous rates under NEM 2.0, with the idea that it would make bills more affordable for all customers. The change was for anyone who installed solar at their home after April 2023 — while those with it installed before that would get the previous rate for the length of their contracts.

Some major environmental groups — including the Natural Resources Defense Council — agreed with the need for reform, even if they didn’t agree with all of NEM 3.0 changes.

Lyser said NEM 3.0’s intent was to prompt more solar storage — not kill rooftop solar — by making midday solar exports less valuable and evening power more lucrative. “What we most need is to reach those goals as renewables during the peak period of 4 o’clock to 9 o’clock at night, which obviously solar can’t always fill… so you need solar paired with storage,” she said.

“We believe in having a program where you can have rooftop solar where customers are getting incentives that encourages development … but isn’t six times as expensive as other renewables.” -Shelly Lyser, California’s Public Advocates Office

Lyser attributed the downward trend in rooftop solar installation in 2024 to a surge in installations in 2023.

The encouragement for more storage appears to be working.

Terrie Prosper, director of strategic communications for the California Public Utilities Commission, which has authority over the state’s investor-owned utilities, said “the percentage of solar installs that now include battery storage is up to 60% of rooftop solar installations as of 2024 in comparison to 10% under NEM 2.0,” citing a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory May report.

Elaine Kahan, a California Energy Commission spokeswoman, said while rooftop solar is an important part of the state’s resource portfolio, “it comprises a small portion compared to utility scale solar.”

She said early data trends from the commission for the first quarter of 2025 show residential solar rates closer to what they were four years ago before the slump.

But NEM 3.0’s future hangs in the balance: the California Supreme Court in August sided with environmental groups who challenged an earlier ruling on NEM 3.0 and the state’s Court of Appeal will rehear the case. While rooftop solar’s spread in California could hinge on that decision, the arguments that underpin it — how to properly and fairly incentivize and compensate rooftop solar energy — continue.

Cost-shift controversy

Lyser said her office calculates residential solar’s value by crediting avoided costs such as generation, distribution and emissions and then subtracting what solar customers still impose on the grid: fixed costs, backup capacity, maintenance, nighttime use. The gap is what they call the “cost-shift.” The Public Advocates Office estimated an $8.5 billion cost-shift in 2024 to utility customers without rooftop solar.

Prosper said this accounts for approximately 21% to 27% of the average non-solar customer’s bills.

“If your usage goes down to zero, that doesn’t mean the grid isn’t still paying for you to have power at night, when it’s cloudy, or for the basic maintenance of the grid,” Lyser said.” “If you’re avoiding all those costs, then other customers are paying for that.”

But Nathan Phelps, the managing director at Vote Solar’s regulatory advocacy hub, said the cost-shift argument is misleading. “When you just focus on cost, you’re not talking about benefits provided. When we see local solar deployed, not just solar customers benefiting, everyone benefiting … when we suppress (energy) demand, we alleviate the need for expensive new projects.”

A counter analysis in February from the California Solar & Storage Association alleged the $8.5 billion cost-shift estimate is “error-ridden and takes an analytical approach that does not match the technical questions they purportedly seek to address.”

“Correcting their analysis changes the $8.5 billion cost shift to a $1.5 billion net benefit,” the report said, alleging the state analysis assumes customers are obligated to buy all of their electricity from the utilities, ignores that solar installed in low-income homes reduces subsidies needed, “intentionally ignores” that the average customer with home solar still pays $80 to $160 a month, among other alleged errors.

The report found that utilities’ spending — and incentives for spending — are a major driver in the state’s rate spike, citing data that utilities’ spending on grid infrastructure such as poles and transmission lines has increased between 130% to 260% for each of the state’s utilities over the past eight to 12 years.

Over the same time, customer rates have increased at a high rate: At three of the state’s largest utilities PG&E, SDG&E and SCE rates increased 104%, 81% and 74%, respectively.

“It’s really in crisis proportions,” said Brad Heavner, executive director of the California Solar & Storage Association. “About a fifth of all Californians are behind on paying their utility bills.”

Record profits

David Feldman, an energy researcher and analyst at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, said “a lot of utilities are trying to make good faith efforts to support rooftop solar” but for investor-owned utilities “it’s not just that they care about the operations of the grid and having reliability and stability … they have to make a profit.” And many utilities are incentivized to spend to make that profit.

In California, for every ratepayer dollar spent on transmission and distribution, utilities earn a guaranteed profit of roughly 10%. PG&E, the state’s largest utility, had record profits in 2024 at roughly $2.47 billion. It was its second straight year of record-breaking profit.

“Electricity prices are so high because of utilities spending increases on poles and wires and other infrastructure,” Rosenfeld said.

The spending trend is national: spending by major US utilities to produce electricity decreased 24% from 2003 to 2023, according to federal data. However, over the same time period, utility spending to transmit electricity nearly tripled over this time and spending to distribute energy increased 160%. “Capital spending on overhead lines, poles and towers increased the most,” according to the report. Just a little over 1% of utilities’ infrastructure costs over this time were on customers’ property, including meters and rooftop solar installations.

“When you just focus on cost, you’re not talking about benefits provided. When we see local solar deployed, not just solar customers benefiting, everyone benefiting.” – Nathan Phelps, the managing director at Vote Solar

In California, utilities point to wildfire risk as causing a spike in spending — with customers paying an estimated $35 billion in wildfire-related utility costs since 2019.

Lyser said reports like the California Solar & Storage Association’s ignore that even customers with net-zero usage still rely on the grid for backup, maintenance and reliability. “And rooftop solar customers trend much wealthier compared to other customers, and so we do see this as an equity issue,” she added.

However, when looking at household income, the largest group in California that has solar energy at their homes is households making between $50,000 and $100,000 a year, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

“Sixty percent of all rooftop solar users in California are middle and working class,” Rosenfeld said, referring to households making less than $150,000 a year.

Households making less than $50,000 a year, however, do have the lowest rates of solar at their home, representing just 12% of the state total, but behind the rate (14%) for the highest earners making more than $250,000 a year.

“The idea that now is the time to eliminate solar when the most vulnerable populations could now most benefit from solar is backwards … we’re seeing more equity in solar happen,” Phelps said.

Rosenfeld said these arguments didn’t happen by accident. California utilities donated roughly $212 million in campaign contributions over the past 25 years — including $2.6 million to Governor Gavin Newsom.

“Newsom has taken more money from the utilities than [former governors] Schwarzenegger and Brown combined,” Rosenfeld said. “And you can see that in the direction that his administration has gone in rooftop solar.”

Governor Newsom’s office directed questions about residential solar to the state’s Energy Commission and Public Utilities Commission.

While the fate of NEM 3.0 rests in the courts, other battles continue: just this summer California Assemblymember Lisa Calderon put forth a bill that would have broken more than two million contracts backed by the state that guaranteed solar systems installed at homes had a 20-year net metering plan with utilities, regardless of whether the home was sold. The bill was defeated.

“The new administration turns right around in less than two years after promising these people that their contract was going to be safe and push a bill to break the contract,” Rosenfeld said. “We defeated that effort, but it took a massive effort.”

“The sun is going to keep shining”

Despite headwinds, many advocates of rooftop solar remain convinced it is the long-term answer to consumer energy demands.

“The sun is going to keep shining and utility bills are incredibly high,” Heavner said. “Solar is still a very good investment for customers.”

Phelps said residential and rooftop solar can be much more nimble with urgent energy needs.

“When it comes to large scale projects, when they come online – it’s a large amount of solar coming online at once but there are also delays in those projects,” he said. “Large projects can take years, local solar can take just months.”

California alone has the potential to produce more than five times more energy from solar on rooftops and in parking lots and commercial buildings, according to estimates.

Phelps said there are a couple states that have found ways for rooftop solar to fit better within the utilities’ best interest. In 2021, Hawaii, for example, adopted “performance-based regulation,” which ties utility revenue to performance on things like reliability, cutting bills and expanding clean energy rather than the previous spend more, earn more model.

Hawaii saw a 7.5% increase in solar systems, most of which are residential. Dozens of other states — including New York, North Carolina and Minnesota — have adopted some performance-based regulations or are considering it.

But performance-based regulation is imperfect. Hawaii still has some of the highest electric bills in the nation, however, the state’s utility commission estimates the performance-based changes will have saved customers more than $70 million over the past four years.

Sparks, the Sacramento Valley resident with rooftop solar, said he hopes that even with reduced incentives his fellow neighbors can find ways to take advantage of rooftop solar’s benefits — for their bills and for the planet.

“We’re just trying to do what we can to reduce our carbon footprint and this is one of the easiest ways that it can happen,” Sparks said.",https://www.thenewlede.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/getty-images-2d_ReXUzgoU-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 09:58:30.434514

China continues to be the world’s biggest EV market, but sales growth cooled to 6% in August compared to a year earlier, when the Chinese sales surged with the introduction of the trade-in scheme.

Total global EV sales in August reached 1.7 million units, including 1.16 million Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and 570,000 Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), according to Rho Motion’s data.

Sales in the United States accelerated to reach a monthly record in August, due to the upcoming expiry of the tax credits in September, Rho Motion Data Manager, Charles Lester, said.

Emissions legislation continues to underpin sales in the top European markets Germany and the UK, while China’s growth slowed compared to high sales numbers a year ago at the start of the Chinese trade-in scheme.

“Y-o-y growth in the Chinese market slowed in July-August 2025, however, this is compared to a period where subsidies for the auto trade-in scheme increased last year, which spurred on EV demand in the country,” Lester said.

Year to date, global EV sales rose by 25%, with Chinese growth also at 25% and Europe’s sales increase at 31%.

North American EV sales rose by 6% between January and August, but there is high uncertainty from the fourth quarter onwards, in view of the end of the tax credits.

The rush to take advantage of the tax credits pushed the U.S. electric vehicle market to its highest-ever monthly sales in August, with over 175,000 units sold, Rho Motion’s EV & Battery Database showed earlier this week.

Under the OBBBA, the 30D purchase credit and the 45W leasing credit – both worth up to $7,500 on eligible EVs – will end.

“There’s high uncertainty of how big the EV sales drop off will be in Q4,” said Will Roberts, Automotive Research Lead at Rho Motion.

Automakers are already adjusting to this expected dip. VW has announced plans to scale back ID.4 production in the U.S. from October, while GM will cut output at several EV facilities, Rho Motion noted.

Speaking at the State Review Meeting on Renewable Energy organised by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), the Minister said the country is expanding its efforts beyond modules to include wafers and ingots, paving the way for a comprehensive solar manufacturing ecosystem within India.

Shri Joshi emphasised that this move will reduce import dependence, generate employment, attract investment, and strengthen India’s position as a global leader in clean energy manufacturing. He appreciated the efforts of various states in advancing renewable energy initiatives, noting that these contributions are helping India move towards its 2030 vision of achieving 500 GW of non-fossil capacity. With 251.5 GW already installed, the Minister described this milestone as evidence of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s visionary leadership, which is driving clean energy growth and manufacturing in the renewable sector.

Progress Under PM Surya Ghar and PM-KUSUM

The Minister highlighted that nearly 20 lakh households have benefitted from the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, urging states and distribution companies to ensure quality compliance and offer optimal tariff credits. On the PM-KUSUM scheme, he noted its growing popularity across states and announced that the second phase will be launched after March 2026.

Addressing concerns regarding free electricity, Shri Joshi stated that benefits must be delivered in a financially sustainable way. He pointed out that about half of the beneficiaries under PM Surya Ghar currently enjoy zero electricity bills, demonstrating a sustainable model that balances relief with long-term viability.

Renewable Capacity and Ease of Doing Business

India has achieved the milestone of 50% of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources, five years ahead of schedule. However, the Minister cautioned that capacity additions must be matched with effective utilisation. He urged states to expedite Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs), power purchase agreements (PPAs), and land allotments, warning that delays in procurement could undermine broader goals.

Calling for strengthened Ease of Doing Business, Shri Joshi encouraged states to adopt single-window clearance systems, reduce compliance burdens, and address right of way and law-and-order challenges. He further urged wind-rich states to develop time-bound roadmaps for site allocation and transmission readiness.

The Minister welcomed the recent GST reduction from 12% to 5% on renewable energy devices, making technologies such as solar, wind, biogas, and waste-to-energy systems more affordable.

Domestic Manufacturing Achievements

Highlighting successes in domestic manufacturing, Shri Joshi pointed to the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for High-Efficiency Solar PV Modules, with an outlay of ₹24,000 crore. Under this scheme, India has established 100 GW of module manufacturing capacity, attracted ₹50,000 crore in investments, and created over 12,600 direct jobs.

The Minister reaffirmed that India’s energy transition would require collaborative action from the Centre, states, industry, and citizens, and assured full support from MNRE while inviting stakeholders to share ideas for accelerating renewable energy deployment.

Supporting Remarks from Other Leaders

Union Minister of State for New and Renewable Energy, Shri Shripad Naik, praised the PM-KUSUM and PM Surya Ghar schemes as central to India’s mission for energy security and sustainability. He noted that over 16 lakh solar pumps have been installed or solarised, reducing diesel consumption by 1.3 billion litres annually, cutting 40 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions, and saving foreign exchange. The PM Surya Ghar scheme is installing 4,500 systems daily, supported by 18,000 vendors nationwide, empowering farmers and households while reducing emissions and creating jobs.

MNRE Secretary Shri Santosh Kumar Sarangi underscored that India’s green energy transition is vital to meeting its net zero target by 2070, with ambitions of 1,800 GW renewable capacity by 2047 and 5,000 GW by 2070. He highlighted successful state initiatives, including Maharashtra’s PM-KUSUM implementation, Gujarat’s renewable clusters, and Karnataka’s land facilitation efforts.

State-Wise Assessment and Future Roadmap

The review meeting featured a state-wise assessment of the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana and PM-KUSUM, with presentations from states detailing progress and challenges. Industry associations shared insights on sectoral issues, and stakeholder consultations were held to align policy reforms with the design of PM-KUSUM 2.0.

With stop-work orders, red tape, and wild claims about whale-killing electromagnetic fields, the White House has stepped up its war on wind.

The flashpoint is Ørsted’s $5 billion Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island, which was weeks from delivering 700 megawatts of clean power to New England, and now frozen by federal order. The threat against the project is more than a local fight: It signals that even fully permitted, nearly finished clean energy assets can be derailed for political leverage.

Analysts warn that this is sending shock waves through the entire energy sector, raising the cost of capital for everything from solar farms to advanced nuclear.

Katherine Hamilton: Plus, what you do there has to stay there, so that’s inefficient.

Jigar Shah: Well, not if you’re podcasting. We are like, “We are going to change that today.”

Stephen Lacey: Okay. You’ve been going to RE+ formerly known as SPI for a lot of years. Pop quiz for you. Do you remember who the keynote speaker was in 2008?

Jigar Shah: No. Was it Obama?

Stephen Lacey: No. It was Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Jigar Shah: Well, I mean we definitely have our share of duds.

Stephen Lacey: From Latitude Media, this is Open Circuit. On his first day in office, Trump laid out his wind policy in one simple sentence, “We are not going to do the wind thing,” he said, before halting approvals for wind projects. And that was certainly true and was just a preview. With stop work orders, red tape and wild claims about whale killing, electromagnetic fields and underwater drone threats, America is indeed not doing the wind thing anymore.

We’ll look at the carnage in the wind industry and more importantly why it matters for all clean energy. Plus layoffs are sweeping around clean energy. What does it mean for the broader economy when the jobs’ engine sputters. And finally, Amory Lovins is arguing the AI boom won’t save nuclear, but Silicon Valley and the Trump administration are betting it will, who is right?

Welcome to the show, I’m Stephen Lacey. I’m joined by Katherine Hamilton and Jigar Shah are my co-host. Katherine is the co-founder and chair of 38 North Solutions and the executive director of Common Charge. Hi, Katherine.

Katherine Hamilton: Hello. Instead of heading out to Vegas tomorrow, I’m heading up to my alma mater Cornell to give some talks to the engineering school and the business school. So I’m super excited about heading back to Ithaca.

Stephen Lacey: What’s the thesis of the conversation?

Katherine Hamilton: Kind of transition in a time of chaos, like what’s happening? How is the transition going? And I’m there to buck them up, I think.

Stephen Lacey: Jigar is a clean energy investor. He’s the former director of the DOE’s Loan Programs Office. Jigar, what is on the docket for RE+? What’s the vibe check right now?

Jigar Shah: It’s a fascinating thing, right? I have been traveling a lot this year because there’s a lot of people who want to understand how to process this moment. I think they feel the aggression that has come for our industry and they did not expect it because many folks here frankly are conservative.

And I think that they are now recognizing that they have a lot of opportunity in front of them, particularly on the distributed generation side. And that they need to actually look inward and figure out how we cut costs by 40% and figure out how to meet this moment. In the same way that the fracking industry frankly did when the Saudis came after them in 2014, 2015 and they rationalized their supply chain, they figured out where all the bloat is.

I have been very impressed by how many residential solar installers in particular have dramatically changed the way that they’re doing customer acquisition. They’re moving away from door-to-door sales, they’re moving to AI enabled tools to dramatically reduce the cost of bringing a contract to installation. And so I think a lot of people believe in the Tesla white paper that they can cut 40% of the cost of their installation over the next 18 months.

Offshore wind under siege

Stephen Lacey: Okay, let’s roll into the show. So let’s tackle offshore wind, the problems in that industry and what it means for everything else that needs to get deployed quickly. So 20 years ago, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cut the head off a dead whale with a chainsaw and strapped it to the roof of his car. That is a real story recounted by his daughter, and I can think of no better metaphor for what the Trump administration is doing to offshore wind.

The past eight months have brought frozen permits, yanked funding and flimsy investigations into electromagnetic fields and drone attacks under offshore wind farms. A few weeks ago, his administration ordered work to stop at Orsted’s $4 billion Revolution Wind Project off Rhode Island. A project that was 80% complete and weeks from delivering 700 megawatts of clean power to Connecticut and Rhode Island. And now the administration is pulling back hundreds of millions of dollars in port funding that was approved under Biden. So I could go on and on and on here. Katherine, give us the lay of the land. Have you ever seen anything like this in your career?

Katherine Hamilton: No, although there are a lot of different angles to this. So there are five offshore wind projects actually under construction, two of which have been issued stop work orders. So that still leaves three under construction. And I’ll just say first there’s a really big pushback. So as you noted, Orsted, the Revolution Wind Project, challenged the DC, District Court, they filed for preliminary injunction this last Friday night on that stop work order.

They have people stranded on a ship in the water until they know what they’re supposed to be doing. All their labor forces out there, Connecticut and Rhode Island have filed in the Rhode Island district also about Revolution, US Wind in Maryland and then 17 states in the district are suing the government and challenging the presidential authority from the day one executive order. And they’ve done an oral argument but no ruling yet.

And what that shows is that this is a big industry and a lot of these projects are mostly done. Some of them like Vineyard’s already generating electricity, even though their project is not completely done, they’re already starting to generate electricity. And these are projects that are ready to go. Those that have already been under construction are ready to put electrons on the grid and this administration is with a lot of misinformation, and we can dive into what that is, has just decided that it doesn’t like it.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, I think a big part of this is that Trump personally hates wind, but another question is whether this is a tactic to extract concessions from governors. So you mentioned the offshore wind project in New York and that was allowed to move forward after supposedly Kathy Hochul made concessions on approving gas pipeline infrastructure. I think her office denies that exactly. But many are speculating whether this is just going to be another way that Trump can extract concessions from people and exercise raw power. What do you guys make of that element of this stop work order?

Jigar Shah: Well, I mean it’s clear that the reporting at least is that he did successfully do that in New York. So if a playbook works, you sort of continue to do it again. But I want to make sure that we hearken back to episodes that we did back in 2017, 2018, 2019 to talk about the fact that we predicted that this would happen.

Stephen Lacey: What did we predict?

Jigar Shah: Well, when projects are fully approved for construction, like XL Pipeline was fully approved, like Mountain Valley Pipeline was fully approved, and then later an administration cancels the permit after it was fully approved. Then the challenge with that is that, and I’m not suggesting this equivalency, what we’re talking about here is completely and utterly beyond any sort of logic that I could possibly think of, but I think that we have so politicized energy in this country now that we are now in a place where everything is on the table.

And I think that that is a really bad thing. I think that we should understand that having an abundant energy supply in our country is what allows us to be innovative. It’s what allows us to be artistic, it’s what allows us to do all the things that we do and we sort of politicize all these things to our peril.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, that’s an interesting point. I think there’s a long history of energy infrastructure being politicized. When you look at a lot of the fracking bans, many of the pipeline bans, a lot of cities creating regulations to push gas connections out of buildings. I think people inside the Trump administration and a lot of people on the right generally would say the left has been doing this for a long time. To your point, I think it’s important to separate just how different the Trump administration’s tactics are, but I’m sure there’s a lot of people out there who see them as part of the same story.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah. So that may be true, but I also feel like this is different and very specific and maybe you can find linkages. I just hadn’t quite thought of those linkages, but in the case of the wind projects, it feels like a very emotional rationale for stopping something that is just electrons that are ready or already being fed to the grid. That New England ISO, which is not exactly right, left leaning group, they’re just like, “Hey, we’re just the ISO New England. We’re just the guys that control the grid.” They’ve basically said that stopping Revolution Wind would undermine system reliability. That is a big deal.

But if you look at what the rationale is from the government, they’re just making things up. So they said that there’s something about national security because of underwater drones being able to attack when why would that not also affect sub-sea oil and gas lines or sub-sea internet service? They’re just things that they’re making up and they’re all kind of in it together. And I would say RFK Jr., the whale head dude, he’s been saying a couple of things. One is that it’s super expensive, that it’s 34 cents a kilowatt-hour.

It’s not. The fixed price contracts are between seven and 15 cents a kilowatt-hour. Revolution Wind is 9.80 cents a kilowatt-hour. That is not 34 cents a kilowatt-hour. And then RFK Jr.’s also saying that this is very harmful, that there are 109 whale groundings in 22 months. Zero whale groundings have been linked to wind at all. None. Whale groundings are linked to vessels and fisherman’s nets and climate change migration and all kinds of other things but not wind. And so it just feels like they’re coming up with things pre-textual, like, “We’re going to find things that are wrong to make up for the fact that this is a very emotional decision on the part of the president.”

Stephen Lacey: Mm-hmm, and it’s been just such an extraordinarily hard time for the offshore wind industry. They got hit particularly hard by inflationary pressures and this Revolution Wind project was so close to being done, it is so close to being done. But, Jigar, Orsted now says it needs like nine and a half billion dollars to keep this project afloat. Is this project financeable? Is offshore wind generally financeable still in the US?

Jigar Shah: You’d have to think twice. And remember, it’s not just this project. I think that part of this is recognizing that the work that we’re doing here is impacting our relationships with Denmark broadly in the same way that the raid in Georgia affects our relationship with South Korea broadly, these are countries who have decided to invest billions of dollars into our country and bring their expertise, which is considerable.

And I would think twice, but more than that, remember they also have invested in supply chain jobs. So when you think about the towers and you think about all the ships that are being produced, part of this is the ship that was used here was produced in Steve Scalise’s district down in Louisiana. I just think that the shock waves of this project being paused, but also the jobs that are being impacted across the entire country is profound.

And it’s something that I have a really hard time wrapping my brain around. Because if you’re the Danish government and you get wronged on this front, would you invest in circular economy projects? Would you invest in other areas where you have expertise that you want to bring in to the United States? I think that they would’ve to think twice.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, I just spoke with a wind executive who said that a huge amount of the investment is from upfront lease acquisition, hundreds of millions of dollars, even a billion dollars to acquire a lease. And the good news on that front is that these are long-dated, so 35 years, these are long-term lease arrangements. So that as long as you have that under your belt, if you can bide your time, we might find a way out because a lot of that upfront investment has been made.

Stephen Lacey: To your bigger point, Jigar, what other technologies could this impact? So a lot of analysts are worried about this sending shock waves through clean energy writ large, forcing financiers to reassess risk for everything from gas plants to advanced nuclear potentially. So if government approvals can be undone at will, what is actually safe? How big are the potential casualties across the energy system or the grid system?

Jigar Shah: Well, and remember we also got a cancellation which was illegal of the loan for a Grain Belt Express. And so this is a transmission line that is so desperately needed to bring power from SPP to MISO. And so you’re in this world where there’s a lot of people who provide capital along the way. So I think we think sometimes about capital around at the end of the project so that at the completion of the project you have debt, you have equity, et cetera.

But along the way you have development capital, you have other types of capital, and if routine things, like for instance permits at the Department of Interior might have to provide for solar projects that are on private land but have some sort of routine checkoff from some local office. I’m now hearing that some local offices are working fine as if they got no new instructions from the Trump administration. Other local offices are paralyzed, because they’re not sure what the Trump administration wants them to do in terms of these routine approvals.

And so, if you’re providing development capital to a project, and you’re like, “I don’t know whether that routine approval is going to come through,” do you fund that project? I think that there’s just all this uncertainty and even if things move forward, the cost of capital goes up. And so then now the PPA price that someone needs to sign at the very end goes up. And so I don’t understand on the macro world here, which I think the Trump administration is operating under, is that they believe that there is so much natural gas in this country that if they just built unlimited amounts of natural gas that we could just solve all of our electricity problems with AI, et cetera. And the math is just not on their side.

Just to give you one example, if you take the Permian Basin because you can’t get gas from the Marcellus down to the LNG export terminals, there’s not enough pipeline capacity. So if you take the Permian Basin and you power the entire 500 gigawatts of Stargate data centers with natural gas that would use up a third of all of the natural gas in the Permian Basin through the next 32 years. You’re saying that that would have no impact whatsoever on the cost of natural gas in that region? That that would have no impact on our ability to export LNG gas with the natural gas terminals that have already installed? It’s maddening.

Nobody in their right mind would ever go all in on natural gas when we’re already at 40% natural gas. We need diversification. You need offshore wind, you need solar, we need geothermal, we need to keep our nuclear plants running. All of that stuff needs to happen in this moment if we’re going to meet the load growth. And I just think that all of these data points are confusing to normal voters. They are not looking to become PhDs in electricity design and technologies and development. But I think that for many people, like Trump’s Truth social account is supposed to be telling them that, “We could just do this all with natural gas, but for all these woke leftists.”

Katherine Hamilton: We’re also going to see knock on effects of all these other industries that the administration purports to care about. For example, shipping. Well, the offshore industry has improved ports, Empire Wind improved South Brooklyn. Revolution, New London. Vineyard, New Bedford. These are all improved marine terminals and those are also getting funding reduced when we need more of those.

And those would also help boost those priorities that the president claims to have for building more ships, for doing other kinds of trade. And so there’s always a knock on effect if you curb one industry and offshore wind has created so much additional both supply chain and other types of industries that are surrounding it, that you’re going to have an adverse impact on a bunch of other things too.

Jigar Shah: I think that actually, yes, they’re winning some sort of meme war on Twitter, but they’re not winning the main street argument. And I think the ones who are the most nervous about this that I’m talking to are the electric utilities. They really believe that they are going to be blamed fully for these rate increases and that they believe that Trump is going to aim the Eye of Sauron on them.

Stephen Lacey: Yes, he will.

Jigar Shah: And when that happens, then they are going to have to respond in kind around why they’re doing battery storage and why they’re doing solar and why they’re doing all this other stuff because there’s no other choice. Even if they wanted to do whatever Trump wanted to do, it’s not possible. They can’t build natural gas power plants in time to bring all these loads on board. They can’t build nuclear plants in time to bring all these loads on board. And so they are caught in the middle and right now they’re keeping their mouth shut because they frankly have no political power given the changes at EEI and all the other things.

But what I’m worried about is that this offshore wind piece is giving all of this confidence to people in the administration. And what’s in fact going to happen is that you’re going to see a rallying of all of these different people including oil and gas. Remember the oil and gas industry is not happy with this administration. The steel and aluminum tariffs, all this stuff, has made their profitability go way down, right? Chevron just announced that they’re cutting 20% of their entire global workforce.

And so you’re seeing all of these negative ripple effects and no one is willing to stand up to the president this week. But I think collectively you will see that people will have to stand up to the president at some point because we’re just not going to be able to meet our energy goals.

Katherine Hamilton: But all of those utilities, all of these companies, offshore wind included, they all have employees and people, many of whom voted for this president for very different reasons. Those folks that are stuck on that boat in the middle off the coast because of the revolution stop order, a lot of those I’m sure voted for this president because they didn’t think that their job was a woke job. They just thought it was a really good construction job.

And so I think you’re going to start seeing, if he goes too hard, an erosion of support from people who just want work and they want really good work and they found a good job in an industry that was growing. And I think that’s going to come back to bite all of those folks who are not standing up for the industries that are being kneecapped.

Stephen Lacey: All right. So do you think this is the end of the US offshore wind industry?

Katherine Hamilton: I do not. I actually think they’re going to keep going. I think some of them may kind of wait it out a bit. I think the ones that are about to go online are going to get online. They’re going to find a way through the courts. They’re going to get online. I think some of those who already have leases and have spent gobs of money trying to make sure that they’ve got those in place and that have the long-term contracts and OffTEC agreements, I think they might wait it out because they will see that it will turn around. This is a long-term big infrastructure industry. I don’t think it’s dead.

Jigar Shah: Yeah, I would say it a little bit differently, which is that I agree with Katherine, but I think that the president is putting us into a massive recession. Through that massive recession, you’re going to start to see some harmonization of some of the inflation stuff and some of the other sort of cost drivers that were hurting offshore wind. And I think offshore wind will come roaring back strong sort of in that 2030, 2031 timeframe. But it’s just the most maddening thing to see the politicization of energy.

Because what I worry about is that if a Democrat comes back in the White House, they’re going to be pressured to politicize all sorts of other energy sources that we also need to keep the lights on. So I just think that we need to be very careful about politicizing energy sources.

Is the clean energy jobs engine sputtering?

Stephen Lacey: So I just had a news alert pop up on my computer from the Wall Street Journal, “Revised BLS data show the US likely added 900,000 fewer jobs than initially reported over the last 12 months that ended in March.” So that brings us into our jobs’ conversation. We got a weak August Jobs report, job creation was down 75% from last year. The overall clean energy jobs story is a schizophrenic right? On one hand, many of the headlines are pretty brutal. PosiGen shutting down power and in bankruptcy, AES cutting thousands of people. Of course we talked about this E2 study of dozens of projects that have been canceled or downsized, erasing over 15,000 jobs and tens of billions of dollars in investment.

But on the other hand, I have not looked at the latest data that just popped up on my screen here, but the last data that I saw from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that clean energy is still a pretty fast-growing part of the US workforce. They’re expected to add over 40,000 jobs by 2030. And so I want to kind of understand where we are on the macro level where clean energy is a bright spot, but on the micro level, how individual companies are suffering or recalibrating. So Katherine, how do you reconcile those two realities?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, so I think there are a few things at play. There are very specific business models that right now are in real jeopardy and I would say PosiGen falls into that. They’re very much pegged to LMI communities that are reliant on government funding, the Solar for All program, all of those things that the Inflation Reduction Act put into place with a lot of investment. When that was pulled back, some of those entities that had really relied on that to beef up their workforce are now finding themselves without the funding to do so. So those are very specific examples of types of business models.

Now that’s terrible because it negatively affects communities that most need access to solar. And then there’s another piece, and I would say vote solar probably falls into this and a few other entities that rely on philanthropic funding. And a lot of the philanthropies are being pulled in a bunch of different directions including internationally because everything that’s happening with the US government pulling out, so you’re just finding more strain on philanthropic organizations.

So if you don’t have government support and your philanthropies are strained, you have to have something else. You have to have a really strong business model. You have to be able to pivot quickly. You have to be able to rely not just on public policy, but actually on market signals and on cost-effectiveness. And so I think that’s part of what you’re seeing and that the folks that have had strong business models that have been able to pivot or be able to double down on what they do best are going to be okay.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, I think that’s a pretty good read of the landscape. Jigar, are there any commonalities among the companies where we’ve seen widespread layoffs?

Jigar Shah: Well, I think when you say layoffs in the clean energy sector, I think we’re talking mostly about bankruptcies. I don’t know that there’s a lot of people that are cutting 10% of their workforce. It’s more people who are like, “We ran out of cash and we have to shut down.” I think that what’s interesting in the broader clean energy marketplace is that we have a lot of weak companies, and those weak companies were, I think buoyed really by low interest rates out of COVID. I think as the interest rates went way up over the last two years, a lot of them faced a lot of strain in their business model and figuring out how they navigated that I think was already quite challenging.

And I think that as Katherine’s suggesting, I think with all the headwinds from the political rhetoric, there’s a lot of investors going, “Do I really want to put more money into some of these companies right now?” The good thing is that there’s a tremendous number of clean tech companies who actually have been quite disciplined over the last two years and they grew a lot less quickly because they’ve been more disciplined, and so they decided to grow more slowly and they are doing fine. And so they are hiring like crazy right now and they are actually taking over the market share from the companies who are going bankrupt.

And so, the overall deployment of clean energy has never been stronger, and I’m more bullish today at RE+ than I was coming in on my airplane flight into Vegas. And so I do think there’s a lot of people with a good head on their shoulders. I don’t think that that means that everyone is going to make this pivot well. I think that there’s going to be some percentage, a healthy percentage of companies that go bankrupt here over the next six months, but I think all of that market share will be taken up by the companies that are healthy. And so, as a result, we will have net job creation through 2030.

I think that people will continue to get jobs in this sector. I think this is the place where young people want to work. As I talked to young people this year, they still want to work in this sector. And so I think the future is very bright and I do think that clean energy also is broad. It’s not just solar. It’s going to be a lot of battery storage over the next five to eight years, which I think is super exciting.

Katherine Hamilton: I would pick up on that and say exactly, I’m seeing a lot of companies that are now scooping up the assets of those that are going under and finding that is tremendous opportunity for growth. As you say, they’ve been kind of lying in wait to see where the detritus landed. And then the other piece is on the job side, Jigar, jobs are changing a little bit because of the way our AI and all these other industries are moving. New manufacturing, advanced manufacturing, some of the jobs are changing, some of the skill needs are different, but that just creates more opportunity I think for people coming out of school.

Stephen Lacey: So the BLS data shows that on the generation side, solar, wind, geothermal, hydro, we could see 41,000 jobs by 2030. While battery and electrical component manufacturing could add almost 50,000 positions. Jigar, do you think there are any particular areas that are poised to grow the workforce faster?

Jigar Shah: Yeah, to Katherine’s point, I think that the jobs are changing radically. So when you look at some of the new companies that I met here at RE+, we have reduced the cost of developing a project by 80%. So it used to cost X dollars to build or to find the right spot for a battery or the right spot for solar. It now costs 80% less than that money.

And why? Because a lot of those standardized reports, a lot of the work around which substations are the best, a lot of that stuff can be done with AI models and with outsourced models and that kind of stuff. And so reports that used to cost $30,000 are now costing $6,000. And so that to me means a lot of jobs are moving out of those places, reports and just reading unstructured data, and AI is doing a lot more of that. And you’re seeing a lot more jobs in revenue maximization.

So the value of some of the revenue streams in battery storage, for instance in Texas, has gone down 82% the last two years because batteries have taken the volatility from the ERCOT market. But you find that there’s actually five additional revenue streams that they’re getting access to now, and they’re stacking a lot of those value streams. And so there’s a lot of new jobs in people who are experts at unlocking those new value streams. So those are jobs that are being created.

But the tried and true jobs that continue to be there are the trades. We still have a shortage of electricians and we still have a shortage of LIUNA workers and the laborers and operating engineers and all of those people. And so every single EPC contractor I’ve talked to in the last 24 hours has said that they are fully booked out through ’26, just no space whatsoever in their dance card and that they are short workers. And so if you know somebody who just graduated from college but doesn’t have a job, they would be happy to take them on as apprentices and figure out a way to get them a meaningful career in the trades.

Stephen Lacey: What do you make of the way the green jobs’ policy political conversation has shifted? We’re like two decades into the mainstreaming of the term green jobs. No one really uses the term green jobs anymore, at least in mainstream political discourse. Katherine, how has it changed?

Katherine Hamilton: Well, I think you were getting people who had environmental leanings to get into industries that are hard tech industries. These are real jobs with real people. As Jigar says, a lot of them are trade jobs, and so you have a confluence of people who are interested in doing things that are mitigating or adapting for climate change.

At the same time, you get people who just want jobs and these are good jobs. And so, I think what that means is that when you bring all that together, it ends up just being economic driver. It doesn’t matter if you want to call it green or not. And right now in some places green, the term, seems to be out of favor, but the result is the same. And I think it’s a good thing that these are just considered good jobs.

Jigar Shah: Well, we also don’t need to classify stuff anymore. I don’t call us alternative energy, I just call us dominant.

Katherine Hamilton: No, right.

Jigar Shah: That’s what happens these days, right? You’re in this place where when you’re 85% of everything that gets added to the grid, I mean so much winning.

Is the AI bubble inflating nuclear?

Stephen Lacey: Speaking of winning, the question we want to ask now is nuclear winning. And Amory Lovins, the longtime nuclear skeptic, the founder of the Rocky Mountain Institute, now RMI, just penned a piece in Utility Dive on why he thinks the AI boom will not rescue nuclear power. He called it a bubble within a bubble, and he writes that, “Nuclear lost the race to power the grid. So new reactors have no business case or operational need at this moment.”

So Lovins main point is that, he’s been arguing this for a long time, but he applies this to the AI era, “While AI-driven data center demand is real, it’s being exaggerated potentially.” And we’ve talked a little bit about whether that load growth number is being exaggerated on the data center side. And he says that, “Renewables can mostly meet that growth at lower costs,” and he argues that, “Nuclear keeps missing the same targets, big reactors that arrive years late and billions over budget. The smaller designs cost more per kilowatt-hour and create more waste per unit of energy.”

And so, I don’t think it’s any surprise that Lovins is writing a piece like this, but it does bring up an important question that I want to tackle with and I think that we will continue to wrestle with, which is that is the current demand picture enough to drive this renaissance in the nuclear industry? So, Jigar, you were in this at DOE, you did a lot within DOE to try to get nuclear back on track, what do you make of Amory’s arguments? I know that you’re probably not going to agree with them, but maybe we start with what do you think he gets right and what is off the mark?

Jigar Shah: Well, it’s very clear that the Western governments have had persistent cost overruns on all the nuclear plants that they built, whether it’s Finland or the UK or Vogtle down in Georgia. And he might actually even be right throughout his piece, but I think that the part that bothers me about this way of thinking, and it’s the same way that Jane Fonda thinks about things or Jerry Brown thought about things, is that they just believe that America can never do big things.

Their point of view is basically all of these projects that don’t benefit from manufacturing excellence, the learning curve that we’ve talked about for so many years, cannot be done by the United States. Whether it’s the Big Dig in Boston or whether it’s large port projects, we just can’t do big things and we’re never going to be better. And I just feel like that point of view is stupid.

Why in the world would you believe that America can never do big things? It’s one thing to say that we do not implement the best practices from Brent Flyvbjerg’s book and some of the other books that have come out recently around how to do big things. You have to spend 10% of the entire budget up front, have to measure 34 times and cut once. You can’t rush into projects. There’s lots of things that we can say that are productive in this time. But saying that, “Nuclear power, which I’ve hated since I protested with Jane Fonda at Diablo Canyon is not going to work and here are the random arguments I’m going to use to actually hurt nuclear power,” why?

Just say that we have a hard time doing big things, whether it’s sustainable aviation fuels, whether it’s clean hydrogen, whether it’s decarbonizing, cement and steel. We have a hard time with all of these big things. Why single out nuclear power?

Stephen Lacey: Katherine, what do you think he gets wrong and what do you think he gets right?

Katherine Hamilton: This is so funny when I hear Jigar saying this, I feel like that’s the argument that the Trump administration is making against offshore wind, “Those are big projects. Can we build big projects?” And given that demand is rising and price of electricity is rising, it seems like we have to use whatever we can get our hands on and if there are nuclear plants that are available and able to be brought online cost effectively and in a way that handles demand.

And the trick about demand that Amory Lovins is completely correct about is that it’s uncertain. We don’t really know what’s going to happen. We know for some places what’s going to happen, but it’s also very localized. So making sure that we match whatever we’re building, whether it’s large or small, with where we think demand is going and with affordability, I think that’s going to be the secret sauce. And whatever is going to be the cheapest quickest to get online I think is what we’re going to need to get in the short term. And then we need to think about what do we want to invest in over the long term?

Because yeah, we may need to invest in big projects. I would argue that we need to invest more in transmission projects. Those are big hard projects to do, but those are going to be able to get us what we need in a lot of ways, whether it’s nuclear or any other kind of large generation source.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah. This was not a surprise, as I said, that Amory penned this piece. I think what was interesting to me is thinking about the demand picture for data centers, and I think that a lot of the load growth projections are inflated and that has consequences for what you invest in in the long-term to serve the boom in AI and in computing.

And so I think what he gets right in this piece is that we should be sort of skeptical about some of these long-term demand projections, and we should ask whether that is enough to really drive the nuclear industry in particular forward. So, Jigar, what do you think about the demand signal we’re seeing? A lot of this new demand is coming from the tech industry through partnerships and order books and a verbal commitment to the industry. Do you think it is enough to move the industry forward and get projects in the ground?

Jigar Shah: Well, I think the proof is in the pudding. It’s very obvious that the restart of the TMI plant is because of a contract with Microsoft. So that’s pretty clear, right? It’s very clear that when you look at the announcements that Google has made with Kairos, that Google is quite serious about Kairos. And they believe that that 50 megawatt size range is something that is more manufacturable than the 300 megawatt small modular reactors or the AP1000.

And so Google has gone all in on Kairos, and that is interesting. I think when you look at what OPG in Ontario is doing with GE Hitachi’s 300 megawatt reactor at Darlington, they’ve decided that it’s smarter to build four 300 megawatt reactors and learn from each reactor than it is to build one 1,200 megawatt reactor. And so we’re going to know exactly. Those are projects that are absolutely moving forward. They’ve already gotten financing, they’ve already gotten offtake agreements, they’ve already got these things.

Now VC Summer is supposed to announce very soon, and Lindsey Graham has said that they’re definitely restarting the process there. So we’ll see who they pick. And then I can tell you whether I believe that they’re capable of actually restarting the process of finishing VC Summer or not. Holtec has decided to go public as a publicly traded company, and they’re going to use that balance sheet to build to Holtec 300s at Palisades in Michigan, and they also have a deal that they’ve announced in India. So these are real data points with real commercial contracts, with real things.

Now, there’s lots of stuff that I don’t believe. So there’s like a hundred other companies that have announced that they’re doing stuff, and I have looked into whatever I can there and have found nothing underneath there. So nothing that gives me comfort that they’re going to be real. So of the 150 names that have been floated, I think I named six or five. So those are the ones that I think are real.

Now, separately, I think the question becomes how much wealth creation has our country experienced out of owning the internet? I think a lot, right? Then social media companies, then all these cloud computing companies. And so I think it is very clear that if you believe that the US is unlikely to challenge China to be the manufacturing hub of the world that we were in the 1940s, then we need to continue to have these new acts.

And one of the new acts that we think we want to win on is AI. Do I think that AI is going to be fully powered with nuclear? Unlikely, but there are a lot of really commercial contracts being signed right now by companies. Even in Maryland, there’s a very serious conversation happening with the hyperscalers and building another reactor at Calvert Cliffs. And so that’s real. And so it’s an interesting conversation.

Do I think it’s going to get to a final investment decision? I don’t know. I feel like the Loan Programs Office right now is not a place that I would like to hang my hat around efficiently giving me a loan for any new projects. And I don’t see how a lot of these projects move forward without that loan. So we’re going to have to see where that goes. But I just think that like the enthusiasm that I feel for Fervo and all the geothermal names, I also feel enthusiasm for the three, four, five names in the nuclear space that I think are sober who are reading Brent Flyvbjerg’s book and actually really learning from what it takes to do things slowly, methodically, and better this time around.

Are they going to succeed? Hell if I know, but I believe in the commercialization of technologies that have a much lower carbon footprint. I just do. And I don’t think that we’re going to become bankrupt as a country because we try to build $40 billion worth of next generation nuclear plants when at the same time we’re building $550 billion of clean energy from electric vehicles to solar, plus battery storage, to wind to other things on the other side. I feel like there’s a way to be balanced about this conversation without being hyperbolic.

Stephen Lacey: Very well said. I agree with most of that. I think the biggest bottleneck for me right now, sort of taking the handful of examples of things that could move forward is the disorganization within government and what it could do to the public-private partnerships to eventually finance these plants. And it feels to me like that is the big wild card that could prevent some of these plants from going forward.

Katherine, what’s your read on the way the Trump administration is emphasizing nuclear right now? What’s working and not working and how’s the industry reacting?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, there’s this whole storyline about nuclear being more American as a technology. And I checked to see how about the supply chain for all these different technologies, which is more American? The most American is hydropower, 75% of the equipment in the hydropower industry in supply chain. And second is geothermal. It’s basically oil and gas industry, 65%, geothermal. Wind, 55%. We have a lot of wind manufacturing in this country, so a lot of it is American. Nuclear comes down to at 45% and solar is 30%, so solar is the lowest.

But nuclear mining and conversion happen in Canada, enrichment in the EU, especially France, and then reactors and forging are in Japan, South Korea and Europe. It’s a global industry. So anything that the administration does on international relations is going to impact the nuclear power industry as much as if not more than it impacts others. So it’s just something that if the administration believes it’s more American, that’s a great narrative, but it may not be true, especially when you have to rely other countries and rely on trade from other countries to make it happen.

So that’s just something to keep in mind because this is a global marketplace and in order to build big things, you got to work with other countries to do it. And that’s where I think some of the gaps are and what the administration would like to do, what their narrative is and what may happen on the ground.

Stephen Lacey: I guess the last question that I have is about cost. Are we seeing learning curves in nuclear, Jigar? Are you bullish about cost reductions?

Jigar Shah: So we certainly are seeing learning curves out of China, but I think there’s a lot of people who are worried that we can’t match that here in the United States. I think when you read the Liftoff Report that we published in January of 2025, as we were leaving office, we were very sober, so we said it was going to cost $20 a watt for the first reactor and then it was going to come down. We have an entire cost curve. I’d say that the vast majority of Wall Street as well as the reactor construction folks believe that cost curve, right?

So whether or not it’s true, I can’t tell you, but I think that they think that it was thoughtful and that we made it high enough that they actually thought that if you took the best practices approach, that that is the best case scenario that you could see. And that shows that we never get to Chinese numbers, we never get to like $4,000 of kW. We get down to like $8,000 of kW in the west.

And so the other thing I would say though is with Kairos and then some of the microreactors, so think Oklo, Radiant, some of those types of folks, they really are a manufactured product. So they are a twenty-foot shipping container. You would create a manufacturing facility, you would create a hundred reactors a year that came out of that manufacturing facility, which is similar to offshore wind.

Offshore wind are very complex units, and the manufacturing facilities for offshore wind make 50 of those like nacelles a year. They’re manufactured, but they’re complex. So we have experience on how to do that kind of manufacturing, which could drive down the cost. And so I am bullish on the cost structure. I think that we can consistently get to pick a number, let’s say 9.9 cents a kilowatt-hour. I don’t think it ever gets to 2 cents a kilowatt-hour.

And then remember, the way that nuclear is financed is that these reactors will last 60, the current fleet of reactors now have been permitted to 80 years. And so the cost structure I’m talking about is only for during the first 30 years, right? When the loan program’s office provides a loan, et cetera. So as soon as you pay off the loan, then you drop to where nuclear power plants are today that are on the grid, which are like three and a half to 4 cents a kilowatt-hour depending on whose math you’re using and which reactors.

The last thing I would say is that the value of nuclear is very high. So when you look at the decarbonization scenarios from NREL, the cost of a high clean firm grid is 37% cheaper than a high solar and wind grid. Because you have to build so much transmission, you’d have to 3X the transmission grid to be able to handle 80% solar and wind power with battery storage. And so you can have high specific generating costs while reducing overall system costs. And so that’s important.

And then one more point is people have been talking a lot about the PJM auction and how the costs have come way up and it’s impacted prices in New Jersey and Maryland. The one place in the PJM where you did not see spikes in the capacity auction Illinois. Why? Because it’s 70% nuclear. So part of the challenge here is thinking this through from a systemic point of view. And so I think you could see nuclear continue to be high cost, let’s call it a hundred dollars a megawatt-hour, and still see lower overall decarbonization costs for our entire grid.

Stephen Lacey: All right, Jigar, we’re going to let you go off to RE+, what are you going to do today? You’re not going to sit in the casino, right? You’re going to actually go talk to people.

Jigar Shah: Well, honestly, I am going to hang out with Neil Chatterjee who’s here, whose Fox News piece, by the way, two days ago was a masterstroke in politics.

Stephen Lacey: I didn’t see it.

Jigar Shah: He wrote this great news piece on Fox News that talks about how Trump’s energy policy is going to drive a wedge between Silicon Valley and MAGA, which I thought was a fascinating political analysis. So I’d have everybody watch and read that. And I’m going to go see our friend Nico at the SunCast stage and do his podcast.

And so, I’m super excited about all of the folks who have boosts on the trade show. I am one of those people who always walks the trade show floor just because I find all the cool stuff that people are doing to just be so inspiring. And so I’m going to let myself be inspired.

Stephen Lacey: Katherine, good luck at Cornell.

Katherine Hamilton: Thanks so much. Ithaca is gorgeous. So if you like anything about geothermal, that’s the place to go and I can’t wait.

FAQs About Green Lithium for EV Batteries What makes lithium production ""green"" compared to conventional methods?","What is Green Lithium and Why Does it Matter for EVs?

The global transition to electric vehicles continues to accelerate, with EV sales reaching 10.5 million units in 2022 – a remarkable 55% increase from the previous year. As this shift progresses, the environmental footprint of EV production has come under increasing scrutiny, particularly the materials used in battery manufacturing, which can account for up to 40% of an EV's total lifecycle emissions.

Green lithium for EV batteries represents a fundamental shift in how this critical battery material is sourced and processed. Unlike conventional lithium production, which often involves extensive environmental disruption, green lithium prioritizes sustainability throughout the supply chain while delivering the same high-performance battery materials.

The Environmental Imperative Behind Green Lithium

The rapid growth of the EV market has created unprecedented demand for lithium, with projections suggesting a potential 500% increase in lithium requirements by 2030. This demand surge has highlighted the unsustainable nature of traditional lithium extraction methods, which often consume massive water resources in drought-prone regions and generate significant carbon emissions.

Industry leaders like Vulcan Energy's CEO Cris Moreno emphasize the critical importance of developing ""local, low-cost sources of sustainable lithium for European EV batteries,"" reflecting the growing recognition that EVs can only deliver their full environmental promise when their component materials are responsibly sourced.

Defining the Green Lithium Difference

Green lithium is characterized by extraction and processing methods that minimize ecological impact through reduced water usage, lower carbon emissions, and decreased chemical pollution. Key differentiating factors include:

Use of renewable energy throughout the production process

Implementation of water-efficient extraction technologies

Reduced land disturbance compared to traditional methods

Decreased or eliminated dependence on harsh chemical reagents

Regional production that minimizes transportation emissions

These sustainable approaches maintain the same chemical purity and performance characteristics as conventionally produced lithium while dramatically reducing environmental impact. The successful production of Europe's first domestically manufactured lithium hydroxide by Vulcan Energy in November 2024 demonstrated that green lithium can meet rigorous quality standards while adhering to strict sustainability principles.

How Traditional Lithium Production Impacts the Environment

Before examining green lithium solutions, it's essential to understand the environmental challenges posed by conventional lithium production methods that have dominated the industry for decades.

Water-Intensive Extraction Methods

Traditional lithium extraction from salt flat brines through evaporation ponds represents one of the most water-intensive mining operations globally. These operations typically consume between 500,000 and 2,000,000 liters of water per tonne of lithium produced – a staggering volume that has severe implications for local ecosystems and communities.

This water consumption becomes particularly problematic considering that approximately 75% of global lithium reserves are located in the ""Lithium Triangle"" of Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile – a region already experiencing significant water stress. In Chile's Atacama Desert, lithium operations have been linked to declining water tables, soil degradation, and ecosystem disruption in one of the world's driest environments.

The carbon intensity of traditional lithium production contributes significantly to battery manufacturing emissions:

Hard rock mining requires energy-intensive crushing and heating processes

Conversion of lithium concentrate to battery-grade lithium compounds involves multiple chemical processing steps

Global transportation of raw materials and refined products adds substantial emissions

Chemical reagents used in processing carry their own embedded carbon footprint

Studies indicate that conventional lithium production can generate between 5-15 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent per tonne of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE), representing a significant portion of an EV battery's total carbon footprint.

Land Use and Ecosystem Disruption

Traditional lithium operations frequently involve extensive land disturbance:

Evaporation ponds can span thousands of hectares, with the Atacama operations covering over 80 km²

Hard rock mining creates significant surface disruption, including pit development and tailings storage

Road construction and infrastructure development fragment habitats

Chemical contamination can affect soil and water quality beyond operational boundaries

These impacts can persist long after mining operations cease, creating lasting ecological damage that requires extensive remediation efforts.

What Innovative Technologies Are Making Green Lithium Possible?

The transition to green lithium is being driven by several breakthrough technologies that fundamentally reimagine how lithium is extracted and processed.

Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) Breakthroughs

Direct Lithium Extraction represents one of the most promising advances in green lithium production. These technologies selectively extract lithium from brines without requiring extensive evaporation ponds, delivering multiple environmental benefits:

Water consumption reductions of up to 90% compared to traditional evaporation methods

Land footprint reduced by approximately 70% through elimination of large evaporation ponds

Processing time shortened from 18 months to as little as a few hours

Increased recovery rates – typically 70-90% versus 30-40% for traditional methods

Reduced chemical usage and waste generation

Several DLE approaches are gaining commercial traction, including ion-exchange resins, solvent extraction systems, and selective adsorption technologies, each offering specific advantages for different brine compositions and operational contexts.

Electrolysis-Based Processing Innovations

Advanced electrolysis systems are transforming lithium processing by enabling the production of battery-grade lithium compounds using renewable electricity rather than chemical reagents. NESI's NORSCAND® Electrolysers exemplify this approach, using specialized electrodes from Permascand AB to produce high-purity lithium hydroxide through an electrochemical process.

Key advantages of electrolysis-based processing include:

Elimination of most chemical reagents used in traditional processing

Direct production of battery-grade lithium hydroxide without intermediate steps

Compatibility with renewable energy sources, enabling carbon-neutral processing

Reduced waste generation and simplified waste management

Higher product purity with fewer impurities

The successful implementation of this technology at Vulcan Energy's Central Lithium Electrolysis Optimisation Plant (CLEOP) demonstrated its commercial viability, producing Europe's first domestically manufactured lithium hydroxide in November 2024.

Geothermal Lithium Recovery

Emerging geothermal lithium extraction projects tap into naturally occurring lithium-rich brines that are already being pumped as part of geothermal energy production. This approach offers several unique advantages:

Utilizes existing geothermal infrastructure, reducing capital requirements

Produces renewable energy simultaneously with lithium extraction

Avoids additional land disturbance beyond existing geothermal operations

Leverages natural heat to enhance lithium extraction efficiency

Creates potential for carbon-negative lithium production when CO₂ sequestration is incorporated

These geothermal lithium projects are advancing particularly in the Rhine Valley of Germany, California's Salton Sea, and Cornwall in the United Kingdom, where appropriate geological conditions coincide with growing lithium demand.

How Are Companies Implementing Green Lithium Solutions?

Theoretical innovations are rapidly translating into commercial operations as companies race to establish sustainable lithium supply chains.

Vulcan Energy's Zero-Carbon Lithium Project

Vulcan Energy's integrated geothermal energy and lithium extraction project in Germany's Upper Rhine Valley represents a pioneering approach to green lithium production. The company's ""Zero Carbon Lithium"" process extracts lithium from geothermal brines while simultaneously generating renewable geothermal energy.

Key features of this project include:

Co-production of renewable geothermal energy and battery-grade lithium

Carbon-neutral or potentially carbon-negative production process

Regional supply chain development reducing transportation emissions

Enhanced European resource security through domestic production

Minimal land and water requirements compared to traditional methods

This approach has attracted significant attention from European automakers seeking to reduce the carbon footprint of their supply chains while securing reliable material sources.

The Vulcan-NESI Partnership for European Green Lithium

Vulcan Energy's contract with NESI for their Phase One Lionheart Project marks a significant advancement in European green lithium production. This partnership will implement NESI's NORSCAND® Electrolysers at Vulcan's Central Lithium Plant in Frankfurt, enabling the production of high-purity lithium hydroxide using renewable energy sources.

The collaboration builds on the successful operation of Vulcan's Central Lithium Electrolysis Optimisation Plant (CLEOP), which produced Europe's first domestically manufactured lithium hydroxide in late 2024. Key components of this partnership include:

Technology transfer encompassing the NORSCAND® Electrolysers system

Comprehensive services including process engineering and commissioning support

Electrode supply from Swedish manufacturer Permascand AB

Integration with Industrial Park Höchst infrastructure in Frankfurt

Construction timeline commencing in H2 2025

This project represents a crucial step in establishing European lithium independence while maintaining strict environmental standards.

International Collaborations for Sustainable Supply Chains

The Germany-Canada Joint Declaration of Intent exemplifies the growing international cooperation around sustainable critical minerals. Signed in September 2025, this agreement aims to secure green lithium supply chains while accelerating clean energy transitions in both countries.

Such governmental partnerships provide essential support for private sector innovations through:

Regulatory harmonization facilitating international project development

Research funding for emerging green technologies

Market incentives for sustainable material sourcing

Public-private partnerships addressing infrastructure needs

Long-term policy stability enhancing investment confidence

These collaborative approaches recognize that sustainable lithium production requires coordinated efforts across national boundaries, with governments increasingly viewing green lithium as a strategic priority for both environmental and economic reasons.

What Benefits Does Green Lithium Offer for EV Manufacturing?

The adoption of green lithium delivers multiple advantages for EV manufacturers beyond environmental considerations.

Green lithium for EV batteries significantly reduces the embedded carbon in EV batteries, which can account for up to 40% of a vehicle's lifetime emissions. By implementing sustainable extraction and processing methods, manufacturers can reduce the carbon intensity of lithium by 50-90% compared to conventional sources.

This reduction delivers several benefits:

Enhanced environmental credibility for EV products

Improved lifecycle emissions profile for regulatory compliance

Potential carbon credit generation in certain jurisdictions

Alignment with corporate sustainability commitments

Competitive advantage with environmentally conscious consumers

As automotive manufacturers face increasing pressure to reduce scope 3 emissions (those from their supply chain), green lithium represents an important opportunity to address a significant emissions source.

Supply Chain Resilience and Regional Security

Localized green lithium production enhances supply chain resilience by reducing dependence on concentrated production regions. This diversification helps manufacturers:

Mitigate geopolitical risks associated with resource concentration

Reduce transportation costs and associated emissions

Decrease vulnerability to regional disruptions

Establish shorter, more transparent supply chains

Support domestic economic development and employment

The European focus on developing regional lithium production capacity, exemplified by Vulcan Energy's German operations, reflects growing recognition that battery material security represents a strategic imperative for the continent's automotive industry.

Marketing and Regulatory Advantages

As consumers and regulators increasingly prioritize sustainability, EVs powered by green lithium offer manufacturers significant marketing advantages:

Enhanced brand positioning with environmentally conscious consumers

Compliance with emerging supply chain due diligence requirements

Alignment with sustainability-linked financing opportunities

Preparation for future carbon border adjustment mechanisms

Compatibility with emerging battery passport regulations

These advantages become increasingly valuable as markets differentiate between EVs based on their full environmental footprint rather than simply comparing them to internal combustion alternatives.

How Does Green Lithium Compare Economically to Traditional Sources?

The economic viability of green lithium represents a crucial factor in its widespread adoption.

Cost Comparison and Long-Term Economics

While green lithium technologies often require higher initial capital investment, their operational economics increasingly compete with traditional methods:

DLE technologies reduce operational expenses through faster processing times

Reduced land requirements decrease leasing and remediation costs

Decreased chemical inputs lower ongoing material expenses

Higher recovery rates improve resource utilization efficiency

Integrated energy production can offset operating costs in geothermal projects

These operational advantages increasingly offset higher capital costs, particularly as technologies mature and achieve economies of scale. Additionally, as carbon pricing mechanisms expand globally, the economic advantages of low-carbon lithium production are expected to increase substantially.

Premium Market Positioning

Green lithium commands growing premium pricing in certain markets, particularly among luxury and sustainability-focused EV manufacturers. This premium, currently estimated at 10-15% above conventional lithium prices, provides additional economic incentives for producers investing in sustainable technologies.

Several factors drive this premium pricing:

Brand value enhancement for premium EV manufacturers

Corporate sustainability commitments requiring verifiable low-carbon materials

Emerging regulatory advantages for demonstrably sustainable supply chains

Consumer willingness to pay for environmentally responsible products

Potential carbon credit generation in applicable markets

This price premium helps offset the potentially higher production costs of green lithium while the technologies continue to mature and achieve economies of scale.

Investment Trends and Market Growth

Investment in green lithium technologies has accelerated dramatically, with venture capital and public market funding for sustainable lithium projects increasing over 300% since 2020. This investment surge reflects growing confidence in both the technological viability and market demand for environmentally responsible lithium production.

Key investment trends include:

Major automotive manufacturers taking equity positions in green lithium producers

Sovereign wealth funds prioritizing sustainable resource development

Venture capital targeting early-stage extraction technology innovations

Public markets rewarding companies with clear sustainability credentials

Government support through grants, loan guarantees, and tax incentives

These investment flows are enabling the rapid commercialization of technologies that might otherwise remain at pilot scale for extended periods, accelerating the industry's sustainable transformation.

What Challenges Remain for Green Lithium Adoption?

Despite promising advances, several significant challenges must be overcome to enable widespread green lithium adoption.

Scaling Technologies from Pilot to Commercial Production

“Resource planning is critical for evaluating the energy resources that will be most beneficial for customers.","DES MOINES, Iowa — Today, the Iowa Utilities Commission approved a settlement between MidAmerican Energy and stakeholder parties, including Environmental Law & Policy Center (ELPC), Iowa Environmental Council (IEC), and Sierra Club, to authorize 800 megawatts of solar in Iowa. This is the largest solar approval in state history and would quintuple MidAmerican’s existing solar resources. MidAmerican expects the project to produce enough energy to power 144,000 homes.

When assessing different energy resources, MidAmerican’s predictive modeling concluded that expanding the utility’s solar fleet was the most cost-effective choice for customers. The environmental groups conducted their own modeling that confirmed solar as a good option in a range of future electricity cost and demand growth scenarios.

“Building solar is a no-regrets choice for Iowans: It provides consistent, clean power and moves Iowa toward a renewable energy future,” said Josh Mandelbaum, Senior Attorney at ELPC. “This proposal balances MidAmerican’s wind generation fleet to reduce reliance on its polluting coal plants.”

The settlement was unanimously supported among parties participating in the case. It provides advance approval for reasonable costs to build the solar generation and comes as federal tax credits for clean energy projects are close to expiring.

“Solar is a cost-effective resource even without tax credits, but the opportunity to use tax credits for this project makes it a clear win for Iowa customers,” said Steve Guyer, Senior Energy Policy Counsel at IEC. “Our vision for 100% renewable energy in Iowa is one step closer.”

The environmental groups have encouraged MidAmerican to expand its solar resources for several years, including in prior cases. The groups collaborated with other parties in the docket to reach agreement on a future resource planning process, which will provide an opportunity to consider rapidly changing conditions in the energy sector.

“Resource planning is critical for evaluating the energy resources that will be most beneficial for customers. The improved planning process laid out in the settlement ensures involvement for stakeholders and requires MidAmerican to evaluate coal plant retirements and affordable clean energy replacement options,” said Josh Smith, Senior Attorney at Sierra Club. “Iowa communities deserve to know what to expect. This planning process will provide needed transparency into the direction of Iowa’s energy generation.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-12 11:01:02.224731

You’ve probably noticed more electric vehicles (EVs) on the road lately. You might have even thought about buying one yourself. But with prices fluctuating, federal incentives expiring soon and new models launching frequently, it’s hard to know if now is a good time to buy.

Buy now and you might miss out on better technology or lower prices in the future. Wait and you could miss out on the current rebates and incentives. It’s a bit like trying to time the stock market. Keep reading as we look into whether now is a good time to buy an electric vehicle or if it makes more sense to wait.

Also here are EV expenses you may not be aware of.

EV Adoption and Trends

EVs are quickly growing in numbers on the road. According to Rho Motion, approximately 9.1 million electric cars were sold worldwide in the first half of 2025. This is a 28% increase over the first half of 2024. Why is this trend happening? Part of it is because more manufacturers are releasing new electric models, which gives buyers more options to choose from.

Additionally, charging stations are being installed in more convenient locations. Larger cities have them at grocery stores, shopping malls and even in parking lots across town. They can even be found at larger office buildings. However, even though the number of charging stations is increasing, things aren’t ideal for everyone. Small towns have fewer options, making it crucial that owners can charge at home.

One of the biggest issues that’s kept people from purchasing an electric vehicle in the past has been battery technology. But even that’s improving. New electric models can go further without needing a charge. This makes them good for not only city driving, but also people looking to travel out of town.

Reasons To Buy Now

If you’ve been considering an electric car, there are a few reasons why you might want to buy now rather than waiting.

Incentives and rebates: Depending on where you live, your state may have rebates available for electric vehicles. Plus, federal rebates currently offer $7,500 when you purchase a new electric vehicle or $4,000 when you buy used. However, because of the Big Beautiful Bill, these federal rebates will expire on Sept. 30, 2025.

Lower Costs to Run: With the average price of gas being over $3.00 per gallon (per AAA), it’s cheaper for most people to run an electric car as long as you have the ability to charge at home.

Technology Has Improved: Range has always been one of the key reasons why people haven’t made the change from gas to electric. However, new technology has increased the range electric cars can make it without needing a charge.

“Now is a good time to buy an EV,” said Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book (KBB). “There’s a greater choice than ever before. There are various discounts and rebates available, some are regional, some are national. Also, the popularity of some EV models is declining so a little research by the shopper could end up getting them an exceptional deal.”

Reasons To Wait

While there are many reasons why people might want to buy an electric vehicle now, some people might find it better to wait.

Technology continues to improve: Even though technology has improved, delaying your purchase might lead to further improvements. The driving range could improve even more and charging could become faster, all of which drivers desire most.

Drop in prices: As more car manufacturers continue to release electric models, prices could fall even further.

Home charging not available: One of the biggest reasons why a potential buyer might want to wait is that they don’t have access to home charging. This can significantly increase the costs of ownership.",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/automobile-car-artificial-intelligence-concept_iStock-1946362176.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 09:58:43.297152

Corporate silence on climate policy puts profits and people at risk

The US Environmental Protection Agency recently announced a proposal to end the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.

Known as the “endangerment finding” and often cited as the legal bedrock for addressing global warming, officials are reconsidering the basic premise that carbon and methane pollution threatens public health.

By seeking to overturn the only rule that allows for the limiting of planet-warming GHG emissions from vehicles, power plants, and oil and gas wells under the Clean Air Act, it would end the EPA’s ability to fight and mitigate climate change.

This latest move reminds us that the climate crisis is ultimately a political crisis. The oil and gas lobby, via the Donald Trump administration 2.0, continues to dominate US politics and would have us ignore science and our senses all in the service of maximising profit, while destroying clean air, public health and the environment in the process.

It also follows a long string of anti-climate efforts by the government to cut federal climate science research, repeal the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy provisions, withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and repeal dozens of regulations that aim to keep America’s water and air pollution at bay.

However, the proposed endangerment finding repeal moves beyond predictable regulatory rollbacks and attacks the scientific foundation for climate action.

It is also a deliberate blow to the moral and legal bedrocks of the environmental protection the EPA is tasked with upholding. After all, the EPA’s mission is to protect human health and the environment.

This strategy . . . underscores the administration’s willingness to manipulate our collective understanding of reality

While the government and the polluting oil majors may want us to believe that climate change and the associated pollution pose no threat to public health or the environment, the persistent realities of air pollution and increasingly common extreme weather events such as heatwaves, wildfires and floods persist.

For anyone who has read George Orwell’s 1984, the new administration’s climate denialist moves might remind you of this quote: “The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.”

This strategy to discredit and undermine climate science and climate action underscores the administration’s willingness to manipulate our collective understanding of reality in service of a broader political and economic agenda that sides with polluters over people.

It is up to us to come to our (literal) senses, wake up and recognise that EPA administrator Lee Zeldin’s chaotic plans make climate denial official US policy.

At risk are even further accelerated climate destabilisation and the health and safety of millions of Americans.

Corporate silence

For more than 15 years, the endangerment finding has limited planet-warming GHG emissions from the oil and gas, power and transportation sectors. Many companies moved to invest in clean tech and emissions reduction strategies, especially given the private sector’s understanding of the inherent material risks of climate change to business.

According to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s Business Breakthrough Barometer report, 61 per cent of company leaders predict that increased costs from climate-related disruptions will impact their business, and nine out of 10 companies say they will maintain or increase their transition-related investments and emissions targets.

Businesses know climate change is not going away, despite what American politicians suggest.

Some chief executives are choosing not to break with reality, recognising that the EPA’s move on the endangerment finding is “endangering” US businesses on climate.

Beyond companies simply continuing to do the work of meeting climate commitments quietly — many of which have been driven by concern for the bottom line — businesses should move into more forceful advocacy despite political risks.

Why? If the endangerment finding is repealed and if climate denialism continues to dominate US policy, there will probably be increased legal risk, regulatory disruptions and uncertainty, and the potential for American businesses to fall behind as markets globally continue the shift towards emissions reductions and a cleaner energy economy.

Companies once seen as potential climate leaders, such as Apple, Microsoft and Salesforce, should be using their lobbying power and political influence

Companies have invested billions in renewables — with those investments now at risk from ongoing policy uncertainty — and even most oil and gas companies support a national approach to limiting methane.

Businesses should be speaking up now for long-term regulatory stability and US competitiveness globally. Company leaders should remember commitments to shareholders, employees, customers and American communities.

The attacks on climate action will not slow the realities of climate change, or the associated risks. It is beyond time for companies to wield their influence on climate policy — especially those that recognise the very real material risks involved and who have made strong commitments to act.

For example, companies once seen as potential climate leaders, such as Apple, Microsoft and Salesforce, should be using their lobbying power and political influence to change the corporate climate landscape. With the complete absence of government leadership, there is even more of an imperative for businesses to act.

ClimateVoice continues to call on companies to lobby for climate solutions and publicly endorse climate policies.

Public comments to the EPA defending the endangerment finding can be submitted until September 22. Businesses can urge the EPA to maintain the endangerment finding to ensure a stable policy environment supporting long-term business planning and economic growth, while advancing a cleaner energy future.

Business leaders should band together and advocate openly through public statements and strong lobbying forces, along with urging trade groups to oppose rollbacks.

Companies must urgently consider their role at this critical moment, and end the trend towards corporate silence and complicity in an anti-climate agenda.

Silence will not lead us to a better future. Practising corporate political responsibility and moral courage will, if we act now.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/e442ea64-1b5f-4d18-a9e6-301eb9f8128c.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 07:59:25.621874

. As the EV market matures, Rivian's dual focus on commercial and defense sectors has created a unique first-mover advantage, one that could redefine its role in the broader EV ecosystem. By securing high-profile partnerships with and in the commercial space and laying the groundwork for military applications, Rivian is not merely selling vehicles—it is shaping the infrastructure and workforce of the future.

Commercial EVs: A Proven Track Record

Rivian's commercial EV strategy has been nothing short of aggressive.

Walmart's commitment to acquiring 4,500 Rivian electric delivery vans further underscores the company's dominance in this spaceLeading EV Stocks List 2025 - Electric Vehicles[ 1 ]. These partnerships are not accidental; they reflect Rivian's ability to align with corporate sustainability goals while delivering vehicles that meet the rigorous demands of commercial fleets. As of 2025, Rivian's commercial van is available to fleets of all sizes, signaling a shift from exclusive partnerships to broader market penetrationRivian Opens Sales of the Rivian Commercial Van to Fleets of All Sizes in the U.S.[ 3 ].

Defense Sector: A Quiet but Strategic Push

While Rivian's commercial success is well-documented, its foray into the defense sector remains less visible but no less significant. The U.S. military's growing interest in electrification—driven by the need for quieter, more sustainable, and less fuel-dependent operations—has opened a new frontier for EV manufacturers. Rivian's R1T and R1S models, with their 400+ mile range and 835 horsepower, are technically well-suited for military applicationsLeading EV Stocks List 2025 - Electric Vehicles[ 1 ].

Though specific defense contracts remain undisclosed, Rivian's engagement with military stakeholders is evident. The Pentagon and Detroit automakers are collaborating to modernize the military's vehicle fleet, and Rivian's electric platforms are under consideration for both tactical and non-tactical rolesLeading EV Stocks List 2025 - Electric Vehicles[ 1 ]. Additionally, Rivian's $6.6 billion federal loan for its Georgia plant$6.6B federal loan for Rivian's Georgia plant finalized[ 4 ] provides the financial runway to pivot toward defense contracts if the opportunity arises. The company's recent workforce development initiatives, such as the Rivian Mobile Service Technician training program at Fort Benning Army Base and partnerships with Tidewater Community College$6.6B federal loan for Rivian's Georgia plant finalized[ 4 ], further signal its intent to integrate into the defense supply chain. These programs not only prepare veterans for EV careers but also create a pipeline of skilled technicians who could support military EV maintenance.

First-Mover Advantage: A Double-Edged Sword

Rivian's early lead in commercial EVs has positioned it as a critical player in the transition to electrification. However, the company's success hinges on its ability to maintain this momentum. Competitors like

Conclusion

Rivian's strategic position in the EV ecosystem is defined by its ability to bridge commercial and defense markets. While its commercial partnerships have already validated its first-mover advantage, the defense sector represents an untapped opportunity—one that requires both technological adaptability and political capital. As the EV industry evolves, Rivian's success will depend on its capacity to translate its commercial credibility into military contracts and to scale its workforce development initiatives.

Allegheny County schools lead the state in potential for solar energy generation, advocates report

‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ casts shade over Pennsylvania’s solar boom

Pennsylvania’s Solar for Schools program awarded its first round of grant funding to 74 schools this spring. The program helps districts pay for the up-front costs of solar installations that will lower their utility bills in the long term.

Districts were expected to use the state money to take advantage of a federal solar tax credit, which became available to schools for the first time through former President Joe Biden’s climate law.

Fiedler’s office had said that by combining the state grants with the federal tax credit, schools could install solar arrays for free or a fraction of the usual cost.

Rooftop solar tax credits to expire with enough time for schools to install panels

Despite fears that Congress would pass a bill that would have killed the tax credits before the end of the year, a version of the tax bill that ultimately became law gives districts until next summer to start building their projects or start running them by the end of 2027, to still claim the credit.

“That’s not a rush,” said Micah Gold-Markel, founder of Philly-based solar energy installer Solar States. “We can get solar projects started in as little as two weeks. So, to start construction in a year and finish it in two years, that’s easily doable.”

The School District of Philadelphia is still pursuing its Solar for Schools projects, said spokesperson Christina Clark. The district plans to install solar panels at W.B. Saul High School, Northeast Community Propel Academy, Andrew Hamilton Elementary School and Murrell Dobbins CTE High School.

A report released by the nonprofit PennEnvironment found that if all roughly 5,000 of Pennsylvania’s schools installed solar panels, they could produce enough electricity to power around 187,000 homes per year, reduce planet-warming carbon emissions by as much as taking 300,000 cars off of roads and save schools more than $300 million over the lifetime of the solar energy systems.

In reality, fewer than half of the schools in the state would likely be capable of hosting solar on their rooftops, and even fewer would be able to install solar without first upgrading their roofs or electrical systems, Gold-Markel said.

PennEnvironment recommended policy changes that could make it easier for schools to actually install solar, including grants that cover roofing and electrical system upgrades.

“It’s clear that going solar is good for the environment, schools and students, and taking full advantage of Pennsylvania’s solar school potential requires supportive policies at every level of government,” said Flora Cardoni, deputy director of PennEnvironment.

Fiedler wants to see a second round of Solar for Schools funding included in the overdue state budget. She said even after the federal tax credit expires, the program will still benefit schools.

“Everyone who pays an energy bill is aware that energy prices are going up,” Fiedler said. “So everyone is trying to save money where they can, and the sun that’s up there waiting for us to harness its energy is a pretty good place.”

“There is huge demand for this program,” she added. “We believe that that’s going to continue.”",https://www.alleghenyfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/climate-change-pa-farmers-6-solar-panel-768x511.jpeg.webp,N,,2025-09-12 07:59:29.981618

This is indicated in the study that was conducted jointly by the Enzi Ijayo Africa Initiative (EIAI) and Africa Climate Insights (ACI), looking into a comprehensive roadmap for accelerating clean energy transition.

The report shows that while Africa has both enormous potential and enormous need to develop renewable energy, a lack of financing is holding back its progress.

“Despite being home to almost 20% of the global population, Africa accounts for just 2% of global clean energy investment, according to IEA estimates for 2025. For every US$1 invested in fossil fuels in Africa, only around 92 cents goes to clean energy, compared to a near 2:1 ratio in favour of clean energy globally.”

According to the study, in order to meet the targets of the Nairobi Declaration, Africa’s renewable capacity must rise by 23% each year between 2022 and 2030. However, it warns, since 2022, yearly growth has averaged 6.2%, necessitating a threefold increase.

“To fill this gap, Africa must use a wide range of finance tools to scale up private finance for mitigation projects like renewable power, including green guarantees, impact investment, public-private partnerships, green financial instruments like green bonds and sustainability-linked bonds, and blended finance.”

Patrick Mwesigwa, Managing Director of Kanara Solutions and a certified Public-Private Partnership (PPP) specialist, shares his insights into building successful PPPs in Africa’s energy and infrastructure sectors.

Case studies: Diverse renewable energy solutions across Africa

The report highlights several successful renewable energy projects across Africa that have been implemented using diverse financial models. It focuses on five case studies, examining their financing structures and overall impact.

Kenya

One such example is the Lake Turkana Wind Power Project (LTWP), Kenya’s largest single private investment to date. Located in the uniquely windy region of Marsabit County, LTWP is a major private-sector renewable energy initiative. With an installed capacity of 310MW generated by 365 wind turbines, the project accounts for approximately 17% of Kenya’s total installed power capacity.

“The LTWP project, costing approximately €625 million, was a prime example of blended finance, which strategically combined concessional funding with commercial capital to de-risk the high-impact venture. The project secured €130 million in equity financing from a mix of public and private investors and debt financing from the African Development Bank (AfDB) and European Investment Bank (EIB).

“LTWP has delivered significant impacts across Kenya. In 2024, it contributed approximately 10.89% of the country’s total power mix and provided over one million homes with 100% renewable energy.”

Of reference: What drives wind farm installations in Africa?

Morocco

The study highlights the Ouarzazate Solar Power Station (NOOR Complex) in Morocco, which it says represents a significant milestone in solar power development.

“It is one of the largest concentrated solar power plants globally, with a total capacity of 582MW from both concentrated solar power (CSP), which provides 510MW, and photovoltaic (PV) technologies for the remaining 72MW.

“The NOOR Complex has delivered significant environmental and economic impacts. It offsets approximately 690,000 tonnes of CO₂ emissions annually, directly supporting Morocco’s climate action goals.”

Nigeria

In Nigeria, the report states that a demand-led approach to solar energy adoption is gaining momentum, particularly as an off-grid solution for both residential households and commercial and industrial users.

“President Bola Tinubu’s first act in office in 2023 was a policy decision to eliminate fuel subsidies, leading to an immediate increase in petrol and diesel prices. Given that an estimated 40% of electricity consumed is from backup generation, this sudden increase in fuel costs fundamentally altered the operational economics for Nigerian businesses and households.

“A key model offered by companies serving the residential and small business market is Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG), which supports these customers to pay for solar systems in small, regular instalments, making clean energy more accessible.”

DRC and Mozambique

Moving to Central and Southern Africa, the study notes that the region is home to some of the world’s most ambitious proposed mega-hydropower projects, aimed at harnessing the vast energy potential of major river systems. Notable examples include the Grand Inga project in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Mphanda Nkuwa project in Mozambique.

The study states that these projects could drive industrialisation, generating long-term economic growth in the region, particularly in the mining sector through local mineral processing.

“The projects are backed by a range of key stakeholders, including governments, private consortia, and multilateral development banks (MDBs) such as the World Bank and AfDB. These projects would address the severe energy deficit in Central and Southern Africa and the need to drive regional economic development and industrialisation.”

South Africa

Lastly, the study highlights South Africa’s deployment of Africa’s largest Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) project, marking a critical step toward addressing the country’s persistent electricity crisis.

Of reference South Africa: Five projects announced for third battery bid window

“The country’s strategy is twofold: the state-led Eskom BESS Rollout Programme and a competitive tender process for private developers called the Battery Energy Storage Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (BESIPPPP).

The study indicates that the BESIPPPP has cumulatively procured over 1,744MW of BESS capacity across three bid windows, attracting significant private investment.

“The BESS rollout is already yielding significant impacts. The programmes are creating significant employment opportunities, with the first bid window of BESIPPPP committing to creating 992 jobs, and the third bid window promising 852 jobs.”

This incident highlights the sector's reliance on cross-border labor and the fragility of supply chains when regulatory enforcement clashes with operational needs.

Historically, regulatory shifts have significantly influenced EV valuations. For example, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced tax credits for EVs but also imposed stringent compliance requirements, while California's Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) program penalizes automakers up to $20,000 per missed zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) targetTrends in the electric vehicle industry – Global EV Outlook 2024[ 2 ]. These frameworks create financial pressures, forcing companies to balance compliance costs with market demands. Hyundai's delay adds to a pattern where regulatory missteps—whether immigration enforcement or emission penalties—can trigger short-term valuation declines and long-term reputational risks.

Operational Risks and Sector-Wide Valuation Trends

The EV sector has faced valuation volatility due to operational challenges. In 2024, Tesla's failure to meet delivery targets led to a 6.3% stock price drop, erasing $13.5 billion in market valueTrends in the electric vehicle industry – Global EV Outlook 2024[ 2 ]. Similarly, Hyundai's reliance on a single battery plant in Georgia, now delayed, risks overexposure to localized disruptions. Analysts note that such bottlenecks amplify sector-wide risks, particularly as automakers race to meet aggressive EV production targets.

A broader trend reveals how operational risks—such as supply chain bottlenecks and production delays—have reshaped sector valuations. Between 2020 and 2024, the combined market capitalization of pure-play EV manufacturers fell by 20% despite global EV sales surging to 17 million unitsTrends in the electric vehicle industry – Global EV Outlook 2024[ 2 ]. Battery makers like CATL have seen their stocks trade near three-year lows, reflecting investor skepticism about overcapacity and margin compressionTrends in the electric vehicle industry – Global EV Outlook 2024[ 2 ]. Hyundai's delay, while not yet quantified in stock price terms, aligns with this pattern of volatility, where operational hiccups can erode investor confidence.

Geopolitical and Policy Headwinds: A Broader Context

The Georgia incident also occurs amid heightened geopolitical tensions. Reports indicate that Trump-era policies, including the repeal of the IRA and tariffs on critical battery components like graphite, have already weakened the U.S. battery supply chainTrends in the electric vehicle industry – Global EV Outlook 2024[ 2 ]. These policies have led to the cancellation of $21 billion in clean energy investments and projected job losses in the sectorTrends in the electric vehicle industry – Global EV Outlook 2024[ 2 ]. Hyundai's delay, therefore, is not an isolated event but part of a larger narrative where policy shifts and enforcement actions create uncertainty for EV manufacturers.

Implications for Supply Chain Resilience

Hyundai's experience underscores the need for diversified supply chains and contingency planning. The company's pivot to sourcing batteries from its SK On plant demonstrates a short-term fix but highlights long-term risks if similar disruptions occur elsewhere. Industry analysts emphasize that resilience requires not only geographic diversification but also investments in local talent and regulatory alignment. For instance, Hyundai's Customer Assurance program—fixing MSRP prices to mitigate tariff impacts—shows proactive risk managementTrends in the electric vehicle industry – Global EV Outlook 2024[ 2 ]. However, labor shortages and immigration policies remain persistent challenges.

Hyundai Motor Company and LG Energy Solution have been building a battery joint venture plant in Georgia, United States, with the goal of completion in the first half of 2026.
As a result, the resumption of plant construction will inevitably be further delayed.
The delay in establishing the Hyundai Motor Company and LG Energy Solution joint venture plant is also expected to affect the investments of other companies operating locally.
Hyundai Motor Group is keeping open the possibility of revising its production strategy in the United States to minimize the impact of the delay in establishing the battery joint venture plant.","Jose Munoz, President of Hyundai Motor Company, has officially stated that the construction schedule for the Hyundai Motor Company and LG Energy Solution battery joint venture plant has been disrupted due to the impact of U.S. authorities' visa crackdown. After a large-scale visa enforcement action at business sites by U.S. immigration authorities, concerns were raised about reduced investment and potential delays in plant construction by Korean companies, and this is the first time it has been acknowledged. LG Energy Solution, whose more than 300 employees, including those from partner companies, were detained, has also decided to grant these employees a special one-month leave of absence, making it inevitable that construction will be delayed by at least a month.

On September 11 (local time), President Munoz attended an automotive event in Detroit, where he said, ""Due to this incident (the U.S. authorities' visa crackdown), we expect at least a two to three month delay in construction."" He added, ""All personnel want to return to Korea,"" and continued, ""We will also have to consider how to fill those positions."" He explained the background of the disruption by stating, ""The construction phase of the plant requires specialized personnel,"" and ""There are many skills and equipment that cannot be sourced in the United States.""

Hyundai Motor Company and LG Energy Solution have been building a battery joint venture plant in Georgia, United States, with the goal of completion in the first half of 2026. However, as disruptions have occurred in securing personnel such as equipment process experts, the completion date is now expected to be pushed back to the second half of the year or later.

It has been reported that LG Energy Solution will grant four weeks of leave of absence to its employees and those of its partner companies until October 12. This type of leave is provided by a company or country for official reasons to allow employees to rest. As a result, the resumption of plant construction will inevitably be further delayed. A company representative said, ""We were almost at the final stage of completion, but due to this sudden variable, it is expected to take quite some time,"" and continued, ""At the moment, we do not have the capacity to assess the extent of plant damage or whether we can resume operations. Our focus is on ensuring the safe return of our employees to Korea.""

The delay in establishing the Hyundai Motor Company and LG Energy Solution joint venture plant is also expected to affect the investments of other companies operating locally. Semiconductor, automobile, and battery companies that have already confirmed investments will have no choice but to delay the start of plant construction or the deployment of personnel, while companies considering new investments must now reassess stability and direction.

This trend is also placing direct pressure on Samsung Electronics' foundry (semiconductor contract manufacturing) plant in Taylor, Texas. This plant is a key investment site that must establish an advanced 2nm (1nm = one billionth of a meter) semiconductor production line, requiring the dispatch of a large number of skilled personnel from Korea. However, inevitable delays are occurring due to visa issuance holdups. In particular, not only Samsung but also its parts and equipment partners face significant challenges, as it is difficult to obtain L1 visas unless they have established local subsidiaries.

An industry official stated, ""Even if we prepare to dispatch personnel who have already received L1 visas, it takes several months to obtain new ones,"" and added, ""The fact that partner company personnel are also restricted is a problem."" He continued, ""In order to cooperate with Tesla, it is necessary to complete the Taylor plant as soon as possible, but uncertainty has increased even at the equipment ordering preparation stage,"" and said, ""We can only hope for negotiations between the governments."" He also explained, ""We are considering to what extent we can increase the proportion of local hires, but at least 20% of the workforce must be skilled personnel from Korea.""

Jang Sangshik, Head of the International Trade and Commerce Research Institute at the Korea International Trade Association, said, ""In the short term, negative impacts are inevitable,"" and analyzed, ""Companies that have not yet begun construction will have no choice but to delay their schedules, and those already underway will need to adjust completion dates or recalculate costs."" He pointed out, ""During the plant construction and equipment installation phase, there is a high dependence on Korean engineers, so it is difficult to replace them with only U.S. personnel.""

Companies unanimously agree that the U.S. market remains a core strategic market for Korean companies and the Korean economy. On this day, Chung Euisun, Chairman of Hyundai Motor Group, attended the Automotive News event in the United States and said, ""I felt relieved to hear that everyone is returning home safely,"" and added, ""The United States is the largest and most important market for Hyundai Motor Company,"" expressing, ""As an automobile manufacturer, I want to contribute even more to the U.S. market."" This is seen as emphasizing that the fundamental commitment to investment in the United States remains unchanged, even after the large-scale crackdown by U.S. authorities. He continued, ""Visa issues are very complicated. I hope both countries can work together to create a better system.""

President Munoz also stated, ""Although this incident is very regrettable, the strategic importance of the U.S. market to Hyundai Motor Company remains unchanged,"" and emphasized, ""We have been investing for the past several years and will continue to do so in the future."" Hyundai Motor Group is keeping open the possibility of revising its production strategy in the United States to minimize the impact of the delay in establishing the battery joint venture plant. A leading option being discussed is to reduce the proportion of electric vehicle production and increase the production of hybrid vehicles at Hyundai Motor Group Meta Plant America (HMGMA).",https://cphoto.asiae.co.kr/listimglink/6/2025091210534930596_1757642029.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 12:05:10.462187

Power management company Eaton and electric vehicle charger network ChargePoint have unveiled new EV charging infrastructure meant to provide ultrafast charging along with bidirectional charging capabilities, the companies announced Aug. 28.

The new ChargePoint Express Grid combines ChargePoint chargers with Eaton’s end-to-end power infrastructure to create a system that will “seamlessly synchronize onsite renewables, energy storage and vehicle batteries with local energy markets to help fleets significantly reduce fueling costs,” according to the press release.

The companies said the system will require a 30% smaller footprint with 30% fewer capital expenditures compared to typical chargers, ultimately cutting up to 30% of operational costs.

The new technology “will take DC fast charging to levels of performance and cost not previously imagined,” Rick Wilmer, CEO of ChargePoint, said in a statement.

ChargePoint and Eaton announced their partnership in May, promising “turnkey offerings” to simplify and accelerate the electrification transition in transportation.

“Combined with Eaton’s end-to-end grid capabilities, ChargePoint is delivering solutions to help EVs win on pure economics, regardless of tax incentives or government support,” Wilmer said.

The Trump administration had previously stalled federal funding of EV chargers, though it relaunched the program after a court order. In addition, federal EV tax credits are expiring this month due to the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill in July.

Commercial ChargePoint clients in North America and Europe can order the new infrastructure in early 2026, with deliveries expected in the second half of 2026. Eaton will build a custom, “site-ready” solution for each client, the release said.

“Our partnership with ChargePoint is an accelerator for innovation in electrification, with novel technology today and into the future that makes going electric the smart choice,” said Paul Ryan, vice president and general manager of energy transition at Eaton.

The technology may be advancing quickly, but as the panelists made clear, the future of the battery industry will be decided by its workforce.","The battery sector is in the midst of rapid transformation. Companies are racing to scale, new technologies are reshaping production, and workforce demands are evolving faster than talent pipelines can keep pace. These dynamics framed the recent Future-Charged Workforce webinar, which I hosted on behalf of the Volta Foundation, which brought together industry leaders to examine how the sector can prepare the workforce of tomorrow.

The panel consisted of Roshan Pujari (Stardust Power), Nicolina Nanni (Liminal Insights), Ajay Gnanasekaran (Argonne National Laboratory), and Veronika Wright (Electrification Academy). Together, they explored the major workforce shifts of the past five years, the emerging skills most in demand, and strategies to better align education with industry needs.

From R&D to scaling

A clear theme was the pivot away from R&D-heavy efforts toward full-scale implementation. As Roshan Pujari emphasized, the priority has shifted from experimentation to building the infrastructure that will allow the US to meet its energy needs. That transition requires retraining workforces from adjacent industries, strengthening regional training pipelines, and ensuring that new projects are rooted in local community engagement.

Broadening skills & data literacy

Where the workforce once drew primarily from engineering disciplines rooted in the physical, the skillset is now broadening. Nicolina Nanni stressed that data is no longer a byproduct but a strategic asset. Factory workers don't need to become data scientists, but they do need the literacy to interact with data, identify anomalies, and apply systems thinking to support AI-enabled quality inspection and predictive analytics.

AI, automation, & human judgment

AI and automation are reshaping battery manufacturing, but the panelists agreed these technologies will not replace people. Instead, they heighten the importance of human judgment.

""The more automation you have, the more human judgment really matters,"" Nanni observed.

The consensus was clear: technology adoption and workforce training must advance together, with continuous upskilling built into factory rollouts.

Bridging academia, industry, & communities

Ajay Gnanasekaran highlighted the role of national labs as facilitators, linking universities, vocational schools, and companies to build educational ecosystems around new industrial projects. Programs such as the Battery Workforce Challenge give students real-world experience under simulated industry conditions, producing graduates who are job-ready on day one.

He also stressed the importance of transferable skills. Workers from oil and gas, automotive, or other high-volume manufacturing sectors often bring valuable expertise that can be quickly repurposed for battery production. Effective workforce development strategies must account for these opportunities to retrain and redeploy existing labor pools.

A shared language for training

Closing the discussion, Veronika Wright pointed to a deeper challenge: the lack of a shared framework for battery education. Through her Electrification Academy initiative, she is mapping real industry workflows — from manufacturing and recycling to logistics and safety — and turning them into practical training resources.

She emphasized that while AI can provide facts about chemistries or fundamentals, it cannot capture the lessons learned on the factory floor. Sharing those experiences openly will be critical to avoid repeating mistakes as the industry scales.

Outlook: Workforce as the bottleneck

If one consensus emerged from the webinar, it was this: energy security depends on workforce security. Scaling production, deploying AI, and securing supply chains will all falter without a trained, adaptable, and future-ready workforce.

The message to companies, policymakers, and educators was clear — investing in talent pipelines is not optional but essential if the battery industry is to thrive in the decade ahead.

Next steps for the industry

To help benchmark progress, the Volta Foundation recently released the Battery Talent Census, the most comprehensive snapshot yet of hiring trends, salary benchmarks, and workforce dynamics across the ecosystem. And on October 2, the Battery Career Fair will provide a platform for connecting talent with employers, directly addressing one of the sector's most urgent needs.

“The harmful Public Lands Rule would have blocked access to use of public lands for outdoor recreation and also would have restricted energy production, grazing and forest management,” Sen. Steve Daines said in a statement.
He repeated the past assertion that the public lands rule last year was illegal.
“And this idea that somehow conservation was going to trump production agriculture — that's what this public lands rule is all about.
Furthermore, not all agriculture producers were against the rule, with 92% of the more than 150,000 public comments supporting the Public Lands Rule, according to a Center for Western Priorities analysis.","The Department of the Interior is proposing to quit the public land conservation rule finalized last year under the Biden administration and then legally challenged by Montana.

With the removal of the rule, the agency intends to open up public lands across the nation for mostly industry interests like energy development and agriculture.

The government's move was praised by Republicans and industry groups, while environmentalists said it would threaten wildlife, hunting and public access.

“The harmful Public Lands Rule would have blocked access to use of public lands for outdoor recreation and also would have restricted energy production, grazing and forest management,” Sen. Steve Daines said in a statement. “By rescinding the Public Lands Rule and unlocking more timber sales in Montana, we’ll be better able to manage our forests and prevent catastrophic wildfires.”

The Conservation and Landscape Health Rule, informally known as the Public Lands Rule, intends to help safeguard the health of public lands by defining conservation as an official use of public lands on equal footing with other activities like grazing or drilling. The Bureau of Land Management oversees roughly 8 million acres in Montana.

For more than two years, politicians, environmental groups and industry interests deliberated over whether the rule would lock up lands or protect and restore lands in a changing climate. Roughly 80% of BLM land is open to oil and gas development, something environmental groups believe comes at the expense of public access and conservation.

Once the rule was enacted in June last year, it was met with four separate legal challenges by industry interest groups and states, including by Montana.

The State of Montana joined the states of Idaho and North Dakota in a joint challenge to the rule in the U.S. District Court for North Dakota after it went into effect last May. The lawsuit said the Interior Department made the “radical leap” that conservation is on the same grounds of uses like drilling or grazing and is obstructing the development of public resources for climate change reasons.

The Department of Justice said the states’ interpretation of federal law was inaccurate and that the states lacked sufficient legal claims of harm. As of the start of the Trump administration, that lawsuit has been continually paused, according to recent court documents.

At a Billings agriculture roundtable Wednesday, Gov. Greg Gianforte said the difference between the Trump administration and the Biden administration has been ""night and day"" with communication on these issues. He repeated the past assertion that the public lands rule last year was illegal.

“Public lands need to be managed for multiple use, recreation and production agriculture,” Gianforte said. “And this idea that somehow conservation was going to trump production agriculture — that's what this public lands rule is all about. So, we fought the decision during the Biden administration to take public lands out of production agriculture in Montana.”

Contrary to what Gianforte told producers and the surrounding audience at the roundtable, conservation was not prioritized over other uses with the rule. It also directed the BLM to consider local community input in its decision making.

Furthermore, not all agriculture producers were against the rule, with 92% of the more than 150,000 public comments supporting the Public Lands Rule, according to a Center for Western Priorities analysis.

“Rural Montanans like me stake our livelihoods on healthy lands and clean waters,” Wade Sikorski, a farmer and rancher in Fallon County, said in a press release. “The Public Lands Rule is a tool in BLM’s toolbox to work with landowners and other interests to make sure land uses are equitably balanced to keep our lands healthy for future generations. It’s extremely disheartening that this administration is trying to dismantle this rule less than a year after it went into effect.”

The Interior Department stated in a press release that rescission of the rule would allow for the streamlining of permitting for industry interests and avoiding potential litigation.

The rule leads to land being “left idle,” rather than legitimate multiple-uses like grazing or energy development, according to the press release. The rescission comes at a time where the Trump administration is trying to push for greater domestic energy production, primarily in the realm of fossil fuels. The release referenced Trump’s executive order on ""Unleashing American Energy,"" and said it would eliminate unnecessary barriers to energy development.

The proposed rescission of the rule follows other recent industry-friendly actions reversing years of federal actions like a reduced federal royalty rate for coal, oil and gas. Another proposed federal rescission would repeal a 2001 Roadless Rule for national forests and in the process open up around 6 million federal acres in Montana for development.

Environmental groups said the latest proposed rule rescission is one in a string of action tilting public land to industry interests.

“Every one of this administration’s public-lands policies is designed to sell out public access, recreation, clean water and wildlife to boost corporate profits,” Wild Montana federal policy director Aubrey Bertram said in a press release “‘Multiple-use’ doesn’t mean that oil and gas corporations get to dictate what happens to our public lands. Rolling back the Public Lands Rule is another way to cut out public input, undermine local management and give industry and billionaires control of the places where we hike, hunt, fish, camp and ride.”

Public comment will be open through the Federal Register in a 60-day comment period running through Nov. 10.

Atom-smashing fusion devices replicating the power of the sun. Sleek next-gen nuclear reactors splitting isotopes.

So what is Dan Schwartz, founding director of the University of Washington’s Clean Energy Institute, excited about?

Solar power and batteries.

President Jimmy Carter put solar panels on the roof of the White House in 1979. Omnipresent lithium-ion batteries go back decades. Where’s the thrill?

“I love fusion,” Schwartz said. “I love that we are the fusion capital of the world in this region. But there’s no utility that has on their 10-year planning document … a fusion reactor or even a small modular reactor, or even a conventional nuclear reactor. You’re just not going to build those in 10 years.”

Schwartz shared his expertise on clean energy solutions at a Seattle CityClub Civic Cocktail event Wednesday evening held in the city’s downtown. The conversation included fellow panelists Emily Moore, director of climate and energy for the Sightline Institute think tank, and Gregg Small, executive director of the nonprofit Climate Solutions. I moderated the conversation.

Washington state and the rest of the world are racing to deploy clean energy solutions amid surging demand. The rapid expansion of AI-powered data centers has intensified power consumption needs, while transportation, building heating and cooling, and industrial operations are increasingly shifting to electricity as they transition away from fossil fuels.

There are fusion and nuclear projects being deployed today. Helion Energy this summer began construction near the Columbia River on what it hopes will be the world’s first commercial fusion reactor. If all goes to plan, Microsoft has promised to buy energy from the facility, which should be running by 2028. Washington’s TerraPower is building its first small modular reactor in Wyoming and aims to operate by 2030.

While cutting-edge companies are launching new electricity sources, significant components of these technologies often still need to be proven at scale, and the supply chains aren’t close to ready for rapid deployment.

“Solar is really the cheapest, fastest thing that you can install today for new generating capacity, and when it’s coupled with a battery, it is really a tremendous new resource for the grid,” Schwartz said.

Batteries can store excess power that’s produced by solar panels when the sun is shining and then provide electricity at night, making renewable energy available around the clock.

And the truth is, these technologies have advanced dramatically since the days of President Carter and the original Energizer Bunny. The UW’s Clean Energy Institute is helping facilitate some of that work by providing expertise and lab space to innovators.

In solar energy, researchers are developing new technologies that are much more efficient at generating power than existing photovoltaic cells. That includes materials that can capture energy from solar wavelengths that aren’t normally tapped into.

Companies such as Group14 Technologies, Sila and Ecellix are operating in Washington, building and producing materials to significantly improve battery performance — making them more powerful, longer lasting and faster to recharge.

Efforts are underway to eliminate “conflict minerals” from batteries — materials often mined under conditions involving forced labor, child labor, corruption and environmental damage. According to Schwartz, batteries now use about 10% as much cobalt as they did a decade or two ago, with the industry shifting toward abundant minerals like iron, sodium and sulfur.

And finally, there are mounting efforts to recycle and reuse solar panels and batteries. Schwartz even sees an opportunity for Amazon to get into the field — perhaps evolving from books to cloud to batteries?

“There is a whole economy waiting to be created out of [used] batteries if we can understand their state of health and then value them,” he said. “Honestly, I think it could be Amazon’s biggest business, creating a marketplace for this because it is a massively increasing asset.”",https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sep-10-25-Civic-Cocktail-66-1260x840.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 23:59:01.139853

See our briefing notes “ CSRD – The European Commission Proposes Significant Deregulation” and “ CSRD and the Omnibus Proposal – Implications for Asset Managers”.","The pace of change with regard to attitudes, laws and regulations on climate change matters in the ten years since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015 has been head spinning. In the early years of the past decade, there appeared to be a growing international consensus on the need to finance the transition to net zero. In its ambitious Sustainable Finance Action Plan, published in 2018, the European Union (“EU”) sought to position itself as a global leader in the area of sustainable finance, introducing a complex framework of new disclosure rules intended to provide investors with the information they needed to make investments aligned with their sustainability goals. In the US, at a federal level, the SEC proposed rules aiming to standardise how companies report their climate-related risks and impacts, while a large number of states introduced sustainability reporting regulations. The Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) introduced significant tax incentives to facilitate the transition towards sustainable energy.

In more recent years, we have seen the US's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and denouncement of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”), legal challenges to the SEC's proposed corporate disclosure rules, ultimately leading to their defence being abandoned earlier this year, and a significant rollback on the clean energy tax credits and other climate-related provisions in the IRA. A number of US states have implemented policies to restrict ESG considerations in state investments, requiring investment decisions to be based solely on financial considerations, and “blacklisting” asset managers deemed to be boycotting fossil fuels. A number of asset managers have withdrawn from climate initiatives such as the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, which had launched as recently as 2020 but suspended its activities in January of this year.

The EU's Ongoing Commitment

The “ESG backlash” and change in the administration in the US coincided with the reconstitution of the European Commission in 2024, a year in which both the Letta1 and Draghi2 reports on the future of the EU's single market and on EU competitiveness were published. The EU's renewed focus on competitiveness and growth posed questions as to whether the EU would pursue its European Green Deal with continued zeal, particularly in light of the prospect of increasing deregulation across the Atlantic. President von der Leyen's mission letter3 to Commissioner Albuquerque reaffirmed the Commission's climate objectives, including its goal to become the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050, and its commitment to the UN SDGs and the Green Deal. The letter made it clear that the EU intends to remain a global leader in sustainable finance, referring to scaling up sustainable finance, in particular transition finance and climate resilience.

The Simplification Agenda

Notably, the mission letter also referred to the Commission's focus on reducing administrative burdens and simplifying legislation, including reducing reporting obligations by at least 25%. The new Commission acted with purpose in this regard, publishing the Omnibus I proposal in February of this year, which includes proposals to significantly reduce the scope of the reporting requirements under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) and proposed amendments to reporting obligations under the Taxonomy Regulation. While the proposals have been described by the Commission as ‘simplification' rather than ‘deregulation' efforts, the effect of the proposals, if adopted, would be to significantly scale-back CSRD reporting obligations, with 80% of companies taken out of scope and a two-year delay to reporting for those that would continue to be subject to the CSRD.4

From a burden reduction perspective, the CSRD changes will no doubt be welcomed by many EU companies. However, reduced sustainability reporting poses challenges to fund managers already dealing with significant data challenges in meeting their obligations under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (“SFDR”) and the Taxonomy Regulation. To fill the data gap, fund managers will have to continue to rely on ESG data and ratings sold by third-party providers, potentially increasing costs for investors. The fact that ESG data providers remain unregulated at EU level, and that ESG data is not standardised and often incomparable, adds to the compliance challenges for asset managers. The lack of available, reliable data will likely lead to the increased use of estimates in meeting disclosure obligations, which, in the absence of clear guidance on the use of such estimates, may increase the risk of greenwashing and undermine the trust and confidence of investors in the financial system.

Recognising that the “regulatory burden has become a brake on Europe's competitiveness”,5 the Commission's simplification agenda includes proposals to address the issue of fragmentation and the unnecessary duplication of regulatory burdens, particularly the barriers and costs relating to operating group structures across EU member states and to the distribution of investment funds across the EU, with legislative proposals expected later this year.6

The review of the SFDR, one of the cornerstones of the EU's sustainable finance framework, does not fit neatly into this new simplification and burden reduction agenda. Work on the review of the SFDR commenced in 2023, prior to the publication of the Draghi report and the reconstitution of the Commission, and the introduction of a new product classification regime to replace the current disclosure regime is difficult to reconcile with a simplification objective. While criticisms of the current SFDR censuring the complexity of the disclosures for retail investors and questioning the usefulness of the disclosures for professional investors are warranted, asset managers have already incurred significant compliance costs and made substantial changes in order to comply with the disclosure regime and are now faced with a further potentially significant overhaul of the framework.

One of the most notable challenges in implementing the SFDR related to the misalignment in timing of the introduction of obligations. For example, the EU imposed detailed disclosure obligations on market participants at a time when there were no corresponding reporting obligations on investee companies, creating significant data gaps and resulting in less comparable, comprehensible disclosures for investors, undermining the purpose of the EU disclosure regime. The proposed reduced scope of the CSRD is likely to compound these challenges.

There continues to be misalignment between the SFDR, the Taxonomy Regulation and the provisions relating to investor's sustainability preferences in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”). A more coherent, consistent framework should be the objective of an holistic approach to the Omnibus I Proposal, the SFDR review and a future review of MiFID.

What do investors have to say?

In addition to diverging policy and regulatory approaches with regard to ESG reporting and disclosures, there may also be divergence in investor preferences between the EU and US. In both jurisdictions, the geopolitical environment has drawn attention away from sustainability issues and towards economic growth, competitiveness and defence. While assets in global ESG funds ended 2024 8% higher than in 2023 to reach an annual record high of $3.2 trillion, inflows had been declining in the three years prior to 2025, and redemptions were at a record high of $11.8 billion in the first quarter of 2025 globally. While not representative of an established pattern, in the second quarter of 2025, European investors drove a recovery in sustainable funds, investing $8.6 billion of net new money into ESG funds over those three months, after redeeming $7.3 billion in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, the US saw the eleventh consecutive quarter of withdrawals.7

There has also been a marked difference between the EU and the US in relation to the level of support for shareholder resolutions with an ESG objective, with asset managers in the UK and Europe supporting 81% of shareholder ESG proposals on average in 2024, compared with 25% support in the US.8 New restrictions on permissible shareholder resolutions introduced by the SEC earlier this year preceded a sharp fall in the number of environmental and social proposals submitted to shareholder vote. Arguably, this could impact US companies' insight into the market's view of financially material ESG themes.9

There have been instances of EU pension funds withdrawing from or reviewing mandates with asset managers that have revised their ESG credentials or withdrawn from climate initiatives such as NZAM and Climate Action 100+. Although it may be too early to determine whether this is the “early phase of a broader movement”, European pension funds and other long-term asset owners remain committed to sustainable investing.10

(WTRF) — Hancock County Commissioner Eron Chek is highlighting hydropower development along the Ohio River as a key to long-term energy, economic and community growth.

In his September newsletter, Chek called hydropower the “original renewable,” noting that projects such as the Current Hydro initiative at New Cumberland and Pike Island represent more than just clean energy.

“Hydropower is steady, reliable, and — when designed right — protects the health of the river ecosystem while fueling economic opportunity for decades to come,” Chek wrote.

Chek outlined four major benefits of local hydropower.

Business: Companies applying for permits score higher when they can demonstrate diverse energy use, giving Hancock County businesses a competitive edge.

Jobs: Hydropower projects bring construction, operations and maintenance work, boosting local restaurants, suppliers and housing.

Future: The Current Hydro project is designed to power Hancock County and the surrounding region for a century or more, Chek said.

Grid stability: Hydropower provides base-load electricity, strengthening the local energy system.

Chek added that hydropower projects are designed to serve communities for more than 100 years, unlike other forms of energy. He said the Current Hydro project is part of a forward-thinking investment meant to keep Hancock County competitive, sustainable and attractive to new opportunities.

It’s a new energy task force in North Carolina, and EDF is honored to have a role in this state initiative to meet the challenge of rising electricity demand. If we fail to build enough electricity generation to keep up with rising demand, that will mean bill shock for NC households. Many people have opened the highest electricity bill of their life this summer, a trend that will continue if we don’t find a way to get costs under control while phasing out our coal fleet and finding the right mix of next-generation technologies.

We’re in a time of broader uncertainty, with federal policy in flux and high interest rates challenging developers and utilities who need to make investments in their growing systems.

But North Carolina has a history of innovating in power sector regulation, regardless of what is happening in Washington, DC. The Clean Smokestacks Act in 2002 helped clean up an aging coal fleet, and House Bill 951 in 2021 set power sector emission reduction targets to put the state on a path towards a cleaner, more diversified energy generation portfolio. We must set our own course and learn from other states who are experimenting with new ways to meet power demand, which is rising faster than traditional power plants like coal, gas or nuclear, and can realistically be built.

We have to expand the range of options on the table to meet a surge in demand from data centers and new industrial sources. That means tapping into batteries on people’s homes, incentivizing large facilities to reduce their usage during peak demand times and building as much of the quickest-to-market resources we can — which are primarily solar and batteries.

Two steps forward, one step back

We took a step backwards from that vision this year with the passage of Senate Bill 266 (S266), which relies on the false hope that slowing our investment in clean energy will save ratepayers money. But we can’t meet rising demand simply by running more aging, dirty coal and gas. Not only does this lead, as it did in June, to the utilities requesting emergency exemptions to exceed local air pollution limits, but it puts regular households on the hook for rising natural gas prices, which the federal Energy Information Agency projects to rise as demand rises, while supply remains flat.

That’s a big part of why an N.C. State University study showed S266 could cost North Carolinians an additional $23 billion in power bill payments through 2050. Instead of modernizing the grid with affordable clean energy, the bill would encourage Duke Energy to rely on older plants and costly gas-fired facilities. EDF-commissioned analysis also found S266 would saddle households with nearly $90 million in extra annual costs to finance power bill discounts for the state’s largest commercial and industrial energy users. And an analysis of the last seven years of power bills shows that volatile gas prices are responsible for up to 67% of the recent rise in North Carolina energy costs.

As EDF’s NC State Director David Kelly put it in this WRAL article, S266 is “an energy tax in disguise,” forcing families to pay more for gas plants we don’t need, and that our climate and working families can’t afford. Doubling down on expensive fossil fuels guarantees more of the same: higher bills and more pollution.

Leading the pack or falling behind?

But S266 does not mean that North Carolina can’t chart a cheaper, cleaner course. The NC Energy Policy Task Force is composed of a set of experts, assembled to ensure that as our state’s energy needs grow, we meet them affordably and transparently.

Along these lines, the new Task Force will tackle two critical priority areas:

Large Load Growth Management

North Carolina needs a plan for integrating large industrial power needs without overburdening residents or rolling back clean energy commitments. The Task Force will examine the full set of solutions — from accelerating clean generation to improving grid efficiency — so that rapid demand growth can be met fairly and sustainably.

Modeling & Transparency

Right now, the long-term utility planning process is often opaque and inaccessible to the public. Utilities make multi-billion-dollar investment decisions with little visibility into the assumptions behind them. The Task Force will change that by creating a public, parallel modeling process — based on the same tools used by utilities — so stakeholders can see exactly how decisions are made, test assumptions, and explore cleaner, more affordable options.

Clean energy is the affordability solution North Carolina needs

North Carolina households are already feeling the pinch from volatile fuel prices and rising bills.

It all adds up to proof there’s still plenty of pent up demand for new vehicles, Smoke said.
If the import tariffs are Thing One, the demise after September 30 of federal EV tax credits qualifies as Thing Two.
“No question we have seen clearly in the data that the first quarter almost always sucks for EV sales.
It will be interesting, however, to see how the various EV brands perform on a more level playing field when there’s no dividing line between those that qualified for tax credits and those that didn’t.","Somehow the auto industry and consumers are figuring out how to deal with the double jeopardy of import tariffs and the impending end of federal tax credits for many electric vehicles, and it’s not at all how insiders thought it would all go down.

When President Donald Trump announced he planned to impose stiff tariffs on imported vehicles among other products, consumers made a mad dash to dealer lots to beat expected price hikes on post-tariff vehicles.

The expectations were dealers would be left with fewer vehicles on their lots and prices would skyrocket on cars and trucks made outside the United States and sales would tank.

It all seemed logical, but sometimes logic doesn’t mirror reality.

Indeed, what happened over the summer is more like an amusement park ride to Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke.

“So you’re seeing inventory deliveries slow down, but yet sales are stronger. So we are seeing supply tighten, a bit like it was back in 2021 or 2022, but it’s created what I’ll call this summer, particularly, a love roller coaster,” observed Smoke during a panel on sales trends at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit on Thursday.

It all adds up to proof there’s still plenty of pent up demand for new vehicles, Smoke said.

That expected tariff-triggered price spike? It was more like a thumb tack.

Average new vehicle prices rose only about a hundred bucks between July and August from $49,400 to $49,500, according the Car Gurus August 2025 Intelligence Report released Thursday.

“Even with rising import costs and economic uncertainty, the market is showing surprising strength. Prices for both new and used vehicles held steady in August, while demand hit multi-year highs. For buyers, that means strong competition for value models—especially affordable EVs, which surged ahead of upcoming tax credit changes,” wrote report author Kevin Roberts, director of economic and market Intelligence at CarGurus.

There’s also the fear of missing out factor, even if not missing out on a new car or truck means missing out on the make or model first on a consumer’s list.

“There's still this disconnect, sort of between how consumers are feeling and what they're doing,” observed Ford Motor Company chief economist Emily Kolinski Morris during Thursday’s panel. “So they may be rushing out to get what they think are the last of the deals. They don't seem to be particularly happy about it.”

So who’s picking up the tab on the added tariff expense? It’s not that easy.

In keeping with Smoke’s “love roller coaster” there are ups and downs. Average list prices of new vehicles actually fell about $500 from $50,000 to $49,500 between April 2 and August 31, according to the CarGurus report.

While some automakers did lower their prices, some, including the Detroit Three companies, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Hyundai, Volvo and Jaguar Land Rover boosted theirs as 2026 models reach showrooms.

But don’t be fooled. That doesn’t mean the cost of other vehicle brands declined as automakers found ways to make up the difference, according to Jessica Caldwell, AVP insights, at auto research site Edmunds.com.

“We have seen is an increase in destination prices in 2025 model year, the average destination was over $1,500. That's another like way I think that you could see some cost increases, and then also changes in vehicle contenting and trim levels,” Caldwell said during the panel discussion.

Indeed, while the combination of pent up demand and ample inventories propped up sales over the summer, Smoke warns consumers are likely to soon see prices affected by tariffs as 2026 models arrive.

“About a quarter of what dealers have on their lots being model year ‘26 so we are seeing more of an acceleration in the increase in MSRP and invoice and average transaction price, but it's still well within what is normal for inflation,” Smoke said.

If the import tariffs are Thing One, the demise after September 30 of federal EV tax credits qualifies as Thing Two.

The rush to beat the deadline is continuing through September, with Smoke predicting record EV sales for the third quarter, boosted by both urgency from consumers and record incentives from some automakers.

But come October, the party is likely to be over.

“We’re going to hit a speed bump when those credits go away,” predicted Smoke. “No question we have seen clearly in the data that the first quarter almost always sucks for EV sales. So I would expect this to have a little bit of a hangover that's going to last us at least through the first quarter of next year.”

Given automakers already laid on generous incentives, Morris notes there’s not much more they can offer to mitigate loss of the tax credits. It will be interesting, however, to see how the various EV brands perform on a more level playing field when there’s no dividing line between those that qualified for tax credits and those that didn’t.

All three panelists agreed EV adoption is simply a slower process than the industry had hoped it would be, but that more consumers who desire some sort of electrified vehicle prefer hybrids.

“For a lot of people, a hybrid is fine, like, that's enough of a change,” said Caldwell. “Because I think for an EV, there is that fatigue of trying to learn something else, and especially like in the post-Covid world, where everyone is really stressed out, and we see this in customer surveys, is they don't necessarily want to buy an EV because they just don't want to. They don't want to deal with the hassle. They've got to figure out the charging situation and all of that, and you just don't want to deal with it.”

One thing is for sure, asserts Smoke, is that the number of internal combustion engine, or ICE, vehicles is beyond the point of growth, declaring that in terms of sales and those on the road, “we’re past peak ICE.”

Indeed, both consumers and the auto industry need to come to grips with a stark reality, said Smoke.

“It's going to be a multiple powertrain world, and we have to deal with the complexity of that.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68c3464eb536d7a8801a5870/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-11 19:02:02.543690

“It also puts new economic pressure on operating facilities that manufacture clean energy technology—tied to nearly $150 billion of investment—given greatly reduced domestic demand for these products,” it added.

These are “early indicators of federal policy attacks and fluctuating trade policy undermining American energy security and economic growth,” the association said.","The Trump Administration’s openly hostile policy toward wind, solar, and electric vehicles is setting the stage for much slower emissions reductions than previously anticipated, a new report says.

The U-turn in U.S. energy policies under President Donald Trump could more than halve the pace of America’s decarbonization, research provider Rhodium Group said in its annual Taking Stock 2025 analysis this week.

“Openly hostile to wind, solar, and electric vehicles”

Solar and wind installations and EV uptake could nosedive with the expiry of subsidies earlier than planned and plans to dismantle the so-called endangerment finding. This finding, from 2009, represents the U.S. federal government’s formal conclusion that greenhouse gases harm the public and cause climate change. This finding has acted as the legal foundation for many U.S. laws and regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions.

As part of the Trump Administration’s rollback of climate laws and provisions, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin has proposed to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding—a move welcomed by Energy Secretary Chris Wright as “a monumental step toward returning to commonsense policies that expand access to affordable, reliable, secure energy and improve quality of life for all Americans.”

For the Trump Administration, reliable and affordable energy means more fossil fuels and nuclear power generation, at the expense of unreliable, weather-dependent, and heavily-subsidized (until now) wind and solar energy and EVs.

“The first seven months of the second Trump administration and 119th Congress have seen the most abrupt shift in energy and climate policy in recent memory,” Rhodium Group said in its report.

“After the Biden administration adopted meaningful policies to drive decarbonization, Congress and the White House are now enacting a policy regime that is openly hostile to wind, solar, and electric vehicles and seeks to promote increased fossil fuel production and use.”

The Chilling Effect in Solar and Wind

Taking Stock, Rhodium Group’s annual outlook of future emissions under current policy, found the U.S. is on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26-41% in 2040 relative to 2005 levels. Emissions levels will decline by 26-35% in 2035, considerably lower than the estimate in the 2024 report, which showed a steeper drop of 38-56% by 2035 compared to 2005.

The high emissions scenario, the most pessimistic of the three scenarios examined in the 2025 report, suggests the pace of decarbonization in the U.S. would more than halve through 2040, with annual average emissions reductions of just 0.4% from 2025 through 2040 compared to 1.1% from 2005 through 2024. In the mid and low emissions scenarios, the pace of decarbonization accelerates instead, with annual average reductions of 1.4% and 1.9% through 2040, respectively, representing a 22% and 70% acceleration, compared with the pace of the last two decades.

“Despite the volume of policymaking from the executive branch, the single largest climate and energy policy action came in the federal legislative realm with passage of the fiscal year 2025 budget reconciliation bill, dubbed the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act,’” Rhodium Group said.

The OBBBA is expected to cut the build-out of new clean power-generating capacity by 53-59% over the next decade, according to the research provider.

Overall, the Act puts more than half a trillion dollars of clean energy and transportation investment at risk of cancellation, Rhodium Group has estimated.

“It also puts new economic pressure on operating facilities that manufacture clean energy technology—tied to nearly $150 billion of investment—given greatly reduced domestic demand for these products,” it added.

The total impact on America’s clean energy could be even bigger, depending on how executive actions shape the law’s implementation, Rhodium Group says.

For the solar industry, OBBBA will have a muted impact in the near term as developers rush to complete projects to qualify for tax incentives by 2027, Wood Mackenzie said earlier this month. However, the longer-term outlook has now worsened due to new barriers to permitting and penalties for reliance on China-based solar manufacturers.

The latest U.S. Solar Market Insight Q3 by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie warns that these policies put the United States at risk of losing 44 gigawatts (GW) of solar deployment by 2030, an 18% decline.

The report finds that 77% of all solar capacity installed this year has been built in states won by President Trump, including 8 of the top 10 states for new solar installations: Texas, Indiana, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky, and Arkansas.

“Instead of unleashing this American economic engine, the Trump administration is deliberately stifling investment, which is raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardizing the reliability of our electric grid,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA president and CEO.

According to Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie, “Further uncertainty from federal policy actions is making the business environment for the solar industry incredibly challenging.”

Wind energy faces significant hurdles, too.

While wind installations jumped in the first quarter of the year, total turbine orders for the first half of 2025 plunged by 50%, to the lowest level since 2020, the U.S. Wind Energy Monitor report by Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association (ACP) showed.

An ACP market report found that U.S. clean power development pipeline showed virtually no growth, as solar installations declined by 23% in the first half of 2025, and Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) plummeted. These are “early indicators of federal policy attacks and fluctuating trade policy undermining American energy security and economic growth,” the association said.

“The uncertainty created by new bureaucratic delays and unclear demands is having a chilling effect on the pipeline for future energy projects, stalling growth precisely when our nation needs more energy to power a growing economy,” ACP CEO Jason Grumet noted.

Saudi Arabia, for example, has announced plans to invest up to $10bn in green hydrogen producers.","While the technology underpinning the use of hydrogen as a fuel source dates back almost 200 years, green hydrogen — hydrogen produced using carbon neutral or renewable resources — is a relatively new concept.

Green hydrogen is produced from water through the use of electrolyzers, one of US energy company Plug Power’s [PLUG] main products. The scale of green energy infrastructure buildout can therefore be traced in the growth of global electrolyzer capacity.

In its Global Hydrogen Review 2024, the IEA forecast that electrolyzers with a combined capacity of 5.2GW would be installed by the end of the year, compared to 0.6GW in 2021, as shown in the graph below.

On a company scale, the growth is even more impressive. As CEO Andy Marsh explains, “about five years ago, the largest user of liquid hydrogen in the world was actually NASA. And Plug is bigger than NASA today … we’re the largest user in the world.”

This scale, in turn, translates directly into more clients running on Plug’s hydrogen. “Here in the States, which is just a portion of our business, about 30% of retail food actually moves through products that are produced by Plug Power.”

Building an Ecosystem

While headquartered in Slingerlands, New York, the company has facilities in Rochester and Spokane, Washington, as well as staff in Europe and India. The company operates a green hydrogen plant in Georgia and a plant in Tennessee, with daily production capacities of 15 tons and 10 tons, respectively. It is also developing a 120MW green hydrogen plant in Graham, Texas. In April 2025, Plug Power and Olin Corporation [OLN] opened a hydrogen liquefaction plant in Louisiana with a capacity of 15 tons per day.

These facilities are part of a network that helps power client operations, including for big names such as Amazon [AMZN], Walmart [WMT] and Home Depot [HD].

While Plug’s hydrogen network is already operational, one of the key markers of success is being carbon neutral from start to finish.

Indeed, the company has built the industry’s first vertically integrated green hydrogen ecosystem. From wind power in its Texas projects to switching charging stations off coal, “from an end-to-end point of view, it’ll be zero carbon emissions.”

While complete carbon neutrality has not yet been realized, the infrastructure is in place. As Marsh explains, “what’s really critical is that these devices are there as the grid becomes more renewable, as our hydrogen becomes, from end to end, completely green.”

Freeing up energy on the grid for other applications helps add to hydrogen’s value proposition. “We’ve taken the equivalent of 400 megawatts of electricity off the grid”, the equivalent of a medium-sized power plant. “We did that either through time shifting or, in many cases, by cleaning up dirty hydrogen sources.”

These kinds of efficiencies are essential, Marsh argues, especially in an era when companies are looking for reliable power for data centers, the backbone of the artificial intelligence boom. “By moving the fuel cells to hydrogen, more electricity is available for other usage.”

Hydrogen, thanks to the fact it can be stored, in turn makes other green energy sources more viable — and more reliable. “You can be running your grid through fuel cells and hydrogen, and that hydrogen was produced when there was way too much wind and way too much solar. So [hydrogen] really makes the possibility of a complete renewable network realizable.”

Making Hydrogen Competitive

However, like many carbon-neutral technologies, green hydrogen production is hindered by high costs and limited infrastructure. Natural gas — a cheaper but less sustainable fuel source than green hydrogen — offers a useful comparison. “There’s going to become a point, and it’s not too far out, where hydrogen is on par with natural gas from energy content … And when the cost of hydrogen is equal to the cost of natural gas, there’ll be no reason for people to buy natural gas turbines.”

Plug is building for this eventuality. “When that day comes, we’re ready,” Marsh explains. “We have the facilities in place, we have the people in place, we have the capabilities in place.”

International competition is fierce for hydrogen projects, with many countries setting ambitious hydrogen production targets. Saudi Arabia, for example, has announced plans to invest up to $10bn in green hydrogen producers. China, meanwhile, has set a target to produce 100,000–200,000 tons of green hydrogen by the end of the year, though it is on course to exceed that level. According to Marsh, however, the US remains the clear leader in the hydrogen race, thanks to its technological edge. “Just like in any competitive environment, we need to continue to innovate and keep on making sure our products are better.

“Don’t worry about the competition,” he says. “Worry about serving customers.”

In the end, the goal is simple, Marsh notes. “Nothing works unless hydrogen is competitive.”",https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/plug_1200px.jpg_medium.jpeg,N,,2025-09-11 20:02:06.824844

U.S. EV sales reach new records in August, with more growth expected

Tesla is losing ground in China and most countries in Europe, but the U.S. is by far the biggest market, and it is losing ground here, too.

In August, Tesla's market share in the U.S. shrank to 38%, down from 80% at its height.

While some of that degradation is tied to increased competition here in the States, the decline in more mature markets like Europe and China could be a serious problem for the automaker.

U.S. EV sales rose to 9.9% of all new car sales in August, a 10% jump from the 9.1% share held in July and the highest-ever record, according to Cox Automotive data.

Market share increased despite an uptick in prices, as the average transaction price (ATP) for an EV was $57,245 in August, a 3.1% increase. The ATP for a traditional new vehicle rose just 0.5% to $49,077.

So despite being more expensive and experiencing a larger price increase, total EV sales in the U.S. reached a record of 146,332 in August.

Tesla gears up to pivot away from EVs

Last month, Tesla and CEO Elon Musk released the Master Plan 4, the fourth (or third, depending on how you count) iteration of Musk's grand scheme for the company's future.

However, Master Plan 4 is different from its predecessors. It's much less about the green revolution or even electric vehicles and more about a future with Tesla-branded humanoid robots known as Optimus.

""What is the happiest future you can imagine?"" Musk asks at the end of the video, announcing his plans. ""Sustainable abundance for all.""

The text version of Master Plan Part 4 mentions sustainable abundance five times.

The goal: ""redefining the fundamental building blocks of labor, mobility, and energy at scale and for all.""

While that is a lofty aspiration for any company, especially one that is ostensibly still a car company, Musk believes he can achieve it, and his shareholders believe him.

Musk recently tweeted that he believes Optimus could eventually account for 80% of Tesla's valuation down the road, but in this current section of that road, Tesla is still an EV company.

Tesla derived 90% of its 2024 revenue and 94% of its gross margin from auto sales. But those auto sales have been falling and not growing for 18 months.

As the country pushes for greener power and energy independence, the agreement marks a major step toward making solar not just cleaner but truly local.

Starting in late 2026, Corning will supply solar wafers from its Michigan factory that T1 will use to make solar cells at a new facility in Austin, Texas. Those cells will then be assembled into panels at T1's existing Dallas-area plant.

T1 CEO Daniel Barcelo said in a statement, per Reuters: ""This is American companies building in America and protecting American energy security.""

The timing is key. With solar demand rising and new federal rules favoring American-made components, this deal reduces dependence on China, currently the world's leading wafer producer, and boosts both clean energy and U.S. manufacturing.

By making solar panels cheaper and more locally available, the deal could help lower energy costs for households while also cutting harmful carbon pollution by replacing fossil fuels with clean, homegrown power.

It also supports thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs, keeping the benefits of the clean energy transition rooted in local communities.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the guidance clarifies when “actual construction” begins under NSR, distinguishing emissions-unit work from broader site activities that do not affect air emissions.
However, that has caused some uncertainty over whether activities such as site grading, foundation pouring, and equipment staging require a permit.
The Code of Federal Regulations currently defines “begin actual construction” as the “initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature.
“For years, Clean Air Act permitting has been an obstacle to innovation and growth,” Zeldin said on Tuesday.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued new guidance under its New Source Review (NSR) preconstruction permitting program that could allow power plant developers to begin certain non-emissions‐related site work—such as installing concrete pads, grading, and utility trenching—before obtaining a Clean Air Act construction permit. The change, described in a sparse set of paragraphs published on the agency’s website on Sept. 10, is designed to shave months off project timelines for power generation, data centers, and reshored manufacturing facilities.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the guidance clarifies when “actual construction” begins under NSR, distinguishing emissions-unit work from broader site activities that do not affect air emissions. By defining which early-stage tasks fall outside the permitting trigger, the EPA seeks to reduce regulatory delays that have long hindered the build-out of essential infrastructure and to bolster U.S. competitiveness in artificial intelligence (AI), energy, and advanced manufacturing, he suggested.

The agency is expected to follow up with a formal rulemaking in early 2026 to revise the regulatory definition of “Begin Actual Construction” in 40 CFR § 52.21 and codify the distinction between emissions units and other parts of a facility.

The EPA says it will continue issuing case-by-case guidance in the interim.

A Few Words to Describe a Big Change

The Clean Air Act’s New Source Review program requires major stationary sources of air pollution, including power plants and industrial boilers, to obtain preconstruction permits before beginning emission-related construction or modifications. Historically, the review process has been considered “very complex,” a murky framework shaped by decades of lawsuits, political battles, and shifting regulatory interpretations—so much so that, as POWER noted in 2008, even standard operation and maintenance projects have sometimes been treated as potential NSR violations, leaving utilities wary that “a little paranoia about NSR might just be prudent.”

Typically, the EPA and delegated state agencies have interpreted “begin actual construction” to encompass nearly all on-site work of a permanent nature, even when unrelated to emissions units. However, that has caused some uncertainty over whether activities such as site grading, foundation pouring, and equipment staging require a permit.

The Code of Federal Regulations currently defines “begin actual construction” as the “initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature. Such activities include, but are not limited to, installation of building supports and foundations, laying underground pipework and construction of permanent storage structures” (40 CFR §52.21(b)(11)). As they apply to a change in the method of operations, the term covers “on-site activities other than preparatory activities which mark the initiation of the change.”

Under the new guidance, preparatory activities that do not involve the physical construction of an emissions unit—defined as any apparatus that emits or controls emissions—may proceed without an NSR permit, provided they pose no air-quality risk. Authorized tasks include soil stabilization, installation of access roads, laydown yards, precast foundation elements, and installation of non-emitting equipment such as concrete pads and underground piping.

According to the EPA, the clarification is part of Administrator Lee Zeldin’s Powering the Great American Comeback initiative launched in February and is intended to “expedite construction of essential power generation and industrial facilities.” The agency said its actions will help permitting authorities “properly distinguish between emissions units and other parts of a facility that are not an emissions unit or part of an emissions unit,” ensuring that developers understand which activities can advance without a permit and which must remain on hold until a permit is issued.

“For years, Clean Air Act permitting has been an obstacle to innovation and growth,” Zeldin said on Tuesday. “We are continuing to fix this broken system. Today’s guidance is another step to allow the build out of essential power generation, data centers, and manufacturing projects that will bring about America’s Golden Age.”

Aligned with the Trump administration’s policies, Zeldin has championed more than $90 billion in energy and industrial investments announced at the Pennsylvania Energy & Innovation Summit in July. In a Fox News op-ed following that event, Zeldin underscored the EPA’s commitment to “clear the regulatory path” for data centers and manufacturing facilities that support America’s AI leadership while maintaining environmental safeguards.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nre-epa.png,N,,2025-09-11 18:00:28.623120

With federal electric vehicle tax credits set to end on September 30, it could be your best, and perhaps last chance, to cash in on some serious savings. Tech Expert Jennifer Jolly joins our Laura Cavanaugh with what the changes mean and what you need to know before time runs out.

Electric vehicle tax credits are vanishing fast by the end of the month. The federal EV tax credit — up to $7,500 for new “clean vehicles” and $4,000 for used — is going away on September 30. The credits were meant to last until 2032, but are being pulled as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill. That means potential buyers could lose out on thousands of dollars in savings in just a few weeks. The tax credits are actually applied directly at the dealership, knocking thousands of dollars off the sticker price or it can also function as a built-in down payment.

In addition, automakers are stepping in to soften the blow with their own perks like the Ford Power Promise. If you buy or lease any Ford electric vehicle, Ford will include a top-tier complimentary home charger and standard installation. That program changes on September 30.

Ford provides 24/7 support and easy charging on the go with the Blue Oval Charge Network. And you can have confidence with Ford’s battery and drive systems, which are covered for 8 years or 100,000 miles.

In terms of on-the-road charging, Ford EVs have compatible functionality to charge virtually anywhere, including at Electrify America and Tesla Supercharger stations.

“Driving one of these means no more trips to the gas station. A full charge at home for me costs about $7,” said Jolly. “That alone saves me close to $2,000 a year in fuel. Maintenance costs drop too. No oil changes.”

For those interested in leasing, Jolly confirmed that incentives apply for the full lease term, not just until September 30.

Jolly says Ford has seen EV sales skyrocket in August, as buyers rush to beat the tax credit, rebate and incentive deadline. And September represents a last-chance window to save thousands on going electric.

Have the tax incentives for electric vehicles worked?
So we might want an ongoing incentive to push people into buying electric vehicles.
What happens now that the federal incentives are ending?
They have also eliminated penalties for failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, which require automakers to sell more fuel-efficient vehicles, including electric vehicles.","Electric vehicle sales in the United States are setting records. Over the past two months, consumers across the country have been rushing to car dealerships to buy EVs before a federal incentive providing up to $7,500 in tax credits ends Sept. 30.

In July, automakers sold more than 130,000 EVs, about 25% more than the month before. That number reached an all-time high in August, with about 12% of all new cars sold being electric.

The federal government rolled out current EV tax incentives in 2008, aiming to bridge the price difference between gasoline and electric cars. In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act modified the policy by adding income caps for those eligible to receive the tax break and limiting the credit to EVs under a certain price. To qualify, vehicles also must be built in the United States using domestically sourced materials. This policy was set to run through 2032.

But in July, Congress approved the tax and spending legislation colloquially known as the Big Beautiful Bill, scrapping the discount seven years before its original expiration date.

“The move is broadly reflective of the government not wanting to promote electric vehicle adoption or environmental policy more generally,” said Stephanie Weber, assistant professor in the Department of Economics, noting that several other pro-EV policies have already been eliminated.

As the program comes to an end, CU Boulder Today sat down with Weber, who is also a fellow at the Renewable and Sustainable Energy Institute, to discuss the impact federal incentives had and the outlook for electric cars.

Have the tax incentives for electric vehicles worked?

There’s evidence that a meaningful share, from 10% to 30%, of the EVs that were being sold were purchased because of the incentives.

Over the past 15 years, the types of products automakers offer in the United States have also improved. For example, we now have EVs with larger batteries that have more range before they need to be charged. We can attribute some of those improvements to the incentives. They motivate automakers to develop new products, knowing there’s this enhanced demand for EVs.

The current tax credit policy for EVs was set to expire in 2032. Doesn't that mean the government was going to phase out the incentives anyway?

The subsidies were always intended to be phased out. But from an economic perspective, some should maybe persist.

Economically, we want to use these incentives to solve what are called market failures—basically anything that causes us to deviate from efficient outcomes under a free market. In the case of vehicles, the major market failures are environmental impacts from gasoline vehicles, from local air pollution to greenhouse gas emissions.

Consumers, when they buy a car, don't necessarily have an incentive to consider the pollution impacts on other people. So we might want an ongoing incentive to push people into buying electric vehicles.

What happens now that the federal incentives are ending?

In the immediate term, we're seeing really big increases in electric vehicle adoption, because people want to make the purchase before the tax credit expires.

Over time, we will see a reduction in sales relative to what we’d see under the policy. It may not be an absolute decline in sales, although that's also possible, but it might be a flattening out in growth. Some estimates suggest that between 2026 and 2028, about 4% of new vehicles sold will be EVs, about half the current share, due to these policy changes.

How is this policy change affecting automakers?

We are going to see fewer new products than we might have otherwise. Some automakers have actually canceled EV models that they had previously announced. For example, Honda canceled plans for a large electric SUV in July, anticipating a decrease in U.S. demand. General Motors and Volkswagen have announced that they’re scaling back EV production. They are also going to spend less money trying to develop new electric vehicles and trying to improve the technology in the United States.

And it’s not just the tax credits that are getting taken away. There are other incentives on the automaker side for promoting EVs and fuel-efficient vehicles. Many of those have also been eliminated in the last year.

One was a waiver that allowed California to set its own vehicle emission rules, which were stricter than federal standards. The state mandated that a certain percent of new cars sold in California be zero-emission, ramping up to all new cars by 2035, and 11 other states, including Colorado, adopted California’s standards. They have also eliminated penalties for failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, which require automakers to sell more fuel-efficient vehicles, including electric vehicles.

What would be a better long-term policy than EV subsidies?

EV subsidies, as we've been doing them, are not the optimal policy, partly because these subsidies tend to disproportionately benefit wealthier people who can afford new vehicles.

From an economic standpoint, an effective environmental policy should align people's private incentives with societal incentives. So in this case, we would want to directly make it more expensive to generate pollution, through ways like putting a surcharge on gasoline.

Such a policy can have impacts beyond car-buying behaviors too. It would also make people consider things like, “Should I drive to the grocery store, or is this actually a small trip that I can make via the bus or bike?” and reduce their emissions that way. An EV subsidy isn't going to do that.",https://www.colorado.edu/today/sites/default/files/2025-09/andrew-roberts-2JvEjF0tf50-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 17:02:07.386128

The most significant change is the elimination of the Five Percent Safe Harbor for all wind and solar projects more than 1.5 megawatts.
This requirement for the ""performance"" of physical work is a departure from the prior guidance, where physical work only needed to have ""begun.""
We expect compliance with the Physical Work Test to be the subject of increased diligence by tax equity investors and lenders, as well as the subject of IRS audits.","In a decision that could make it challenging for wind and solar projects to qualify for the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released Notice 2025-42 on August 15, 2025, which eliminates the ""Five Percent Safe Harbor"" option to establish ""beginning of construction"" for certain renewable energy projects.

Under the updated guidance, these projects can only use the Physical Work Test to establish a ""beginning construction"" date under Sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Additionally, taxpayers who wish to claim a wind or solar ITC or PTC that avoids the new December 31, 2027, placed-in-service date requirement must begin construction by performing on-site or off-site physical work before July 4, 2026.

The New Rules

Notice 2025-42 is effective for wind and solar projects that begin construction after September 2, 2025, and before July 4, 2026. Developers will have four calendar years to place the facility into service after construction officially commences. Any developers needing an extension for construction lasting beyond four years will have to demonstrate ""continuous construction"" as opposed to merely demonstrating continuous efforts. Projects that start after July 4, 2026, must be completed by the end of 2027.

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, tax credits for wind and solar projects are subject to earlier phaseouts compared to other renewable energy technologies. For those wind and solar projects seeking to qualify for the ""technology-neutral credits"" under Code Sections 45Y and 48E (i.e., projects with a begin of construction date after December 31, 2024, but before July 4, 2026), the new guidance under Notice 2025-42 now controls the requirements for what constitutes a project's beginning of construction. However, projects that have begun construction by September 2, 2025, may still rely on guidance contained in numerous notices previously issued by the Department of the Treasury.

The most significant change is the elimination of the Five Percent Safe Harbor for all wind and solar projects more than 1.5 megawatts. Previously, developers were permitted to expend five percent or more of a project's total cost to establish that construction had begun on a facility. Under the new guidance, there must be specifically documented on-site or off-site physical work being conducted to establish the beginning of construction, rather than mere economic investment. This requirement for the ""performance"" of physical work is a departure from the prior guidance, where physical work only needed to have ""begun."" Distributed solar developers, with projects whose nameplate capacities do not exceed 1.5 megawatts, will still be permitted to rely on the Five Percent Test.

Meeting New Regulations

Unless subject to the Five Percent Test, it is critical that wind and solar project developers demonstrate compliance with the Physical Work Test by documenting progress through pictures, emails, invoices, government permits, and similar records. We expect compliance with the Physical Work Test to be the subject of increased diligence by tax equity investors and lenders, as well as the subject of IRS audits.",https://www.bakerdonelson.com/images/_wbmanaged/screenshot2025-09-09155310_wbc_socialimage_163227.png,N,,2025-09-12 04:58:17.685157

In a typical solar grazing arrangement, sheep farmers (called grazers) are paid by solar developers to bring the animals to sites hosting large arrays — often farms — where they munch away on the vegetation.
It can do damage to the panels.” Solar grazing goats, meanwhile, has been ​“a disaster,” Anderson said, because they chew wires and other parts of solar arrays.
In climates like Illinois’, sheep must be housed and fed inside during winter — a considerable expense.
​“There may be a real advantage in having the Illinois Solar Lamb label.”","To all the challenges the solar industry is facing today, add one more: cultivating a domestic market for lamb meat. It may seem an unlikely mission for clean-energy developers, but in many states, including Illinois, grazing sheep between rows of photovoltaic panels is considered the most efficient form of agrivoltaics — the combination of solar and farming on the same land.

Solar advocates, researchers, and developers have given much attention to agrivoltaics. The practice includes growing crops like blueberries, tomatoes, or peppers in the shade of solar panels and letting cows or sheep graze around the arrays.

Perhaps the biggest benefit of agrivoltaics is that land is not being taken out of agricultural production in favor of clean energy, a concern that has stoked intense opposition to solar. The Trump administration codified this sentiment when the head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced on Aug. 19 that the agency ​“will no longer fund taxpayer dollars for solar panels on productive farmland.”

Illinois’ sprawling fields of corn and soybeans don’t coexist well with solar panels, but sheep do, making grazing a promising type of agrivoltaics for the state, proponents say.

In a typical solar grazing arrangement, sheep farmers (called grazers) are paid by solar developers to bring the animals to sites hosting large arrays — often farms — where they munch away on the vegetation. Meanwhile, the landowner benefits from lease payments. Grazing is a lower-emissions alternative to mechanical mowing, and sheep can reach corners that mowers can’t.

But to make a living herding sheep, the grazers need to be able to sell the lambs they raise as meat. In the U.S., lamb is sold primarily in halal markets and appears on menus only during Easter holidays. Three-quarters of that meat is imported from Australia and New Zealand.

“What there needs to be, honestly, is more demand for lamb in the country,” said Stacie Peterson, executive director of the American Solar Grazing Association, which offers solar grazing certifications and contract templates. ​“We’re hoping to help develop more breeding stock, more farmers, more grazers doing this.”

A taste for lamb

Brooke Watson would like to see demand for lamb soar in the Midwest, in tandem with demand for solar grazing. Brooke’s husband, Chauncey Watson IV, has been raising sheep since he was in 4-H, a program that teaches kids about agriculture. Chauncey’s family has farmed in Illinois since 1856. The couple has raised lambs and sheep for wool, but in 2023 they bought a new flock of ​“hair sheep,” which don’t need shearing, to give solar grazing a try. ​“Hooves on the ground” happened last summer, Brooke said. Now they have 500 ewes grazing on over 320 acres at nine community solar sites in six Illinois counties.

Brooke laments that Americans ​“lost their taste for lamb” after World War II — because veterans had grown tired of wartime canned lamb rations, according to some accounts. (Other historical factors also likely influenced the decline in mutton’s popularity.)

“It has picked up in the last few decades, but more so with immigrant communities, where lamb is that really valuable cultural and religious product,” she said, adding that ​“traditional beef and chicken consumers” should give lamb a chance. ​“There’s really a huge, huge potential for both of these industries to grow and evolve together side by side.”

Brooke said solar grazing can also provide a way for younger farmers to stay in the business.

“The landowner most typically is hitting retirement age, and they don’t want to work the land anymore. So solar is a way for them to still maintain ownership of that parcel, and they’re compensated to host the solar on the site” while collaborating with farmers like her and her husband, who are typically ​“younger, maybe first generation or newer farmers, and they’re excited about the sheep grazing.”

A novelty in Illinois

According to a census by the American Solar Grazing Association and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, sheep solar grazing is concentrated in the West and the South. In 2024, almost 62,000 sheep were grazing over 87,000 acres at 109 solar sites in the South, with more than half of the animals in Texas. In the Midwest, including Illinois, just over 13,000 sheep grazed almost 7,000 acres of solar at 148 sites.

Texas and California have long histories of shepherding, and in many areas sheep are central to the ranching culture. That means grazing sheep under solar panels is continuing these areas’ traditional agriculture.

But in Illinois, there is little history of raising sheep. So converting acres of the state’s primary corn and soybean fields may still raise eyebrows.

“In Europe, solar grazing has taken off, but they are much more into sheep,” said Ken Anderson, director of the Advanced Energy Institute at Southern Illinois University. ​“When you see sheep move into Illinois, it’s unfamiliar to people; they’re not used to seeing sheep. It’s better with cattle, but cattle are harder — they like to scratch. It can do damage to the panels.”

Solar grazing goats, meanwhile, has been ​“a disaster,” Anderson said, because they chew wires and other parts of solar arrays. He is working on a proposed agrivoltaics research site that would grow peaches, apples, and other specialty crops amid solar panels on a former military munitions site in Illinois. Anderson prefers growing crops under panels to grazing, but crops need more specialized solar configurations.

Solar panels suited for sheep are ​“strictly industrial arrays,” he said. ​“All you’re going to be able to do is graze sheep there in the future, so you need to think about the long haul.”

Sheep may be the state’s best option for large arrays because, Anderson thinks, there’s limited potential for solar panels to occupy the same land as the state’s traditional sprawling corn and soybean fields.

“In my opinion, the economics will never work,” for pairing corn and soy with solar, Anderson said. ​“When you grow broad-acreage crops like corn and soy, you use very large equipment, so you have to put the panels far apart,” resulting in less energy output.

While solar grazing in Illinois might often replace corn or soybean production, Watson sees it as a positive trade-off.

“So much of that corn is used for ethanol production, and so much of that soy is, quite frankly, exported to other countries,” she said. ​“So we really look at solar grazing as an opportunity to have more U.S.-sourced energy production and food production as well.”

The Watsons work with a solar developer called Pivot Energy. Since 2021, agrivoltaics has been the company’s main focus, according to director of operations and maintenance Angie Burke. In Illinois, Pivot Energy has 365 sheep grazing at 11 sites, and those numbers are projected to more than double by next year.

“Agrivoltaics is this great way to support those family farmers locally and provide that cost-competitive, locally sourced, and high-protein-value food for those communities that are excited to eat more lamb,” Burke said.

Improving the land

While solar grazing may not be more profitable than mechanical mowing for landowners, it leaves the soil in better condition than if it were left idle under the panels.

“Let’s be delicate — [the sheep] are contributing to the soil” with their excrement, said Anderson.

In climates like Illinois’, sheep must be housed and fed inside during winter — a considerable expense. But Brooke Watson noted that, unlike solar grazers in Western states, she and her husband don’t need to provide much water for sheep in summer, as the lush vegetation and frequent rain suffice. In any state, solar grazing means ensuring that there are safe fences or wires around sites and that predators are kept out.

“In the early days, there were some horror stories where people dropped sheep off and came back at the end of the summer and there weren’t any sheep anymore,” said Ethan Winter, national smart solar director of American Farmland Trust, an organization committed to farmland preservation and sustainable farming practices. ​“You’re starting to see more professionalization, more formalized best practices for grazers.”

American Farmland Trust’s Midwest solar specialist Alan Bailey noted that existing crop residue or debris must be cleared and specific cover crops planted to prepare for solar grazing, but this can happen while an array is being built. ​“One of our principles is having some sort of living cover on those sites throughout the entire construction process,” he said.

“There’s both the need and opportunity to think about markets for the lamb,” Winter said, noting that the animals could be sold to wholesale processors or marketed locally. ​“There may be a real advantage in having the Illinois Solar Lamb label.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/250610_NATHAN-HELEINE_PIVOT-SOLAR-187-Final.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=7b6bbc80d6790336a7978ed42aac7c35,N,,2025-09-11 17:02:21.793493

Iowa utilities still have a “long way to go” to meet a 2035 net zero emissions goal, especially as changes at the federal level have accelerated the timelines for key wind and solar tax credits, according to the 2025 Iowa Electric Generation Condition of the State report.

The annual report from Iowa Environmental Council said in order to meet this net zero goal, utilities not only have to transition away from coal but also continue to meet demand, which is projected to increase by 30%-60% over the next 20 years.

The net zero goal is consistent with federal goals from 2021 that directed the energy sector to achieve net zero emissions, or emissions that are equal to the amount of greenhouse gases that are removed from the atmosphere, by 2035.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change similarly found in 2022 that global greenhouse gas emissions must reach net zero by 2050 in order to avoid the greatest impacts of climate change, including limiting global temperature increases.

Steve Guyer, IEC’s energy policy counsel, said in a webinar Wednesday about the report that climate change costs Iowa businesses, families, governments and taxpayers billions of dollars each year.

“I want us to keep in mind that energy, the environment and the economy are actually inextricably linked,” Guyer said.

Guyer, and the report, said coal generation which has the greatest greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector, not only “drives climate change” but also has negative effects on public health, creates air pollution, can cause premature death and can even impact corn yields.

“Air pollution does not discriminate,” Guyer said. “Everybody has to suffer, and is burdened by, basically, this impact – not only financially, but otherwise.”

Coal down, wind and solar up

In Iowa, the share of coal-based electric generation has declined consistently since 2010, according to the report. From 2021 to 2024, fossil fuel generation decreased by 9% in the state.

The share of wind generation has steadily increased in Iowa since the early 2000s and has trumped coal generation in the state since 2019. In 2024, wind energy accounted for 66% of the state’s total electricity generation.

Solar increased in 2024 to represent 1% of the share of electricity generation. According to the report, in 2024 Iowa had the largest share of generation from renewable sources of any state.

“So wind and solar in 2024 actually represented 67% of our generation,” Guyer said. “That places us certainly ahead of any other state as far as the percent of generation from renewables. It also means that we are uniquely positioned to actually achieve 100% carbon free by 2035.”

Geoff Greenwood, the media relations manager for one of Iowa’s main utilities, MidAmerican Energy, said Iowa’s status as a leader in clean energy is “in large part because of MidAmerican Energy’s clean energy leadership.”

Wind makes up the majority, or 64%, of MidAmerica’s energy mix. Greenwood said in an email that since 2004, the company has invested in more than 7,600 megawatts of wind and 141 MW of solar, and has plans to invest in hundreds more by 2028. According to the company’s website, it delivered “the equivalent of 100% carbon-free energy” to Iowa customers in 2024.

“The environmental benefits of renewable generation are not diminished by the timing of its production—each and every megawatt of clean energy MidAmerican generates contributes to overall emissions reductions and supports our customers’ sustainability goals and Iowa’s leadership in clean energy,” Greenwood said. “MidAmerican has made, and continues to make, significant, measurable progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and leading Iowa’s electric sector in decarbonization efforts.”

The report points out that despite the significant share of wind and solar generation in the state and commitments from MidAmerican and Alliant Energy, to achieve net zero emissions, Iowa has six operational fossil-fuel power plants.

According to the report these plants emitted more than 14 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2024, along with several thousand tons of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.

Power plants represent about 16% of Iowa’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to the most recent greenhouse gas inventory report from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. The report shows that agriculture at 29% accounts for the largest share of emissions in the state, closely followed by residential, commercial and industrial fossil fuel use.

Greenwood said MidAmerican has already retired “several coal units” and “will continue to retire the remaining coal units by 2049.” He noted the existing plants are in compliance with federal and state regulations.

Coal generation in Iowa is nearly 52% lower in 2024 than it was in 2005, and carbon emissions have decreased by 47% in the same time, according to Greenwood.

“The Council’s report itself acknowledges that the electric sector is the only sector in Iowa that has made meaningful progress in reducing GHG emissions,” Greenwood said. “MidAmerican is proud to be a key contributor to that progress.”

A spokesperson for Alliant Energy said in an email the company is implementing a strategic plan to “create a more sustainable future for our customers and communities.”

Alliant plans to, by 2030, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from utility operations to 50% of 2005 levels, and to eliminate all coal from generation by 2040.

According to the spokesperson, the company reduced its 2005 emission levels by 39% in 2024.

“We will continue to review and update our Energy Vision, based on future economic developments, evolving energy technologies and emerging trends in the communities we serve,” the spokesperson said in an email. “Our goals remain the same, however, increasing customer energy needs, reliability and resource adequacy requirements and tax policy changes may result in delays in achieving, or revisions to, our goals.”

‘Staggering’ increases in energy needs projected

Guyer said energy demand is increasing rapidly, in part due to the implementation of data centers.

According to the report, which analyzed modeling projections from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO power pool, Iowa has a projected load growth of between 30% and 60% over the next 20 years.

Guyer said that projected load, plus a change in MISO’s rules as to what can count towards a utility’s accredited capacity, means there is a “staggering” amount of energy that will be required in the next 20 years.

“We have a, I’ll just say, a staggering mission ahead of us,” Guyer said. “Not only do we have to try and achieve the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, but we have to try and do that while we’re also trying to meet this increase in demand.”

Greenwood said the “exponentially” growing demand for energy noted in the report, means that “a dependable supply during this growth is critical.”

“Our long-term vision remains clear: we are striving to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining the reliability our customers expect,” Greenwood said. “It’s crucial that our energy transition balances reliability and affordability with environmental responsibility. Reliable electricity is not a luxury, it’s a necessity.”

‘Big beautiful’ law changes timeline for tax credits

Guyer said utilities need to “aggressively move” to make use of the wind and solar credits made available under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.

This massive spending bill created tax credits to incentivize many types of renewable energy investments, including solar and wind energy projects, through 2032.

The massive, Republican-led tax incentive and spending bill known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” which was signed into law in July, shrinks the timeline for these credits.

Now, to be eligible for the credits, projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026, and be placed in service before 2028, according to the report.

“Even though there was an urgency back with the IRA, that has been exponentially increased now due to the big, beautiful bill,” Guyer said.

But, Guyer said, whether a company can make use of IRA credits or not, renewable energy projects are still the cheapest forms of electric generation in Iowa.

“Even without the credit, the renewable generation will still be lower cost, but the credit certainly will have an impact and help customers overall,” Guyer said.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/turbinesatsunset-2048x1274-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 16:01:08.667693

Six months later, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a recommendation to rescind the “endangerment finding”—a result of a 2007 Supreme Court case—which argued that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and welfare in the United States and therefore are subject to direct regulation by EPA under the Clean Air Act.

These two actions, though playing out on different political stages, are connected in more ways than meet the eye.

For international climate policy—where the Paris Agreement remains the primary framework to structure international cooperation—actions taken in one country can send a signal to other countries and thereby affect global climate policy momentum. This is the underlying logic of the process in which all parties to the Paris Agreement submit pledges, called nationally determined contributions, or NDCs, to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) every five years. The pledges are then collectively assessed by all parties to the Paris Agreement and updated every five years.

The immediate magnitude of the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement (which formally takes effect in January 2026) can be measured by the country’s substantial share of global emissions. But even US domestic policy is more influential globally than its proportional contributions to emissions. The endangerment finding underpins several US federal regulations targeting greenhouse gas emissions; for example, EPA standards regulating power plant carbon pollution and the fuel economy of passenger cars. Without the endangerment finding, the legal basis for these climate policies disappears.

By eliminating a legal foundation for US domestic policy, the United States is inviting other nations to revisit their own internal policies. Indeed, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, in an editorial for the Economist, referred to the previous administration’s climate policies as “a regulatory assault aimed at eliminating hydrocarbons” while inviting other countries to mirror the United States and prioritize “energy addition, not subtraction.”

The United States is therefore no longer just critical of international climate policy agreements, but also increasingly of climate action more broadly. These changing attitudes may be influencing other countries to reconsider their Paris commitments, too.

All greenhouse gas emissions matter, but large countries’ emissions matter most.

The potential impact on global climate policy momentum leads to questions about the federal government’s assertion that US greenhouse gas emissions have limited influence on the global climate.

In the documentation supporting the endangerment finding rescission, EPA states that “reducing greenhouse gas emissions from all vehicles and engines in the United States to zero would not have a scientifically measurable impact on greenhouse gas emission concentrations or global warming potential.” This statement is dubious on its face: according to EPA, 29 percent of total US greenhouse gas emissions are from transportation, of which more than three quarters are from road vehicles. These road vehicles alone emit over a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, exceeding the total annual greenhouse gases of all but a handful of countries, each with their own obligations under the Paris Agreement.

EPA’s statement ignores the political dynamics inherent to global climate policy, which requires all emitters to cooperate for the greater good. Individual countries can contribute only a minor share toward the stabilization of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The United States emits 11 percent of greenhouse gases today, second only to China with 30 percent of global emissions, and followed by India and the European Union with 8 percent and 6 percent of global emissions each. The other 45 percent of global emissions are shared among the more than 160 other countries of the world.

Thus, a free-rider issue extends through global climate policy. Countries bear high costs to decarbonize, but the benefits are shared by all countries. At the same time, individual climate action without buy-in from the rest of the world not only limits benefits to the mitigating country, but potentially puts the proactive country at a competitive disadvantage if the costs of mitigation increase the prices of export goods.

Breaking the free-rider problem has driven decades of multilateral climate policy cooperation—culminating in the Paris Agreement.

The United States influences climate policy momentum.

While the United States leaving the Paris Agreement once more is a blow for global climate policy, the “Paris structure” can in principle withstand countries abandoning or downscaling their climate policy pledges; it was never likely that 200 countries would always be on the same page. But in the pledge-and-review process of the Paris Agreement, the NDCs of large economies are particularly important: an NDC perceived as ambitious might spur other countries to strengthen their own pledges, while pledges perceived as being comparatively modest would see such peer pressure diminished. On top of that, the actual commitments of NDCs, and especially their implementation, could support climate action abroad in terms of financing, clean technology costs, and other spillovers.

Even though the rest of the world continued to implement climate policy after the first US withdrawal under the first Trump administration, more severe spillovers may ensue this time. The United States elected President Donald J. Trump again, when his stance toward climate change was more well known and strident. This repeated US reticence on climate policy leads to a persistent credible commitment problem.

Other countries will be asking if the regulatory repeals can withstand court challenges and how easily a more pro-climate administration could reinstate both the endangerment finding and related regulations. Such uncertainty could affect the ambition of other governments.

In the past, US actions could be interpreted as disagreement with the legal form of an international agreement (concerns sometimes shared by other countries). But now, the United States appears to have shifted toward hostility, exacerbating the free-rider problem inherent to climate policy. The United States’ actions could move countries to believe that their domestic actions are in vain if the rest of the world does not follow. A self-fulfilling prophecy might ensue.

It is against this background that the repeal of the endangerment finding, and especially the repeal of associated federal climate policy regulations, could reverberate through the international community. The Paris architecture can deal with any country—even the world’s largest historical emitter—stepping in and out of the agreement. But actions that make it harder for future US governments to enact climate policies would not go unnoticed and may over time lead to a negative multiplier effect.

Some anecdotal signs already indicate that other countries are reacting to the United States’ climate negativity with negativity of their own. Indonesia’s special envoy for climate stated in January that his own country might consider leaving the Paris Agreement, saying that it is unfair for Indonesia to commit to climate action if a large country like the United States abandons the agreement. Argentinian president Javier Milei likewise expressed his desire for Argentina to leave the Paris Agreement. In New Zealand, one of the government coalition partners raised the possibility of leaving the Paris Agreement after the next national election in 2026. In the European Union, a former climate commissioner warns against “green backsliding.”

Another impact of the US withdrawal from the international climate stage is felt in its foreign assistance. South Africa was counting on financial support from the United States to gradually decommission coal-fired power plants, which will no longer happen due to the United States also withdrawing from the Just Energy Transition Partnership that supports the energy transition in emerging economies. Stakeholders in India expressed concerns about ripple effects for green hydrogen development and capital to finance clean technology investments.

But evidence for any multiplier effect, positive and negative, will be found in future NDCs. As it happens, the 2025 COP30, hosted by Brazil, will be the first annual climate conference after the new round of NDC submissions are due. The deadline to submit the new NDCs was initially set for February 2025 but later extended to September 2025. So far, only about 20 parties have submitted NDCs. Missed deadlines in multilateral forums are not necessarily unusual, given that each party will be constrained by its own domestic political circumstances. But it remains to be seen how many NDCs will be submitted and how ambitious the pledges contained therein will be.

In contrast, for the COP26 in Glasgow, which took stock of the first set of NDCs, well over 100 parties submitted NDCs, with most having done so well in advance of the conference. This included the United States, as President Joe Biden reversed the decision to leave the Paris Agreement only a few months after the US withdrawal had taken effect but before COP26, which was delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Even after the 2024 US election, the Biden administration still submitted a revised NDC for 2035, committing to 61–66 percent emissions reductions by 2035, compared to 2005. This revised NDC could be seen as a signal of what a future administration committed to climate policy might want to achieve.

But if actions are now undertaken to constrain the future regulatory capabilities of the federal government, other countries might adjust their expectations of what the United States can achieve over the next decade. Expectations about the relative supply and costs of fossil fuels versus clean technologies could lead to other countries moderating their NDCs. For poorer economies, expectations of reduced international climate finance could reduce the willingness to adopt more ambitious pledges.

In the European Union, lack of momentum is also visible. The world’s second-largest economy traditionally sees itself as a frontrunner in climate action and has indeed legislated extensively to achieve its 2030 climate target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55 percent compared to 1990. For 2040, its proposed target is a 90 percent emissions reduction compared to 1990. The European Council—the body representing the EU countries’ heads of government—so far has not formally agreed to this target, which means the European Union has delayed its NDC for 2035, which depends on its 2040 target. EU decisionmakers cite ongoing challenges to industrial competitiveness and high energy prices. But the knowledge that the world’s largest economy is unwilling to commit to further climate action does not help the case of those promoting climate action in Europe.

Perhaps the most critical NDC will be the one that the world’s largest emitter, China, submits. In its current NDC, its main target is to ensure that its greenhouse gas emissions peak before 2030. China moving toward an absolute emissions reduction target would send a signal to other emerging economies to consider similar carbon constraints. The absence of a new US NDC, however, will remove any peer pressure from its greatest geopolitical and economic rival to enhance its current ambition.

Speakers at the RE+ trade show have pointed to the immense load growth from data centres as an opportunity for energy storage development.

At the moment, given the budget reconciliation bill’s negative targeting of wind and solar energy, BESS is available for rapid deployment to, in theory, meet that load growth.

Hithium emphasised that in the AI era, data centres will need to balance energy transition while maintaining efficient operations.

However, intermittency and millisecond-level load fluctuations have presented a challenge for data centres, creating a need for long-duration energy storage (LDES).

Hithium noted that combining Li-ion and Na-ion enables “data centre operators to meet both base load and peak demands efficiently, without sacrificing reliability.” Meanwhile, “the dedicated lifetime assessment model for AIDC ESS further ensures precise degradation insights, longer and more reliable project lifespan guaranteed under highly dynamic workloads.”

The company also claimed that the AIDC ESS solution can reduce the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE), improving the efficiency of AI power supply.

Hithium’s Na-Ion cell, N162 Ah, has a low levelised cost of storage (LCOS), with a wide temperature range and high thermal stability, with no fire or explosion during nail penetration and crush tests.

Recently, Hithium opened a 10GWh, 484,441-square-foot battery module and system factory in Mesquite, Texas. The company said the investment figure for the factory was close to US$200 million.

Storion secures first vanadium electrolyte customer

Vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) joint venture from Stryten and Largo Clean Energy, Storion Energy, has secured its first customer for vanadium electrolyte from its continuous production line.

Storion established the production line with support from the US Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Manufacture of Advanced Key Energy Infrastructure Technologies (MAKE IT) prize, of US$5 million, which the company received in 2024.

The company says the MAKE IT funds have been critical to enabling Storion’s growth since its launch this February.

Largo Physical Vanadium, which owns the vanadium, will deliver 50MWh of electrolyte to TerraFlow Energy for a 9.6MW/48MWh VRFB installation in Bellville, Texas.

In July, TerraFlow signed a strategic supply agreement with Storion. Under the agreement, Storion will provide its vanadium electrolyte production and manufacturing abilities to scale TerraFlow’s skid-based architecture.

Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are likely to help fill the gap as battery EV sales slow.
Still Goldman Sachs Research expects the medium-term boost to operating margins will be greater than any short-term impairment costs.
While hybrids are getting a boost in the US market, China sales are driving the higher plug-in hybrid sales forecasts.","The pace of adoption for electric vehicles (EVs) is expected to slow as regulations shift, and hybrid vehicles stand to benefit, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Traditional automakers are set up for a significant boost in profits as a result.

“Global battery-electric vehicle penetration rates are likely to enter a period of decline outside certain regions, such as China,” Goldman Sachs Research analyst Kota Yuzawa writes in a report. “We think the shift in the direction of US environmental regulations will have a major positive earnings impact on traditional automakers.”

What is the forecast for EV market share?

Goldman Sachs Research now expects EVs to be 25% of global sales in 2030, down from a previous forecast of 28%. That leaves their 2030 forecast 7 percentage points below the current market consensus for global EV market penetration, as tracked by IHS Global Insight. The team also cut their projection for 2040 EV sales share to 52% from a previous forecast of 59%.

Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are likely to help fill the gap as battery EV sales slow. The researchers see a structural shift in the US market toward hybrids and cite updated strategies from manufacturers. Japanese and Korean makers, in particular, have announced plans to shift a significant part of their product lineup from internal combustion engines to hybrid drivetrains.

Profit margins for car makers to rise as hybrid sales increase

Margins in North America for major US and Asian automakers may increase by 2 to 3 percentage points, adding between $15 billion and $22 billion to earnings before taxes for a group of companies that had combined operating profits of about $52 billion in 2024, Yuzawa writes.

As mandates to sell low-margin EVs ease, traditional automakers can maximize profits by selling a mix of gasoline-powered vehicles and hybrids. Recent comments from several traditional automakers support this view.

“The strength of HEV sales even amid low gasoline prices testifies to the fact that consumers value not only fuel efficiency but also power performance,” Yuzawa writes. “We believe that the simultaneous downsizing of gasoline engines and increase in vehicle size in the US market has led to demand for HEVs with better acceleration.”

The research team raised its forecasts for HEV sales weightings to 12% of the global market in 2030 (up from 10% previously) and 9% in 2040 (from 5%). In addition, they see plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) getting 14% of the market in 2030 and 17% in 2040 (up from a previous forecast of 9% in 2040).

How have regulatory changes impacted the EV industry?

US lawmakers recently eliminated civil penalties for non-compliance with federal fuel economy rules. Automakers that failed to meet existing corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards from the 2022 model year onward are no longer expected to face fines.

Among other things, the legislation also set a September 30, 2025, expiration date for tax credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of a new EV and $4,000 for a used EV. This credit was previously set to run through 2032.

US rule changes may result in impairment charges for some automakers as the credits they purchased for emissions compliance decline in value. The value of credits is set in negotiated transactions and is difficult to quantify based on publicly available information. Still Goldman Sachs Research expects the medium-term boost to operating margins will be greater than any short-term impairment costs.

In Europe, environmental regulations that affect EV sales are also being eased, though not to the same extent. The European Commission in March softened its stance on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions targets for 2025, giving automakers a three-year grace period that runs through 2027. The change is anticipated to help manufacturers to meet targets and avoid fines.

What is the EV market forecast for China?

Goldman Sachs Research’s revised global EV market penetration forecasts reflect reduced expectations for sales in the US, Europe, and Japan, but their forecasts for China and India are unchanged. Indeed, Global EV sales rose 21% to 1.16 million vehicles in June of this year. Sales volume in China increased 37% (year over year), while sales in the US and Europe declined 13% and 5%.

As such, EV and hybrid vehicle demand is regionally dependent. While hybrids are getting a boost in the US market, China sales are driving the higher plug-in hybrid sales forecasts.

The Iowa Environmental Council says it's possible for the state to meet higher demand and achieve the carbon-free electricity goal.

Renewable energy from wind and solar rose to 67% last year in Iowa, according to the IEC's latest Condition of the State report. But import taxes on materials, including a 50% tariff on steel, and a rollback on federal tax credits could dampen momentum.

""A wind turbine is almost all steel. And it'd be nice if all that steel was available here in the U.S., but it's not. So, as that steel is imported, that's certainly going to increase the cost of building that turbine,"" said Steve Guyer, IEC's senior energy policy counsel.

The U.S. Supreme Court said Tuesday it will hear a case challenging the legality of President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Utility-scale wind and solar projects also face a severely shortened timeline for federal tax credits after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law this summer. Projects must begin construction before July of next year to qualify for subsidies.

""It's very possible that as we look at this rapid increase in demand, they may be viable even without those tax credits. But sort of crystal-balling this, it's sort of hard to tell what impact will really occur,"" Guyer said.

The IEC report and other research show the costs to build and maintain wind and solar are cheaper than coal and natural gas, even without subsidies.

Earlier this year, Alliant Energy and MidAmerican Energy proposed large-scale wind and solar projects.

The authors of the IEC report said Iowa's utilities ""must aggressively act to take full advantage of any Inflation Reduction Act incentives"" and advocate for the elimination of coal generation by 2030.

Next, it’s time to put the decade of 1.5°C behind us.

A bit of history. Let’s go back to early 2015, a few months before the COP21 climate talks in Paris. Countries have agreed to limit the global temperature increase to 2°C but have not yet turned that figure into an emissions target. The UK – the most progressive economy in the developed world – was still targeting an 80% reduction under its pioneering 2008 Climate Change Act.

In June, the Group of Seven met in Schloss Elmau in Germany as guests of then German Chancellor Angela Merkel. When the closing communique appeared, it contained this bombshell: “We emphasize that deep cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions are required, with a decarbonisation of the global economy over the course of this century.” [italics mine – M.L.].

The political enthronement of net zero had begun.

But the enthronement went too far. The Paris Agreement only promised to “hold the increase in global average temperatures to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels”. However, in order to secure support from the coalition of Small Island Developing States (as documented in a series of Cleaning Up episodes), it also included a commitment to “pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels”.

This set in train a series of events, starting with the publication by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, of the SR15 report in October 2018, which documented for the first time the considerable climate impacts that could be avoided by remaining under 1.5°C. It also pointed out that keeping to 1.5°C would mean cutting emissions by 45% from a 2010 baseline by 2045 (around 50% from the 2018 figure) and reaching net zero by 2050.

These goals were immediately seized on by Fridays for Future, Extinction Rebellion, the Sunrise Movement and other activists, who were having their moment in the spotlight. Net zero by 2050 was adopted by politicians, executives and investors in an orgy of virtue-signaling ahead of COP26 in Glasgow. How many of them spared a thought for how much it would cost?

Energy and transport assets can have lifetimes of 30 years or more. Reducing emissions by half in the 12 years after 2018 would mean writing off trillions of dollars in productive assets, the economic impact of which was not captured in the IPCC’s analysis. What its report did show, however, as long as you scrolled to page 152 of Chapter 2, was the impact on marginal carbon prices: In the 2°C scenario they could rise to $225 per metric ton of CO2 (in 2010 dollars) by 2030; under 1.5°C they could go as high as $6,050 per ton. That’s quite the difference.

Adopting the 1.5°C target, therefore, meant targeting the premature retirement of a large slice of existing energy assets and throwing money at anything with the slightest chance of reducing emissions. Is it surprising that so many people now associate climate action with a profligate waste of public money and an elite indifferent to energy bills?

The irony is that the world went mad for 1.5°C at almost exactly the moment it became clear it could not be achieved: My first public statements that 1.5°C was no longer achievable can be dated to 2018.

Today, it is ten years since that G-7 meeting in Schloss Elmau. We have either passed the 1.5°C threshold or will do so in the next few years – yet commitment to 1.5°C still serves as an article of faith for the climate community. That has to change.

It’s not that 1.5°C of warming won’t have devastating impacts – indeed, we are already seeing them. But that doesn’t make it a credible target. Continuing to adhere to it leads to terrible policy decisions and undermines public support. It’s time to switch back to the hard 2°C target that lies at the heart of the Paris Agreement.

Coda I. To avoid exceeding 2°C of warming we still need to reach net zero, only later. Advanced economies would still need to target 2050; China would still need to target 2060; India would still need to target 2070 – just as they all promised in Glasgow in 2021.

Coda II: If we all get to within 5% or 10% of our targets, that’s pretty good going. If it’s not enough, we can always course correct along the way (following what is called in the jargon an adaptive pathway), using technologies and wealth generated over the coming decades. The target should be net zero-ish, rather than absolute net zero.

3. Reset energy priorities

When it comes to energy, the pragmatic climate reset means focusing on decarbonizing the first 90% as quickly and affordably as possible, rather than letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.

On one level, decarbonization is simple: Clean up electricity, and electrify almost everything. All low-carbon pathways ever modeled have this approach at their heart.

We already know how to electrify huge additional swathes of the economy at modest or no cost: Land transport, domestic and commercial heating, low- to mid-temperature industrial heat, and those thermal processes that can switch to electrochemistry. We even know how to decarbonize high-temperature industrial heat using commercially available technologies, particularly if we are prepared to pay a modest carbon price.

The challenge. A lack of skills, immature supply chains, reluctance to change behavior, existing high-carbon assets, lags in capital formation, lobbying and regulatory capture. These are all things that get fixed with the passing of decades and generations.

As for decarbonization of electricity, we certainly already know how to do this. Every country in the world is already doing it, even those with no commitment to climate action.

A decade ago, coal provided 39% of US power. Last year it was 15%. In the European Union, coal was at 26%, and last year it was 10%. The UK was 42% dependent on coal in 2012 and last year closed its final power station. In China, coal was at 73% of power ten years ago, in the first quarter of 2025 it was 58%. China may still be building new power stations, but it is also shutting old ones and using the ones it has less and less.

Over that same decade, wind and solar generation have soared by a factor of 18 – making them the fastest-growing new source of electricity in history, by a wide margin. This quarter, wind and solar together will deliver 17% of global power. Nuclear is growing too, but much more slowly. The global solar industry now has enough capacity to manufacture 2 terawatts of panels per year and will soon be installing 1TW annually – enough to replace 10% of fossil-based power.

The multi-decadal decline in solar and wind costs, only briefly interrupted by the recent spike in inflation, has resumed. Costs are below those of new-built coal or gas plants practically everywhere, and in many places below the cost of running existing plants.

Last year saw around 1 terawatt-hour of batteries manufactured, up by a factor of 26 over the past decade. To put this in context, 1TWh is enough to meet global power needs for around half an hour; models show that four hours of storage is enough for most grids to ride through most daily variations in supply and demand. EV batteries are increasingly being used to provide flexibility, and grid-connected storage is increasingly co-located with renewable generation. Ten more years of battery growth and the grid will be a completely different animal.

The main remaining challenges to complete decarbonization of the grid will be industry, seasonality and longer-duration resilience.

In countries with good resources, a combination of renewables with batteries will soon deliver dispatchable power more cheaply and reliably than coal or natural gas, so that’s a big chunk of industry sorted. Very sunny regions can already have power from solar and batteries 97% of the time at $104/MWh, down 22% from last year, according to estimates from think tank Ember. And Abu Dhabi is building the first GW of baseload solar in the world. Seasonality will most likely end up being solved by overbuilding (as happens in every other sector of transport, energy, infrastructure and the built environment).

This tide of cheap clean electricity is unstoppable. In the 11th century, after his failed attempt to stop the waters, King Canute declared that “all the inhabitants of the world should know that the power of kings is vain and trivial.” President Trump his Energy Secretary Chris Wright should take note.

Then there is gas.

Then there is gas. In 2022, Trieu Mai and some of his colleagues at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) showed that the cost of decarbonizing 90% of U.S. electricity would be around $125 per ton of CO2 (in 2022 dollars). After that it gets expensive, reaching $1,000 or more per ton to get to 100%. Similar results have been found for many other geographies including the UK, Germany and Australia.

I used to reject the idea of gas as a “transition fuel”. I was wrong.

If you simply replace big inflexible coal plants with big inflexible gas plants, you achieve an immediate halving of emissions, as the gas industry is fond of pointing out. The problem is, you are then locked in for the life of that plant and – given the scale of the infrastructure serving it – perhaps forever.

However, if you replace inflexible coal plants with flexible gas then, as long as regulation makes owners indifferent to the number of hours of operation, there’s no such lock-in. You might start with the flexible generation meeting 25% of the grid’s output, but as you continue to add very cheap wind, solar, demand response and batteries – and nuclear if you can get the numbers to work (see Part I for why I’m skeptical) – you can continue to push down gas use until your grid is 90% or more decarbonized. In fact, modelling shows that grids could keep going all the way to below 5% flexible generation before it becomes impossible to ride through periods of low renewable resources.

There is an additional benefit of leaving flexible gas capacity on the system: It can also help with grid stability.

The power cut that hit Spain and Portugal on April 28 was not caused by renewables. In fact, those who seize on power cuts (most recently Spain, but the UK, Australia, Texas, California, Chile and so on before then) as proof that grids must be based on fossil or nuclear power for stability, have been wrong every time.

Spain’s headlong rush to wind and solar, which were meeting 64% of demand at the moment of failure, had certainly reduced the amount of inertia on the system, but the issue that brought the grid down was the arcana of voltage oscillations. The fact is, Spain’s grid codes – the rules by which market participants feed in or draw out power – had not kept up with the rapidly-changing power mix; there was a culture of non-compliance by market participants; and too much was being asked of a weak interconnection to France.

It is perfectly feasible for renewable resources and batteries to provide grid stability services, and we should expect them to do so. Still, flexible gas capacity can help too, even at times when it is no longer needed to generate power. Engines and turbines can be decoupled from generators, leaving them spinning but neither consuming nor generating power. Then, when grid frequency changes, they provide inertia. They can also provide reactive power, short-circuit current, black-start capability and a range of other stability services.

Unlike a system that provides all grid stability services with only renewables and batteries, one with flexible gas generation can also ride through longer renewable outages at an affordable cost.

If society decides, at some later point, that we need to go all the way to a 100% decarbonized grid, we will face a well-defined challenge: How to replace a few percent of flexible gas generation (and the associated stability services).

Whatever route we choose, those last few percent would require vast investment and incur high running costs. It may be that by then we are so wealthy, and the impact of climate change so obvious, that we decide to spend the money. But it may be that we decide instead to do carbon removal, or to help laggard regions first. Or maybe we will have other priorities, like defense, or adaptation.

The fact is, how to decarbonize the last few percent of the grid is simply not a question we need to answer today.

Coda: Some sectors, of course, cannot be decarbonized via electrification – shipping, aviation, process emissions from cement, and the like. However, these account for less than 15% of emissions, and even here a pragmatic climate reset means focusing on rapid and cheap progress, not technological purity. 40% of shipping goes away if we stop shipping coal and oil around the world. For the rest, LNG, biogas and streamlined operations can reduce emissions far more rapidly than ammonia or synthetic methanol. Aviation emissions can be slashed via more efficient planes, improved operations, biofuels, contrail management and carbon removal, supported by appropriate taxation and the removal of subsidies. Industrial heat can be substantially decarbonized before tackling process emissions, which we will eventually eliminate via carbon capture and storage. We could finally get serious about plastics recycling or just accept that putting plastic waste in a well-managed landfill is a form of carbon sequestration. And so on.

4. Reset hydrogen

Hydrogen needs a reset all of its own. In all my decades as an analyst, I have never seen such a big disconnect between the physics of what a solution can deliver, and the politics of what’s being asked of it.

Why does this matter? Because if you wanted to delay the transition you would promote a solution that sounds perfect but doesn’t work. A fuel that is ubiquitous, easy to make, produces only water, will get cheaper and cheaper, provides jobs and photo-opportunities and solves every problem from cars to rockets, transport to fertilizer and steel to seasonal storage. Whoopee! And hydrogen even has an extra feature: It takes years and years to figure out that it is unaffordable – particularly if you can get the public to ignore 50 years of wasted public funds.

The hydrogen soufflé is beginning to deflate. At the end of last year, the European Court of Auditors found that the targets in the EU’s 2020 Hydrogen Strategy were “driven by political will rather than being based on robust analyses”, and called for a “reality check”. In January this year, France’s state auditor, the Cour de Comptes, estimated the country’s hydrogen strategy implies a cost of carbon of at least €520, and even jeopardizes France’s national finances.

But it’s time to go all in on the hydrogen reset. It is time to admit that green hydrogen will play no more than a bit part in a future low-carbon energy system.

It’s not just that green hydrogen is currently expensive to produce. It’s that it has no plausible pathway to affordability. Electrolyzer stacks will exhibit the same sort of learning rates as solar PV and batteries, but they are responsible for only around 10% of the cost of green hydrogen. Another 40% is electricity, and 40% is heavy engineering – electrical, chemical and civil – and their costs are not about to drop by the five to ten times required to make green hydrogen cheaper than other clean solutions.

You also have to add the cost of compression, transport, distribution, use and safety management. Even if your plan is to make ammonia locally from cheap wind or solar, or to feed hydrogen into a refinery, you either have to add the costs of batteries to smooth your power supply, or the cost of compression and buffer storage to meet the 24/7/365 demands of the downstream plant. If you are exporting, you’ll need pipelines and deep-water port infrastructure.

Green ammonia? It could perhaps eventually be viable, but only where dispatchable green power is very cheap, natural gas is very expensive and there’s a local market for fertilizer (Brazil, China and India come to mind). Elsewhere, the numbers simply don’t stack up, not even for Saudi Arabia’s NEOM mega-project.

Green steel? Simply not urgent. Switch primary iron production to natural gas direct reduction and you get 75% of the benefit at a fraction of the cost. We should keep working on direct electrical reduction and bio-coking coal, which promise to be cheaper and more flexible in terms of ore grades than hydrogen.

E-fuels? No way will they ever be cheap enough to replace petrol or diesel or to compete with electrification. It’s obvious, really, because you can’t make something from electricity which is cheaper than electricity. Germany needs to stop the charade of Technologieoffenheit (technology openness) before it witnesses the implosion of its entire automotive industry.

Hydrogen aviation? It’s a dead parrot, as even Airbus seems to have understood. Building the plane is not the problem (though it would carry half the passengers because it’s full of hydrogen and insulation) but there is no plausible way of getting liquid hydrogen to major airports at the required scale to run an airline.

What about sustainable airline fuel made from hydrogen with captured carbon, or so-called e-SAF? According to the EU’s own figures, it currently costs 12 times more than jet-fuel. And, since it is made in chemicals plants with electricity as the feedstock, there is no plausible pathway to an order-of-magnitude cost reduction.

Blending hydrogen into the grid? I have called this the stupidest idea from Stupidville, and I can’t improve on that. You are making a chemical feedstock for €6 – €10/kg, and then instantly reducing its heat value of less than €2/kg, while driving up costs to all other gas users, and committing to a pathway that cannot get beyond 6% decarbonization without building a new pipeline network. It beggars belief that this is being supported by governments – a gross failure of public policy.

White (geological) hydrogen? At this point it its an interesting field for scientific research. It certainly exists, but probably can’t be extracted at a meaningful flow rate. Even if it can, unless it can be extracted at high purity it’s just slightly lower-carbon natural gas. If the resource isn’t big enough to last 40 years you can’t build a pipeline to get it to the point of demand, and if it won’t last 20 years you can’t even build a local fertilizer plant. Wishful thinking is not an energy strategy.

We need to decarbonize 100 million tons of current hydrogen demand, which causes around 2.3% of global emissions. Since green hydrogen will always cost at least $2/kg more than fossil-based hydrogen, that means finding $200 billion per year of additional money – equivalent to the entire global aid budget. And since you need 15-year offtake agreements to secure project finance, you are looking for $3 trillion of up-front, bankable support. That’s three orders of magnitude more than anything available today.

The only affordable approach to decarbonizing current use cases is by means of hydrogen from natural gas, with the carbon captured and sequestered. Of course we have to do it right: Limiting fugitive methane emissions to less than 0.2% and achieving 95% or more capture and carbon sequestration. Society needs to demand that producers meet these stringent targets, instead of falling for activist claims that they are physically unachievable.

Coda: Luckily, there’s a silver lining to the inevitable failure of green hydrogen – it will be a relief for the planet. Every wind and solar project developer has to decide whether to sell electricity or make hydrogen. Until such time as the world is awash with green electricity (or pink, from nuclear, for that matter), every kilowatt-hour used to make hydrogen could deliver two to nine times the emission reductions if used directly, at a fraction of the cost. So that is what the pragmatic climate reset demands we do.

5. Reset diplomacy

In November 2011, I wrote a piece for BloombergNEF called Ya Basta! Time to Call Time On The COP Show. My argument was that the failure of 17 COP meetings to produce a global deal was actually harming the meteoric rise of clean energy that BloombergNEF was chronicling. Four years later, at COP21, the Paris Agreement was signed and, in a piece entitled We’ll Always Have Paris, I had to admit that “in retrospect I am very glad no one listened to me!”

I am older and wiser today so I am not going to call for the UNFCCC or even the COP process to be abandoned. But climate diplomacy most certainly needs a pragmatic reset.

My own first experience of COP meetings was COP14, Poznan, 2008. When I turned up, a subcommittee of the 9,000 delegates was debating whether to reopen the previous year’s agreement on the position of a comma. I kid you not. They were still at it a year later at COP15 in Copenhagen. There, the 27,000 delegates famously enjoyed freezing weather, poor food, traffic jams and huge lines, and produced… nothing of measurable benefit to the climate.

Back in Poland for COP19 in 2013, the hosts enraged the activist community by inviting businesses – including Polish coal-producing ones – to participate. By 2015, COP21 in Paris, side-events were everywhere, and delegate numbers had swelled to 30,000. COP26 Glasgow in 2021 saw 38,000 delegates (of which an undisclosed proportion caught Covid-19) at what I would argue was only the second breakthrough COP in history (Paris in 2015 being the other).

The three COP meetings since then have been hosted by oil and gas exporters Egypt, UAE and Azerbaijan. COP28 in Dubai was the UNFCCC’s Woodstock, with 84,000 delegates. We spent much of the week stuck in taxis, checking on our phones to see if the world would pretend to “phase out” unabated fossil fuels or only pretend to “transition away”. After decades of negotiations, a loss-and-damage fund was agreed – raising less than 0.1% of the market value of Saudi Aramco.

Last year’s COP29 in Baku was held in the shadow of President Trump’s re-election promise to exit the Paris Agreement for a second time. Instead of acknowledging reality, leaders of the Western democracies promised to invest $300 billion per year in developing countries by 2035. What were they thinking?

The COPs simplistic rich country / poor country classification is stuck in the last century. Today, supposedly rich countries are full of people suffering economic hardship from stagnant incomes, a cost-of-living crisis, persistent inflation, low growth and an ongoing European war. Meanwhile many supposedly poor countries (Non-Annex I Countries, in COP-speak) have skyscrapers, space programs, global multinationals, oligarchs owning European football clubs, middle classes taking international holidays, and millions of kids attending Western universities.

It is astonishingly tin-eared for Group of Seven leaders to fly off to Baku and promise to invest hundreds of billions of dollars per year in their emerging economic rivals – receiving nothing but a handful of climate indulgences in return.

The single best thing developed countries can do to ensure the decarbonization of South Africa, Indonesia or wherever, would be to succeed in decarbonizing their own economies while preserving their population’s standard of living. Do that, and the whole world will follow. Fail, and no amount of conferences or communiques on North-South climate finance will make any difference.

So, what would a pragmatic climate reset of the UNFCCC/COP look like? A full answer would require more words than you want to read. But here are some ideas:

Host the annual meeting on an island with no more than 5,000 hotel rooms, and a broader meeting only once every five years. Demand that delegations be led by ministers of finance, energy or trade rather than ministers of environment or climate.

Stop pretending plenary decisions are binding. Move from consensus to qualified majority voting. That alone would shorten meetings from two weeks to one.

Focus on sectoral deals in industry, energy and transport, rather than economy-wide agreements. Move land use, land change and forestry, or LULUCF, into its own Convention: the social, cultural and political importance of land means no government will ever let the tail of climate negotiations wag the dog of national priorities.

Shut down the loss-and-damage track. It makes no sense to build a duplicate aid infrastructure, particularly when losses cannot be unambiguously linked to climate change. Climate models which cannot predict individual storms, floods, fires or droughts cannot be used retroactively to quantify the contribution of climate to their cause – no matter how many activist scientists tell you they can.

Nearly 20 years ago, I wrote a piece explaining that climate change is not a simple prisoner’s dilemma but a repeated, multiplayer prisoner’s dilemma, which means the winning strategy is be to be “nice, retaliatory, forgiving and clear” and the role of the UNFCCC is to act as coach and mediator. It needs to focus on creating platforms for sectoral, bilateral and multilateral negotiations – not trying to deliver global economic government by means of emissions policy.

6. Reset science

In 2018, I launched the hashtag #RCP85isBollox to draw attention to the implausibility of the worst-case scenario used throughout climate research. Two years later, climate scientists Zeke Hausfather and Glen Peters published Emissions – The ‘Business As Usual’ story is misleading, agreeing that RCP8.5 needed to be retired. And yet RCP8.5 (and its modern analog SSP5-8.5) remains the most popular scenario in the climate literature, even today. This is a scandalous failure of science to self-correct.

The reason I made such a fuss about RCP8.5 was that it creates a trivially easy attack surface for opponents of climate action. And, sure enough, in his Presidential Order “Restoring Gold Standard Science”, President Trump specifically named RCP8.5, citing academic research from 2017 that showed how reaching it would involve burning more coal than exists in the world’s recoverable reserves. On this matter, though it pains me to say it, Trump is right.

Another case in point is the Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, the report by five known climate sceptics intended to serve as the evidence base to revoke the EPA’s Endangerment Finding. There is much to criticize about the report, without doubt. However, it should also be noted that the original Endangerment Finding was based on research dating to before 2009, using scenarios even more extreme than RCP8.5. No one committed to science-based decisions should object to a review, in light of another 15 years’ worth of additional research and data. The focus should be on making sure the review is objective – in which case there seems little doubt the Endangerment Finding would remain in place – rather than rejecting it out-of-hand and claiming that it is entirely and completely without merit.

Today, the IPCC is about to sign off on a new set of scenarios to be used for its next Assessment Report, AR7, due out in 2029. Despite stipulating that its scenarios must be plausible, the IPCC imposes no peer-reviewed test of plausibility. The worst-case scenario which they are about to endorse (SSP3-7.0), is no more plausible today than RCP8.5 was seven years ago. I am afraid this suggests the failure to self-correct is not accidental, but intentional.

The pragmatic climate reset does not mean dismantling the entire edifice of climate science, but reforming it. IPCC scenarios really must be plausible from an energy systems perspective. And they must focus on the landing zone to which we might actually be headed – between the 1.8°C which would still count as “well below 2°C of the Paris Agreement, and the 3.5°C that is now the plausible worst case (and which US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright says would be fine and dandy, based on the modeling by William Nordhaus which won him the Nobel Prize).

Above all, scientists need to stop trying to scare people and focus on informing them. Let society do the rest.

7. Reset finance

The pragmatic climate reset also means rethinking the role of sustainable finance. The idea that you can squeeze CO2 emissions out of the real economy or achieve environmental goals by means of financial regulation and central bank interventions has been tried and found wanting.

At COP26 in Glasgow, no fewer than 60 multilateral organizations were promoting the use of finance as a way to bend the arc of the global economy toward net zero. Towering over them was the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, whose members managed assets worth $130 trillion.

It didn’t work. Threats of legal action led to the withdrawal of major names and a severe pruning of the thicket of organizations and initiatives. In late 2024, a US coalition of Republican states launched lawsuits against leading asset managers – later joined by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission – claiming that they were violating antitrust and consumer protection laws and using ESG issues as a way of driving up energy prices in order to boost their investment returns.

Even in regulation-loving Europe the tide has turned against ESG. Just as I warned in 2021, the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities turned out to be “a considerable over-reach”, and attempts to get asset managers to report on Scope 3 emissions were “simply a mess”. Last year, after complaints of excessive bureaucracy from France, Germany and other countries, the European Commission and the European Banking Authority were forced to hack back reporting requirements.

The whole edifice of ESG has descended into little more than a box-ticking exercise.

While it may be possible to identify the lifecycle carbon emissions of a single product or project, when it comes to a company or investment portfolio, it is impossible. I’ll give you one example. How would the investors in New Energy Finance have rated the emissions impact of the initial million pounds raised in January 2006? We were using grid power in the office, most of which was from coal and gas, and flying to conferences and client meetings. Not good. However, over the next 20 years, New Energy Finance (now BloombergNEF) became the most trusted information provider to investors pouring trillions of dollars into climate solutions. That first million pounds may have been the single most effective climate investment in history – yet not one of today’s ESG methodologies would have given it a pass mark.

We need to get back to basics.

Companies are not vehicles for delivering social outcomes or justice. They are vehicles to produce products and services valued by customers – while respecting the spirit and letter of the law, generating returns for investors, and treating their staff and other stakeholders fairly. There is no evidence that becoming a so-called B-Corp improves behavior.

Asset managers allocate capital into well-run businesses, provide custodianship on behalf of asset owners and beneficiaries, and treat all other stakeholders fairly. Investment regulation needs to align with those goals and stop trying to save the world.

Policy makers need to stop using the financial system to discriminate against organizations active in politically unpopular parts of the economy. If they want different outcomes, they need to l regulate the real economy.

Activists too – stop claiming oil and gas companies cause emissions (especially if you yourself haven’t yet switched to green power, electric heating and no-fly holidays). We are all the cause, and we all have to be the solution.

It’s time to retire the term ESG. Once you get beyond issues of basic fairness – which is delivered through strong leadership, a healthy corporate culture and robust HR processes – ESG is all about nothing more than risk and opportunity. Every board and management team needs to understand the full set of issues that could destroy their business or present extraordinary opportunities. The fact that some may stem from environmental, social or governance factors does not justify a different department. Fire the consultants and box-tickers. Reassign the corporate sustainability officer. Focus on the issues, not the process.

The role of central banks is to maintain sound money and a dynamic, flexible economy. It is not their role to ensure the country meets environmental, social, industrial or other targets – that is the role of government. If political leaders fail to create appropriate regulations to enable capital formation around desired solutions, it is not up to central banks to second-guess them.

8. Reset policy

The pragmatic climate reset also means a new approach to policy and regulation. Here are a few thought-starters:

Remember what we learned in Part I: If clean energy grows 3% faster each year than total demand for energy services, and keeps it up for decades, fossil fuels will be squeezed off the system in a time-frame broadly consistent with 2°C. The overwhelming priority is to maintain growth in clean energy, year in and year out.

Policies designed to restrict investment in fossil fuel supply are a recipe for energy price inflation and social pushback. Without investment, global oil and gas output would decline at over 10% per year. With investment in existing fields alone, the decline would still be 4% to 6% per year. Once clean energy can meet demand growth, fossil fuels will be pushed off the system, but until then, climate justice demands that we let them keep energy costs down and the public on board.

All new climate-related grants, subsidies and regulations need to pass a value-for-money test, based on cost per ton of CO2 avoided. The calculation must include the contribution of overlapping measures, to make explicit the impact of multiple subsidies, and should be repeated at five-year intervals.

For solutions that are competitive with fossil fuels – including relevant carbon prices – policies should focus on removing barriers, not on providing funding.

Solutions that are not yet competitive may still deserve funding or regulatory support, but only if they can demonstrate a plausible pathway to a carbon price of $250 per ton within a decade – which must be peer-reviewed and published ahead of any funding decision.

Solutions that cannot meet the “plausible pathway to $250/tCO2 in a decade” value-for-money test may still receive funding, but only for R&D or pilots. They are simply not ready for prime-time and must not receive funding or regulatory support for scale-up or roll-out.

Investors who disagree with the findings of the value-for-money test are welcome to invest their own money and come back later with better evidence of a cost-reduction pathway.

Each measure providing public funding or creating a regulation-driven market must include a sunset clause. If it does not deliver as promised, if it is not on track to deliver the expected cost reductions at any five-year milestone, the measure should automatically be suspended.

Any mechanisms supporting asset investment needs to focus on the point when assets are reaching their end of life and need to be replaced anyway. There is a huge cost difference between replacing a fully-functioning boiler, car, power plant or piece of industrial equipment, and one that is fully depreciated. If no one were ever again to purchase a fossil-burning asset, the world would be on track to net zero in one asset cycle. Think about it.

Public statements relating to the cost of climate action need to differentiate carefully between total investment, additional investment, and actual costs. Too often, total investment is presented as a cost, ignoring the fact that investments have a financial return, and that investment would also be required in any fossil-based counterfactual. The actual cost of climate action to consumers is usually a fraction of the total investment, and often even negative, and it’s time for that story to be told – loudly and clearly.

Stop promoting fossil fuel consumption. There is a rich literature on fossil fuel subsidies, most of it worthless because it confuses subsidies with non-cash externalities and gives fossil fuels no credit for the royalties and taxes they generate. Just do the simple stuff: Stop cash subsidies, insulate homes instead of giving people fuel allowances, stop giving freebies to airports and tax breaks to airlines in the belief that they are magic machines for economic growth.

Shift green levies and social charges from clean to fossil-based solutions and in particular from electricity to gas. The biggest single barrier to electrification is the difference between power and gas prices. One example: with an electrical heat tariff no higher than three times the gas price, any heat pump with a coefficient of performance of three or more would reduce utility bills. No further policy would be required to drive their uptake.

Embrace locational pricing. The reason cheap renewables reached grid competitiveness in 2015 was not just falling production costs, but also because the world adopted reverse auctions. It is time for another major shift – to locational pricing. As soon as the penetration of variable renewables gets to the point that grids struggle, locational pricing matters. Incumbents hate it – they would rather be paid wherever they build wind and solar, whether it is generating or curtailed. Locational pricing shifts value from the supply side to the demand side and is essential to maintain public support for the continued growth of clean energy.

Reform the Greenhouse Gas Protocol carbon-accounting rules. The current ones, written in 1990, allow companies to claim they use 100% renewable power on the basis of annual matching – which means they can offset night-time coal use with extra purchases of daytime solar power. It’s absurd and destroys public confidence. The rules are currently under review and need to be tightened.

Summary – the Climate and Energy Reset

I said I was not going to write a manifesto. The ideas here are intended as a provocation. Some of them might make you uncomfortable, in which case I apologize. Some of them make me uncomfortable. But this is surely a moment for frank talk, given what is going on in the world.

If the climate and clean energy community wants to do more than hunker down and watch brick after brick being kicked out of the foundations of the future clean energy economy, it needs to take control of its destiny. Refresh its offer, scrape off the barnacles, and come out fighting.

A pragmatic climate reset is essential if we are to maintain momentum toward a low-carbon economy over the next few years. The transition is dead.

Europe’s ‘independence moment’: a strong signal for continued transatlantic energy cooperation

Reading President Ursula von der Leyen’s State of the Union amid the biggest wave of air strikes since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it’s deeply inspiring to hear her description of Europe’s “independence moment.”

Importantly, she highlights dependence on Russian fossil fuels as a central element of this campaign. This European determination to end Russian energy imports and embrace reliable and much cleaner American LNG represents a success for several decades of transatlantic energy diplomacy.

Also notable is her focus on Europe’s commitment to energy transition, including a 30 percent reduction in emissions by 2030. At a moment when both Europe and the United States are focused on reducing China’s domination of clean energy supply chains, this is an obvious area for continuing transatlantic commercial cooperation. For instance, von der Leyen’s battery booster initiative should build naturally on what the United States has already been doing through the Minerals Security Partnership. Similarly, her strong endorsement of nuclear power as part of Europe’s strategy for energy independence suggests this as a priority focus for American companies working on next-generation nuclear and small modular reactor technologies.

The right message must be followed by real action

European sovereignty. Greater unity. Strategic autonomy. Yes, yes, and yes. These were the key—if recycled—lines adopted by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in her “State of the Union” annual speech at the European Parliament yesterday. Europe is encircled and needs to take care of itself—that is the message…again. But will the words be followed with action?

This time, they truly must, as every day brings worrisome proof that the global context is deteriorating. The same morning von der Leyen was delivering her speech, Russian drones for the first time penetrated the European Union—in this case, across the Polish border. Internal social maneuverability and political leadership are worsening across the continent. Also on this 10th of September, French trade unions engaged in a general strike, which coincides with a motion of no-confidence for the François Bayrou government.

And in terms of energy sovereignty, which has become increasingly critical, there has been not much progress but quite a lot of deception. Northvolt, the only European hope to match Asian batteries, has collapsed. The Iberian blackout exposed a major weakness in grid management and, by necessity, led to a ramp up of dispatchable sources. Neither Enrico Letta’s nor Mario Draghi’s report recommendations from 2024 were implemented even though everybody largely agreed with them. The past year only proved once again a hard truth: wishing for different outcomes without imagining different inputs is doomed to fail.

Europe continues to be squeezed between the necessity of importing hydrocarbons and the desire to move forward the energy transition that fuels Asian manufacturing. It now not only depends on Chinese panels and batteries, but also its wind turbines and cars—both electric and conventional. These industries, of which Europeans were once proud, are now subject to a dangerous slowdown. High energy prices and their volatility discourage new investment and harm the profitability of existing industries. If Europe wants to pass from words to action, it needs to develop an independent vision of energy sovereignty and make it an operational issue not only subject to majestic speeches.

What von der Leyen’s speech did—and did not—say

Von der Leyen’s State of the Union speech was an attempt to appease diverse political audiences, a goal that had her walking a very fine line. It was a wartime speech, which was powerful on the front end, focusing on continued support for Ukraine and surrendering to pressure from the left on Gaza. But the speech became muddled toward the end, as it morphed into a mere checklist and lost track of priorities.

To von der Leyen’s credit, she made an effort to again warn about the challenges Europe faces in an increasingly competitive and hostile global environment, while acknowledging that the Commission has been slow to act.

On energy, her statement that “it’s time to get rid of dirty Russian fossil fuels completely” was a clear rebuke to those who have been advocating a return to cheap Russian oil and gas. Also remarkable was her mention of nuclear as baseload power for more homegrown renewables, breaking with the past Commission consensus that it remain neutral on nuclear energy.

Her strong statement defending the trade agreement with the United States reflects growing criticism of the deal.

The speech, although valiantly delivered, still does not reflect a sense of urgency for Europe, but it does reflect the limits of the power of the Commission president in the face of a very divided Europe. While von der Leyen raised the famous Draghi report, European analyses timed for the speech note that only a small portion of the proposals in the Draghi report has been implemented.

Europe’s energy balancing act: nuclear power recognition, softer climate rhetoric

In her State of the Union address, President Ursula von der Leyen struck a notably pragmatic tone, prioritizing Europe’s competitiveness, defense, and strategic autonomy over major new climate announcements.

Transatlantic cooperation remained central to her message. Von der Leyen highlighted the EU-US deal, underlining its importance for protecting European jobs and portraying it as a stronger outcome than what others managed to secure—signaling both the strategic and economic weight of this partnership.

Nuclear power was explicitly acknowledged as part of Europe’s clean energy pathway, reflecting Brussels’ growing openness, influenced by France’s demands for greater recognition in the 2040 climate targets or by the US interest in nuclear projects, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. Enlargement, too, was emphasized, reaffirming the European future of the Western Balkans, Moldova, and Ukraine—a development that must drive a deeper debate on energy security in these regions.

Notably, “green” and “climate” were mentioned only five times, compared to eighteen mentions in the last State of the Union in 2023, with the 2040 targets briefly referenced amid ongoing heated negotiations in Brussels. Energy affordability, however, remained a central theme of the address.

Despite drawing clear lines between friends and foes, von der Leyen underscored that Europe must remain “open to the world and choose partnerships with allies—old and new,” a statement that may reflect an evolving view of a multipolar global order.

– Andrei Covatariu is a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center.

Boosting European batteries is a start

President von der Leyen’s “battery booster package” is a start, but the €1.8 billion for equity to boost production in Europe pales in comparison to over $230 billion in subsidies China lavished on electric vehicles (EVs) and batteries from 2009 to 2023—and even the United States continues to invest tens of billions of dollars in its battery/EV complex despite a less favorable policy environment. Europe risks being left behind in this cutting-edge technology.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Germany’s removal of the debt brake could prioritize battery and EV investment, while other northern European countries enjoy fiscal space that must be balanced against inflation risks. There’s also an urgent need to build on embryonic Europe-US cooperation in advanced batteries.

Finally, advanced batteries hold important security implications for European countries—especially Ukraine. Next-generation, Western-made batteries, with greater energy density, would enable Western forces to outrange Russian drones powered by Chinese batteries. With battery-powered, first-person view (FPV) drones changing battlefield tactics in Ukraine, the EU should prioritize battery investment.

Given batteries’ relevancy for Europe’s military, economic, and climate objectives, the Commission and Member States must build on the battery booster package.

Europe’s call for greater energy security could be met through the Black Sea region

Von der Leyen’s urgent call to rewire Europe’s energy map positions the Black Sea region as a key element in reducing dependence on Russian fossil fuels faster and advancing European energy independence. The “Energy Highways” initiative and upcoming Grids Package target persistent gaps in cross-border infrastructure in Central Europe. By prioritizing grid upgrades, new interconnectors, and faster permitting, the Commission signals that Black Sea offshore wind, nuclear capacity, and other clean energy projects can be integrated quickly if they are backed by committed investment and political will.

Von der Leyen’s reference to “crucial stability in our relations with the US” also has implications for regional energy security. Stable EU-US trade relations prevent tariff shocks that could disrupt important infrastructure development. The planned Vertical Gas Corridor would channel US and other non-Russian LNG into the Black Sea region, diversifying essential natural gas routes. In addition, US partnerships on nuclear energy, especially small modular reactors and Cernavodă modernization in Romania, would provide long-term, low-emissions power. These transatlantic links and EU initiatives collectively support the Black Sea’s development into an energy hub that is critical to Europe’s clean energy transition and strategic independence.

The road ahead for European energy security

Von der Leyen’s emphasis on energy infrastructure in the State of the European Union marks a positive step forward for European energy security and competitiveness. This suggests the Commission is responding to last year’s Draghi report warnings about permitting delays and grid constraints.

However, the slow pace so far in advancing European competitiveness raises doubts about how much this agenda will be acted upon. The Commission’s pledge earlier this year to phase out Russian fossil fuels by 2028 was long overdue, albeit a welcome rhetorical shift. But without proper diversification of energy sources, the EU risks replacing one dependency with another, shifting from Russian gas to increased US liquefied natural gas imports, and ultimately falling short of delivering the strategic autonomy that von der Leyen emphasized throughout her address.

Her call to double down on homegrown renewables, with nuclear as a baseload, and to modernize and invest in infrastructure and interconnectors is a promising step forward. For Central and Eastern Europe in particular, this could further accelerate progress toward meeting the EU’s 2030 climate targets while enhancing long-term energy security. Yet without national buy-in—as seen in Hungary and Slovakia’s resistance to the fossil fuel phase-out, and Austria’s recent legal opposition to nuclear settled by the court this week—these proposals risk becoming at best, slow moving, and at worst, more rhetoric than reality.

Dive Brief:

In the first half of this year, total project finance lending to the U.S. clean energy industry increased to around $86 billion, up from $80 billion in the first half of 2024, according to a Monday report from Crux, a finance technology company that connects tax credit buyers and sellers.

The clean energy industry faced considerable policy uncertainty this year after President Donald Trump took office and rolled back some Biden administration policies, then worked with Congress to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which curtailed many of the tax credits offered by the Inflation Reduction Act.

“The market is growing and becoming much more diverse,” said Crux CEO Alfred Johnson. “We’re still seeing a lot of volume from wind and solar, and anticipate to continue to see it as projects are placed into service over the next four years. But the dynamic of increased diversification is definitely going to continue, and we expect to be even more pronounced in the back half of the year.”

Dive Insight:

A lot of that diversity is coming from parts of the industry which saw their tax credits less trimmed by the OBBBA, which targeted benefits to wind and solar in particular. Storage tax credits made it through largely unscathed, and transactions on those are “booming,” Johnson said.

Crux’s report estimates that the total transferable tax credit market exceeded $20 billion in the first half of this year, almost doubling from the first half of 2024.

“A critical driver of this growth was the broadening range of technologies and sponsors active in the market, with energy storage projects in particular gaining market share alongside established solar and wind deals as well as newly eligible credits from advanced manufacturing, clean fuels, geothermal, and other sectors,” the report said.

Johnson noted that there is “continued bipartisan support for categories like advanced manufacturing, critical minerals, nuclear, biofuels, that continue to see significant amounts of investment, and that is materializing in the tax credit market.”

Crux’s report said that not all technologies face “the same accelerating investment as storage.” Onshore and offshore wind energy, which have been targeted by the Trump administration, “face headwinds to new investment. The proportion of wind PTCs sold in the transfer market declined to 9.5% during 1H2025 from 33.0% in 1H2024.”

Tax credits benefitting wind and solar are winding down earlier than anticipated, and are subject to new and onerous foreign entity of concern requirements.

“The market has some real pockets of financial distress as some developers that premised their business on a prior reality of policy and development are having to come to terms with the new reality,” Johnson said.

Johnson said there are numerous and cross-cutting forces at work in the current clean energy market, making it “difficult to discern the net effects – which is why I find the conclusion that the market grew so materially from the first half of 2024 to 2025 to be so interesting.”

“It suggests that there are a lot of forces that drive this development, and we are in a moment of categorical expansion of energy need and domestic manufacturing, and that will play out through trillions of dollars being invested in energy infrastructure and manufacturing over the next decade,” he said. “It’s just going to be shaped somewhat differently than it might have been in a prior policy environment.”

Crux estimates that the tax credit market is likely to shrink from the first half of the year to the second, a forecast that Johnson called “admittedly conservative.” Part of the reason for that, he said, is that much of the volume in the second half of 2024 came from transactions on future year credits.

“Given some of the dynamics in policy and what we are seeing in terms of buyer bidding behavior, with tax liabilities reduced somewhat … We have not yet called the ball on there being as much forward investment and tax credit purchases as there were in the second half of last year,” he said.

Crux also found that nearly all of the wind tax credits — and around two-thirds of the solar tax credits — that the company expects to transact in 2025 have already been sold.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/4wI3lOZwJZ8EIOR6C4RTuvXh_zC-MG6aAWHA4PpdOX0/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9DTkhFNDUuanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-11 15:00:39.192520

Lawmakers on both sides increasingly recognize that permitting delays now jeopardize far more than developer timelines, they threaten U.S. energy security, grid reliability and competitiveness.","Clean energy and traditional baseload energy alike are significantly constrained by a permitting system that cannot keep pace with the nation’s growing energy needs. Federal permitting processes are notoriously complex, and the challenges only multiply when layered with state and local requirements. Developers must navigate overlapping environmental reviews, interagency approvals and jurisdictional inconsistencies, creating uncertainty and costly delays.

Energy facility and other infrastructure projects, regardless of the type of resource or technology, have found themselves delayed years beyond their feasible siting and construction timeframes. For solar and wind projects, it has become the norm rather than the exception for permitting plus other delays to add anywhere from two to four, or more, years. These delays are often longer for wind, particularly offshore.

This permitting dilemma has been further complicated by recent reductions in personnel and reprioritization at the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Department of Energy, agencies critical to the processing of rights of way, environmental impact analyses and other necessary approvals.

With the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) changes to the clean energy tax incentives also now in place, the urgency to finalize permits has only heightened. Unlike other projects, solar and wind now face immediate deadlines to either begin construction before July 5, 2026, or be placed in service before 2028 to qualify for the Internal Revenue Code Sections 45Y and 48E production and investment tax credits. Against this backdrop, permitting reform has shifted from a long-term policy goal to an immediate necessity. Without meaningful changes, delays in securing approvals will threaten eligibility for these critical tax incentives and jeopardize the nation’s ability to meet emergent and future energy needs.

Permitting reform is needed immediately to ensure clean energy projects meet new deadlines to qualify for critical tax incentives and can more quickly add critical capacity to the power grid.

IRS Beginning of Construction Standards and the Looming OBBBA Deadline

Under the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) beginning of construction guidance, Notice 2025-42, issued Aug. 15, taxpayers may now only establish that a wind or solar project has begun construction using the physical work test in order to qualify for the Sections 45Y and 48E tech-neutral incentives. (Read more about the implications of Notice 2025-42 here.)

In designating the physical work test as the sole method by which projects may certify that they have begun construction, the IRS also reaffirmed the existing standards for establishing physical work. In prior guidance, the IRS determined that there are certain reasonable disruptions to continuous construction and outlined specific incidents beginning in Notice 2013-29 and expanded on in Notice 2018-59. But while the new guidance preserves these permitted disruptions, including, “delays in obtaining permits or licenses from federal, state, local, or Indian tribal governments,” any delays in progress towards sufficiently beginning construction and then placing facilities in service inherently create additional risk.

Projects must both satisfy physical work and continuous construction requirements and may do so for the latter by placing a project in service within four calendar years of the calendar year in which construction begins. Allowable delays are not taken into consideration under this “continuity safe harbor,” and permissible extensions of the timeframe are not provided by any guidance, prior or new. Delays in permitting will therefore continue to jeopardize qualification for this safe harbor eligibility. This applies to both the physical work test and the 5% safe harbor still allowed for small solar projects producing 1.5 megawatts or less of alternating current generation.

If not claiming the continuity safe harbor, whether a project has satisfied the physical work or 5% safe harbor and continuous construction requirements comes down to the “facts and circumstances,” as determined by the IRS. This distinction has enormous implications for developers and tax equity investors:

A project that begins construction in 2025 but experiences prolonged permitting delays risks falling outside the four-year safe harbor, jeopardizing eligibility for Sections 45Y and 48E credits.

If the continuity safe harbor is missed, the IRS evaluates eligibility based on facts and circumstances, introducing significant uncertainty.

With solar and wind projects under more scrutiny and the July 4, 2026, deadline looming and additional foreign entity of concern restrictions on the way, even relatively short permitting delays could derail projects, strand capital and destabilize tax equity markets.

Lack of Solar and Wind Projects Jeopardize Grid Capacity and Reliability

While developers grapple with shortened timelines and complex approvals, grid operators are sounding alarms about growing reliability risks. Demand for electricity is climbing sharply, driven by three structural trends reshaping U.S. energy consumption: the rapid expansion of AI data centers, increasing electrification and growing domestic manufacturing capacity.

At the end of 2024, Grid Strategies published a forecast that electricity demand will increase almost 16% by 2029, totaling 128 gigawatts (GWs). This would require a fivefold increase in load capacity. Growth that the nation has not seen since the 1980s. This five-year forecast increase expects this historic load growth to be significantly concentrated within the PJM Interconnection regional transmission organization (RTO) and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) footprints. The report's estimates are based on annual planning reports submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by electric balancing authorities and updated with additional data from utilities and planning regions.

AI data centers, in particular, are driving incremental load growth far faster than previous forecasts. In some regions, these facilities are expected to add gigawatts of annual demand, with nationwide AI-related consumption projected to reach about 10% of total U.S. electricity demand by 2030, according to the Electric Power Research Institute. Electrification policies and market shifts are adding to the strain, while new industrial facilities increase pressure on already stretched capacity margins.

To maintain reliability, grid operators are stressing the need for unprecedented volumes of new renewable generation and storage, in addition to other resources, grid modernization and transmission infrastructure. Even though the intermittency of wind and solar has posed reliability challenges, when paired with storage or other existing base load generation, they can quickly add vital capacity. Texas is currently proving this out as its chance of rolling blackouts during summer peak demand were reduced to only 0.30% from 12% in 2024 and weathers unexpected outages from coal plants by running on 40.2% wind and solar generation.

Other regional organizations also already have the spare capacity for additional resources. PJM Interconnection, for example, the largest RTO in the United States and at high-risk for future capacity shortfalls, has as much as 153 gigawatts of surplus capacity that could be filled by solar, wind and storage, according to University of California, Berkeley. PJM's recently updated Surplus Interconnection Service (SIS) process also permits expedited review outside the standard interconnection queue for projects that do not require transmission system upgrades. A SIS allows new resources to utilize unused interconnection capacity of existing generating facilities without increasing the total interconnection service at a point of interconnection. UC Berkley found that California could similarly add 53 GWs of clean energy capacity, including solar and wind, and 23 GWs of storage, for a total of 76 additional GWs. Yet many projects end up stalled by permitting delays at all levels, in addition to having to navigate backlogged interconnection queues and attempt to qualify for exemptions.

In New England, reliability concerns are continuing to build. The Independent System Operator of New England (ISO-NE) recently warned that the DOI’s stop-work order for the Revolution Wind project threatens near-term system stability, underscoring how individual project delays can ripple through regional capacity planning. Without accelerated deployment, regions across the country risk falling behind demand growth, facing higher prices and compromising grid reliability at a time when every electron is needed, so to speak.

NEPA Holds the Spotlight

Though the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) of 2023 amended the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to both streamline and circumvent the application of NEPA environmental analyses, the consensus is that these are not enough and, many argue, are not effectively accelerating the permitting process while still safeguarding the environment and public inclusion. The FRA of 2023 established certain time and page limits and a lead agency policy, allows for cross-agency adoption of categorical exclusions, and amended the core mandate of NEPA to limit the consideration of environmental impacts to only those that are “reasonably foreseeable,” among other provisions.

The current administration has additionally instituted deregulatory updates to NEPA procedures broadly across the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and all relevant agencies, building on decisions by the courts regarding CEQ and agency authorities. In the case regarding CEQ’s authority, the D.C. Circuit determined in November 2024 that CEQ does not have the degree of authority that it has exercised for almost five decades to issue NEPA regulations for agencies.

In the other regarding a new 88-mile rail in Utah, the Supreme Court of the United States in May 2025 determined that federal agencies should conduct more limited environmental reviews of the impacts of proposed projects and not take downstream effects (Scope 3) into consideration. Scope 3 emissions encompass all sources outside of Scope 1 and 2 boundaries. They are the indirect greenhouse gas emissions that occur in a company’s value chain but are not produced by the company itself or its owned or controlled assets, such as emissions from purchasing, using, and disposing of products from suppliers.

These agency actions further minimize the role of NEPA and environmental analyses in the permitting approval process and, like the FRA of 2023, do not sufficiently address enhancing process efficiency for energy infrastructure. Substantial reforms to thoroughly yet responsibly streamline the federal permitting process for clean energy infrastructure are still needed to more expeditiously construct and bring generation facilities and transmission online. Solar and wind facilities face earlier 2026 and 2028 deadlines than other net-zero emissions generation technologies seeking to claim Sections 45Y and 48E, and the datacenter and electrification booms are only just beginning.

More Expansive Efforts Have Fallen Short

In response to the looming electricity supply-demand crisis, lawmakers have continually raised the issue of permitting reforms to the top of the policy agenda for the last several years, but as of yet, have been unable been unable to establish a highly tenable, passable bipartisan compromise. The Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024 introduced by former Senator and chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Joe Manchin, I-West Virginia, and the former ranking member, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, last year during the final months of the 118th Congress garnered bipartisan support. The bill proposed to expedite the permitting process for energy and mineral projects by shortening judicial review timelines and setting deadlines for federal agency actions. It accelerated leasing and permitting decisions and increased capacity goals for onshore and offshore energy projects, including renewables, reforms electric transmission planning and sets deadlines for liquified natural gas export applications. The bill also included provisions to improve electric reliability, modernize geothermal and hydropower permitting processes, and streamline mining sites. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources proposal came close to satisfying the priorities and assuaging the concerns of both sides of the aisle but was unable to build and sustain the impetus needed for passage before the end of the Congress.

A discussion draft of another proposal was simultaneously released by the House Natural Resources Committee at the end of 2024, led by the committee chair, Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas. Westerman’s proposal, unlike the Manchin-Barrasso bill, only included House Republican priorities for significantly reforming NEPA and limiting judicial review. In a committee hearing on the proposal, Westerman said that the bill would make common sense reforms to NEPA to limit the number of projects subject to NEPA review by ensuring projects that receive federal funding are not automatically subject to legal review; clarify the scope of review; and create timelines to expedite the judicial review process, limit standing for serial litigants and reduce vacatur and injunctions.

Westerman emphasized that the bill is technology and sector neutral and would streamline the process for all projects, but the proposal was met with significant Democratic opposition. They opposed the bill for similar reasons that they opposed the FRA of 2023, asserting that it would reduce timelines so much that they would become untenable and would weaken community engagement and environmental protections. Democrats insisted that NEPA is not the essential problem, it is the lack of human capital, other resources, modernization and therefore permit processing capacity that hinders the timeliness of reviews. As evidence, Democrats submitted a 2015 report by Natural Resources Defense Council to the record, which details cases in which the NEPA process has saved money and time, improved projects, and achieved better outcomes for communities and the environment.

During the 118th Congress, Democrats also introduced many of their own proposals, focusing on incentivizing and fast-tracking transmission, renewable energies and grid operational and technology modernization.

Like their Republican counterparts, these proposals similarly fell short of enticing bipartisan interest and progress towards passage of a compromise package.

Looking Ahead: Permitting Reform in the 119th Congress

The stakes for permitting reform are higher than ever and for developers and investors, the next 10 months are pivotal. OBBBA’s accelerated cutoff requires projects to have begun construction under the new Notice 2025-42 guidance by July 5, 2026, to still qualify for the full extent of the Sections 45Y and 48E credits. They will otherwise be required to be placed in service before 2028 to qualify. At the same time, AI-driven demand, electrification and manufacturing reshoring are also compressing grid planning horizons and raising the stakes for timely deployment.

In addition to its NEPA reforms, the FRA of 2023 also directed the CEQ to study the use of online and digital technologies to reduce delays in project reviews and enhance public accessibility and transparency. The study was intended to explore the use of a permitting portal for real-time document submission and collaboration, as well as a cloud-based tool to improve interagency coordination and streamline communications.

In response to industry, agencies and lawmakers, in April 2025, President Trump built on the FRA’s directive to modernize permitting technology by issuing a memorandum and launching in May the Permitting Technology Action Plan, which directs federal agencies to maximize technology use in environmental review and permitting processes.

In Congress, both parties have expressed a desire for a deal, with Democrats focusing on expanding the nation's grid for renewable energy and Republicans aiming to revamp environmental laws to accelerate various projects. During floor remarks in July, Chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Shelley Moore Capito, R-West Virginia, and Ranking Member Sheldon Whitehouse discussed the need for permitting reform, though Whitehouse and Democrats remain hesitant, citing the administration's actions regarding congressional authority and judicial orders. Additionally, many Republicans are reluctant to make it easier to build power lines through their states and support renewables.

Just after OBBBA passage, on July 17, Reps. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, and Scott Peters, D-California, introduced the bipartisan ePermit Act to digitize the U.S. permitting process and reduce processing times for NEPA reviews. The proposed ePermit Act intends to build on the recommendations from the administration, and so also the FRA of 2023, by providing legislative direction on how agencies should implement an electronic permitting system.

Shortly after, on July 25, House Natural Resources Committee Chair Westerman and Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, introduced a new permitting reform package, Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act. Similar to Westerman’s 2024 proposal, the SPEED Act again focuses on further NEPA reforms to accelerate approvals for energy infrastructure.

Westerman's new NEPA proposal aims to codify the recent Supreme Court ruling that limits the scope of environmental reviews to only the direct impacts of a project, excluding broader effects. The bill builds on the FRA of 2023 by setting a two-year limit for Environmental Impact Statements and a one-year limit for environmental assessments and narrowing the definition of ""major federal action"" by excluding federal funds, loans, or loan guarantees as triggers for NEPA to prevent agencies from considering upstream or downstream consequences.

The bill also restricts judicial challenges by requiring lawsuits to be filed within 150 days and setting a 180-day deadline for court judgments. Only parties who provided substantive comments during the public review period can issue legal challenges. Additionally, it limits a court's ability to remand agency decisions, allowing an agency’s decision to stand while errors or deficiencies are corrected. Republicans have made addressing litigation a priority because of the significant delays to project construction it can cause.

The House Natural Resources Committee held a hearing Sept. 10 on the SPEED Act, the ePermit Act, and another bill that would establish an annual CEQ study and report on NEPA’s impacts on projects.

While Westerman’s bill again reflects House Republican priorities and faces challenges in a narrowly controlled Republican Senate, it and other proposed legislation have reignited bipartisan discussions. Lawmakers on both sides increasingly recognize that permitting delays now jeopardize far more than developer timelines, they threaten U.S. energy security, grid reliability and competitiveness.

The coming months will determine whether Congress can deliver a durable compromise, or whether permitting bottlenecks will continue to strain developers, destabilize tax equity financing and threaten grid reliability. Project developers and other stakeholders are encouraged to stay actively engaged and participate in industry coalitions tracking legislative developments closely and advocating for bipartisan reforms.

The Iowa Environmental Council says it’s possible for the state to meet higher demand and achieve the carbon-free electricity goal.

Renewable energy from wind and solar rose to 67% last year in Iowa, according to the IEC’s latest Condition of the State report. But import taxes on materials, including a 50% tariff on steel, and a rollback on federal tax credits could dampen momentum.

“A wind turbine is almost all steel. And it’d be nice if all that steel was available here in the U.S., but it’s not. So, as that steel is imported, that’s certainly going to increase the cost of building that turbine,” said Steve Guyer, IEC’s senior energy policy counsel.

The U.S. Supreme Court said Tuesday it will hear a case challenging the legality of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

Utility-scale wind and solar projects also face a severely shortened timeline for federal tax credits after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law this summer. Projects must begin construction before July of next year to qualify for subsidies.

“It’s very possible that as we look at this rapid increase in demand, they may be viable even without those tax credits. But sort of crystal-balling this, it’s sort of hard to tell what impact will really occur,” Guyer said.

The IEC report and other research show the costs to build and maintain wind and solar are cheaper than coal and natural gas, even without subsidies.

Earlier this year, Alliant Energy and MidAmerican Energy proposed large-scale wind and solar projects.

The authors of the IEC report said Iowa’s utilities “must aggressively act to take full advantage of any Inflation Reduction Act incentives” and advocate for the elimination of coal generation by 2030.

Not only are data centers driving Illinois' clean energy transition, they are major job creators.

The state's data center industry will continue to be a constructive partner in this effort to devise practical solutions to the state's energy needs.
Josh Levi is president of the Data Center Coalition, the national trade association for the data center industry.","The average U.S. household now has 21 different devices connected to the internet, enabling everything from computers and cell phones to smart lighting and appliances. Beyond personal uses, cloud-based computing is now central to our economic growth, supporting countless industries. This demand, along with artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge applications, is creating a growing need for data storage and processing made possible by data centers — the physical facilities that provide the digital infrastructure supporting our modern lives and the 21st century economy.

Illinois has become one of the most important states in the country for deploying data centers, which have already created thousands of jobs and contributed billions in direct economic impact in the Prairie State, all while driving clean energy investments that are critical to making the state's clean energy transition a reality.

In fact, data centers have long been drivers of the clean energy transition, both in development and deployment. In 2024, half of all U.S clean energy procurement in solar and wind projects was attributed to companies that operate data centers. Data center operations are also highly efficient and leverage the latest innovations in facility design, cooling and technology to maximize our collective computing output.

Even better, data centers unlock tangible energy savings and efficiencies — for Illinois homes, businesses, utilities, government and other industries — by facilitating smart thermostats, managed electric vehicle charging, grid-enhancing technologies and more. Data center companies also invest in distribution- and transmission-level infrastructure that benefits all electricity users, helping modernize the nation's electricity grid.

The opportunity to fortify Illinois' clean energy future is already at hand, including through a recent commitment from Meta that supports the relicensing of over 16 gigawatts of carbon-free power and an additional 30 megawatts of power at the Clinton Clean Energy Center, enabling continued operation of the facility without increasing costs to ratepayers. Other data center companies are making similar investments toward expanding the state's clean energy supply, such as Digital Realty, which recently announced an agreement to support three solar projects in the state.

In short, data centers are helping to develop a resilient, affordable energy infrastructure for Illinois, all while driving the state's broader economic and energy transformation.

Not only are data centers driving Illinois' clean energy transition, they are major job creators. A recent study from PwC found that Illinois' data centers supported more than 115,000 jobs across the state in 2023, an 8% increase in employment in just one year. For every job inside a facility, six more are supported across the broader economy, according to the study. As these projects are built and maintained over several years, they help anchor stable, high-paying careers in the skilled trades.

The investments made by the data center industry also create significant benefits for local governments. The PwC study found that data centers contributed more than $1.8 billion in state and local taxes to Illinois in 2023, helping support investments in community priorities like education, transportation and public safety that enhance the quality of life for Illinois communities.

These positive impacts didn't happen by accident. They are largely due to the forward-looking leadership of Gov. JB Pritzker and legislators in creating a successful economic development program and encouraging investments that have contributed to Illinois' progress over the last six years in making the state ""open for business"" once again. In fact, a 2024 Illinois Department of Commerce & Economic Opportunity report confirmed that more than $15 billion in data center investment has come to Illinois as a result of the state's tax exemption program.

There is no industry better suited to help support Illinois' clean energy and technology leadership than the data center industry. As Illinois looks to consider new energy policy proposals, state lawmakers should adopt policies that signal the state is welcoming data center investment in digital infrastructure and clean energy projects, and avoid policies that risk driving these investments to neighboring states.

To meet this moment and harness the opportunity, legislators should commit to a comprehensive, data-driven evaluation of the state's energy needs, convene stakeholder meetings that allow public participation and consider thoughtful legislation that helps keep energy costs affordable while driving more clean power generation to meet statewide demand.

The state's data center industry will continue to be a constructive partner in this effort to devise practical solutions to the state's energy needs. By continuing to support the growing data center industry, the state can support Illinois' clean energy transition while minimizing the growth in energy costs, creating more high-wage jobs, ensuring consistent financial support for community priorities and maintaining its competitiveness.

Most recently, the House included language in its FY2026 Appropriations bill to defund the IRIS Program entirely and prohibit the use of IRIS assessments in rulemaking.
The No IRIS Act would prohibit EPA from using IRIS assessments in regulatory decisions.","On September 17th, industry leaders will gather on Capitol Hill to advocate for the No IRIS Act (H.R.1415/S.623)—a bill that offers a durable, science-based solution to addressing longstanding problems with the EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) Program.

For years, the IRIS Program has operated without Congressional authorization, issuing chemical assessments that often lack transparency and scientific rigor. These assessments have significant, real-world implications when they are used to inform regulatory decision-making and despite some modest reforms over the years, the IRIS Program continues to minimize or exclude high quality, relevant information, and default to overly conservative options when evaluating scientific information.

The result is toxicity values that are out of step with peer reviewed literature and other global chemical assessments. IRIS toxicity values are frequently set below naturally occurring background levels, detection limits, or even levels produced by the human body. This disconnect undermines regulatory credibility, puts access to critical chemistries in jeopardy, and threatens innovation across critical sectors of our economy that rely on the best available science to underlie decision-making.

Overly burdensome and scientifically flawed assessments like those produced by the IRIS Program jeopardize America’s chemical manufacturing sector—an industry responsible for over $600 billion in economic impact and more than 4 million jobs. In an era of global competition and supply chain vulnerability, maintaining a strong, science-based regulatory framework is not just an economic imperative, it’s a matter of national security. We must ensure that chemicals can be produced safely in America, so that we aren’t dependent on foreign sources.

For decades, multiple stakeholders, including the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, have raised concerns about the IRIS Program’s scientific methods and conclusions and called for improvements. Additionally, since 2009, the program has remained on the GAO’s High-Risk List, flagged for vulnerability to mismanagement and lack of accountability.

Policymakers are starting to take notice--and take action. In May, the White House issued an Executive Order directing agencies to rely on “gold standard” science that is transparent and rigorous. The EPA is undergoing internal reforms within the office that oversees the IRIS Program, and the U.S. House of Representatives has repeatedly voted to eliminate funding for IRIS assessments. Most recently, the House included language in its FY2026 Appropriations bill to defund the IRIS Program entirely and prohibit the use of IRIS assessments in rulemaking.

While these are important steps, this moment demands a durable legislative solution—to give the American public assurance that the best available science is the foundation for regulations and provide manufacturers the certainty they need to grow the American economy. The No IRIS Act would prohibit EPA from using IRIS assessments in regulatory decisions. It’s a straightforward step toward restoring scientific integrity and transparency in chemical evaluation.

American success relies on American chemistry. From agriculture and infrastructure to semiconductors and national defense, nearly every corner of our economy depends on the safe, innovative, and reliable production of chemical products.

Power management company Eaton and electric vehicle charger network ChargePoint have unveiled new EV charging infrastructure meant to provide ultrafast charging along with bidirectional charging capabilities, the companiesannounced Aug. 28.

The new ChargePoint Express Grid combines ChargePoint chargers with Eaton’s end-to-end power infrastructure to create a system that will “seamlessly synchronize onsite renewables, energy storage and vehicle batteries with local energy markets to help fleets significantly reduce fueling costs,” according to the press release.

The companies said the system will require a 30% smaller footprint with 30% fewer capital expenditures compared to typical chargers, ultimately cutting up to 30% of operational costs.

The new technology “will take DC fast charging to levels of performance and cost not previously imagined,” Rick Wilmer, CEO of ChargePoint, said in a statement.

There are two projects in the German North Sea: the Waterkant 300-megawatt offshore wind project should conclude by late 2028, and the Waterekke 1,500-MW project has a 2029 end date. Altogether, these projects have a combined capacity of 1,800 MW to provide clean energy for up to 2.4 million households after the connection to Germany's national grid.

""We reached an important milestone, and we are pleased to have reserved 97 wind turbines from Siemens Gamesa for this project alone,"" Holger Matthiesen, managing director of the two project companies, said in an August press release.

This milestone involves helping the German government reach its target of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030, followed by at least 70 gigawatts by 2045, as outlined in the German Offshore Wind Energy Act.

Utilizing wind energy adds to the diverse portfolio of greener energy options, which include solar, geothermal, energy harnessed from ocean waves, and, to an imperfect extent that is still better for the atmosphere, nuclear power. With various sources, energy independence and reduced reliance on toxic and polluting dirty fuels, regardless of location, is more feasible. Cleaner power means cleaner air and water for all life to thrive.

Individuals and businesses can save money on lower energy bills. Wind is free fuel that doesn't require mining or transport, thus making operational costs lower.

Building out these wind farms helps the economy by supplying local jobs. According to Clean Energy Wire, in 2021, 130,000 of the 344,000 renewable energy jobs in Germany were in the onshore and offshore wind power industry. Globally, the number of wind power jobs went from 1.25 million in 2020 to 1.4 million jobs only a year later, per the World Economic Forum.

In the United Kingdom, 6 million homes can receive power from the Dogger Bank offshore wind project upon its 2026 completion.

Buy now and you might miss out on better technology or lower prices in the future. Wait and you could miss out on the current rebates and incentives. It’s a bit like trying to time the stock market. Keep reading as we look into whether now is a good time to buy an electric vehicle or if it makes more sense to wait.

Also here are EV expenses you may not be aware of.

EV Adoption and Trends

EVs are quickly growing in numbers on the road. According to Rho Motion, approximately 9.1 million electric cars were sold worldwide in the first half of 2025. This is a 28% increase over the first half of 2024. Why is this trend happening? Part of it is because more manufacturers are releasing new electric models, which gives buyers more options to choose from.

Additionally, charging stations are being installed in more convenient locations. Larger cities have them at grocery stores, shopping malls and even in parking lots across town. They can even be found at larger office buildings. However, even though the number of charging stations is increasing, things aren’t ideal for everyone. Small towns have fewer options, making it crucial that owners can charge at home.

For You: 7 Reasons You Should Switch To an Electric Vehicle in Retirement

One of the biggest issues that’s kept people from purchasing an electric vehicle in the past has been battery technology. But even that’s improving. New electric models can go further without needing a charge. This makes them good for not only city driving, but also people looking to travel out of town.

Reasons To Buy Now

If you’ve been considering an electric car, there are a few reasons why you might want to buy now rather than waiting.

Incentives and rebates: Depending on where you live, your state may have rebates available for electric vehicles. Plus, federal rebates currently offer $7,500 when you purchase a new electric vehicle or $4,000 when you buy used. However, because of the Big Beautiful Bill, these federal rebates will expire on Sept. 30, 2025.

Lower Costs to Run: With the average price of gas being over $3.00 per gallon (per AAA), it’s cheaper for most people to run an electric car as long as you have the ability to charge at home.

Technology Has Improved: Range has always been one of the key reasons why people haven’t made the change from gas to electric. However, new technology has increased the range electric cars can make it without needing a charge.

“Now is a good time to buy an EV,” said Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book (KBB). “There’s a greater choice than ever before. There are various discounts and rebates available, some are regional, some are national. Also, the popularity of some EV models is declining so a little research by the shopper could end up getting them an exceptional deal.”

Reasons To Wait

While there are many reasons why people might want to buy an electric vehicle now, some people might find it better to wait.

Technology continues to improve: Even though technology has improved, delaying your purchase might lead to further improvements. The driving range could improve even more and charging could become faster, all of which drivers desire most.

Drop in prices: As more car manufacturers continue to release electric models, prices could fall even further.

Home charging not available: One of the biggest reasons why a potential buyer might want to wait is that they don’t have access to home charging. This can significantly increase the costs of ownership.

“Without charging at home, you don’t get the full benefit of the EV,” said Joseph Nagle, head of corporate strategy at Pando Electric. “Not only are you paying far higher prices for electricity at a public charger, but it’s significantly more convenient and enjoyable to simply come home, plug in and go about your life.”

Delkin says its flash is designed for these “unforgiving conditions,” and it offers high-endurance options for steady writes over time.
Hardware Options Seen in the Field Delkin lists a broad product set: industrial SSD, SD and microSD, CompactFlash, USB, mSATA, and more.
For small, low-power designs, the industrial microSD line targets embedded logging with simple integration.
Where It Fits (Examples) Renewable energy systems: storage for controllers and loggers that run 24/7.","Delkin Devices is promoting industrial flash storage for wind, solar, and grid assets that run far from help. The company’s materials stress rugged builds for heat, cold, vibration, and shock. They also call out support for remote deployments where data logging and safe restarts matter every day. In short, the firm is pitching storage that can live at the edge and keep critical data intact.

Why Storage Matters to Clean Power

Renewable equipment is full of sensors and controllers. These systems write logs, record faults, and push updates. If storage fails, a turbine may stop or a solar gateway may lose data. That is costly. Delkin says its flash is designed for these “unforgiving conditions,” and it offers high-endurance options for steady writes over time. The focus is simple: keep sites reporting, even when weather, vibration, or time makes things tough.

Protecting Data During Power Loss

Grid gear and renewable plants face sudden power cuts. A clean shutdown is not always possible. To reduce corruption, Delkin solid-state drives use power-fail protection at the device level. The company describes a mix of hardware and firmware methods that trigger during a loss event to protect in-flight data. That kind of guardrail helps systems boot cleanly after an outage and keeps event records usable.

Built in the U.S., with Lifecycle Control

According to Delkin’s site, design, manufacturing, and support are U.S.-led, with operations in Poway, California. The company highlights controlled bills of materials and lifecycle management for OEM programs, plus ISO 9001:2015 certification. That approach helps teams keep a stable configuration over years, which can reduce surprise re-qualifications in long-lived energy assets.

Delkin also points to on-site U.S. manufacturing as a way to speed custom work and keep quality under one roof. They note options like HALT (Highly Accelerated Life Testing) and value-added features such as conformal coating, which can be useful in dusty yards and outdoor enclosures.

Hardware Options Seen in the Field

Delkin lists a broad product set: industrial SSD, SD and microSD, CompactFlash, USB, mSATA, and more. That breadth lets integrators match hosts across old and new equipment. For small, low-power designs, the industrial microSD line targets embedded logging with simple integration. And in tiny footprints that still need speed, Delkin’s BGA SSDs offer NVMe Gen4 performance, error correction (LDPC + RAID ECC), and an extended temperature range that reaches from −40 °C to +105 °C. Those specs fit controllers packed into nacelles, cabinets, and edge gateways.

Quick Facts

Target sites: wind, solar, and other energy assets in extreme settings.

Power-loss defense: SSD-level protection to reduce data corruption on unexpected shutoffs.

Made in the U.S.: U.S.-led design and manufacturing with lifecycle control for OEMs.

Tiny but tough: BGA SSD option with NVMe and wide temperature support.

microSD for edge: small size, low power, and high reliability for embedded use.

Where It Fits (Examples)

Renewable energy systems: storage for controllers and loggers that run 24/7.

Industrial and utility gateways: local caching and firmware storage at the edge.

Remote sites with harsh weather: endurance and temperature tolerance to keep reporting.

Feature Snapshot

Form Factor Typical Energy Use Noted Features Industrial microSD Edge gateways, small controllers Small size, low power, reliable logging BGA SSD (NVMe) Space-constrained compute modules NVMe Gen4, LDPC + RAID ECC, −40 °C to +105 °C Industrial SSD (M.2 / 2.5″) SCADA servers, rugged PCs, PLCs Device-level power-fail protection options

Details for microSD design targets come from Delkin’s product pages. BGA SSD specifications include NVMe, ECC, and the wide temperature range. SSD power-fail behavior is described in the firm’s technology section.

Operational Context

Industrial failures cost more than a broken gadget. They can stop output, delay service, or risk safety. Delkin’s writing on industrial use makes that point and lists sectors that need tougher parts than consumer gear. Energy is one of those sectors. Storage here is not a nice-to-have; it is part of running the plant.

The company also shares guidance on common field issues. One example is SD cards that turn “write-protected” in service. The advice explains why it happens and how to respond so uptime improves. That kind of support matters when a site is miles away and windows for repair are short.

CEO Drew Marsh called the three natural gas-fueled power plants the utility is building for Meta's new north Louisiana data center big wins for the state, but they will likely keep the utility from meeting its goal to cut emissions in half by 2030.

In a speech Wednesday to more than 300 energy professionals, policymakers and students at Tulane University’s Future of Energy Forum, Marsh said the huge new power plants, expected to cost more than $3 billion, will improve grid reliability for customers statewide at a cost of pushing back some of its carbon goals.

“It makes it harder to reach our goals in the near term, but I think it has the potential to make it easier in the long term,” said Marsh, who heads the only Fortune 500 company headquartered in New Orleans. “2030 is going to be tough, but I think we still have a good shot at 2050, because Meta can bring its $2 trillion company to bear on this problem and help us clean up.”

Entergy was instrumental in landing the $10 million Meta data center, which is heralded by some as one of the biggest economic development wins in state history. Others have criticized it for its massive energy demands and over concerns about how it will affect people living nearby in Richland Parish.

The project, announced a year ago, will take up the space equivalent to about 70 football fields. Estimates are that the facility will draw twice the power that the city of New Orleans uses on a hot summer day.

Meta promises more than 5,000 construction jobs and 500 permanent jobs. The power plants will likely employ another 50 people.

Louisiana’s Public Service Commission voted to approve the project in August.

Marsh, a 27-year Entergy veteran, said the data center and its power plants are part of an industrial boom along the Gulf Coast — and particularly on the Interstate-20 corridor connecting Shreveport to Jackson, Mississippi — that has boosted the utility’s annual growth from 5% a year to about 13%.

“As we look out to 2050, we think we could triple or quadruple our sales,” he said. “There's just a lot going on out there.”

To meet the increased demand, Marsh said, Entergy will have to invest in a variety of power generation methods, including nuclear.

Marsh, who is chair of the Nuclear Energy Institute trade association, said the country needs to maintain its existing power plants and ease regulations so more can come online.

“Nuclear safety is something that is very important, but it has been overdone,"" he said. ""One-in-a-million years type standards on things could be very, very expensive and not really generate much incremental safety.”

The Energy Forum comes at a time of significant changes in the nation's energy policy, when the Trump Administration has moved away from clean energy initiatives and promoted increasing domestic fossil fuel production.

Marsh's remarks echoed others at the event, where the focus has shifted away from clean energy in favor of a more pragmatic approach. Marsh said Entergy is prioritizing affordability, reliability and resilience.

“Some of the areas that we serve are some of the most economically disadvantaged areas of the country,"" he said. ""And a lot of our large industrial customers are competing in a global commodity market, so if our prices were to go shooting upward, that could end their ability to compete in our service territory.”

""By and large, the world is not focused on sustainability. Less so today than it was two years ago, to be sure,"" he added. ""But it is something that is going to come back around. That's what we believe.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/9f/49f50347-dcc4-4292-8637-dc9fd2d08cd4/68c1ffbda774f.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-11 18:00:23.576341

How to build more wind energy, faster WindEurope welcomes the European Commission’s push to accelerate the build-out of home-grown, competitive wind energy.
To resolve that, National Governments need to remove the four main obstacles to new wind energy projects.","In her annual State of the Union address EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen highlighted the new geopolitical reality based on hard power. To keep its place in this new world order, Europe needs to take control of the energies and technologies which fuel its economy. Von der Leyen termed it “Europe’s independence moment”.

Amid this increasing geopolitical uncertainty, she doubled down on the urgent need to implement Europe’s Clean Industrial Deal. “This transformation is central to our push for independence”, von der Leyen said. She said international “dependencies are ruthlessly weaponised” and pledged to “get rid of dirty Russian fossil fuels completely”.

Von der Leyen’s steer was clear: to become less dependent on international developments, Europe’s economy must become more European. She pledged to “massively invest in digital and clean tech”. She repeated her determination to ramp up clean tech manufacturing in Europe and stressed that urgent action was needed to maintain Europe’s global clean tech leadership. And she committed to work on the completion of the EU Single Market via a new Roadmap to 2028.

“The EU Commission is clear: we need more home-grown wind energy. It boosts energy security. It means lower energy bills for consumers. It strengthens our industrial competitiveness. Europe’s wind industry and its 400,000 workers are ready to step up to the task”, says WindEurope CEO Giles Dickson.

Direct electrification and grids

The EU Commission President also reaffirmed her determination to strengthen the direct electrification of Europe’s economy, among other things with a new electric vehicle initiative and a Battery Booster Package.

But most crucially, Europe needs to invest in its grid infrastructure and interconnections. Electricity grids are the foundation for any electrification effort. The Commission President reminded a European Grids Package is on the way before the end of this year. And announced a new European Energy Highways initiative which will identify eight critical cross-border grid bottlenecks and bring together politicians and industry to resolve them.

Bringing electricity prices down for citizens and companies

Europe is facing a cost-of-living crisis – fuelled by spiralling costs for electricity and housing. “We know what brings electricity prices down”, von der Leyen insisted: “domestically produced clean tech.” She also stressed the critical role an accelerated deployment of renewables plays for Europe’s wider economic competitiveness. Competitive electricity prices are key to ensuring energy-intensive industries keep producing in Europe.

More demand for clean tech

To create more demand for domestically produced clean tech von der Leyen announced the introduction of a new “made in Europe” criterion in public procurement procedures as well as an Industrial Accelerator Act for key clean technologies.

How to build more wind energy, faster

WindEurope welcomes the European Commission’s push to accelerate the build-out of home-grown, competitive wind energy. But in the first half of 2025 the EU only built 5.3 GW of new wind, less than expected and not nearly enough to deliver the EU’s 2030 energy security and climate targets.

To resolve that, National Governments need to remove the four main obstacles to new wind energy projects. They must:

speed up permitting by ruthlessly implementing the excellent Renewable Energy Directive (REDIII);

optimise and expand Europe’s electricity grid and interconnections;

remove all barriers to direct electrification; and

de-risk wind energy auctions with a stable pipeline of two-sided Contracts for Difference (CfD) auctions.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ursula-von-der-leyen-speech-state-of-eu-union-2025.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 15:00:35.637335

U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Tanya Chutkan granted an injunction against the freeze in April, ruling that the EPA had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in attempting to revoke the funding, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a stay on that ruling soon after.

The plaintiffs named in the rehearing petition include the Climate United Fund, Coalition for Green Capital, Power Forward Communities and the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank. The petition argues that the panel’s opinion contradicts settled jurisprudence and misconstrues the plaintiffs’ constitutional claim.

The appeals court issued its 2-1 ruling upholding the freeze on Sept. 2, saying, “The district court erred in concluding the grantees are likely to succeed on their regulatory, arbitrary and capricious, and constitutional claims.”

The majority opinion aligns with the Trump administration’s arguments to freeze GGRF funding disbursed by the Inflation Reduction Act, citing public criticism about the “sheer scale of the grant program and the method of allocating billions of dollars,” and stating, “The month before President Trump’s inauguration, EPA modified the grant agreements — with no apparent consideration from the grantees — to make it more difficult for the government to terminate the grants.”

The opinion concludes that the dispute in this case is contractual, not constitutional, and should be heard in the Court of Federal Claims — thus Chutkan lacked the jurisdiction to rule on the issue.

“While the district court had jurisdiction over the grantees’ constitutional claim, that claim is meritless,” the opinion states. “Moreover, the equities strongly favor the government, which on behalf of the public must ensure the proper oversight and management of this multi-billion-dollar fund.”

The majority opinion was filed by two judges appointed by President Donald Trump, Judge Neomi Rao and Judge Gregory Katsas.

“The grantees insist the [Administrative Procedure Act] gives them an independent right to be free of arbitrary agency action, including contract terminations. But we have long rejected the idea that the APA’s general bar on arbitrary and capricious action subjects contract terminations to a parallel review scheme in district court,” Rao and Katsas wrote.

The EPA said in a release responding to the panel’s decision that it was “fantastic to see reason prevail in the court system ... The gold bar recipients were wrong about jurisdiction all along and wrong to act so entitled to these precious public funds that belong to hardworking American taxpayers.”

The “gold bar” language refers to a covert video recorded of a Biden administration EPA adviser having a conversation in a bar in which he likens the administration’s efforts to disburse funds before Trump’s inauguration to throwing gold bars off the edge of the Titanic. The adviser’s lawyer has said he was not referring to the GGRF in his comments.

The plaintiffs requested a rehearing en banc – meaning all judges of that particular court would have to hear the case.

The panel’s dissenting judge, Nina Pillard, was appointed by President Barack Obama. Of the court’s 15 judges, four are Obama appointees, three are Biden appointees, three are Trump appointees, one is an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, and four judges have senior status and would not vote on an en banc petition.

Pillard said in her dissent that the majority had “[embraced] a misguided and breathtakingly expansive conception of the Tucker Act,” a federal statute which gives the U.S. Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to hear certain claims against the U.S. government.

The plaintiffs cite this argument of Pillard’s in their petition, saying the panel “badly erred in concluding that the Tucker Act impliedly precludes jurisdiction and that Plaintiffs’ constitutional and statutory claims fail.”

Reactivate, American Farmland Trust, and Edelen Renewables Community Solar recently announced a new partnership: Farmers Powering Communities (FPC). The mission of Farmers Powering Communities is: “Bringing together those working to feed the planet with those working to power America.” The goal is to install 500 MW of community solar power in five years.

Community solar power has many benefits and it provides a flexible option for some people in the event homeowners can’t afford their own solar power systems or utilities are not going to develop their own solar power systems. Community solar power can also be used in rural and farming areas. (About 7 months ago, I conducted an interview with some insights about how solar power and energy storage can help Texas farmers.)

The team at Farmers Powering Communities answered some questions for CleanTechnica.

What is Reactivate and what is Farmers Powering Communities?

Reactivate, an Invenergy company, is a mission-driven organization that develops, owns, and operates renewable energy solutions designed to improve quality of life for communities across the country — with a focus on delivering meaningful benefits to working-class people. Reactivate’s portfolio includes community solar, commercial and industrial solar, small utility-scale solar, energy storage, and EV charging projects, all developed with an emphasis on supporting communities burdened by high energy costs. Guided by a vision in which everyone benefits from renewable energy, Reactivate delivers economic, social, and environmental advantages by helping residents and businesses reduce energy expenses, creating local jobs, driving economic growth, strengthening grid resilience.

Farmers Powering Communities is a newly formed partnership between American Farmland Trust, Reactivate, and Edelen Renewables Community Solar. FPC’s mission is to connect those working to feed the planet with those powering America, ensuring solar development is deployed to maximize benefits for farmers, ranchers, and rural communities. The partnership will focus on developing distributed generation projects that serve working-class communities, with project size guided by land characteristics and energy needs.

This new partnership builds on AFT’s growing national Smart Solar℠ network and will initially focus on regions where farmland preservation and clean energy demand are both urgent priorities.

Why is it important to bring community solar projects to American farmers and rural communities?

Across the country, many rural communities face high energy costs and limited access to affordable, reliable power. Reactivate helps close these gaps by delivering community solar projects that guarantee bill savings, support local economies, and enhance grid reliability. Community solar is a flexible energy solution that allows anyone with an electric bill to subscribe to locally generated solar power — offering consumers more choice, encouraging competition in the energy market, and strengthening the grid. These projects typically range up to 5 MW in size and occupy 10–30 acres, making them well-suited for rural settings. Community solar installations can be ground-mounted, co-located with existing crops, placed on rooftops, or built on otherwise unusable land. When sited on farmland, they are designed to preserve the land for future agricultural use — helping protect family farms while generating clean energy and economic value.

How can Farmers Powering Communities advance agrivoltaics?

FPC is unique among solar companies because it is rooted in American Farmland Trust’s Smart Solar℠ principles. Smart Solar℠ refers to solar projects that meet three main, equally important goals:

(1) safeguarding land well-suited for farming and ranching, (2) strengthening farm viability, and (3) accelerating solar energy development. Smart Solar promotes the use of agrivoltaics — the intentional combination of solar energy generation and agricultural production on the same piece of land — as a key strategy for accomplishing these goals.

FPC is committed to working with landowners to ensure that projects are designed and built in a manner that facilitates the continued production of agricultural products on land where projects are sited. Not as an afterthought, but as a priority from day one.

What are some examples of locally generated, accessible energy solutions?

Reactivate has a portfolio of community solar projects across Illinois and New York that completed construction in 2024. This example portfolio will help approximately 5,000 households along with area non-profits, businesses, and a public school district save a minimum of 20% on their monthly electricity costs. Approximately 90% of the subscriber households qualify as working-class. Total subscriber savings are projected to exceed $17 million dollars over the projects’ useful lives.

Do community solar projects create local jobs?

Yes, community solar projects create local jobs, especially during the construction and maintenance phases of the project development.

How can they generate tax revenue and drive economic growth in local communities?

Community solar projects contribute directly to local and state economies by generating tax revenue through multiple channels — including property taxes on the solar installation, sales taxes on equipment, and, in some states, production-based taxes tied to energy output. These funds strengthen local budgets and can be reinvested in essential public services such as schools, roads, and emergency services — offsetting costs and improving quality of life. Beyond tax revenue, Reactivate prioritizes working with local small businesses throughout project development, creating opportunities for contractors, suppliers, and service providers. Once operational, community solar helps residents save on their energy bills, increasing disposable income that can be spent locally — fueling small businesses and contributing to a more vibrant, resilient economy.

Can solar power help farmers stay on their family farms? If so, how?

Absolutely. Since 1981, the U.S. has lost over 559,000 farmers and ranchers, mostly small and mid-sized operations. Today, half of all farm families report negative farm income, and 90% earn most of their income off the farm. These numbers tell a sobering story, but they also point to a powerful opportunity.

By intentionally designing solar to benefit working farms while meeting America’s rapidly growing need for energy, we can create new revenue streams, reduce operational costs, and build resilience during these trying times. Solar leases offer long-term reliable income streams that can help create the economic conditions for farm families to not only stay on their land, but to invest in their operations and help the next generation plan for their future. This is not about replacing agriculture with solar. It’s about adding a revenue generation tool that can build long-term, generational farm viability. At American Farmland Trust, we talk to farmers every day who are harnessing these new opportunities made possible by solar.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Image-Sep-10-2025-08_43_34-AM-800x533.png,N,,2025-09-11 13:02:16.933954

While hydro power remained Brazil’s single largest source of electricity generation, at 48% in August, it was only the second month on record where hydro made up less than half of Brazil’s electricity. Total hydro generation fell to 27 TWh – the lowest value since August 2021 – as reduced rainfall worsened Brazil’s already low dry-season output.

Clean power meets fast-rising demand in Brazil

Brazil’s build-out of wind and solar power has been fast enough to meet and exceed growth in electricity demand over the last decade. This has reduced the need for additional fossil generation and prevented an increase in power sector emissions.

As reported in Ember’s Global Electricity Review 2025 earlier this year, Brazil’s emissions from electricity generation peaked in 2014 at 114 million tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2). Between 2014 and 2024, wind and solar increased fifteenfold, adding 168 TWh – enough to exceed demand growth. As a result, despite demand growing by 137 TWh (+22%) over the same period, fossil generation fell by 64 TWh (-45%). Consequently, power sector emissions declined by 31% to reach 79 MtCO2 in 2024.

Sustained clean power build-out can meet future demand

Brazil’s fast-rising demand presents both an opportunity and a challenge: the opportunity, meet this with cheap, clean sources like solar and wind; the challenge – ensure that policy and investment are aligned to support this.

Brazil’s demand growth has been above-average in the last two years, with 4.8% and 5.3% in 2023 and 2024 respectively, compared to an average of 2.0% in the previous decade. Demand growth is expected to continue in the coming years, with some estimates showing growth of 3.4% per year until 2030.

The continued build-out of clean power at pace can help avoid a rise in costly imports of coal and gas to meet rising power demand. However, solar capacity additions slowed in the first half of 2025 with 7.1 GW installed compared to 9.9 GW in the first half of 2024, as issues such as grid-connection queues and congestion, regulatory uncertainty and reduced incentives put downward pressure on the Brazilian solar market. Planned auctions for transmission lines and new rules on solar compensation aim at reducing the complexity and barriers for wind and solar deployment and could once more accelerate their build-out.",https://ember-energy.org/app/uploads/2025/09/1-55-Wind-mills-in-Brazil.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 14:01:31.537208

Consumers Energy plans to sell its 13 aging and unprofitable Michigan hydropower dams to a subsidiary of a Maryland private equity firm for a dollar apiece, in a deal that would ensure their continued existence for the next three decades.

Company officials announced Tuesday that Delaware-based Confluence Hydro LLC, which formed in June and registered to do business in Michigan in August, plans to sell the dams’ electricity back to Consumers at an unspecified price.

Consumers has been publicly pondering a sale of its 13 hydroelectric dams in the Au Sable, Manistee, Muskegon, Grand and Kalamazoo rivers for the past three years, seeking a way out of a hydropower business that generates paltry power at a $152 million net annual loss.

The company also considered keeping or demolishing the dams, but the sale emerged as “the most cost effective for customers,” said Sri Maddipati, Consumers’ president of electric supply.

Maddipati declined to offer specifics, saying more financial details will emerge as Consumers seeks federal and state approval for the proposed sale.

That process, including reviews by both the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Michigan Public Service Commission, could take up to 18 months. If both entities sign off, Consumers officials said a sale could close in late 2026 or early 2027.

Confluence is a subsidiary of Hull Street Energy, a Maryland-based private equity firm founded in 2014 that invests in natural gas plants, dams and other power generating infrastructure across the country.

Its stated mission is to “rebuild and modernize the North American hydroelectric fleet” to provide “safe, reliable power to the electric grid for generations to come.”

“We bring specialized expertise to modernizing hydro dams, many of which suffer from under investment and poor performance,” said Ed Quinn, the company’s chief executive officer, during a webinar announcing the deal.

After marketing the impoundments to potential buyers virtually for free, Consumers announced in June that it was in negotiations with an unnamed buyer.

Nearby residents and dam safety advocates have expressed concern about the possibility of a sale to a private owner, citing Michigan utilities’ long history of offloading old and unprofitable dams onto new owners who can’t afford to maintain them. Such arrangements have repeatedly shifted safety risks and financial costs onto the public.

Consumers officials sought to allay those concerns on Tuesday, calling safety “a top priority” in the sale.

“We have used this process to find a buyer who is similarly committed to safety,” said Jean Kang, Consumers’ vice president of generation operations.

After the privately-owned and poorly-maintained Midland dams failed in 2020, both federal and state officials considered reforms including stricter dam safety standards and more rigorous financial vetting of dam buyers. They have acted on almost none of them.

News of the plan to keep the dams intact drew cheers from nearby residents, who had feared that Consumers would demolish the dams and drain impoundments that have become valuable recreational lakes.

“We think this is good news,” said Coco Soodek, president of the association representing residents on Lake Allegan, a reservoir impounded by Consumers’ Calkins Bridge Dam in the Kalamazoo River.

But the plan drew suspicion from dam safety and fish advocates who see demolition as a better option.

“This can keeps getting kicked down the road,” said Bob Stuber, executive director of the Michigan Hydro Relicensing Coalition. “These dams are aging infrastructure, and sooner or later, they’ve got to be dealt with.”

While they agree on little else, both Soodek and Stuber said they worry about a private equity firm owning such important pieces of infrastructure.

While Soodek said she has heard good things about the prospective new owners, “I haven’t seen evidence that care for the community and private equity profit motives coexist consistently.”

Why the sale?

Built about a century ago before the era of large power plants and solar farms, the dams now produce just 1% of Consumers’ electricity, at nine times the cost of the company’s next-most-expensive power source.

Against that bad financial math, Consumers has spent recent decades whittling down its dam inventory from more than 90 to just 13 today.

The remaining dams are Michigan’s largest, plugging up rivers to produce artificial lakes that have become prized fixtures on the landscape. People have built homes along the shore, and communities have built tourism economies around boating, swimming and fishing in the reservoirs.

Recreation at the impoundments creates 1,420 direct jobs and $140 million in gross domestic product, according to a survey from Public Sector Consultants, and the reservoirs raise nearby property values by a combined $130 million.

But the dams also superheat and fragment rivers while trapping sediment in the reservoirs, harming migratory and coldwater fish like sturgeon, trout and salmon. Advocates of free-flowing rivers argue that removing the dams would also support tourism and recreation.

Consumers officials have previously estimated that demolishing them would save $781 million compared to keeping them operational under Consumers’ ownership. While they said Tuesday that a sale would present an even better deal for customers, they declined to offer details.

Dear Administrator Zeldin:

We write to express our serious concerns regarding the adequacy of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) oversight of underground injection control (UIC) wells used for carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Recent events, including the substantial well failures at the Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) Class VI injection well facility in Decatur, Illinois, and a pattern of well failures and non-compliance at Class II injection wells in Texas, demonstrate regulatory gaps that threaten underground sources of drinking water and warrant immediate EPA action. The events highlight systemic issues with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology and its regulation, raising serious concerns about the safety and viability of CCS.

On August 13, 2025, EPA issued an Administrative Order on Consent to Archer Daniels Midland for these violations, confirming that injected CO2 and brine migrated into an unauthorized underground formation. While the order acknowledges breaches of core safeguards, it imposes no penalties, does not suspend ADM’s permit, and leaves in place the weak rules that allowed this incident to occur. This underscores the urgent need for EPA to strengthen its Class VI oversight, update regulations, and halt additional injections until it can ensure such leaks will not endanger drinking water.

ADM Decatur Leak and Abandoned-Well Failures

In March 2024, ADM identified a subsurface CO2 leak from its Illinois Class VI injection well facility caused by corrosion at a monitoring well.This followed years of monitoring equipment failures, dating back to 2020. In October 2024, ADM reported a second subsurface leak connected to another monitoring well. Concerns have been raised that other existing wells in the vicinity of the well failures could serve as vectors for the migration of CO2 into Lake Decatur, the primary source of drinking water for 80,000 people in central Illinois.

EPA notified injection well applicants in June 2024 that steel commonly used by the industry is prone to corrosion in the presence of CO2, but did not take steps to notify the public about the leak and threats to drinking water sources. It was ultimately media reports that made the public aware of these concerns, which surfaced five months after the leak was disclosed and two months after EPA notified pending permit applicants.

Broader Texas Class II Noncompliance

Following the public reporting regarding the ADM facility, EPA was made aware of well failures throughout Texas in an October 2024 letter highlighting:

a sudden increase in significant non-compliance violations starting in 2011;

and a higher percentage of Class II CO2 injection wells failing one or more mechanical integrity tests relative to other Class II wells.

Class II wells make up thousands of potential injection sites across the country used to extract oil by injecting CO2 deep into these formations. The practice of injecting CO2 into these wells carries many of the same risks associated with Class VI wells used for CCS; however, the regulations governing Class II wells are less stringent, posing an even greater risk of leaks.

Staffing and Programmatic Cuts at EPA

The Republican congressional leadership is moving forward with plans to cut EPA’s budget by 23%, on top of 3,700 staff who are no longer working at EPA since January of this year. These cuts raise grave concerns about EPA’s ability to comply with its mandate to protect human health and the environment. These cuts, moreover, compound specific concerns we have regarding EPA’s ability to effectively provide oversight and accountability for the UIC program, including ensuring compliance by states that have primacy over Class VI and Class II injection wells.

Concerns with Well Blowouts

Due to changes in the tax code under the recent budget bill, which increased subsidies for the use of CO2 for oil extraction, there are significant concerns with the potential impacts of CO2 well blowouts, uncontrolled releases of CO2 from Class II and Class VI wells, particularly in areas with a long history of oil drilling. Just as with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (3.19 million barrels over 87 days) and the Aliso Canyon methane blowout (109,000 metric tons from October 2015 to February 2016), CO2 wells can catastrophically fail.

CO2 blowouts pose particular risks due to the rapid expansion of supercritical CO2 that would occur during a blowout, as well as the extreme temperatures and pressures present in CO2 wells. Given the thousands of legacy oil and gas wells, especially along the Gulf Coast, we are concerned that a major CO2 blowout, with uncontrolled releases far from an injection site, could threaten the safety of nearby communities if the blowout reaches the surface.

Moratorium on CO2 Injections

We urge EPA to exercise its broad authority to protect sources of drinking water from “imminent and substantial endangerment” under the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. §300i) by:

halting approval of Class II and Class VI wells;

halting approval of primacy applications;

directing existing injection well operators to cease injections;

directing states with primacy to ensure compliance with this EPA objective; and

keeping these restrictions in place until such time that EPA is able to:

ensure that CO2 is not leaking from wells;

update regulations to ensure that the integrity of injection well operations is sufficient to protect drinking water sources; and

ensure adequate staffing to provide direct oversight of injection wells to ensure protection of drinking water sources.

We also ask that you respond to the following questions by November 1 in order to allow Congress to provide resources to EPA in the Fiscal Year 2026 appropriations legislation to ensure adequate protection for drinking water sources from the injection of CO2:

How has EPA changed permitting of Class II and Class VI wells in light of the deficiencies discovered at the ADM facility?

How has EPA revised its permit-review protocols and state primacy-application evaluations to prevent similar oversights in states with extensive oil-and-gas histories, including Texas, Louisiana, West Virginia, and Alaska?

How was a permit issued to ADM without accurate subsurface mapping, and what steps has EPA taken to require comprehensive historical-well surveys prior to permit approvals?

Given that steel used in existing wells is prone to corrosion, what steps has EPA taken to ensure that well equipment at existing Class II and Class VI wells is not corroding and posing a threat to drinking water?

What steps has EPA taken to ensure that injection well operators are not using steel that is prone to corrosion in CO2 injection wells?

Given that standard monitoring equipment was unable to detect a second leak at the ADM injection site, how has EPA changed monitoring protocols to ensure detection of future leaks?

Is EPA aware of other leaks or well failures at Class II or Class VI wells?

Why did EPA fail to notify the public about the leak, even while it notified the industry of issues with corrosion of steel in injection wells?

What steps has EPA taken to ensure that states with primacy over Class II and Class VI wells are updating monitoring, oversight, and permitting in light of revelations from the Texas and ADM well failures?

To what extent are staff positions responsible for the monitoring, reporting, and verification of CO2 injection wells no longer filled at EPA headquarters and regional offices?

Can you provide an assessment of staffing changes within EPA’s UIC and SDWA enforcement offices over the past five years?

Can you provide an evaluation of how resource constraints have affected permit reviews, inspections, and enforcement actions at EPA in general and for the UIC program specifically?

What analyses or modeling has EPA conducted or is planning to conduct to quantify the likelihood and potential consequences of CO2 well blowouts in various environments?

What steps does EPA take to ensure that if a catastrophic blowout were to occur, well operators would be able quickly to identify and plug the well and prevent drinking water contamination?

We stand ready to work with EPA to safeguard our drinking water and public health. The ADM order makes clear that current safeguards are insufficient to prevent dangerous CO2 migration, even under direct EPA oversight. Without stronger rules, robust enforcement, and adequate staffing, approving or operating additional Class II and Class VI wells risks repeating these failures and putting drinking water supplies at grave risk.

We request a written response to each of the points above and look forward to your prompt engagement on this urgent matter. Please have your staff contact Nikki Roy (nikki.roy@mail.house.gov) on Rep. Casten’s staff with questions.

Sincerely,

,Clean Energy ,2025-09-11 15:04:04+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Down to the wire: California lawmakers announce last-minute climate and energy package,"Hayley Smith, www.latimes.com, hayley-smith",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-09-11/down-to-the-wire-california-lawmakers-announce-last-minute-climate-and-energy-deal,"After months of negotiation, California legislative leaders on Wednesday reached an eleventh-hour agreement on a suite of closely watched climate and energy bills.
Among the most prominent items is the extension of California’s nation-leading cap-and-trade program beyond its 2030 expiration date to 2045.
“It leaves billions of dollars on the table that could have supported climate solutions and addressed the state’s affordability challenges.
“It’s just going to be disastrous for California,” said Loretta Lynch, former president of the California Public Utilities Commission.
However, some advocacy groups were upset by what wasn’t included in the package — including “fixes” to the state’s overhaul of the California Environmental Quality Act.","After months of negotiation, California legislative leaders on Wednesday reached an eleventh-hour agreement on a suite of closely watched climate and energy bills.

Gov. Gavin Newsom, state Senate President Pro Tempore Mike McGuire (D-Healdsburg) and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas (D-Hollister) announced the deal just days before the the legislative session ends on Friday. It includes reauthorization of California’s signature cap-and-trade program and the expansion of a regional electricity market, among other items.

“After months of hard work with the Legislature, we have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution — all while fast-tracking California’s transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,” Newsom said in a statement.

There were wins and losses for energy and environmental groups in the package, which is expected to pass by the end of the week before moving to Newsom’s desk for his signature.

Among the most prominent items is the extension of California’s nation-leading cap-and-trade program beyond its 2030 expiration date to 2045. The program sets limits on greenhouse gas emissions and allows large polluters to buy and sell unused emission allowances at quarterly auctions.

Cap-and-trade is seen as crucial for California to comply with its climate goals — including reaching carbon neutrality by 2045 — and also brings in billions in revenue that helps fund state climate efforts such as the high-speed rail and safe drinking water programs. Newsom for months had been pushing for the program to be reauthorized largely in its current form, while environmental groups were hoping to see changes in how the program is run and where the money is spent.

Revised language released Wednesday, including Senate Bill 840 and Assembly Bill 1207, includes some but not all of the changes they had hoped for, such as prioritized funding for nature-based climate solutions and a proposal to provide direct consumer rebates from the California Climate Mitigation Fund to help address affordability concerns.

“By aligning the future of cap-and-trade with the timeline of California’s ambitious emission reduction targets, California is positioned to achieve its climate goals in the most cost-effective way possible,” said Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California state director with the nonprofit Environmental Defend, who urged lawmakers to pass the bill.

But there are also “missed opportunities,” according to the nonprofit group the Climate Center, including the preservation of free allowances for the oil and gas industry — permits to pollute so that businesses are not at a disadvantage against competitors in other states.

“Overall, this proposal is better than a straight reauthorization of the cap-and-trade program, but not by much,” said Ryan Schleeter, the Climate Center’s communications director. “It leaves billions of dollars on the table that could have supported climate solutions and addressed the state’s affordability challenges. California has a lot more work to do to shift the financial burden of the climate crisis from taxpayers to the wealthy, polluting corporations responsible.”

Also included in the package was AB 825, which creates a pathway for California to participate in a regional electricity market. If passed, the bill would expand partnership with other Western states to buy and sell more clean power in a move supporters say will improve grid reliability and save money for ratepayers.

“This historic agreement puts California on a pathway with Western states to provide cleaner, cheaper, more reliable energy,” Rivas said in a statement. “It’s a landmark affordability agreement that will amount to billions of dollars in savings for Californians.”

Some supporters have argued that improved collaboration across the West will help accelerate climate progress, while opponents fear that California would yield control of its power grid to out-of-state authorities, including the federal government.

“It’s just going to be disastrous for California,” said Loretta Lynch, former president of the California Public Utilities Commission. Among other concerns, Lynch said the bill would eliminate all statutory requirements that the California Independent System Operator, run its electricity market consistent with the state’s public health and environmental laws, and would weaken the state’s ability to withdraw from the regional plan if problems arise.

Other groups said the language released Wednesday addresses many concerns and helps protect California’s interests.

“This proposal clears the way to stand up energy markets that can save Californians real money,” Alex Jackson, director of the nonprofit American Clean Power California, said in a statement. “It means we can work with our neighbors to ensure the West has the affordable, reliable, clean power needed to meet surging demand.”

Also included in Wednesday’s package was SB 352, which would establish an air pollution monitoring program in some of the state’s most heavily polluted communities, and SB 254, which would replenish the state’s wildfire liability fund to help cover wildfire damage and finance mitigation efforts, among other items.

“This bold legislative package will deliver for every corner of the Golden State on energy affordability and wildfire prevention, expand clean drinking water to tens of thousands and it also cements historic agreements on California’s signature climate policies,” McGuire said in a statement.

However, some advocacy groups were upset by what wasn’t included in the package — including “fixes” to the state’s overhaul of the California Environmental Quality Act. That overhaul eases new construction in the state. Meanwhile, another bill supported by many environmental groups that would have created a Climate Superfund to hold fossil fuel companies liable for damage caused by their emissions was pushed to next year.

Perhaps most controversial in the package is SB 237, a bill that could help increase the state’s oil production in what lawmakers say is an effort to stabilize the market and gird against future gasoline price spikes. It follows major announcements this year from the oil companies Phillips 66 and Valero that they were shutting down two big refineries in the state.

In something of a compromise, the bill would streamline environmental approvals for new oil wells in Kern County but make it more difficult for companies to get approval to drill off the coast.

In a statement, the activist group Campaign for a Safe and Healthy California expressed concern about the legislation, which it said was “crammed in the Legislature’s last 72 hours,” and urged lawmakers to reject the proposal.

“The transition from oil is well underway in California and across the world, with refineries closing from Texas to Los Angeles,” the statement said. “But in California, Big Oil is using the threat of refinery closures as a bargaining chip to pressure lawmakers into approving more drilling.”

The governor’s office told The Times that Newsom “looks forward” to signing the legislation when it reaches his desk.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3746446/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb5%2Fdd%2Fd36f14f04a6fade3df421bc85fa9%2F1493656-me-colosseum-mine-16-mjc.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 12:01:43.966276
,Indiana and Evs,2025-09-11 15:01:59+00:00,Chicago Tribune,Transportation plan casts wide net for zero emissions in Chicago region,Doug Ross,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/09/11/transportation-plan-casts-wide-net-for-zero-emissions-in-chicago-region/,"A comprehensive climate action plan to achieve net-zero emissions covering 13 counties in the Chicago area is nearing completion.
The goal is to reduce gross greenhouse gas emissions by 80% to 85% by 2050 within the greater Chicago area.
2050 isn’t far away, but already the region has made progress toward that goal, Luther said.
Among the surprises Luther offered Tuesday was that passenger vehicles are the largest source of transportation emissions, ahead of freight vehicles.
For the transportation sector, the residual emissions are primarily from off-road vehicles if the plan is successful, she said.","A comprehensive climate action plan to achieve net-zero emissions covering 13 counties in the Chicago area is nearing completion. The plan covers the area from Kenosha County in Wisconsin to LaPorte County.

The Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus and the Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission are working together to complete the plan before the Dec. 1 deadline.

Kathy Luther, director of environmental programs at NIRPC, briefed the agency’s Transportation Committee about progress on the plan Tuesday.

The goal is to reduce gross greenhouse gas emissions by 80% to 85% by 2050 within the greater Chicago area. Carbon sequestration is factored in when calculating net emissions.

2050 isn’t far away, but already the region has made progress toward that goal, Luther said.

In 2020, emissions were at 192.92 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, but within five years they had dropped to 154.29.

Of the 152 million metric tons emitted in the 13-county region, Indiana’s Lake, Porter and LaPorte counties account for 54.5 million metric tons, or about 35.8%, Luther said.

Transportation accounts for 26% of those emissions, with industry at 36% and buildings at 35%. Agriculture, wastewater treatment and waste management account for another 3%.

Hitting the reduction goal by 2050 means cutting emissions by another 65%, Luther said.

For the transportation sector, hitting that goal means accelerating the move toward electric vehicles, increasing fuel efficiency and adopting low-carbon fuels, reducing travel demand, increasing traffic flows, increasing transit ridership and increasing use of bicycles and other means of active transportation.

That’s easier said than done, especially given the current political climate in the Trump administration, which is seeing Biden-era policies being rolled back or reversed.

Luther said assuming the current federal policies remain in place, emissions would be reduced by 36%. With state and local actions to reduce emissions, the reduction would be 61%. Implementing every aspect of the plan now being developed would see emissions drop enough to hit the goal of an 85% reduction.

Increasing the number of electric vehicles isn’t just limited to replacing internal combustion engines on passenger cars, pickups and SUVs. It also means electrification of off-road vehicles, marine vessels and locomotives.

For commuter trains, electrification began decades ago as a way to reduce pollution in Chicago. But carrying freight requires a lot more power than carrying riders. That’s going to be a challenge for railroads.

And for off-road vehicles and marine vessels, access to recharging stations can be an issue.

California is taking aggressive steps to reduce emissions, including requiring all new light-duty vehicles sold to be either electric vehicles or plug-in hybrids by 2035. That’s driving manufacturers to meet those standards not just for vehicles intended for sale in California but also nationwide.

California is also requiring new lawn and landscaping equipment and off-road vehicles to be zero-emission by 2035.

In Illinois, the CTA plans to switch to electric buses, starting with all new buses purchased in 2026 and completing the conversion by 2040.

An Illinois law also requires 100% of school bus fleets to be electric by 2035, beginning with buses purchased in 2028 and beyond.

Chicago plans for all municipal fleets to be electric by 2035.

Among the surprises Luther offered Tuesday was that passenger vehicles are the largest source of transportation emissions, ahead of freight vehicles. The latter, while significant, is also harder to decarbonize.

Reaching all-electric for new vehicles by 2035 is critical to meeting the 2050 goal, Luther said.

For the transportation sector, the residual emissions are primarily from off-road vehicles if the plan is successful, she said.

Achieving these goals won’t be cheap.

For Gary Public Transportation Co., a large infusion of local cash would be needed to convert the fleet to electric, Planning, Marketing and Grants Planner David Wright said. Assuming prices come back down, an electric bus could cost $900,000.

Additional charging stations, including at the Lake County Government Center, would also be necessary to keep the buses running, he said.

Luther hopes to have a draft of the comprehensive climate action plan ready by late October.

He presses the record button.

Broad-shouldered, quick with riffs and smiling with easy charm, Little is an online streamer. He documents his life in New Jersey and posts the videos online. Playing kickball, dancing in the street, hanging out with friends. He ends his captions with hashtags such as #contentking, #god1st and #hardwork.

His video for the day on July 17: his graduation.

He spent seven weeks this summer in a training program for formerly incarcerated people, learning how to install solar panels to help them reenter the workforce.

“I feel accomplished. Feeling blessed. Feeling stronger than ever,” said Kavone, who served 16 months before his release in 2024.

Kavone is one of 11 men who completed the program hosted by the nonprofit New Jersey Reentry Corporation (NJRC). A team from Hudson County Community College (HCCC) and solar developer Solar One led the course, which included solar installation, construction basics and work readiness and safety—each module providing them a certification.

In total, NJRC has trained over 500 people for various skills, including welding, construction, cooking, solar panel installations and even sales. Trainees are enrolled for free on a first-come, first-served basis. All they need to do is show up.

“With every program we try to base it on a couple things. A, is this an in-demand occupation that we could see being sustainable for the foreseeable future? And B, do we have the interest? We saw that there were a lot of individuals that were interested in solar training,” said Michael Hayek, the facility director of NJRC’s Kearny headquarters.

The program is a springboard to get “reintegrated right” and to bring back “structure” to the lives of former inmates, said Albert Williams, a coordinator with HCCC.

“It’s not just important for me,” said Kavone. “This is important for most men who are trying to have a second chance in life. It gives us the ability to have these skills to go into the world and feel confident about what we know and what we believe in and where we want to go for the rest of our lives.”

Kavone hoped to earn money from solar panel installations to start his dream of opening his own business: an ice cream shop in his hometown of Paterson in the northern edge of New Jersey. It’s a bet he placed on renewable energy.

“If you’re looking, they’re trying to change everything into solar. They want everything to be run by solar,” Kavone said.

Kavone’s observation is not unfounded.

Despite being the fifth-smallest state in land area, New Jersey ranks eleventh among all states in solar power capacity, according Solar Energy Industries Association data. For the past nine years, the state has seen an average of about 17,000 residential annual rooftop solar panel installations, according to data from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU). Solar panel installers like Kavone are contracted to complete those installations.

But President Donald Trump sees a different future for energy in America, where the federal government holds oil and gas in full embrace as it walks away from renewable energy commitments made by the Biden administration.

Trump removed the industry-shaping tax credits meant to encourage the construction of more renewable energy projects across the country, a credit that helped developers fund about a third of each of their projects. Then, in early August, a couple of weeks after Kavone graduated, President Trump canceled the Biden-era Solar For All incentive program, which sought to award $7 billion to states to subsidize solar panel installations in low-income communities—the same communities Kavone hoped to serve with his new certification.

“No doubt, this withdrawal of funds and the clean energy ban coming from the Trump administration is going to be a major setback. It’s going to increase energy prices. It’s going to increase air pollution. It’s going to kill New Jersey jobs,” said Ed Potosnak, executive director of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters.

The federal government allotted $156 million to New Jersey through the BPU. The Garden State also stood to benefit from one multistate and one national grant worth about $500 million combined. The BPU planned to use the money for residential and community solar projects as well as for training people to work in the renewable energy industry.

“These projects are now in jeopardy, and NJBPU is currently reviewing its options,” the NJBPU said in a statement.

The BPU estimated that, in New Jersey, about 22,000 low-income households could have saved $400 annually on energy bills with solar panels that would have cut about 240,000 tons of carbon emissions.

These policy earthquakes emanating from Washington have left solar companies in “an air of gloom,” said Lyle Rawlings, president of Advanced Solar Products, which built large-scale projects from Virginia to Maine and as far west as Ohio.

“Companies like mine and the others that we’ve been meeting regularly are reeling from all of this and wondering how we can maintain our current staffing, let alone hire these new people who are being trained,” said Rawlings.

With the tax incentives for residential solar ending by January 2026 and commercial and larger-scale solar projects ending by July 2026, Rawlings said he’s seeing a rush to build to qualify for these incentives, which require companies to show they’ve at least started construction by the deadlines.

After which, Rawlings said, is a cliff.

With the incentives gone, fewer people will want to install panels on top of their homes and companies now have fewer projects that they could fund without federal dollars.

But the impact of these solar incentive clawbacks will vary from state to state, said Joe Henri, a senior vice president at Dimension, a leading community solar developer. Henri said New Jersey is “in better shape than many places” because of the state’s incentive programs.

“Meanwhile, states like California that pegged their community solar plans to federal dollars are falling behind. More governors should follow New Jersey’s lead and create strong state programs that lower bills and create good local jobs,” Henri said.

New Jersey prides itself for maintaining a diverse set of incentive programs for solar. Under its community solar program—now a permanent fixture after a successful three-year pilot—New Jersey has committed to adding 3,000 megawatts of new community solar capacity by 2029. One megawatt can power roughly 150 homes in the Northeast for a year, depending on energy use.

There is also the Administratively Determined Incentive or ADI, which gives solar projects a steady, guaranteed payment for the power they make and the Competitive Solicitation Incentive or CSI, where bigger projects compete for state support, with the most cost-effective proposals winning the incentives.

To fill the void left by the federal government, the state would need to expand these, said Potosnak, of the League of Conservation Voters. But he also recognized that it would be a hard sell to advocate for transferring dollars into these programs, given that the Trump administration has also cut funding for housing, healthcare and food assistance.

“So if you backfill one thing, then something else is on the chopping block,” said Potosnak.

Just in the latest budget deliberations, New Jersey diverted $190 million from its climate investment funds in response to a budget shortfall and competing demands for state spending. It is the largest climate fund diversion under the administration of Gov. Phil Murphy.

Will the state step up more for renewables? It will depend on the governor it elects in November. Competing for the seat are U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman and gubernatorial candidate. Sherrill wants to continue the incentive programs, while Ciattarelli has repeatedly condemned them as “radical.”

Three weeks after completing the solar installation training program, Kavone has yet to install a single panel.

“From what I understand, it’s tough right now,” said Kavone.

He has applied for 12 solar companies. None of them have gotten back to him. Kavone is worried that companies might be hesitant to hire him because he was formerly incarcerated.

People with incarceration histories face far higher unemployment than the general population. A 2018 report from the Prison Policy Institute showed that, on average, about a quarter of formerly incarcerated people are unemployed, a rate higher than the total U.S. unemployment rate during any period in history, including the Great Depression.

Thanks to hydrogen power, “they’re able to be more productive [and] run longer.","For Andy Marsh — and for Plug Power [PLUG] — the secret to success is experience. “We didn’t enter hydrogen yesterday. We’ve been doing it for 25 years.”

Headquartered in Slingerlands, New York, Plug Power develops products used to liquefy, store, transport and dispense hydrogen, including electrolyzers to produce green hydrogen.

The goal is to make hydrogen “economical, easy and everywhere”.

Marsh himself got his start as a Technical Director at Bell Labs, a premier research facility. In 2001, he co-founded Valere Power, a power solutions company for the communications industry, and served as its CEO for seven years. In 2008, he was appointed CEO of Plug Power, and has driven the company’s transformation from a hydrogen fuel cell manufacturer to a full-spectrum hydrogen solutions provider.

Navigating a Difficult Market

Even as legislators seem to be turning their back on green energy, how is Plug maintaining its momentum? To Marsh, it’s a matter of value.

“In many cases, you have to be more than just green.”

He provides the example of forklifts powered by Plug products. Thanks to hydrogen power, “they’re able to be more productive [and] run longer. They fuel faster, you need less labor, so the value proposition isn’t just sustainability.”

Consistency is another key factor. “Making things that work and run every day, that’s what Plug does. And that really differentiates us.”

While solar and wind have become prominent targets of the Trump administration, hydrogen has fared better. In June, the US Senate extended 45V hydrogen tax credit eligibility through to the end of 2027. “The recent bill passed in the United States, from a fuel cell point of view, was much more beneficial than the Inflation Reduction Act. Our fuel cells have a tax credit of over 30% through 2032.”

In January, the company closed a loan worth $1.66bn from the Department of Energy, helping to finance the construction of six zero- or low-carbon hydrogen projects in the US.

So far, Plug’s work with the Department of Energy has been positive: “it’s a business environment and it’s transactional. And we’re working to make sure the transaction’s good for the US and good for Plug.”

Attracting top talent is another important element in staying ahead of the curve in a highly competitive sector. Marsh attributes their edge to an accepting culture: “we fundamentally believe everybody adds value … it’s important to the leadership team at Plug, and to the board, that employees like coming here every day.”

Funding Net Zero

As Marsh explains, there are two key drivers for demand for hydrogen, and especially green hydrogen.

The first — sustainability targets set by countries — depends on extra measures such as subsidies to make early-deployment technologies commercially competitive.

The second — industrial processes — has created demand for hydrogen in unexpected places, such as oil refining. By installing electrolyzers, oil refineries are able to generate green hydrogen to power operations, replacing the grey hydrogen usually produced from burning natural gas, and reducing the refinery’s carbon footprint. In September 2024, for example, the company partnered with bp [BP] and Iberdrola [IBDRY] to supply 25MW of electrolyzers for their joint refinery project in Valencia, Spain.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production is another driver of hydrogen demand. In October 2023, Plug provided a 280MW electrolyzer system to Danish firm Arcadia eFuels for its SAF plant, with the capacity to produce 120 tons of green hydrogen per day.

Such ongoing projects have helped Plug improve its financials.

In Q2 2025, the company reported a 21% year-over-year increase in revenue, driven by a three-fold increase in electrolyzer revenue. The company’s gross margin also improved from -92% the previous year to -31% in Q2 2025, due in part to reduced costs and improved hydrogen pricing.

Marsh expects the company to reach gross margin breakeven by the end of the year, and potentially to be EBITDA positive by the end of 2026. He outlines three approaches the company is deploying to get there.

First, the company has to reach “about $200m revenue in a quarter”.

Second, it has to lower costs.

Third, it has to expand its service business to maintain longer-term revenue streams.

Ultimately, the area where Marsh foresees the most benefit in cutting costs is not through high-tech, artificial intelligence-driven productivity. Rather, it comes down to something as simple as construction expenses. “If you take a look at the cost of building a hydrogen plant,” Marsh explains, “probably 60%, 65 % of it is construction costs.”

Modular design is likely to help alleviate some of this financial burden, Marsh says. “This is no different than how people may be thinking about how you build homes in the future. We have to design our products so that they can just be dropped in place. There’s very, very little construction next to interconnects happening.”

The benefits of such a system are manifold. “It accelerates the time to market. It makes costs dramatically lower. It makes it possible that hydrogen can compete with other energy sources immediately.”",https://assets.cmcmarkets.com/images/Andy_Marsh_plug_power_medium.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 12:02:02.136729
,North Carolina Clean Energy,2025-09-11 14:35:35+00:00,Daily Nonpareil,Iowa utilities must 'rapidly' make use of renewable credits to reach emissions goals,"iowa capital dispatch, Iowa Environmental Council",,,,,https://nonpareilonline.com/news/state-regional/business/article_99487bc2-2141-4412-9f6c-f3a2ea19e6c0.html,"The share of wind generation has steadily increased in Iowa since the early 2000s and has trumped coal generation in the state since 2019.
In 2024, wind energy accounted for 66% of the state’s total electricity generation.
According to the report, in 2024 Iowa had the largest share of generation from renewable sources of any state.
“So wind and solar in 2024 actually represented 67% of our generation,” Guyer said.
This massive spending bill created tax credits to incentivize many types of renewable energy investments, including solar and wind energy projects, through 2032.","Iowa utilities still have a “long way to go” to meet a 2035 net zero emissions goal, especially as changes at the federal level have accelerated the timelines for key wind and solar tax credits, according to the 2025 Iowa Electric Generation Condition of the State report.

The annual report from Iowa Environmental Council said in order to meet this net zero goal, utilities not only have to transition away from coal but also continue to meet demand, which is projected to increase by 30%-60% over the next 20 years.

The net zero goal is consistent with federal goals from 2021 that directed the energy sector to achieve net zero emissions, or emissions that are equal to the amount of greenhouse gases that are removed from the atmosphere, by 2035.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change similarly found in 2022 that global greenhouse gas emissions must reach net zero by 2050 in order to avoid the greatest impacts of climate change, including limiting global temperature increases.

Steve Guyer, IEC’s energy policy counsel, said in a webinar Wednesday about the report that climate change costs Iowa businesses, families, governments and taxpayers billions of dollars each year.

“I want us to keep in mind that energy, the environment and the economy are actually inextricably linked,” Guyer said.

Guyer, and the report, said coal generation which has the greatest greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector, not only “drives climate change” but also has negative effects on public health, creates air pollution, can cause premature death and can even impact corn yields.

“Air pollution does not discriminate,” Guyer said. “Everybody has to suffer, and is burdened by, basically, this impact – not only financially, but otherwise.”

Coal down, wind and solar up

In Iowa, the share of coal-based electric generation has declined consistently since 2010, according to the report. From 2021 to 2024, fossil fuel generation decreased by 9% in the state.

The share of wind generation has steadily increased in Iowa since the early 2000s and has trumped coal generation in the state since 2019. In 2024, wind energy accounted for 66% of the state’s total electricity generation.

Solar increased in 2024 to represent 1% of the share of electricity generation. According to the report, in 2024 Iowa had the largest share of generation from renewable sources of any state.

“So wind and solar in 2024 actually represented 67% of our generation,” Guyer said. “That places us certainly ahead of any other state as far as the percent of generation from renewables. It also means that we are uniquely positioned to actually achieve 100% carbon free by 2035.”

Geoff Greenwood, the media relations manager for one of Iowa’s main utilities, MidAmerican Energy, said Iowa’s status as a leader in clean energy is “in large part because of MidAmerican Energy’s clean energy leadership.”

Wind makes up the majority, or 64%, of MidAmerica’s energy mix. Greenwood said in an email that since 2004, the company has invested in more than 7,600 megawatts of wind and 141 MW of solar, and has plans to invest in hundreds more by 2028. According to the company’s website, it delivered “the equivalent of 100% carbon-free energy” to Iowa customers in 2024.

“The environmental benefits of renewable generation are not diminished by the timing of its production—each and every megawatt of clean energy MidAmerican generates contributes to overall emissions reductions and supports our customers’ sustainability goals and Iowa’s leadership in clean energy,” Greenwood said. “MidAmerican has made, and continues to make, significant, measurable progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and leading Iowa’s electric sector in decarbonization efforts.”

The report points out that despite the significant share of wind and solar generation in the state and commitments from MidAmerican and Alliant Energy, to achieve net zero emissions, Iowa has six operational fossil-fuel power plants.

According to the report these plants emitted more than 14 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2024, along with several thousand tons of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.

Power plants represent about 16% of Iowa’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to the most recent greenhouse gas inventory report from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. The report shows that agriculture at 29% accounts for the largest share of emissions in the state, closely followed by residential, commercial and industrial fossil fuel use.

Greenwood said MidAmerican has already retired “several coal units” and “will continue to retire the remaining coal units by 2049.” He noted the existing plants are in compliance with federal and state regulations.

Coal generation in Iowa is nearly 52% lower in 2024 than it was in 2005, and carbon emissions have decreased by 47% in the same time, according to Greenwood.

“The Council’s report itself acknowledges that the electric sector is the only sector in Iowa that has made meaningful progress in reducing GHG emissions,” Greenwood said. “MidAmerican is proud to be a key contributor to that progress.”

A spokesperson for Alliant Energy said in an email the company is implementing a strategic plan to “create a more sustainable future for our customers and communities.”

Alliant plans to, by 2030, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from utility operations to 50% of 2005 levels, and to eliminate all coal from generation by 2040.

According to the spokesperson, the company reduced its 2005 emission levels by 39% in 2024.

“We will continue to review and update our Energy Vision, based on future economic developments, evolving energy technologies and emerging trends in the communities we serve,” the spokesperson said in an email. “Our goals remain the same, however, increasing customer energy needs, reliability and resource adequacy requirements and tax policy changes may result in delays in achieving, or revisions to, our goals.”

‘Staggering’ increases in energy needs projected

Guyer said energy demand is increasing rapidly, in part due to the implementation of data centers.

According to the report, which analyzed modeling projections from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO power pool, Iowa has a projected load growth of between 30% and 60% over the next 20 years.

Guyer said that projected load, plus a change in MISO’s rules as to what can count towards a utility’s accredited capacity, means there is a “staggering” amount of energy that will be required in the next 20 years.

“We have a, I’ll just say, a staggering mission ahead of us,” Guyer said. “Not only do we have to try and achieve the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, but we have to try and do that while we’re also trying to meet this increase in demand.”

Greenwood said the “exponentially” growing demand for energy noted in the report, means that “a dependable supply during this growth is critical.”

“Our long-term vision remains clear: we are striving to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining the reliability our customers expect,” Greenwood said. “It’s crucial that our energy transition balances reliability and affordability with environmental responsibility. Reliable electricity is not a luxury, it’s a necessity.”

Timeline for tax credits changed

Guyer said utilities need to “aggressively move” to make use of the wind and solar credits made available under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.

This massive spending bill created tax credits to incentivize many types of renewable energy investments, including solar and wind energy projects, through 2032.

The massive, Republican-led tax incentive and spending bill known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” which was signed into law in July, shrinks the timeline for these credits.

Now, to be eligible for the credits, projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026, and be placed in service before 2028, according to the report.

“Even though there was an urgency back with the IRA, that has been exponentially increased now due to the big, beautiful bill,” Guyer said.

But, Guyer said, whether a company can make use of IRA credits or not, renewable energy projects are still the cheapest forms of electric generation in Iowa.

“Even without the credit, the renewable generation will still be lower cost, but the credit certainly will have an impact and help customers overall,” Guyer said.

About 40 projects slated to go online after tax credits are set to expire have been withdrawn.
""There were some projects that were sort of marginal, that the economic viability of the project depended on the tax credits,"" Chambers said.
Under Trump's bill, solar and wind projects must start construction before July 4, 2026, or be placed in service before Dec. 31, 2027, to receive tax credits.
""Less solar power, less wind power will be added to the U.S. grid in the next few years than would have otherwise.","Proposed utility-scale solar projects were expected to generate 19 gigawatts of electricity for a power-hungry Louisiana.

But President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill and the 2027 sunsetting of tax credits for the industry have created an exodus and slashed that total to nine gigawatts, says Terrance Chambers, director of the Energy Efficiency and Sustainable Energy Center at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

About 40 projects slated to go online after tax credits are set to expire have been withdrawn. No reason has been given for the withdrawal.

""There were some projects that were sort of marginal, that the economic viability of the project depended on the tax credits,"" Chambers said. ""What I anticipate has happened was that those projects are the ones that were withdrawn.""

One gigawatt of electricity generated by solar panels can roughly power 100,000 homes in the state. If all 19 gigawatts were built, around 1.9 million homes could be powered by the renewable technology, according to estimates by the Solar Energy Industries Association.

Under Trump's bill, solar and wind projects must start construction before July 4, 2026, or be placed in service before Dec. 31, 2027, to receive tax credits. Previously, the industry had until the 2030s to begin construction under former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, projects received a 30% tax credit for the buildout of zero-emission plants. Those credits played a significant role in the country's growth of solar and wind energy.

In other states, projects and government leaders are looking at ways to fast-track their current projects ahead of the deadline or face increased costs.

Louisiana has about 40 active projects, according to the Midcontinent Independent System Operator's Generator Interconnection Queue map. Most of them are in early stages of study, Chambers said.

The projected nine gigawatts is a hopeful number, said Chambers, who expects around five to seven, with losses likely resulting from pushback from residents in project areas and agricultural interests.

Despite the Trump administration labeling the technology unreliable and expensive, solar remains a cheap and quickly deployable energy source, Chambers said. He believes solar will continue to be viable without subsidies.

""Policy, of course, has an impact, and we saw the impact,"" he said. ""But I think the economics are there, and so now it's going to continue to happen.""

Louisiana is expected to add more than 4,000 megawatts of solar energy capacity over the next five years, according to SEIA projections.

Meta's Louisiana AI data center alone requires at least 2,600 megawatts. The company has agreed to build 1,500 megawatts of solar power for the state, with additional energy for the facility coming from three gas-fired plants.

In 2023, Louisiana's solar industry contributed over $440 million to the state's economy, generated approximately $10 million in local tax revenue and supported 5,100 jobs. The state has received a total of $2.3 billion in solar investment, according to SEIA.

The state risks losing out on the economic impact of solar projects, to the tune of billions of dollars worth of lost capital investment, Chambers said.

Residents in the affected parishes, however, have raised objections, pushing proposed projects back while governments considered rules, regulations and possible bans on solar farms.

Their concerns focus on land use of the massive solar projects, impacts to property values, the degradation of rural life and agricultural land and the question of what happens to these projects once they run their lifecycle.

In August, NextEra Energy withdrew its plans to build a 2,000-acre solar farm in Iberville Parish. The project would have added 175 megawatts to the grid but faced an uphill battle when it encountered local opposition.

Beyond Louisiana, Chambers said, Trump's moves could pose a threat to American energy dominance during a time of rapidly growing energy needs and significant backlogs on traditional energy components such as turbines, with wait projections up to seven years.

Nationally, the Trump administration's moves could kill 81 gigawatts of new power capacity by 2033, according to renewable energy investment firm Segue Sustainable Infrastructure.

""We're going to see less power put on the system,"" said Sean Gallagher, SEIA's senior vice president of policy. ""Less solar power, less wind power will be added to the U.S. grid in the next few years than would have otherwise. And this is at a time of rising electricity demand.""

Solar, he added, will be a large player in the American energy market again due to its scalability and ability to be deployed quickly. It seems the market agrees, because 96% of new energy capacity in the country was generated by solar, batteries and wind in 2024.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/85/d85f09c4-181b-518a-92fc-04c175ed57bf/6492229c861a0.image.jpg?crop=1743%2C915%2C0%2C136&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-11 12:02:07.606595

Under that agreement, the state guaranteed Revolution Wind a price of $99 per megawatt for up to 304 megawatts of power.
Others, however, have expressed skepticism of the promises of savings from Revolution Wind and other offshore wind projects.
“However, it is entirely unreasonable to say with high confidence that the Revolution Wind contract will save hundreds of millions of dollars in that time.
“Ørsted has not requested any increases to the contract cost,” Dykes said.","Electric customers across New England could be saddled with up to $500 million in additional annual supply costs if work does not resume on the nearly-completed Revolution Wind project, officials with Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) said.

Work on the wind farm — which is four-fifths of the way through construction off the coast of Rhode Island — was suddenly halted last month by the Trump administration, citing unspecified national security concerns.

The decision was roundly condemned by elected officials, labor unions, utilities, renewable energy advocates and the project developer, Ørsted. They said canceling Revolution Wind would result in job losses, reduced grid reliability and higher utility bills for customers who already pay some of the highest prices for electricity in the nation.

Revolution Wind was expected to produce up to 704 megawatts of electricity — about 2.5% of all the power generated across New England — once it began operating, which was projected for early next year.

While that electricity was to be sold through power purchase agreements with utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island, the electricity itself would have been delivered onto the regional power grid that serves customers in all six New England states.

“This affordability impact is not limited to Connecticut or Rhode Island,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said in an interview last week. “It’s actually something that would increase the cost of energy, of electricity for businesses and residents across the entire New England region.”

According to the “rough” estimate Dykes shared, losing that supply would raise electric costs by up to half a billion dollars annually starting in 2028, an increase of between 5% and 7%.

In addition, the agency warned in a briefing that the loss of backup power provided by Revolution Wind would make the region more susceptible to rolling blackouts during periods of peak demand.

Dykes said DEEP’s estimate came from its analysis of the wholesale electricity markets, run by ISO New England, which ensure an adequate supply of power for the region. Power generators bid into those markets, and the ISO automatically selects the lowest-priced bidders needed to meet demand. The highest bid that‘s selected to clear demand is known as the “price setter,” as it establishes the price paid to all other selected generators regardless of their bids.

Because wind turbines can run at little to no cost, Dykes said projects like Revolution Wind tend to be among the first bids selected, driving down prices throughout the market.

The ISO operates both day-ahead energy markets and more forward-looking “capacity” markets that ensure enough generators are available during periods of peak demand, such as on hot summer days and during winter cold snaps. Capacity auctions are run three years ahead of time, which is why DEEP’s estimates begin in 2028.

In addition to the supply costs borne by residents across New England, DEEP also estimated that Revolution Wind’s power purchase agreement with Connecticut would save the state’s ratepayers $150 million to $200 million over the 20-year life of the contract.

Under that agreement, the state guaranteed Revolution Wind a price of $99 per megawatt for up to 304 megawatts of power. If that electricity and its associated renewable energy credits ended up being sold for less, utility customers would be obligated to make up the difference through a portion of the public benefits charge on their utility bills.

But if prices for the electricity and credits were higher than $99 per megawatt, customers would receive a credit back on their bills.

Dykes said Revolution Wind’s impact on the public benefits charge was likely to fluctuate over time, but she acknowledged that it could result in ratepayers being charged slightly more during the early years of the contract.

“The whole reason that we enter into this contract is because we want to see generation rates go down, right?” Dykes said. “The goal here is that we want to invest in resources, through these contracts… because we expect that they will generate more savings on the [supply] charge than the cost that would come into the public benefits charge.”

In a statement on Monday, a spokesman for Ørsted said the project’s contracted price would help “lower wholesale energy costs and stabilize prices for decades to come.”

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of the Interior declined to comment on DEEP’s projections.

While ISO New England has not independently evaluated DEEP’s analysis or produced its own estimate for how much the loss of Revolution Wind would cost customers, the grid operator did release a statement last month saying that it has already planned for the project to come online starting next year.

“As we’ve noted, unpredictable risks and threats to resources that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” ISO spokeswoman Mary Cate Colapietro said in an email.

Others, however, have expressed skepticism of the promises of savings from Revolution Wind and other offshore wind projects.

In a statement reacting to the Trump administration’s stop-work order, a group of Connecticut Senate Republicans said allowing Revolution Wind to come online would result in an increase in public benefits charges.

One of those lawmakers, state Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, called DEEP’s estimates “conjecture,” based on assumptions about the cost of energy, particularly natural gas, several years into the future. Fazio noted that the average day-ahead wholesale price of electricity in New England in 2024 was $41.47 a megawatt — much lower than the price of Revolution Wind’s contract.

“People can argue one way or another whether the deal will save or lose consumers money” over the next few decades, Fazio said in an email. “However, it is entirely unreasonable to say with high confidence that the Revolution Wind contract will save hundreds of millions of dollars in that time. There is no traded market or price for electricity in New England in 10 years time. The market only exists in the near term.”

In a speech in Washington, D.C., on Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright also blamed offshore wind projects for raising electricity prices while questioning their reliability. Wright, a former executive for a fracked-gas company, also dismissed the potential impacts of climate change in remarks that were rebutted by scientists and clean-energy advocates.

Neither of the state’s two largest electric utilities, Eversource and United Illuminating, would comment directly on DEEP’s cost projections.

However, Eversource spokesman William Hinkle expressed support for Revolution Wind’s completion in a statement Monday. The utility had previously partnered with Ørsted to develop the project, before selling its stake last year. Eversource was still involved in some of the onshore construction of transmission infrastructure for the wind farm at the time of the federal government’s order.

“This is an American project, supporting American jobs, and making sure Americans have reliable power, and it is absolutely essential for affordability, resilience, and reliability in New England,” Hinkle said.

Johns Hopkins research backs up estimate

Abe Silverman, a researcher with the Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute at Johns Hopkins University, conducted his own analysis of Revolution Wind and similarly concluded that the project’s cancellation could end up costing ratepayers nearly half a billion dollars annually over the next several years.

Silverman said his estimates relied solely on calculating how much impact the additional supply of generating assets such as power plants and wind farms had on prices within ISO New England’s capacity markets. (DEEP, by contrast, based its estimates on both those forward-looking markets as well as the real-time cost of producing electricity.)

“For every additional megawatt of capacity available to the market, the price goes down a little bit,” Silverman said. “So if you have a lot of excess in the market, the price is really, really low. If you’re in shortage, the price is really, really high. At the simplest level, that’s what we’re talking about.”

Silverman cautioned that attempts to calculate the potential impact of the loss of Revolution Wind are complicated by a lack of information about what sources of power are next in line to fill the gap in the project’s output. If the new price-setting source — whatever it may be — is only slightly more costly than what it would have been in a scenario where the wind farm were producing power, he said the impact would be less.

Colapietro, the ISO New England spokeswoman, said in an email that the price of wholesale electricity is usually determined by the price of natural gas, which supplies most of the region’s power.

Many experts say the price of natural gas is inherently volatile — subject to a number of factors including foreign conflicts, pipeline capacity and even extreme weather. In New England, gas is also used to heat millions of homes during the winter and can lead to occasional shortages that cause electricity prices to spike.

Winter also happens to be the time of year when the winds off the Atlantic coast are blowing almost constantly, allowing wind farms to operate at or near their peak output.

A separate analysis performed earlier this year for RENEW Northeast, a clean energy trade group, found that having 3,500 megawatts of available offshore wind power — about five times the planned capacity of Revolution Wind — would have saved New England customers $400 million during the most recent winter, when generation costs rose to nearly $115 per megawatt.

Francis Pullaro, the president of RENEW Northeast, said that the group’s analysis was based on offshore wind prices in more recent power purchase agreements that were significantly higher than the $99-per-megawatt price Connecticut negotiated with Revolution Wind in 2018.

“We looked at prices that were almost double that, and we still found savings,” Pullaro said.

At other times of year, however, critics argue that offshore wind is more variable than traditional power plants, making it difficult to plan for those resources to be available when needed.

State Rep. Tracy Marra, R-Darien — who, with Fazio, serves as a ranking member of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee — said that DEEP’s analysis appeared to her to be based on an overly-optimistic expectation for how much power Revolution Wind could produce. “I would be interested in seeing if anybody else could possibly back those numbers up outside of the state of Connecticut and their assumptions,” Marra said.

Still, Marra said she’s not opposed to offshore wind, and she echoed the concerns of DEEP and others who said the Trump administration’s stop-work order could stifle further investment in the region.

“I have some issues with the federal government stopping a project that is mostly complete,” Marra said. “I do have issues with that.”

Currently in New England, there are no plans in place to build any new natural gas plants or other large-scale generating facilities that could take the place of a large wind farm such as Revolution Wind, according to Dan Dolan, the president of the New England Power Generators Association, an industry trade group.

While Dolan declined to weigh in directly on DEEP’s analysis, he noted that Revolution Wind had already successfully navigated the time-consuming and costly process of getting state and federal approvals before beginning construction.

“No large-scale energy infrastructure is cheap,” Dolan said. “These are multi-billion dollar projects, and so alignment in the financial markets, making sure you’ve got the right debt and equity structure that you can bring this to the market, is critical.”

Dykes also noted that the price for Revolution Wind’s power has remained the same throughout the construction process, despite wider economic challenges that have led other wind developers to attempt to renegotiate their agreements.

“Ørsted has not requested any increases to the contract cost,” Dykes said. “They’ve stood by their commitment to deliver this project under the terms that they agreed to.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LAMONT-WIND-0825-DE-SONY-107-2000x1333-1.webp,N,,2025-09-11 14:01:22.074324

The demonstration site features floaters, which capture the motion of ocean waves to generate renewable electricity – proving the technology’s potential to deliver reliable and clean power. While still in demonstration mode, this project provides a key foundation for commercial scale operations, positioning Eco Wave Power as the frontrunner in the emerging US wave energy sector.

The launch comes at a pivotal time for California, aligning with the state’s bold climate policies and Senate Bill 605, which calls for the creation of a comprehensive wave energy roadmap. Federal support is also growing, led by Congresswoman Nanette Díaz Barragán, who recently introduced the Marine Energy Technologies Acceleration Act, a US$1 billion initiative to scale marine energy across the nation.

Nanette Díaz Barragán stated: “Eco Wave Power made history by deploying its innovative wave energy technology into US waters for the very first time. This milestone shows incredible potential for wave energy to power our communities with clean, renewable electricity, while creating jobs and protecting our environment. I am proud to lead the Marine Energy Technologies Acceleration Act in Congress, so we can accelerate wave energy development across the country.”

Inna Braverman, Founder and CEO of Eco Wave Power, emphasised: “California has been a pioneer for climate policy, and we are proud to see wave energy included in Senate Bill 605, calling for a full roadmap for wave energy in California. This project shows that with the right policy, we can turn innovation into reality, and we’re just getting started. I am excited to announce that our next projects are already being prepared in Taiwan, India, and Portugal. Wave energy has enormous potential – it is predictable, reliable, and available right here on our coastlines. With projects like this, we are proving that wave energy is not just the future – it is here, now. We are opening the door to a new era of clean energy for California and for the world.”

Terry Tamminen, President and CEO of AltaSea, added: “AltaSea is a blue economy. We support researchers that are creating intellectual property, like Eco Wave Power, to make sure that they can scale up these technologies and make them practical and successful all over the world. Eco Wave Power is one of those exciting technologies that is ready to scale. It has solved many of the problems that other technologies have come up against, for harnessing something as challenging as wave energy.”

Michael J. Galvin, Director of Waterfront and Commercial Real Estate at the Port of Los Angeles, noted: “The San Pedro Bay Port Complex has big goals to get to zero emissions in the next decade. We can only do this with significantly scaled-up local energy generation. Projects like this are super important to get us there. We can’t do it without localised energy sources, and this project provides us the ability to get there – to make this port the cleanest it can be. That’s a critical component of the port’s goals over the next decade. Eco Wave Power’s adaptive reuse of a very old port structure that is not used for anything else and now will be used to demonstrate how energy can be generated out of the ocean. We are really happy to be using the power of the ocean to continue the efforts here and bring the technologies and solutions that we need at the Port of Los Angeles to get to zero emissions in our port complex.”

Eco Wave Power is actively expanding its global footprint, with upcoming projects planned in the Port of Los Angeles, Portugal, Taiwan, and India-contributing to a growing project pipeline of 404.7 MW.

In a Sept. 9 letter sent to U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Chris Wright, the three lawmakers wrote that they have “serious concerns” about the DOE’s cancellation of 24 projects that were supported through statutorily mandated programs overseen by DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), as well as the process by which these cancellations were carried out.

“We are concerned that the cancellation process undertaken by the department was haphazard, disorganized, and politically driven, and we are disturbed that the department intends to continue to use this same fatally flawed and politicized process to terminate more awards in the near future,” wrote U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM), ranking member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee; U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), ranking member of the U.S. House Science, Space, and Technology Committee; and U.S. Rep.

Additionally, the lawmakers outlined the review process undertaken by DOE and highlighted Wright’s confirmation of the “involvement of the department’s political appointees in the termination of these awards.”

“This is highly unusual and counter to long-standing DOE precedent,” they wrote. “It also stands in stark contrast to the rigorous, merit-based process that the department followed in selecting each of the awards.”

The lawmakers also noted that DOE’s cancellation of the projects warrants further investigation, and requested that Wright answer several questions by Sept. 23 detailing the process the department used to cancel the loans that OCED designated; if DOE intends to cancel more awarded projects that previously went through a rigorous, merit-based approval processes; and if so, if DOE will use the same cancellation process run by political appointees used to cancel OCED projects on May 30, among others.",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/shutterstock_2201411241.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 12:01:50.996637

However, it seems the news is not sparking much interest among investors, as the automaker’s shares dropped nearly 1% in early trading on Thursday morning, adding to the almost 2% decline from the day before.

The Kentucky site has been a key part of Toyota’s North American operations for almost four decades, producing, as part of its lineup, the Camry, one of the manufacturer’s most famous passenger cars in the United States.

Is Toyota Re-strategizing amid Trump Tariffs?

The latest development comes as Toyota appears to be making arrangements to boost its hybrid vehicle production in the U.S., while moving the luxury segment of its lineup to Japan. According to Nikkei Asia, Toyota is considering merging its two Lexus plants in the U.S. into one.

The Japanese automaker currently produces the Lexus ES sedans in Kentucky, while the Lexus TX SUV is assembled in Indiana. However, reports indicate the manufacturer might stop production of the ES once current orders are completed, with the next model to be exported from Japan.

Rivals Take the Other Road

On the other hand, other Asian automakers appear to be taking a different road, even as President Donald Trump’s tariffs on imported vehicles, including from Japan, force automakers to reconsider their manufacturing strategies.

Earlier in the year, Hyundai (HYMLF) disclosed plans to invest $21 billion in the U.S. over the next four years. Tokyo-based Hitachi (HTHIY) also recently launched a $100 million factory in Maryland to produce train cars.

Tanish Doshi was in high school when he pushed the Tucson Unified School District to take on an ambitious plan to reduce its climate footprint. In Oct. 2024, the availability of federal tax credits encouraged the district to adopt the $900 million plan, which involves goals of achieving net-zero emissions and zero waste by 2040, along with adding a climate curriculum to schools.

Now, access to those funds is disappearing, leaving Tucson and other school systems across the country scrambling to find ways to cover the costs of clean energy projects.

The Arizona school district, which did not want to impose an economic burden on its low-income population by increasing bonds or taxes, had expected to rely in part on federal dollars provided by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, Doshi said.

But under HR1, or the “one big, beautiful bill,” passed on July 4, Tucson schools will not be able to receive all of the expected federal funding in time for their upcoming clean energy projects. The law discontinues many clean energy tax credits, including those used by schools for solar power and electric vehicles, created under the IRA. When schools and other tax-exempt organizations receive these credits, they come in the form of a direct cash reimbursement.

At the same time, Tucson and thousands of districts across the country that were planning to develop solar and wind power projects are now forced to decide between accelerating them to try to meet HR1’s fast-approaching “commence construction” deadline of June 2026, finding other sources of funding, or hitting pause on their plans. Tina Cook, energy project manager for Tucson schools, said the district might have to scale back some of its projects unless it could find local sources of funding.

“Phasing out the tax credits for wind and solar energy is going to make a huge, huge difference,” said Doshi, 18, now a first-year college student. “It ends a lot of investments in poor and minority communities. You really get rid of any notion of environmental justice that the IRA had advanced.”

The tax credits in the IRA, the largest legislative investment in climate projects in U.S. history, had marked a major opportunity for schools and colleges to reduce their impact on the environment. K-12 school infrastructure releases an estimated 41 million metric tons of emissions per year, according to an analysis from the New Buildings Institute. The K-12 school system’s buses — some 480,000 — and meals also produce significant emissions and waste. Clean energy projects supported by the IRA were helping schools not only to limit their climate toll but also to save money on energy costs over the long term and improve student health, advocates said.

As a result, many students, consultants, and sustainability leaders said, they have no plans to abandon clean energy projects. They said they want to keep working to cut emissions, even though that may be more difficult now.

Solar panels, electric vehicles affected by policy changes

Sara Ross, cofounder of UndauntedK12, which helps school districts green their operations, divided HR1’s fallout on schools into three categories: the good, the bad, and the ugly.

On the bright side, she said, schools can still get up to 50% off for installing ground source heat pumps — those credits will continue — to more efficiently heat schools. The network of pipes in a ground source pump cycles heat from the shallow earth into buildings.

In the “bad” category, any electric vehicle acquired after Sept. 30 of this year will not be eligible for tax credits — drastically accelerating the IRA’s phase-out timeline by seven years. That applies to electric school buses as well as electric vehicle charging stations at schools. EPA’s Clean School Bus Program still exists for two more years and covers two-thirds of the funding for all electric school buses districts acquire in that time. The remaining one-third, however, was to be covered by federal and state tax credits.

The expiration of the federal tax credits could cost a district up to $40,000 more per vehicle, estimated Sue Gander, director of the Electric School Bus Initiative run by the nonprofit World Resources Institute.

Solar projects will see the most “ugly” effects of HR1, Ross said.

Los Angeles Unified School District is planning to build 21 solar projects on roofs, carports and other structures, plus 13 electric vehicle charging sites, as part of an effort to reduce energy costs and achieve 100% renewable energy by 2040. The district anticipated receiving around $25 million in federal tax credits to help pay for the $90 million contract, said Christos Chrysiliou, chief eco-sustainability officer for the district. With the tight deadlines imposed by HR1, the district can no longer count on receiving that money.

“It’s disappointing,” Chrysiliou said. “It’s nice to be able to have that funding in place to meet the goals and objectives that we have.”

LAUSD is looking at a small portion of a $9 billion bond measure passed last year, as well as utility rebates, third-party financing, and grants from the California Energy Commission, to help make up for some of the gaps in funding.

Many California State University campuses are in a similar position as they work to install solar to meet the system’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2045, said Lindsey Rowell, CSU’s chief energy, sustainability, and transportation officer.

Tariffs on solar panel materials from overseas and the early sunsetting of tax credits mean that “the cost of these projects are becoming prohibitive for campuses,” Rowell said.

Sweeps of undocumented immigrants in California may also lead to labor shortages that could slow the pace of construction, Rowell added. “Limiting the labor force in any way is only going to result in an increased cost, so those changes are frightening as well,” she said.

Projects will need to start work soon to qualify

New Treasury Department guidance, issued Aug. 15, made it much harder for projects to meet the threshold needed to qualify for the tax credits. Renewable energy projects previously qualified for credits once a developer spent 5% of a project’s cost. But the guidelines have been tightened — now, larger projects must pass a “physical work test,” meaning “significant physical labor has begun on a site,” before they can qualify for credits. With the construction commencement deadline looming next June, these will likely leave many projects ineligible for credits.

“The rules are new, complex, [and] not widely understood,” Ross said. “We’re really concerned about schools’ ability to continue to do solar projects and be able to effectively navigate these new rules.”

Schools without “fancy legal teams” may struggle to understand how the new tax credit changes in HR1 will affect their finances and future projects, she added.

Some universities were just starting to understand how the IRA tax credits could help them fund projects. Lily Strehlow, campus sustainability coordinator at the University of Wisconsin, Eau-Claire, said the planning cycle for clean energy projects at the school can take 10 years. The university is in the process of adding solar to the roof of a large science building, and depending on the date of completion, the project “might or might not” qualify for the credits, she said.

“At this point, everybody’s holding their breath,” said Rick Brown, founder of California-based TerraVerde Energy, a clean energy consultant to schools and agencies.

Brown said that none of his company’s projects are in a position where they’re not going to get done, but the company may end up seeing fewer new projects due to a higher cost of equipment.

Tim Carter, president of Second Nature, which supports climate work in education, added that colleges and universities are in a broader period of uncertainty, due to larger attacks from the Trump administration, and are not likely to make additional investments at this time: “We’re definitely in a wait and see.”

Student activists look for new paths toward climate goals

For youth activists, the fallout from HR1 is “disheartening,” Doshi said.

Emma and Molly Weber, climate activists since eighth grade, said they are frustrated. The Colorado-based twins, who will start college this fall, helped secure the first “Green New Deal for Schools” resolution in the nation in the Boulder Valley School District. Its goals include working toward a goal of Zero Net Energy by 2050, making school buildings greener, creating pathways to green jobs, and expanding climate change education.

“It feels very demoralizing to see something you’ve been working so hard at get slashed back, especially since I’ve spoken to so many students from all over the country about these clean energy tax credits, being like, ‘These are the things that are available to you, and this is how you can help convince your school board to work on this,’” Emma Weber said.

The Webers started thinking about other creative ways to pay for the clean energy transition and have settled on advocating for state-level legislation in the form of a climate superfund, where major polluters in a community would be responsible for contributing dollars to sustainability initiatives.

Consultants and sustainability coordinators said that they don’t see the demand for renewable energy going away. “Solar is the cheapest form of energy. It makes sense to put it on every rooftop that we can. And that’s true with or without tax credits,” Strehlow said.

WASHINGTON — Last month, Melvin White's first cohort of future solar technicians was ready to begin training.

White's Port Arthur-based company was among the participants in Texas' Solar for All program, a federally funded initiative to deploy solar energy in homes across Texas and build out a workforce to install the technology in low- and moderate-income communities. The Environmental Protection Agency awarded nearly $250 million last year to a coalition of local governments and nonprofits, led by Harris County, to fund Texas' share of the Biden-era clean energy program.

White's company, a workforce development organization which helps train and place skilled laborers, selected 25 people to teach on solar installation and ultimately be placed in an apprenticeship. He had purchased some necessary lab equipment and was set to begin training when, on Aug. 7, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that he was ending all existing Solar for All contracts in order to recoup the federal government's investment and cut what the Trump administration sees as wasteful spending.

""The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,″ Zeldin wrote on X. ""Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!""

White and others were left scrambling.

Workforce development organizations that had already begun training are trying to rebuild trust in their communities after having to cancel programs. Groups that were providing technical assistance are trying to recoup their losses. And everyone agrees that while coalition members can try to find private funding to preserve some components of Solar for All, there's no replacing the $250 million or the direct assistance to low-income households.

""We’re trying now to redirect and seeing how we can salvage the people that we’ve recruited to be in this program — cost-wise for operations, as well as [with] our credibility in the community,"" White said. ""[We told] people we have a program we’re going to start, and all of a sudden we’re not able to start it.""

The funding was already doled out by the Biden administration, leading many Democrats and coalition members to say the move is illegal. Eight Texas Democrats in Congress, led by Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, sent a letter to Zeldin calling for the funds to be reinstated.

Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee, whose office was the lead applicant on the Solar for All grant, said he is exploring legal avenues to restore the grant money, but that he wants to be thoughtful in his approach and cognizant of the differing political realities faced by other members of the coalition.

""One of the challenges here is to what extent are folks willing to publicly be in opposition to President Trump,"" he said. ""I certainly am willing to do so, but not all of our partners are in the same position that I am. So we're just trying to get everybody in line, get all of our ducks in a row, and to really do a deep dive of the issues to make sure that if we bring a lawsuit, that we’re best positioned for success.""

The broader Solar for All coalition, which had planned to operate in 10 municipalities around the state, has been left reeling from the cancellation of a program created specifically to reduce household energy bills. Left in limbo are programs to provide rooftop solar on low-income single-family homes in Waco, bring community solar to Brownsville, install battery storage in Houston to serve neighborhoods during power outages and train solar technicians in Dallas.

Without the support of the federal government and with no money coming from the state to replace it, the coalition's effort to deliver solar energy to low-income households and build greater grid resiliency will have to shrink considerably.

""We’re not going to give up by any means,"" said Sam Silerio, the Texas Program Director at Solar United Neighbors, which was working on grant implementation, and a solar contractor himself in El Paso. ""But as we look to pivot, it’s not the same...the scale and the scope of Solar for All was massive, and unlike anything we’d ever seen before. Losing it is a huge loss.""

What is Solar for All?

Created by congressional Democrats and signed into law by then-President Joe Biden in 2022, the Solar for All program was intended to lower energy bills and create jobs through new residential solar and battery storage installations.

Menefee, a Democrat who is running for Congress in the open 18th District, said Solar for All was among the largest clean energy partnerships in the history of the state and would have addressed three key issues — high costs, job growth and resiliency.

""This is exactly what you want to see in a program,"" he said. ""It’s going to help people with affordability. It’s going to increase the number of jobs. It’s going to strengthen our grid when we know that ERCOT has had issues over the last few years. And it’s a coalition of folks across the political spectrum who are working together to bring it in.""

Low-income households — with eligibility determined by geographic area — could qualify for financial assistance from the program to install solar panels and batteries in their home or conduct home energy efficiency upgrades. As a condition of the program, the installation of solar energy would need to save households, for rooftop solar, or communities, for community solar, at least 20% on their monthly energy bills.

Coalition leaders said Solar for All was going to benefit 28,000 households across the state, with an average annual savings of $468.

Some municipalities had already selected households; others were in the process of doing so or had settled on a number of households they planned to service.

Margo Weisz, the executive director of the Texas Energy Poverty Research Institute, said that one-third of low-income households in Texas either turn off their air conditioning or keep it at uncomfortable levels because their energy bills are prohibitively expensive, according to her organization's annual survey.

Her institute was managing Solar for All community and rooftop solar programs in Brownsville, Laredo and El Paso — all border communities where their survey found that energy costs are most prohibitive.

""We’re really looking at a huge energy affordability problem for people,"" Weisz said. ""With Solar for All, the intent was really to try to address the affordability needs of Americans who struggle most.""

Beyond direct installations and cost savings, Solar for All had a workforce development component that companies like White's were taking part in. While household installations had not yet begun, training Texans on solar technology had. In Houston, Port Arthur and Waco, programs to certify Texans in solar installation and as solar ambassadors — who could help explain the installation process to participating households — were already underway.

The Houston Area Urban League, for example, had received a grant to put on solar technology training classes and offer job placement services for the next five years. That group had already completed a three-week course for 18 people, and had selected 15 people for the second cohort when its funding was pulled.

And with the need for energy resiliency demonstrated by recent hurricanes in the Gulf Coast and 2021 Winter Storm Uri, Solar for All also provided funds for resilience hubs — community centers or homes outfitted with solar and battery technology at no cost to the participant to serve as a gathering place in the event of power outages.

The coalition had begun by selecting 30 homes and a resilience center site in Harris County to serve as those hubs. Because the resilience hubs rely on battery storage — an expensive technology — the coalition's capacity to try to move forward with that element of the project is particularly endangered.

Because Solar for All-funded infrastructure projects had to adhere to regulations requiring materials to be domestically sourced, coalition members also believed that the program could have economic impacts beyond its operational life.

""Eventually, we would have spurred a Texas economy for manufacturing these solar parts, and the jobs associated with that and the ones [created] to install solar,"" said Margaret Cook, the vice president of water and community resilience at coalition member Houston Advanced Research Center. ""We were expecting to have a good amount of impact on jobs in Texas with this program, and then also [provide] contracting opportunities for local businesses.""

Workforce development groups and solar contractors believe solar energy is still an attractive proposition in Texas and that their work will continue, albeit at a smaller scale. But for the local governments expecting millions in investment, the future is murky.

""It's like being uninvited to the dance you're looking for,"" said Harris County Commissioner Adrian Garcia, a solar energy proponent who represents east Houston. ""You go buy a new suit, get your haircut, shine your shoes, and then you've got no dance to go to.""

Electric vehicle sales in the U.S. reached a new high in August, with buyers accelerating purchases to utilize a federal tax credit before its expiration, as reported by Yahoo Finance. A total of 146,000 EVs were sold, capturing a record 9.9% market share, according to data from Cox Automotive.

The sales surge was precipitated by the decision from President of the United States Donald Trump's administration to terminate the $7,500 incentive for new American-made electric vehicles on September 30. This policy shift fueled significant sales increases for manufacturers like Ford, General Motors, and Hyundai. However, Tesla Inc. was an outlier, experiencing a 6.7% decline in U.S. sales year-over-year for August. Data from the IndexBox platform corroborates the overall market growth while highlighting Tesla's contrasting performance. The company's share of the EV market fell to 38%, its lowest point in eight years, despite its average vehicle prices being approximately 5.5% lower than the previous year.

Analysts point to several challenges for Tesla, including public reaction to CEO Elon Musk's political statements, which have led to incidents of vandalism and protest against the company's vehicles. Furthermore, Tesla has not introduced a new mass-market model in several years, during which time competition has intensified from rivals such as Chevrolet, Ford, and Hyundai. This trend is reflected in Tesla's global sales, which were down nearly 14% year-over-year in the second quarter, following a similar decline in the first quarter.

Similarly, during the first Trump administration, over 300 new petrochemical plants were proposed, predominantly in the Gulf South and Appalachia.
Swift energy transition depends on scaling up affordable clean energy.
Because strong laws and regulations give rise to effective litigation strategies, the Trump administration is trying to eliminate them.
Clean energy transition can be an engine for new jobs and healthier communities.","The Trump administration is advancing an extreme, genuinely catastrophic energy policy that requires the strongest possible counter-offensive from climate advocates and funders. As our climate deadlines bear down on us, it is past time to come together around a broadly aligned and robustly resourced strategy, both to promote rapid clean energy deployment and limit the massive oil and gas expansion now underway. Crucially, the organizing and place-based work that is needed to stop irreversible fossil fuel entrenchment is also work that is needed to create the political conditions for ambitious climate action within a functioning democracy.

In these last-chance years to shift our climate trajectory from catastrophic to livable, the United States is producing more crude oil than any country ever has. In 2024, the United States was also the world’s biggest gas producer. The ascendancy of oil and gas interests is a defining fact of American life—economically, politically, and culturally. This was true during the Biden administration, which presided over an oil and gas boom notwithstanding historic climate ambition and accomplishments. It is unmistakably true now, as the second Trump administration pursues a crystal clear agenda to crush clean energy and enshrine oil and gas dependence.

The scale and urgency of the current threat should settle a long-simmering debate about the strategic value of targeting oil and gas production directly. There is no inherent tension between efforts to limit fossil fuel production and efforts to boost clean alternatives, and many advocates understand them both to be necessary and intertwined. But there is also a competing and philanthropically consequential view that the only effective way to overcome the outsize power of the fossil fuels industry is to invest in solutions-side advocacy. Given the scale of new oil and gas development that is slated for lock-in domestically and also globally, it is not enough to focus on limiting demand for fossil fuels. The imperatives over the next three years are to block further oil and gas expansion, drive clean energy progress, protect our bedrock environmental laws, and to use every fight to build a stronger, more activated base of support for energy transition.

Limiting Oil and Gas Expansion

The climate imperative to stop oil and gas expansion is clear. As the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) has consistently affirmed, greenhouse gas emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure are already on track to drive temperature rise greater than 1.5 degrees Celsius. New oil and gas development is taking us further off the narrow pathway to climate stability, perhaps irretrievably.

Ceding the clean energy economy and redoubling investment in oil and gas is the wrong path forward, especially given that current oil and gas production is more than sufficient to meet near term needs both domestically and geopolitically. Deferring the necessary energy transition in the United States will only increase its cost while foregoing the immediate economic benefits of new clean energy investment and jobs. The same logic applies globally. US export strategy—and especially tariff negotiations that lock in uptake of US oil and gas—will make energy transition slower and more expensive for other countries too.

Nevertheless, the United States is on a building spree as well as a tariff offensive. This year and next, oil and gas production is expected to begin at 13 new “fields” in the Gulf of Mexico. As of July 2025, there were seven new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals under construction, 11 more terminals approved, and four terminals either proposed or in the pre-filing stage of the permitting process. As of June 2025, 18.7 gigawatts of new gas capacity were slated to come online by 2028, with 4.3 GW already under construction.

Beyond the climate implications, these big new projects are increasing toxic health burdens on people who have to live near them, especially in the Gulf South and Appalachia, which are targeted for the most deadly pollution and the least economic benefit. Existing rates of premature death, cancer, asthma, and other disease in oil and gas hubs should be compelling a swift transition to cleaner alternatives. Instead, the Trump Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is working to eliminate pollution control requirements and other health protections so that it can further accelerate oil and gas development.

Similarly, the Trump Interior Department is advancing an extreme iteration of “drill-baby-drill” policy to open up public lands and coastal waters to drilling and fast-track new infrastructure projects under the pretext of a false “energy emergency.” The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) turbo-charged these efforts with the most sweeping public lands giveaway in modern history. Among other things, it mandates 30 offshore lease sales of 80 million acres each in the Gulf of Mexico and quarterly oil and gas lease sales for onshore public lands across more than 200 million acres in the West.

In short, the Trump administration is poised to lock in oil and gas dependence—generationally. And its attacks on environmental laws and regulations and the agencies charged with environmental protection are, to a remarkable degree, designed to advance fossil interests. But it is possible to stop harmful projects and redirect national trends, even when it requires facing off against powerful corporations backed by the White House. For example, under the first George W. Bush administration, Vice President Cheney convened an energy task force that proposed construction of 200 new coal plants to address a purported energy emergency. That was a prescription for runaway climate change, but advocates successfully harnessed organizing and litigation to block 170 of those plants. Similarly, during the first Trump administration, over 300 new petrochemical plants were proposed, predominantly in the Gulf South and Appalachia. Concerted local opposition, supported by organizing, lawsuits, and sharp communications strategies have so far succeeded in blocking much of that build-out.

Fundamental goods such as clean air and water do not simply exist. They are the product of ongoing and vigilant enforcement of strong legal standards and requirements.

New fossil fuels development on the scale contemplated by the Trump administration will harm and antagonize millions of people—including people who are already living with unconscionable cancer risks from fossil fuels pollution, people who are weathering devastating climate shocks, people who treasure our public lands, people who are ready to fight to keep their air and water clean. To harness that opposition and derail a coming onslaught of lawless federal actions, philanthropy needs to support (1) organizations that have community standing and influence to lead local opposition; (2) organizations that can provide excellent support, including applied scientific and economic analysis and legal representation; and (3) coalition and campaigning infrastructure that accelerates learning across communities and aggregates their collective power for political impact. Leaders across the country are already doing this work, but their capacity is constantly overstretched. Without more support, it will be overwhelmed.

Driving Faster Deployment of Clean Energy

Of course, it will not be sufficient to stop new oil and gas projects. Swift energy transition depends on scaling up affordable clean energy. With the loss of IRA incentives and escalating attacks on wind and solar energy, it will take a much bigger push to deploy clean energy fast enough.

In the OBBBA, Congress abandoned any pretense of resource-neutral energy policy and picked winners (oil and gas) and losers (wind and solar), eliminating or rapidly phasing out nearly all federal investments that were instrumental in scaling wind and solar even before the Biden administration. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is waging an all-out offensive on renewables, holding up permits, blocking new wind developments, and directing the Justice Department to attack state climate initiatives, including the essential policies that advanced clean energy deployment during the first Trump administration.

This extraordinary hostility to clean energy demands a commensurate counter-offensive. Energy advocates and litigators need more support to handle a new volume of work with defining implications for energy regulation. As the Trump administration tries to brand clean energy as anti-American, more investment in organizing and communications work is required, especially in local venues, including city councils, zoning boards, and public utility commissions, where fossil fuel interests are successfully rallying local opposition based on disinformation—for example, that wind turbines and solar arrays cause cancer.

Crucially, the climate community must supercharge advocacy and litigation to avoid unnecessary investment in new gas capacity to meet growing energy demand. In theory, it is possible to abandon expensive new assets, but in real life it rarely happens. No matter what, building new billion-dollar gas-fired power plants will lock in higher electricity rates for decades to come, making it more economically painful and less politically saleable to modernize the grid.

As the current rush to build new gas plants illustrates, the work to advance clean energy must be integrated with work to limit oil and gas expansion. And, to achieve durable and transformative outcomes, a holistic energy strategy should be grounded in popular and practical plans for energy transition regionally and locally. Clean energy technologies are mature enough to make the next leaps in scale, and there are proven policies to catalyze their uptake. What we need now are better roadmaps for accomplishing the transition in keeping with logistical, social and economic imperatives and constraints that vary across the country. In states with fragile and failing economies that are fossil fuel dependent—West Virginia, Louisiana, Alaska for example—what is the practical path toward a new economy that increases health and wealth? In states like Texas and North Dakota with booming oil and gas plays, what is the economic engine to ensure that energy transition will not leave people worse off? In a state like California that has invested heavily in clean energy, what is the best way to ensure access to affordable energy during the messy period when refineries are going off-line but people are still driving gas-fueled cars? Philanthropy can play a catalytic role in eliciting and enabling serious planning that grapples effectively with problems that will stall energy transition unless and until there are real, politically compelling solutions in sight.

Protecting Bedrock Environmental Laws and Regulations

In all the work ahead, litigation can and must play a role in stopping fossil fuels expansion and enabling timely energy transition. The sheer lawlessness of the Trump administration’s approach will give rise to cases that can prevail even in hostile courts and a legal landscape that has been disrupted by the Supreme Court. Win or lose, when lawsuits are premised on serious wrongs that our justice system should make right, they are powerful vehicles for raising the profile of issues and leaders, organizing effective opposition, and holding the government and powerful corporate actors publicly accountable. This is true of many kinds of cases including enforcement actions, challenges to government rulemaking and project permitting, and lawsuits to hold oil and gas companies financially liable—for example, the growing number of cases that municipalities are bringing against oil and gas companies for the damages caused by climate deception.

Because strong laws and regulations give rise to effective litigation strategies, the Trump administration is trying to eliminate them. Its target list includes regulations that address air and water pollution, waste disposal, chemical safety, ecosystem and species protection, and public lands stewardship. Republicans in Congress are pushing the same deregulatory agenda, while also trying to close the courthouse doors to public interest lawsuits. For example, the House and Senate energy committees are pushing for “pay to play” permitting provisions that would give developers the ability to pay for fast permits that would be immune from court challenges. To attract Democrats, they are framing efforts to gut statutes and preclude judicial review as “permitting reform”—a hot and divisive topic in the climate space.

There is certainly room to improve regulatory systems in the United States. We need to adequately staff and budget for faster environmental review. We should be scoping permitting processes to address the most salient issues of concern, not compiling hundreds of pages of analysis on immaterial issues. We can and should create pathways to streamline approvals for clean energy projects that confer essential environmental benefits. But the notion that we can do without environmental regulation is wrong. Fundamental goods such as clean air and water do not simply exist. They are the product of ongoing and vigilant enforcement of strong legal standards and requirements. Especially under the Trump administration, it would be disastrous to trade away bedrock environmental laws in hopes that deregulation will help us build clean energy infrastructure faster.

Deregulation will only benefit oil and gas incumbents that have no problem building things in the United States. Especially after passage of the OBBBA, clean energy is competing on a playing field that is tilted even further toward fossil fuels. In this political context, weakening environmental laws would not overcome the entrenched advantages enjoyed by the oil and gas industry. It would affirmatively advance the Trump administration’s fossil-first agenda and erode the competitive advantages that clean energy commands. To speed up clean energy deployment, we need tailored policies that are expressly designed to achieve that result. Gutting the laws that safeguard everyone’s right to a clean and healthy environment is not a pragmatic, second best solution.

Getting Organized

Demonizing regulation and climate advocacy is part of the Trump fossil-first agenda, and to a shocking extent, it is working. Nationally, Democrats are going quiet on climate change while climate disasters rock the country. Even in California, one of the world’s greatest laboratories for climate policy and action, there is a retrenchment in climate leadership.

It is not surprising to see climate resolve faltering as inconvenient deadlines for energy transition loom. No matter who is running the country, it will take enormous political will and logistical brilliance to transition the US economy away from oil and gas. The overwhelmingly powerful climate movement that could summon such political will is not yet here. But it could be. There are smart and talented leaders all around the country. Extreme weather is now personal for most people, whether they call it climate change or not. Clean energy transition can be an engine for new jobs and healthier communities. The conditions are ripe for organizing, but serious investment is required.

Now is the time to support communities to grapple in earnest with what it will really take, region by region, state by state, town by town, to manage a transition that leaves no one behind. Over the coming years, there will be many necessary fights to stop harmful oil and gas projects. Each one will present an opportunity to activate people around a practical vision for what we want instead. To maximize those opportunities, we need shared plans for the future and the relationships and resources to act on them together. As our current political moment makes clear, it is a daunting project to shift the common sense of a country that has centered the oil and gas industry for over 150 years—in our infrastructure, policy, and culture. But it is the project, and it will not get done without a very big fight.

“The logical trigger was the tax credit,” he told Latitude Media.
Of course, it’s still a complicated time for the U.S. solar manufacturing industry, which is still adjusting to the new tariffs and sourcing rules introduced by the Trump administration.
But for Tigo — and for certain peers like solar tracker company Nextracker, which announced its acquisition of Origami Solar this week — there is still sufficient incentive to onshore.
“Offshoring manufacturing is cheaper; there’s a reason why the entire world manufactures in Asia,” Dillon said.","Tigo Energy, which produces hardware and software solutions for solar systems across the world, last week announced a manufacturing partnership with the U.S.-based solar manufacturer and retailer EG4 Electronics.

As part of the new agreement, Tigo, which is headquartered in Silicon Valley, will set up production of optimizers and EG4 inverters in the U.S., and EG4 will bundle them and sell them to customers. The move adds to Tigo’s domestic manufacturing capacity, which has so far been focused mostly in Asia; EG4’s parent company Energy Access Innovations has recently opened a large manufacturing facility in Texas.

According to James Dillon, Tigo’s chief marketing officer, the decision to bring some of the company’s manufacturing capabilities to the U.S. was made with the purpose of taking advantage of the 45X tax credit for clean manufacturing. “The logical trigger was the tax credit,” he told Latitude Media.

The credit, introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act, can be used by domestic manufacturers of clean energy equipment to reduce their federal tax bill. To the relief of the industry, it was left largely intact by the GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which dialed back many clean energy tax incentives.

Of course, it’s still a complicated time for the U.S. solar manufacturing industry, which is still adjusting to the new tariffs and sourcing rules introduced by the Trump administration. But for Tigo — and for certain peers like solar tracker company Nextracker, which announced its acquisition of Origami Solar this week — there is still sufficient incentive to onshore.

For the optimized inverters Tigo will produce with EG4, the 45X tax credit is expected to amount to 11 cents per watt, which Dillon said should be enough to offset the increased cost of manufacturing in the U.S. versus in Asia.

“Offshoring manufacturing is cheaper; there’s a reason why the entire world manufactures in Asia,” Dillon said. “And we haven’t [started production] yet, so we don’t have the specifics. But the goal is to have the tax credit offset the increase in costs.”

Tigo’s new domestic production will target its U.S. customers, who currently constitute about 22% of its customer base. U.S. customers are increasingly interested in building projects with domestic products that can help them comply with increasingly complicated sourcing requirements, such as “foreign entity of concern” regulations. The U.S. production will not substitute Tigo’s offshore manufacturing, however; for the rest of its global customers, which are spread over more than 100 countries, Tigo will continue producing optimizers in China and Thailand.

Despite the timing of the announcement, which came just a few months after President Trump signed the OBBB into law in early July, Dillon says Tigo’s decision was not influenced by recent policy changes.

“Who knows what [President Trump] is going to do?” he asked rhetorically, adding that, while the decision to bring some manufacturing to the U.S. was indeed triggered by the existence of the 45X tax credit created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, Tigo wouldn’t have followed through if it didn’t think it had long-term benefits.

“Manufacturing in the U.S. is a good thing regardless,” he said, citing benefits like a simplified supply chain and reduced shipping costs, as well as supporting more U.S. jobs.

In fact, Dillon thinks recent policy changes — despite the preservation of 45X — are bound to send the U.S. solar industry into a “solar coaster” of “chaotic up and chaotic down,” and that Tigo’s global diversification will help it weather the storm easily.

“The beauty of being worldwide is that we saw a little bit of a drop in Asia last quarter, but two quarters before that, Asia was our strongest quarter,” he said. “Like any investment, spreading your risk is a wise thing.”

More broadly, Dillon thinks onshoring manufacturing could allow the solar industry to work on the quality of its product. Dillon, who worked in the semiconductor industry for 15 years before moving to storage and solar, says that the failure rate for semiconductors is generally so low it’s measured in parts per billion. Solar panels, on the other hand, have an average failure rate of 0.05% annually, which “is orders of magnitude off.”

“The entire industry, start to finish, needs to work on qualities, from the manufacturer to the designer to the salesperson,” he said, noting that onshoring manufacturing could help it do just that. “It’s not the fact that it’d be in the U.S., but the fact that we are going to be able to start something from scratch, take the learning from every prior generation, and build it in.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-09-10T152308.162.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-11 13:02:09.355806

The map is designed to help legislators, policymakers, and investors visualise the full-scale and strategic alignment of Wales’ clean energy pipeline and industrial transition, and to spotlight the transformational potential for jobs, infrastructure, and regional economies.

It not only identifies £6.9 billion which could be added to the Welsh economy over the next decade but also highlights £2.1 billion which could be saved by avoiding further deindustrialisation through investment in low-carbon technologies and infrastructure.

To support political understanding and constituency-level impact, the map overlays the 16 new ‘super constituencies’ which will be contested in the 2026 Senedd election. This allows political candidates and decision-makers to identify priority clean energy and industrial projects within their prospective constituencies — and to understand the local benefits they could deliver.

Ben Burggraaf, CEO of Net Zero Industry Wales, said: “At its core, this map sends a powerful message: Wales is not simply a collection of individual projects. As a nation, we are building a strong, diverse and nationally significant clean energy and low-carbon industry investment portfolio, enabling Wales to become a leading clean energy transition hub and remain a cornerstone of the UK industrial base.”

Jess Hooper, Director of RenewableUK Cymru, said: “Renewables are not just about delivering projects and electricity— they are about delivering a future. Clean energy is both a climate imperative and a once-in-a-generation economic opportunity.

“With this map, we’re making the case for action on where investment is needed, with real locations, real figures and real opportunities for every part of Wales.”

Critical infrastructure upgrades can also be seen, including grid reinforcements to boost connectivity in Mid Wales and create a North–South transmission spine, alongside current and new interconnectors with Ireland and Scotland. These are essential to ensuring clean power can flow efficiently into, out of, and across Wales — unlocking further investment and economic growth.

The collaboration between clean energy and industry associations reflects the shared missions of the two organisations: Net Zero Industry Wales is focused on decarbonising industry and manufacturing, positioning Wales as a clean energy hub and a cornerstone of the UK industrial base; RenewableUK Cymru is leading the shift to clean electricity by embedding renewables into Wales’ wider economic strategy.

Crucially, scaling up renewable energy deployment is not only about creating new value— it’s also about protecting Wales’ existing economic strengths.

Key recommendations from the Virginia Energy Efficiency Council include increasing investments into energy efficiency programs for low-income households to upgrade their homes and waste less energy.

The Commission on Electric Utility Regulation reviewed the state’s efforts to fund energy efficiency plans during virtual meetings on Wednesday. They also talked about the uncertainty around community solar investments and the rollout of energy storage plans.

Charts shared in the meeting by Carrie Hearne, the executive director of the commission, show that Virginia is 9th in electricity expenditure, which is higher than the national average. This energy use is due in part to the growing number of data centers across the state, which require large amounts of electricity. The state’s high energy expenditure also means that the cost burden for low-income households can be great.

Key recommendations from the Virginia Energy Efficiency Council include increasing investments into energy efficiency programs for low-income households to upgrade their homes and waste less energy.

“Investments in energy efficiency is a very least-cost way to save money, save electricity, save energy, and help reduce pressure on the grid,” Hearne said.

The council also recommended the state rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a carbon credits market which previously was generating funds for the state to invest in energy efficiency and flood resilience programs. Gov. Glenn Youngkin pulled the state out of RGGI, a move a judge deemed unlawful, and some lawmakers fear rejoining it will add yet another cost added onto customer’s utility bills.

“If we’re talking about affordability, anything we add to that, no matter what it is, it’s going to cost. So we need to be very careful about adding things to riders,” said Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott.

The commission expressed interest in ramping up nuclear power through small modular reactors. SMRs are not currently operating in the country, but multiple are under construction in other states. Dominion Energy has already selected their North Anna power plant as the site of their first SMR. There is still a long road ahead that will entail selecting the proposals for the projects, getting the proposer licensing, and other requirements.

The commission did not discuss utility sized solar projects, but did discuss the status of community solar in the commonwealth. Community solar allows neighborhoods to buy into small-scale solar projects to have their utility bills reduced based on how much power is generated and how much they bought in.

However, if Dominion’s proposed changes to the minimum bill amount materialize, it could impact those savings. There hasn’t been much movement to expand this program in Virginia, and federal grants for it have recently been paused or terminated.

The Virginia General Assembly has failed to pass bills that would expand energy storage requirements, and ones that have passed have been vetoed by Youngkin. As long-term battery technology advances, some lawmakers are pushing utilities to utilize them more to assist with storing energy from solar and wind projects.

The American Clean Power Association, which represents companies in energy storage, solar, and wind, reported to the commission that there is 56 megawatts of battery storage operational in the state now, 252MW in construction, and 94MW in the proposal stage. There are many battery storage projects in the interconnection pipeline for the regional transmission grid, PJM, to approve. Dominion has multiple pilot projects in the works that look outside lithium-ion batteries as options for their projects.

“These pilots will deliver significant value, not only for the technology developers, they get to test their systems and real world conditions, but also to us, as we help de-risk the technical performance and cost effectiveness of these proposed three (projects),” said Brandon Martin with Dominion Energy. “The real world operating data validating the technology’s ability to enhance the resiliency of the grid and those claims and the cost benefits is real.”

The Commission on Electric Utility Regulation will hold more meetings this fall to get updates on the state’s energy profile and efforts by utilities to meet the VCEA transition to renewable energy sources. They plan to have recommendations for legislation by December.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-98/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dscf7040-1024x6831757587186.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=hwVV2xXk,N,,2025-09-11 06:58:40.449135

The electric vehicles it plans to build in Kentucky will be based on the RAV4 and the Land Cruiser, said a person familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly.

Toyota will end production of the ES sedan of its luxury Lexus brand at the Kentucky plant, the person said. The next-generation version of the model, due next year, will be manufactured in Japan, as the company announced in 2021.

In the US, Toyota currently makes Lexus ES sedans at its Kentucky plant and Lexus TX sport utility vehicles at its Indiana facility.

On Tuesday, the Nikkei newspaper reported Toyota would consolidate production of Lexus brand cars in the US to a single location in the face of high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.

In response to that report, Toyota said the information was not something announced by the company, adding that it continually reviews its production structure as part of efforts to make ever-better cars.

“Eco Wave Power made history by deploying its innovative wave energy technology into U.S. waters for the very first time,” Barragán said.
“Eco Wave Power is one of those exciting technologies that is ready to scale.
We can’t do it without localized energy sources.” At the launch event, state and local officials presented Eco Wave Power with formal recognitions.
His organization is conducting a feasibility study with Eco Wave Power for a site at the Port of Ngqura, with further expansion planned in Kenya.","Eco Wave Power has launched the first-ever US onshore wave energy project at the Port of Los Angeles, a milestone for renewable energy in the country. The project was developed in partnership with AltaSea and Shell Marine Renewable Energy (MRE).

The installation uses floaters that capture the motion of ocean waves to generate electricity. While currently a demonstration site, the project is designed to lay the groundwork for larger commercial-scale operations in the future.

Congresswoman Nanette Díaz Barragán, who has introduced the Marine Energy Technologies Acceleration Act – a $1 billion initiative to scale marine energy nationwide – called the launch a historic step.

“Eco Wave Power made history by deploying its innovative wave energy technology into U.S. waters for the very first time,” Barragán said. “This milestone shows incredible potential for wave energy to power our communities with clean, renewable electricity, while creating jobs and protecting our environment.”

Eco Wave Power CEO Inna Braverman said the launch is aligned with California’s Senate Bill 605, which calls for a statewide roadmap for wave energy. “This project shows that with the right policy, we can turn innovation into reality. And we’re just getting started,” Braverman said. She also announced upcoming projects in Taiwan, India, and Portugal.

AltaSea CEO Terry Tamminen described the technology as ready for global scaling. “Eco Wave Power is one of those exciting technologies that is ready to scale. It’s already around the world, and it’s only going to get bigger because it has solved many of the problems that other technologies have come up against for harnessing something as challenging as wave energy,” Tamminen said.

Michael J. Galvin, Director of Waterfront and Commercial Real Estate at the Port of Los Angeles, linked the project to the port’s climate goals. “The San Pedro Bay Port Complex has big goals to get to zero emissions in the next decade,” Galvin said. “Projects like this are super important to get us there. We can’t do it without localized energy sources.”

At the launch event, state and local officials presented Eco Wave Power with formal recognitions. California State Senator Laura Richardson said the project demonstrated “commitment to energy innovation,” while Los Angeles Councilmember Tim McOsker called it “a remarkable milestone – not just for your team, but for the future of clean energy.”

The event drew international partners, underscoring the global momentum behind wave energy. Sandra Lee, speaking on behalf of CY Huang of I-Ke in Taiwan, said a pilot project is already being prepared at Suao Port. “Just as the LA pilot turns that port into a living laboratory, Suao will become a blueprint for replication across Taiwan’s working harbors — and eventually across the region,” she said.

Wilfred Emmanuel, CEO of Africa Great Future Development, highlighted plans for South Africa. “With more than 2,800 kilometers of coastline, South Africa has enormous wave energy potential to diversify the energy mix, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and provide sustainable, reliable electricity,” Emmanuel said.

,IRA Tax Credits,2025-09-11 08:19:22+00:00,Grist,"Students, schools race to save clean energy projects in face of Trump deadline - Grist.org","Julia Gentin, The Hechinger Report, Julia Gentin, The Hechinger Report",,,,,https://grist.org/energy/students-schools-race-to-save-clean-energy-projects-in-face-of-trump-deadline/,"Now, access to those funds is disappearing, leaving Tucson and other school systems across the country scrambling to find ways to cover the costs of clean energy projects.
The law discontinues many clean energy tax credits, including those used by schools for solar power and electric vehicles, created under the IRA.
As a result, many students, consultants, and sustainability leaders said, they have no plans to abandon clean energy projects.
Lily Strehlow, campus sustainability coordinator at the University of Wisconsin, Eau-Claire, said the planning cycle for clean energy projects at the school can take 10 years.
“At this point, everybody’s holding their breath,” said Rick Brown, founder of California-based TerraVerde Energy, a clean energy consultant to schools and agencies.","Tanish Doshi was in high school when he pushed the Tucson Unified School District to take on an ambitious plan to reduce its climate footprint. In Oct. 2024, the availability of federal tax credits encouraged the district to adopt the $900 million plan, which involves goals of achieving net-zero emissions and zero waste by 2040, along with adding a climate curriculum to schools.

Now, access to those funds is disappearing, leaving Tucson and other school systems across the country scrambling to find ways to cover the costs of clean energy projects.

The Arizona school district, which did not want to impose an economic burden on its low-income population by increasing bonds or taxes, had expected to rely in part on federal dollars provided by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, Doshi said.

But under HR1, or the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” passed on July 4, Tucson schools will not be able to receive all of the expected federal funding in time for their upcoming clean energy projects. The law discontinues many clean energy tax credits, including those used by schools for solar power and electric vehicles, created under the IRA. When schools and other tax-exempt organizations receive these credits, they come in the form of a direct cash reimbursement.

At the same time, Tucson and thousands of districts across the country that were planning to develop solar and wind power projects are now forced to decide between accelerating them to try to meet HR1’s fast-approaching “commence construction” deadline of June 2026, finding other sources of funding, or hitting pause on their plans. Tina Cook, energy project manager for Tucson schools, said the district might have to scale back some of its projects unless it can find local sources of funding.

“Phasing out the tax credits for wind and solar energy is going to make a huge, huge difference,” said Doshi, 18, now a first-year college student. “It ends a lot of investments in poor and minority communities. You really get rid of any notion of environmental justice that the IRA had advanced.”

The tax credits in the IRA, the largest legislative investment in climate projects in U.S. history, had marked a major opportunity for schools and colleges to reduce their impact on the environment. K-12 school infrastructure releases an estimated 41 million metric tons of emissions per year, according to an analysis from the New Buildings Institute. The K-12 school system’s buses — some 480,000 — and meals also produce significant emissions and waste. Clean energy projects supported by the IRA were helping schools not only to limit their climate toll but also to save money on energy costs over the long term and improve student health, advocates said.

As a result, many students, consultants, and sustainability leaders said, they have no plans to abandon clean energy projects. They said they want to keep working to cut emissions, even though that may be more difficult now.

Sara Ross, co-founder of UndauntedK12, which helps school districts green their operations, divided HR1’s fallout on schools into three categories: the good, the bad, and the ugly.

On the bright side, she said, schools can still get up to 50 percent off for installing ground source heat pumps — those credits will continue — to more efficiently heat schools. The network of pipes in a ground source pump cycles heat from the shallow earth into buildings.

In the “bad” category, any electric vehicle acquired after September 30 of this year will not be eligible for tax credits — drastically accelerating the IRA’s phaseout timeline by seven years. That applies to electric school buses as well as electric vehicle charging stations at schools. EPA’s Clean School Bus Program still exists for two more years and covers two-thirds of the funding for all electric school buses districts acquire in that time. The remaining one-third, however, was to be covered by federal and state tax credits.

The expiration of the federal tax credits could cost a district up to $40,000 more per vehicle, estimated Sue Gander, director of the Electric School Bus Initiative run by the nonprofit World Resources Institute.

Solar projects will see the most “ugly” effects of HR1, Ross said.

Los Angeles Unified School District is planning to build 21 solar projects on roofs, carports, and other structures, plus 13 electric vehicle charging sites, as part of an effort to reduce energy costs and achieve 100 percent renewable energy by 2040. The district anticipated receiving around $25 million in federal tax credits to help pay for the $90 million contract, said Christos Chrysiliou, chief eco-sustainability officer for the district. With the tight deadlines imposed by HR1, the district can no longer count on receiving that money.

“It’s disappointing,” Chrysiliou said. “It’s nice to be able to have that funding in place to meet the goals and objectives that we have.”

LAUSD is looking at a small portion of a $9 billion bond measure passed last year, as well as utility rebates, third-party financing and grants from the California Energy Commission, to help make up for some of the gaps in funding.

Many California State University campuses are in a similar position as they work to install solar to meet the system’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2045, said Lindsey Rowell, CSU’s chief energy, sustainability, and transportation officer.

Tariffs on solar panel materials from overseas and the early sunsetting of tax credits mean that “the cost of these projects is becoming prohibitive for campuses,” Rowell said.

Sweeps of undocumented immigrants in California may also lead to labor shortages that could slow the pace of construction, Rowell added. “Limiting the labor force in any way is only going to result in an increased cost, so those changes are frightening as well,” she said.

New Treasury Department guidance issued August 15 made it much harder for projects to meet the threshold needed to qualify for the tax credits. Renewable energy projects previously qualified for credits once a developer spent 5 percent of a project’s cost. But the guidelines have been tightened — now, larger projects must pass a “physical work test,” meaning “significant physical labor has begun on a site,” before they can qualify for credits. With the construction commencement deadline looming next June, these will likely leave many projects ineligible for credits.

“The rules are new, complex, [and] not widely understood,” Ross said. “We’re really concerned about schools’ ability to continue to do solar projects and be able to effectively navigate these new rules.”

Schools without “fancy legal teams” may struggle to understand how the new tax credit changes in HR1 will affect their finances and future projects, she added.

Some universities were just starting to understand how the IRA tax credits could help them fund projects. Lily Strehlow, campus sustainability coordinator at the University of Wisconsin, Eau-Claire, said the planning cycle for clean energy projects at the school can take 10 years. The university is in the process of adding solar to the roof of a large science building, and depending on the date of completion, the project “might or might not” qualify for the credits, she said.

“At this point, everybody’s holding their breath,” said Rick Brown, founder of California-based TerraVerde Energy, a clean energy consultant to schools and agencies.

Brown said that none of his company’s projects is in a position where it’s not going to get done, but the company may end up seeing fewer new projects due to a higher cost of equipment.

Tim Carter, president of Second Nature, which supports climate work in education, added that colleges and universities are in a broader period of uncertainty, due to larger attacks from the Trump administration, and are not likely to make additional investments at this time: “We’re definitely in a wait and see.”

For youth activists, the fallout from HR1 is “disheartening,” Doshi said.

Emma and Molly Weber, climate activists since eighth grade, said they are frustrated. The Colorado-based twins, who will start college this fall, helped secure the first “Green New Deal for Schools” resolution in the nation in the Boulder Valley School District. Its goals include working toward a goal of “zero net energy” by 2050, making school buildings greener, creating pathways to green jobs, and expanding climate change education.

“It feels very demoralizing to see something you’ve been working so hard at get slashed back, especially since I’ve spoken to so many students from all over the country about these clean energy tax credits, being like, ‘These are the things that are available to you, and this is how you can help convince your school board to work on this,’” Emma Weber said.

The Webers started thinking about other creative ways to pay for the clean energy transition and have settled on advocating for state-level legislation in the form of a climate superfund, where major polluters in a community would be responsible for contributing dollars to sustainability initiatives.

Consultants and sustainability coordinators said that they don’t see the demand for renewable energy going away. “Solar is the cheapest form of energy. It makes sense to put it on every rooftop that we can. And that’s true with or without tax credits,” Strehlow said.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/K12climate-post-obbba-3.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-09-11 04:58:02.996367

Perry served as U.S. energy secretary from March 2017 to December 2019.
However, the engineering, construction, and licensing of nuclear reactors is a complex and highly regulated undertaking, Fermi stated in its filing.
She previously worked on the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant, where she oversaw regulatory coordination.
Fermi’s combined licenses application for 4 gigawatts of nuclear power has undergone a preliminary review and has been accepted for processing by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.","After opening in January, would-be data center builder Fermi America has aggressive plans to build four nuclear reactors near Amarillo, Texas by 2038, but has not yet signed a lease for the land, or one tenant for the massive buildout.

Data center builder Fermi America plans to construct four nuclear reactors along the plains outside of Amarillo, Texas, home to the largest natural gas fields in America and next door to where the U.S. builds nuclear weapons, though the company acknowledges that its management team has “limited experience” in the nuclear sector, and the CEO is currently fighting accusations of fraud.

The details were disclosed in Fermi America’s application for an initial public offering filed Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. CRN has reached out to Fermi America for comment.

The company, focused on landing AI hyperscale tenants, hopes to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “FRMI.”

The building of the “first-of-its-kind"" energy campus called “Project Matador” expects to produce 11 gigawatts of behind-the-meter power for AI infrastructure through the use of four, full-scale Westinghouse nuclear reactors, along with 4.5 gigawatts of gas-fired power, solar PV arrays, and battery energy storage systems.

The 5,263-acre site is owned by the Texas Tech University System and sits beside the Panhandle-Hugoton Gas Field, which is one of the largest known natural gas fields in the U.S., the filing states. Project Matador also abuts Pantex, where the U.S. Department of Energy has built and now disassembles nuclear weapons and stores plutonium, according to the Pantex website.

“Project Matador, is among the largest hybrid infrastructure developments in the United States, that will combine hyperscale data centers and vertically integrated energy assets on a single site,” the filing states. “Project Matador is designed to host power generation, transmission, compute workloads, and chip manufacturing equipment all within the same perimeter.”

In order to hold on to the lease of that property and begin building, Fermi said it must show the lease holder, Texas Tech University, that it has secured “fully and unconditional funding for Phase 1.” If it can’t do that by Dec. 31, it risks losing the lease.

The project is currently in “Phase 0” and development through “Phase 1” is expected to cost at least $2 billion with a target to finish that by December 2026. To win that money and lock up its lease of the land, the company has embarked on the IPO, the filing states. The full build-out across all phases of Project Matador is expected to see a pricetag between $70 billion to $90 billion.

Fermi recently won $100 million in Series C preferred equity funding along with a $250 million loan from the Macquarie Group. The company has also raised $246 million in debt financing since May.

It has applied for a 10-year property tax abatement from Carson County, Texas. The Carson County Commissioners Court may review the request in the third quarter 2025, the filing states.

The company has generated no revenue to date, and expects financial losses to continue “for the foreseeable future” as it builds out its power footprint, Fermi America stated in the filing. It hopes to see tenant revenue begin in 2027, but it does not expect to see fully operating and capital requirements until phase four of Project Matador when it has successfully deployed up to six nuclear reactors on two nuclear islands in 2038.

Fermi plans to deliver a full 1 gigawatt of capacity by the end of 2026, with 46 percent coming from natural gas, 46 percent coming from mobile generators, and 8 percent purchased from the grid.

In May, it began the purchase of turbine and power equipment from Seimens. This includes “a combined cycle gas power plant rated at 487 MW.” Fermi said the equipment has been fully fabricated and is ready for shipment, but it remains warehoused at Siemens staging facilities in Germany, Sweden, Vietnam and China pending final delivery and assembly. Fermi still owes Seimens $134 million plus shipping costs, which are expected to total between $10 million and $12 million.

Once those are delivered, Fermi hopes to have that plant in operation by April 2026.

Fermi America’s CEO and cofounder is Toby Neugebauer, who co-founded Quantum Energy Partners in 1998, which was a private equity firm focused on energy investments. He also founded Windrock Capital, which was acquired by Macquarie. In 2022, he operated GloriFi, a bank that has declared bankruptcy. Fermi’s other co-founder is former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Perry served as U.S. energy secretary from March 2017 to December 2019.

Nuclear Ambitions

As a “core component” of Project Matador’s power platform, Fermi plans to build four AP1000 pressurized water reactors developed by Westinghouse to provide 4 gigawatts of power to the site, with the first one beginning construction on Dec. 31, 2026, for a 2032 commission and then another in 2034, 2035 and 2036. Additionally ,the company is drafting plans to build another 2 gigawatts of nuclear power from small modular reactors.

However, the engineering, construction, and licensing of nuclear reactors is a complex and highly regulated undertaking, Fermi stated in its filing.

“Our management team has limited experience in the nuclear energy sector, which may hinder our ability to effectively navigate the complex technical, regulatory, and operational challenges associated with Westinghouse Reactor and SMR (small modular reactor) projects,” Fermi America wrote. “This lack of experience could lead to delays, misjudgments, or failure to anticipate critical risks, further increasing project costs and timelines.”

In August, the company hired Mesut Uzman as chief nuclear officer.

Uzman previously worked in the United Arab Emirates, China and Bulgaria and led the successful development of the 5.6-gigawatt Barakah nuclear project in the UAE, which recently celebrated its first year of operation and is comprised of four APR-1400 nuclear reactors. He played key roles in the construction and commissioning of 12 nuclear units in China, including four Westinghouse reactors, the company said.

Fermi also hired Mesut Uzman’s wife, Sezin Uzman, who has been named vice president of nuclear supply chain and compliance. She previously worked on the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant, where she oversaw regulatory coordination.

Fermi’s power plans include two gigawatts of small modular nuclear reactors, called SMRs, which are in the early stages of development and deployment globally. Fermi wrote and the technology is still under evaluation.

“The limited availability of commercially viable SMRs poses additional risks. The technology is still emerging, with few operational SMRs globally, and the supply chain for specialized components is underdeveloped,” the company warned.

‘Risk Of An Accidental Explosion’ And Access To Thousands Of Nuclear Professionals

In the SEC filing’s risk section, Fermi said also of concern is Project Matador’s proximity to Pantex, a high security U.S. Department of Energy facility for nuclear weapon assembly and disassembly that is also on the national priorities list as a superfund site. The last nuclear weapon assembled there was in 1991, according to Pantex’ website.

This cuts both ways, Fermi said as it offers “normalization of nuclear activity” as well as logistical resource and infrastructure benefits, but comes with the potential danger of an “accidental explosion” or “catastrophic incident” at either facility.

“In addition, there is a risk of an accidental explosion or other catastrophic incident. Such an incident at the Pantex Plant or on the Project Matador Site could materially and adversely affect Project Matador, including causing significant construction delays, significant disruption of operations and damage to infrastructure and equipment,” the company disclosed.

On the other hand, Fermi said Pantex – the nation’s primary nuclear weapons center – is home to 4,600 “skilled nuclear professionals,” which the company highlighted as a resource for labor at its own facility.

“Our proximity to the Pantex Plant offers us the opportunity to access a highly experienced workforce steeped in nuclear safety culture and expertise,” the company stated. “We believe this proximity to critical United States nuclear and security infrastructure will be highly attractive to our prospective tenants.”

Fermi: Project Matador’s Timeline Is ‘Aggressive’

Nuclear power development in the U.S. has “slowed dramatically,” Fermi said with the most recently certified nuclear plant in Georgia taking 15 years to complete.

Yet Fermi plans to build and switch on the nation’s second largest nuclear generation complex comprised of four traditional nuclear reactors and two small modular reactors — 6 gigawatts of nuclear power — by 2038, 13 years from now.

Fermi is relying on the Trump administration’s push to hurry sign-offs for nuclear power projects. The administration has shortened the approval time for new nuclear reactor license applications to no more than 18 months. The goal is to have three new nuclear plants reach “criticality” by July 2026.

Fermi’s combined licenses application for 4 gigawatts of nuclear power has undergone a preliminary review and has been accepted for processing by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Fermi is holding to a five-year construction cycle for each nuclear plant, basing that on projects that were completed in China and the UAE, it stated in the filing.

However, Fermi acknowledged there are risks to betting that looser regulations will remain in place.

“There can be no guarantee that this executive order will be effective in doing so or that a future Presidential administration will not reverse this executive order,” Fermi stated. “Indeed, certain recent nuclear power plant projects have taken more than ten years from commencement to completion and the timeline in our model to make the Westinghouse Reactors operational is aggressive,” the company stated.

CEO Buffeted By Fraud Accusations, Lawsuits

Fermi America’s President and CEO Neugebauer was previously the founder and CEO of GloriFi, a short-lived bank that marketed itself as catering to politically conservative causes. In July 2022, that business sought $1.7 billion in funding via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger with DHC Acquisitions. But it later declared bankruptcy.

In January 2023, Animo Service, an affiliate of GloriFi filed for bankruptcy and the trustee filed adversary proceedings against Neugebauer accusing him of a series of fraudulent transfers and breaches of fiduciary duty.

In February 2023, GloriFi’s bankruptcy trustee did the same, and also filed adversarial proceedings against Neugebauer “alleging a series of fraudulent transfers and breaches of fiduciary duties.”

Then in March of 2023, GloriFi investors filed a lawsuit against Neugebauer alleging “fraudulent inducement, negligent misrepresentations, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment and exemplary damages.”

Neugebauer contests the allegations and has filed his own federal lawsuits against GloriFi investors in Georgia and Delaware under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.

In it he takes aim at high-profile conservative power brokers and campaign donors who invested in GloriFi, including Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, Peter Theil’s Founder’s Fund, and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. He accuses the group of attempting to wrest away control of the business and oust him as CEO. His suit is on hold while Texas courts wade through the allegations in GloriFi’s bankruptcy proceedings.

In response to an email from CRN, a Citadel spokesperson provided a news story in which a spokesman for Griffin called Neugebauer’s claims “fabricated nonsense.” A LinkedIn message to Founders Fund’s chief communication officer was not immediately returned.

The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate requires all EU airports to blend 2% SAF by 2025, rising to 70% by 2050. The United States, under the Inflation Reduction Act, offers tax credits of $1.25 to $1.75 per gallon of SAF, tied to emissions reductions of at least 50%. Singapore plans to mandate a 1% SAF blend in 2026, increasing to 3-5% by 2030, and charge a SAF levy to fund supply chain development. Japan targets 10% SAF use by 2030, while South Korea mandates 1% for international flights by 2027.

Airlines are responding. Many carriers have signed multi-year offtake agreements. Corporate travel programmes are also investing in SAF purchases, reflecting a growing willingness to pay for climate-conscious flying.

Yet the challenge looms. Global SAF production in 2024 stood at just 1.3 billion litres – barely 0.3% of total jet fuel demand. Even with 2024 volumes doubling, output remains far short due to weak airline margins and limited incentives. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), aviation requires 450 billion litres of SAF annually by 2050 to meet net-zero goals, with SAF delivering 65% of emission reduction. Meeting this target would require investments of nearly $128 billion per year.

India is the world’s third-largest aviation market, with more than 350 million passengers annually. Domestic air travel is growing at 10–12% per year, and fleet expansions at Air India and IndiGo will significantly increase aviation emissions within a decade. Efficiency gains from newer aircraft and better operations will help, but not nearly enough.

Here, SAF offers a realistic bridge between growth and sustainability. Unlike many countries, India enjoys a natural feedstock advantage. It produces around 680 million tonnes of agricultural residue annually, of which 180 million tonnes is surplus. Add to this used cooking oil, non-edible oilseeds, sugarcane by-products like bagasse and press mud, and organic municipal waste, and the potential is significant. With these pathways – Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), Fischer-Tropsch, and Alcohol-to-Jet – India could produce 8–10 million tonnes of SAF each year, enough to meet a 50% blend by 2030.

India’s successful ethanol blending programme offers valuable lessons. Rising from 1.5% in 2014 to more than 19% in July 2025, it has built supply chains, policies, and production facilities that could provide a springboard for SAF.

India’s SAF story is a classic paradox – abundant feedstock and rising demand on one side, but negligible production and weak incentives on the other. With the right mix of policy clarity, investment support, technology choices, and global partnerships, India can not only decarbonise its domestic skies but also emerge as a global hub for SAF supply.

As automakers and energy firms race to dominate the next frontier of mobility, strategic talent acquisition and R&D innovation have emerged as the linchpins of competitive advantage. For investors, understanding these dynamics is critical to identifying leaders in a market projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 22.2% through 2030 Electric Vehicle Battery Market Size | Industry Report, 2030[ 3 ].

The Talent Arms Race: Paying Premiums for Specialized Skills

The EV battery sector's reliance on cutting-edge technology has intensified competition for skilled professionals. In China, where the industry is most advanced, battery thermal management experts now command salaries ranging from $130,000 to $220,000 annually, reflecting the scarcity of expertise in optimizing battery performance and safety Explosion of High-Paying Jobs in China: The Golden Era ...[ 2 ]. Similarly, Huawei and other tech giants are offering seven-figure compensation packages to attract young engineers for autonomous driving and AI-powered battery monitoring systems, underscoring the sector's pivot toward software-driven innovation Explosion of High-Paying Jobs in China: The Golden Era ...[ 2 ].

This talent war extends beyond salaries. Companies are investing in employer branding, sustainability initiatives, and career development programs to retain workers in an industry marked by high attrition—projected to reach 14.6% globally Hiring Trends in Automotive Industry 2023- 2025[ 5 ]. For instance, expatriate technical directors in the EV sector earn up to 50% more than their domestic counterparts, incentivizing firms to expand operations into high-growth markets like India and Southeast Asia Hiring Trends in Automotive Industry 2023- 2025[ 5 ].

R&D Acceleration: Innovation as a Strategic Asset

R&D spending in the EV battery sector has surged, fueled by the need to reduce costs, enhance energy density, and mitigate supply chain risks. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), nearly 90% of global cathode active material manufacturing capacity is concentrated in China, but innovation is diversifying. Breakthroughs in sodium-ion batteries and the adoption of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry are reducing dependence on critical minerals like nickel and cobalt, addressing both environmental and geopolitical concerns Trends in electric vehicle batteries – Global EV Outlook 2024[ 4 ].

Collaborative R&D is also gaining traction. Strategic partnerships between battery manufacturers, automakers, and energy suppliers are accelerating the commercialization of next-generation technologies. For example, SAP's integration of predictive analytics into EV production processes has improved efficiency and reduced time-to-market for new battery models Electric Vehicle Battery Market Size | Industry Report, 2030[ 3 ]. These alliances are not just about sharing costs—they're about creating ecosystems that can rapidly iterate on design and scale production.

Corporate Strategies: Localization and Global Partnerships

To meet the projected $61.31 billion market size in 2024 and its trajectory through 2030 Electric Vehicle Battery Market Size | Industry Report, 2030[ 3 ], companies are localizing production near demand centers. This strategy, however, requires not just capital but also talent. Firms like CATL and Panasonic are establishing joint ventures in North America and Europe, leveraging local engineering talent while retaining core R&D in Asia. Such hybrid models allow for rapid scaling without sacrificing innovation.

China's dominance in battery manufacturing—over 97% of anode active material capacity—remains a key factor, but competitors are emerging. The European Union and the U.S. are incentivizing domestic production through subsidies and tax credits, creating a fragmented yet dynamic global supply chain Trends in electric vehicle batteries – Global EV Outlook 2024[ 4 ]. For investors, this fragmentation highlights the importance of firms with diversified manufacturing footprints and strong R&D pipelines.

Challenges and Opportunities

Despite progress, structural challenges persist. A shortage of skilled workers in manufacturing and advanced technology sectors, exacerbated by misaligned education systems and labor market preferences, threatens to slow growth EV infrastructure roll out + Manufacturing sector + Talent ...[ 1 ]. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions over mineral sourcing and trade policies add uncertainty.

Yet these challenges also create opportunities. Companies that invest in reskilling programs, AI-driven R&D, and sustainable battery chemistries are poised to outperform. For instance, firms pioneering sodium-ion technology—such as those in Japan and the U.S.—could disrupt the market by offering lower-cost alternatives to lithium-ion batteries.

Conclusion: Investing in the Talent-Driven Future

The EV battery sector's future hinges on its ability to attract and retain talent while accelerating R&D. For investors, this means prioritizing companies with robust talent strategies, collaborative innovation ecosystems, and agile supply chains.

(HARTFORD) — The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) released a final Request for Proposals (RFP) on an expedited schedule for solar and onshore wind facilities. DEEP is pursuing this RFP to seek bids from clean energy projects that could diversify the state’s energy sources, improve electric reliability, and save ratepayers money.

DEEP is working on an expedited schedule to identify late-stage projects that can capture federal tax incentives before they expire pursuant to the federal budget reconciliation bill passed by Congress earlier this summer. Federal tax incentives can make projects more cost competitive for ratepayers, hence DEEP’s effort to solicit bids from projects before tax credits expire. The RFP also allows Connecticut to coordinate with other New England states, including with Massachusetts under its relevant state authority.

“The decision by the federal administration and Congress to eliminate federal tax credits for resources like solar and wind will needlessly drive up the cost of a readily available domestic energy resource at a time that we need to grow all forms of energy supply to support a thriving economy,” said Katie Dykes, Commissioner of DEEP. “DEEP is taking steps to consider projects that can capitalize on these federal tax credits before they expire, as we continue to pursue ‘all of the above’ options to provide affordable, reliable energy supply in the long term.”

This expedited RFP is a follow up to the Energy Action Update webinar DEEP held on July 24, 2025, reviewing the impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on clean energy projects, and subsequent the Request for Information (RFI) DEEP released on July 25, 2025, seeking expressions of interest from project developers who believe that they can (1) meet the end of 2027 in service date to qualify for production or investment tax credits authorized by sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code, or (2) meet the July 4, 2026, start of construction requirement to continue to make use of the production or investment tax credits authorized by sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code.

However, unlike the previous Plug-In Car Grant offered under the Conservatives until 2022, the new ECG is awarded exclusively based on how sustainable an electric car is.
So, we're taking a look at EV sustainability to try and add some clarity to the sustainable EV situation.
Greg Archer, the campaign group's former UK director, said: 'The valuable minerals mined to make electric car batteries will be used and reused unlike those of oil.
'In comparison only 30kg of metals would be lost each time an electric car battery is recycled – roughly the size of a football.'","The Government launched an Electric Car Grant in July in a bid to invigorate interest in new EVs.

However, unlike the previous Plug-In Car Grant offered under the Conservatives until 2022, the new ECG is awarded exclusively based on how sustainable an electric car is.

In the Government's words, the grant will 'back UK and other manufacturers, with eligibility dependent on the highest manufacturing sustainability standards'.

Car makers are being awarded either a lower Band2 2 £1,500 subsidy or a higher Band 1 £3,750 subsidy depending on how each model complies with these 'sustainability standards.'

And yet everyone from manufacturers to experts and buyers are confused by these 'standards'.

To date, 35 EVs are confirmed eligible for the discounts - but just two for the full Band 1 £3,750 amount.

Why this is the case, the Department for Transport won't yet divulge. What is clear is that the Government is not on a general push towards EVs now, but a push towards only certain EVs.

But EVs and sustainability is nothing new: the debate about how green EVs really are has been raging as long as early adopters first hopped in their zero emission models, and manufacturers have long been investing in sustainable production to make sure they past muster.

So, we're taking a look at EV sustainability to try and add some clarity to the sustainable EV situation. Is green really green?

Government's criteria for what makes a sustainable EV

The Government says its criteria for sustainably produced cars 'is in recognition of the need to address embedded carbon emissions across a vehicle's lifetime, as well as tailpipe emissions'.

At a minimum this means the manufacturer must hold a verified science based target.

These are commitments corporate entities make to reduce their environmental impact and are verified by the independent Science Based Targets Initiative.

As we've briefly mentioned, the Government has tiered its grant so that the amount available per vehicle (on or under the £37,000 price cap) will depend on the level of emissions associated with the production of the vehicle; the most sustainable get £3,750, less sustainable models get £1,500. Those that don't qualify at all will get £0.

Emissions from vehicle production are assessed against the carbon intensity of electricity grid in the country where vehicle assembly and battery production are located.

How does this compare to manufacturer sustainability standards?

While the Government is just now looking at lifetime emissions of electric cars, manufacturers have been doing this for a considerable period.

Swedish brands Polestar and Volvo, both owned by Geely, are leaders in sustainability reporting that goes far beyond just EVs.

Volvo has been publishing an annual sustainability report for years, with its Annual Sustainability Report accessible online all the way back to 2007.

Its first EV was launched in 2019, and along with it came the Carbon Footprint Report: Battery electric XC40 recharge and the XC40 ICE: 43 pages covering everything from 'end-of-life of the vehicle' to 'material production and refining' and the results of a comparison between the XC40 Recharge and ICE driving 200,000km.

This is now a yearly occasion, with every new Volvo EV model being scrutinised to the nth-degree of sustainability.

Then when Polestar appeared on the scene, it not only published annual sustainability reports, but gave customers the option to deep-dive into sustainability while on the Polestar website - you can trace every car's whole sustainability journey if you so wish, and read through exam level sustainability insights.

It's not just Scandi brands though: Ford, Kia, BMW, Mercedes are just a few of the manufacturers who publish sustainability reports with as much weight to them as annual financial reports.

Not granted: The many cheap EVs that likely won't meet the Government's criteria

The Government might have announced the first 35 models that qualify, but we don't and won't know at any point why each manufacturer is awarded the level it is.

What we do know is that it is almost certain that Chinese EVs won't qualify, and that South Korean brands are unlikely to either.

Transport Minister Lilian Greenwood told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on 16 July: 'We don't expect any cars that are assembled in China to be eligible for this scheme.'

As chief executive of EV website Electrifying - and all-round EV expert - Ginny Buckley points out: 'The reality is that car making is a global business. Even if your car doesn't bear a Chinese badge, the chances are part of it was manufactured there.'

So, while you shouldn't put a new BYD with a Government Electric Car Grant discount on your bingo card, also don't put a Dacia Spring, Volvo EX30 or Mini Electric on it either, because as Ginny says, these are all partially made in China.

How sustainable are EVs really? Is battery production the Achilles heel?

The main reason EVs aren't seen as 'green' in some eyes is the battery: Either end of the battery's life - manufacturing and recycling - and the use of raw materials.

There are four essential raw materials battery manufacturers need to secure in order to produce electric car batteries; Lithium, nickel, cobalt and high-purity manganese.

Mckinsey's December 2024 Toward security in sustainable battery raw material supply report found that battery producers use more than 80 per cent of all lithium mined today.

By 2030 though that is predicted to rise up to 95 per cent.

While around 65 per cent of demand for class 1 nickel today originates from the stainless steel sector, the battery sector is set to compete with this contributing to a possible shortage in 2030.

On the other hand about 64 per cent of cobalt – largely a by-product of copper and nickel production – originates in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Mckinsey states.

Its analysts predict that demand for cobalt could rise by 7.5 per cent a year from 2023 to 2030, even though the share of cobalt in battery mixes is expected to decrease.

Shortages are unlikely to arise but a resurgence in demand is possible.

Using the latest demand estimates, Mckinsey predicts that in 2030 only about 20 per cent of the high-purity manganese supply will meet the requirement of battery applications, which in itself will only equate to about five per cent of the total demand for manganese.

However, this could change with the rapid adoption of Lithium Iron Phosphate technology.

What's being done to use less raw materials in battery production?

Lithium iron phosphate batteries have become the 'rising star' of the battery industry thanks to the fact that they reduce reliance on cobalt and nickel, which addresses sustainability concerns at the same time as bringing down costs of production.

The International Energy Agency's (IEA) 2024 Global EV Outlook report found that LPF has supplied more than 40 per cent of EV demand globally by capacity in 2023, more than double the share recorded in 2020.

Despite LFP being invented in the US in 1997, China has been the only country mass-producing LFP since 2010. Today two-thirds of EV sales in China use this chemistry, and China produces 70 per cent of the world's EVs.

In Europe and the US, LFP remains below 10 per cent.

However, there's a shift towards LFP batteries in Europe, with BMW announcing LFP batteries in its EVs from this year and Volkswagen confirming it will use cheaper LFP batteries from 2026. They both join Tesla (among others) which has been using LFP batteries in the majority of its new EVs since 2022.

2025 analysis published in Scientific Reports by a team based out of China discovered that replacing nickel-cobalt-manganese batteries with lithium iron phosphate batteries and combined with battery recycling can reduce lithium, cobalt, and nickel demand between 2021 and 2060 by up to 7.8 million tons.

Similarly new lithium manganese-rich (LMR) batteries used far fewer raw materials.

Comparatively composition of LMR cells is around just 35 per cent nickel, 65 per cent manganese, and virtually no cobalt.

There is of course the issue that a massive increase in demand for manganese as LMR batteries become popular will see manganese contributions to manufacturing emission rise.

Human rights issues with EV battery production – Amnesty International report

Last year Amnesty International's study revealed that many of the world's leading EV manufacturers are not adequately demonstrating how they address human rights risks in their mineral supply chains.

Amnesty scored 13 key manufacturers using criteria based on international standards to comprehensively assess their human rights due diligence policies and self-reported practices, with the automakers awarded a score out of 90.

Worryingly none of the companies scored higher than 51/90, with Mercedes-Benz coming out top.

Tesla was second with 49/90 and Stellantis third with 42/90 - showing only 'moderate demonstration' of their commitment to human rights policies, risk identification processes, supply chain mapping and reporting and remediation.

At the other end of the spectrum BYD – the world's largest EV manufacturer – scored the lowest with just 11/90.

Mitsubishi didn't fare much better with 13/90, Hyundai managed 21/90, and Geely Auto (which owns Lotus, Volvo and Polestar) and Nissan both scored 22/90.

Renault and GM sat in the middle with 27/90 and 32/90 respectively (both showing 'minimal demonstration'), while Ford, BMW and VW all scored 41/90 - 'moderate demonstration'.

Amnesty International's Secretary General, Agnès Callamard commented: 'While some progress was made, across the board, the scores were a massive disappointment.'

With the main concern being the 'huge risks for people and the environment' caused by mining for materials, Callamard put pressure on car companies 'to use their massive leverage as global minerals buyers to influence upstream mining companies and smelters to mitigate these human rights risks'.

Presumably human rights will be an area of sustainable practice the Government looks at.

Science Based Targets itself cites 'stakeholder engagement guidance' as a key component, where corporations are guided on 'how to engage with and recognize the knowledge and potential contributions of Indigenous peoples, local communities, and other stakeholders who are (directly or indirectly) affected in positive and negative ways by your company's activities and value chains'.

It's important to note that some manufacturers, despite being owned by conglomerates have marque specific commitments to responsible mining and sustainability.

The Volvo Group for instance says that its Sustainable Minerals Program uses 'strict practices to protect human rights'.

EV battery recycling is crucial: Are EVs step towards a cleaner future rather than the perfect answer?

In 2021, environmental think tank Transport & Environment (T&E) analysed that an EV uses up just 30kg of raw materials with recycling compared to the 17,000 litres of petrol burned by the average car.

Crude oil dependency far outweighed the need for battery raw materials, with the gap set to increase further as technological advancements drive down the amount of lithium required to make an EV battery by half over the next decade.

There's an increasing need for battery recycling as there are sufficient mineral reserves in Europe and the UK to manufacture almost 200 million electric cars – enough to replace about two-thirds of Europe's car fleet if recycling of EV batteries is optimised, T&E found.

The European Union enacted a Batteries Regulation law in 2023, which mandates minimum recycled content targets for various battery types, including EV batteries, and sets recycling efficiency targets for different types of waste batteries.

Overall, T&E states that EVs are also far better for the climate, requiring 58 per cent less energy than a petrol car over their lifetime. With better battery recycling, this will only improve.

Greg Archer, the campaign group's former UK director, said: 'The valuable minerals mined to make electric car batteries will be used and reused unlike those of oil.

'Over its lifetime, an average engined car would burn through a stack of oil barrels, 25 storeys high, creating about 40 tonnes of CO2 and worsening global warming.

'In comparison only 30kg of metals would be lost each time an electric car battery is recycled – roughly the size of a football.'",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/01/16/100848541-0-image-a-6_1754062596813.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 04:57:58.575825

The company will assemble two new three-row battery electric SUVs it plans to make at Toyota Kentucky, Toyota Motor North America said in a statement, adding it is “strategically transitioning” production across its Kentucky and Indiana plants.

“Toyota Indiana will continue to assemble the Grand Highlander in its west plant and add assembly of the vehicle to its east plant to accommodate increased production volume,” the company said.

The electric vehicles (EVs) it plans to build in Kentucky will be based on the RAV4 and the Land Cruiser, said a source familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly.

Toyota will end production of the ES sedan of its luxury Lexus brand at the Kentucky plant, the source said. The next-generation version of the model, due next year, will be manufactured in Japan, as the company announced in 2021.

In the US, Toyota currently makes Lexus ES sedans at its Kentucky plant and Lexus TX sport utility vehicles at its Indiana facility.

On Tuesday (Sep 9), the Nikkei newspaper reported that Toyota would consolidate production of Lexus brand cars in the US to a single location in the face of high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.

In response to that report, Toyota said that the information was not something announced by the company, adding that it continually reviews its production structure as part of efforts to make ever-better cars.

The forecasts for 2025 and 2026 fuel ethanol exports were also unchanged.","Aemetis Inc., a renewable natural gas and renewable fuels company focused on low and negative carbon intensity products, on Sept. 9 announced that its Keyes plant subsidiary has signed an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract with NPL Construction Co., a subsidiary of Centuri Holdings Inc., a $2.6 billion revenue infrastructure services contractor, to install a mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) system at the company’s 65 million gallon per year ethanol production facility in Keyes, California, with an estimated total project cost of $30 million.

The project has received approximately $19.7 million in tax credits and grants from the Internal Revenue Service (upon recommendation by the U.S. Department of Energy), California Energy Commission, and Pacific Gas & Electric. The MVR project is scheduled to complete construction in Q2 2026.

Once operational, the MVR system is projected to reduce natural gas usage at the Keyes plant by approximately 80%, generating an estimated $32 million of incremental annual cash flow from energy savings, increasing LCFS credits from a double-digit reduction in the carbon intensity of ethanol produced, and increasing transferrable Section 45Z production tax credits.

“NPL’s construction of the MVR project is designed to deliver a high-return, high-impact upgrade to our California ethanol facility with minimal equity dilution,” said Eric McAfee, Chairman and CEO of Aemetis. “The MVR system is expected to materially improve operating margins, strengthen cash flow, and advance our commitment to reducing emissions from the renewable fuel we produce.”

“We are pleased to expand our partnership with Aemetis in pursuit of a shared public-private commitment to advancing California’s clean energy goals through the production of renewable fuels,” said Centuri US Gas President Dylan Hradek. “We have the people and capabilities to provide the energy infrastructure solutions required to build a more sustainable future and look forward to our role in this project.”

The law discontinues many clean energy tax credits, including those used by schools for solar power and electric vehicles, created under the IRA.
As a result, many students, consultants and sustainability leaders said, they have no plans to abandon clean energy projects.
Lily Strehlow, campus sustainability coordinator at the University of Wisconsin, Eau-Claire, said the planning cycle for clean energy projects at the school can take ten years.
“At this point, everybody’s holding their breath,” said Rick Brown, founder of California-based TerraVerde Energy, a clean energy consultant to schools and agencies.","Tanish Doshi was in high school when he pushed the Tucson Unified School District to take on an ambitious plan to reduce its climate footprint. In Oct. 2024, the availability of federal tax credits encouraged the district to adopt the $900 million plan, which involves goals of achieving net-zero emissions and zero waste by 2040, along with adding a climate curriculum to schools.

Now, access to those funds is disappearing, leaving Tucson and other school systems across the country scrambling to find ways to cover the costs of clean energy projects.

The Arizona school district, which did not want to impose an economic burden on its low-income population by increasing bonds or taxes, had expected to rely in part on federal dollars provided by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, Doshi said.

But under HR1, or the “one big, beautiful bill,” passed on July 4, Tucson schools will not be able to receive all of the expected federal funding in time for their upcoming clean energy projects. The law discontinues many clean energy tax credits, including those used by schools for solar power and electric vehicles, created under the IRA. When schools and other tax-exempt organizations receive these credits, they come in the form of a direct cash reimbursement.

At the same time, Tucson and thousands of districts across the country that were planning to develop solar and wind power projects are now forced to decide between accelerating them to try to meet HR1’s fast-approaching “commence construction” deadline of June 2026, finding other sources of funding or hitting pause on their plans. Tina Cook, energy project manager for Tucson schools, said the district might have to scale back some of its projects unless it could find local sources of funding.

“Phasing out the tax credits for wind and solar energy is going to make a huge, huge difference,” said Doshi, 18, now a first-year college student. “It ends a lot of investments in poor and minority communities. You really get rid of any notion of environmental justice that the IRA had advanced.”

The tax credits in the IRA, the largest legislative investment in climate projects in U.S. history, had marked a major opportunity for schools and colleges to reduce their impact on the environment. Educational institutions are significant contributors to climate change: K-12 school infrastructure, for example, releases at least 41 million metric tons of emissions per year, according to a paper from the Annenberg Institute at Brown University. The K-12 school system’s buses — some 480,000 — and meals also produce significant emissions and waste. Clean energy projects supported by the IRA were helping schools not only to limit their climate toll but also to save money on energy costs over the long term and improve student health, advocates said.

As a result, many students, consultants and sustainability leaders said, they have no plans to abandon clean energy projects. They said they want to keep working to cut emissions, even though that may be more difficult now.

Sara Ross, cofounder of UndauntedK12, which helps school districts green their operations, divided HR1’s fallout on schools into three categories: the good, the bad and the ugly.

On the bright side, she said, schools can still get up to 50 percent off for installing ground source heat pumps — those credits will continue — to more efficiently heat schools. The network of pipes in a ground source pump cycles heat from the shallow earth into buildings.

In the “bad” category, any electric vehicle acquired after Sept. 30 of this year will not be eligible for tax credits — drastically accelerating the IRA’s phase-out timeline by seven years. That applies to electric school buses as well as electric vehicle charging stations at schools. EPA’s Clean School Bus Program still exists for two more years and covers two-thirds of the funding for all electric school buses districts acquire in that time. The remaining one-third, however, was to be covered by federal and state tax credits.

The expiration of the federal tax credits could cost a district up to $40,000 more per vehicle, estimated Sue Gander, director of the Electric School Bus Initiative run by the nonprofit World Resources Institute.

Solar projects will see the most “ugly” effects of HR1, Ross said.

Los Angeles Unified School District is planning to build 21 solar projects on roofs, carports and other structures, plus 13 electric vehicle charging sites, as part of an effort to reduce energy costs and achieve 100 percent renewable energy by 2040. The district anticipated receiving around $25 million in federal tax credits to help pay for the $90 million contract, said Christos Chrysiliou, chief eco-sustainability officer for the district. With the tight deadlines imposed by HR1, the district can no longer count on receiving that money.

“It’s disappointing,” Chrysiliou said. “It’s nice to be able to have that funding in place to meet the goals and objectives that we have.”

LAUSD is looking at a small portion of a $9 billion bond measure passed last year, as well as utility rebates, third-party financing and grants from the California Energy Commission, to help make up for some of the gaps in funding.

Many California State University campuses are in a similar position as they work to install solar to meet the system’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2045, said Lindsey Rowell, CSU’s chief energy, sustainability and transportation officer.

Tariffs on solar panel materials from overseas and the early sunsetting of tax credits mean that “the cost of these projects are becoming prohibitive for campuses,” Rowell said.

Sweeps of undocumented immigrants in California may also lead to labor shortages that could slow the pace of construction, Rowell added. “Limiting the labor force in any way is only going to result in an increased cost, so those changes are frightening as well,” she said.

New Treasury Department guidance, issued Aug. 15, made it much harder for projects to meet the threshold needed to qualify for the tax credits. Renewable energy projects previously qualified for credits once a developer spent 5 percent of a project’s cost. But the guidelines have been tightened — now, larger projects must pass a “physical work test,” meaning “significant physical labor has begun on a site,” before they can qualify for credits. With the construction commencement deadline looming next June, these will likely leave many projects ineligible for credits.

“The rules are new, complex [and] not widely understood,” Ross said. “We’re really concerned about schools’ ability to continue to do solar projects and be able to effectively navigate these new rules.”

Schools without “fancy legal teams” may struggle to understand how the new tax credit changes in HR1 will affect their finances and future projects, she added.

Some universities were just starting to understand how the IRA tax credits could help them fund projects. Lily Strehlow, campus sustainability coordinator at the University of Wisconsin, Eau-Claire, said the planning cycle for clean energy projects at the school can take ten years. The university is in the process of adding solar to the roof of a large science building, and depending on the date of completion, the project “might or might not” qualify for the credits, she said.

“At this point, everybody’s holding their breath,” said Rick Brown, founder of California-based TerraVerde Energy, a clean energy consultant to schools and agencies.

Brown said that none of his company’s projects are in a position where they’re not going to get done, but the company may end up seeing fewer new projects due to a higher cost of equipment.

Tim Carter, president of Second Nature, which supports climate work in education, added that colleges and universities are in a broader period of uncertainty, due to larger attacks from the Trump administration, and are not likely to make additional investments at this time: “We’re definitely in a wait and see.”

For youth activists, the fallout from HR1 is “disheartening,” Doshi said.

Emma and Molly Weber, climate activists since eighth grade, said they are frustrated. The Colorado-based twins, who will start college this fall, helped secure the first “Green New Deal for Schools” resolution in the nation in the Boulder Valley School District. Its goals include working toward a goal of Zero Net Energy by 2050, making school buildings greener, creating pathways to green jobs and expanding climate change education.

“It feels very demoralizing to see something you’ve been working so hard at get slashed back, especially since I’ve spoken to so many students from all over the country about these clean energy tax credits, being like, ‘These are the things that are available to you, and this is how you can help convince your school board to work on this,’” Emma Weber said.

The Webers started thinking about other creative ways to pay for the clean energy transition and have settled on advocating for state-level legislation in the form of a climate superfund, where major polluters in a community would be responsible for contributing dollars to sustainability initiatives.

Consultants and sustainability coordinators said that they don’t see the demand for renewable energy going away. “Solar is the cheapest form of energy. It makes sense to put it on every rooftop that we can. And that’s true with or without tax credits,” Strehlow said.

Looking ahead, solar deployment is forecasted to be 4% lower than pre-HR1 projections by 2030.
“There is considerable downside risk for the solar industry if the federal permitting environment creates more constraints for solar projects,” said Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie.
The report warns that declining solar deployment may hinder the administration’s broader technological ambitions, including AI leadership.","The U.S. solar industry added nearly 18 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity in the first half of 2025, despite a wave of anti-clean energy policies introduced by the Trump administration. Solar and storage accounted for 82% of all new power capacity added to the grid during the period, underscoring the growing market demand for renewable energy solutions.

However, the industry faces significant headwinds. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (HR1) and other recent policy measures are projected to reduce deployment forecasts. According to the U.S. Solar Market Insight Q3 2025 report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie, the low-case scenario estimates that the country could lose 44 GW of solar deployment by 2030 — an 18% decline. When compared with pre-HR1 forecasts, the potential reduction could total 55 GW, or a 21% decline.

“Solar and storage are the backbone of America’s energy future, delivering the majority of new power to the grid at the lowest cost to families and businesses,” said SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “Instead of unleashing this American economic engine, the Trump administration is deliberately stifling investment, which is raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardizing the reliability of our electric grid.”

The report highlights that 77% of all solar capacity installed this year has been built in states that supported President Trump in the 2024 election. Eight of the top ten states for new installations are among them, including Texas, Indiana, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky, and Arkansas.

In terms of manufacturing, the U.S. added 13 GW of new solar module capacity in the first half of 2025, with new or expanded factories in Texas, Indiana, and Minnesota. The country’s total solar module manufacturing capacity now stands at 55 GW. Nevertheless, the report noted a halt in new upstream manufacturing investments in Q2 due to federal policy uncertainty, putting billions of dollars of private investment at risk.

Looking ahead, solar deployment is forecasted to be 4% lower than pre-HR1 projections by 2030. Near-term growth is supported by ongoing projects, tax credit deadlines, and increased demand for electricity amid rising costs and reduced availability of natural gas.

The report also cites concerns about permitting challenges introduced by the Department of the Interior (DOI), which singled out solar projects for more restrictive review. These actions could affect around 44 GW of planned capacity, with Arizona, California, and Nevada among the hardest hit.

“There is considerable downside risk for the solar industry if the federal permitting environment creates more constraints for solar projects,” said Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie. “Further uncertainty from federal policy actions is making the business environment for the solar industry incredibly challenging.”

SEIA has urged DOI Secretary Doug Burgum to reconsider these actions, warning that without reversal, the measures could lead to job losses, higher electricity prices, and a less competitive economy.

The report warns that declining solar deployment may hinder the administration’s broader technological ambitions, including AI leadership. In response, SEIA recently released a grid reliability policy agenda calling for coordinated actions by local, state, and federal leaders to strengthen the U.S. electric grid through solar and storage technologies.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/24-2-1024x576.png,N,,2025-09-11 04:58:14.012990

Far too often, environmentalists and laborers find themselves on opposite sides of a battle. As Global Citizen co-founder Michael Sheldrick recently explained when he guest edited Katherine Hayhoe’s newsletter, “For years, tensions ran high between coal workers and environmental activists. Unions fought to protect jobs. Activists protested outside power stations. Both sides saw the other as part of the problem.” Michael was talking about the town of Collie, in Western Australia, where tensions had simmered, with environmentalists pushing to eliminate coal and union workers fighting for their jobs. But one day, one of the union leaders got the idea to talk about the future with those who were “obsessed with it” — environmentalists. It was for many, Michael said, the first time each side had talked to the other. And what they discovered was that their goals weren’t in opposition to each other. They all wanted a sustainable future. And through respectful conversations, they co-created a future that worked for all of them. With Western Australia moving toward renewables, the workers realized that their skills made them valuable when it came to new systems like battery storage.

There are similar stories playing out around the world, including in West Virginia, where Bluedot contributor Teresa Bergen told us about coal workers turned tour guides. And our reporter Diane Selkirk shared the story of a town in British Columbia who put this type of respectful conversation to work building consensus for clean energy.

That’s exactly the approach encouraged by U.S.-based Climate Changemakers, which organizes “hours of action” for everyday people — many with no background in climate or politics — to spark conversations with neighbors, coworkers, or friends about what change could look like in their own communities.

These sorts of alliances are crucial in our fight against climate change and Dot salutes the union workers and environmentalists who found common ground. Climate Champ kudos for all of them.

U.S. biofuels policy has been politically divisive, pitting the oil industry against the farm interests that underpin U.S. production of biofuels like corn-based ethanol.

At the heart of the current fight is whether larger refineries should be forced to make up for the biofuel blending requirements that small refineries avoid through federal exemptions. The Environmental Protection Agency has submitted a proposal on the issue for White House review, and its contents have not yet been made public.

""Punishing American energy producers who comply with the EPA’s made-up rules isn’t just unfair, it’s bad for everyday consumers. Americans will pay more at the pump and Utah’s refineries will suffer,"" Lee said in a statement.

Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, criticized the legislation as a direct attack on rural America. “We shouldn’t even be having a conversation about reallocation,” Cooper said. “This bill simply rewards the bad behavior of a handful of small refineries who have steadfastly refused to blend renewable fuels and are looking for yet another way to dodge their legal obligation.""

The biofuel fight adds another headache for Trump as he tries to keep Republicans united during the effort to pass his budget and avoid a government shutdown. Funding for federal agencies runs out at the end of the month, and the fight over small refinery exemptions is dividing GOP lawmakers just when Trump needs their support.

The EPA recently cleared a backlog of more than 170 small refinery exemption requests dating back to 2016 — a sweeping move that is now forcing the White House to review how billions of gallons of biofuel blending obligations should be handled going forward.

The EPA offered the White House a preferred option to deal with the exempted gallons, as well as other options that will also be weighed during the review, Reuters reported. A decision is expected in the coming weeks.

The bill, titled the Protect Consumers from Reallocation Costs Act of 2025, would amend the Clean Air Act to prohibit the EPA from reallocating renewable fuel obligations. Republican Senators John Barrasso, of Wyoming, and Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, are also sponsors.

VIRGINIA CENTER FOR INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM AT WHRO

Pound, Va.—Solar on land once mined for coal was a “bit of a notion” for The Nature Conservancy when it purchased the tri-state Cumberland Forest Project in 2019.

That musing escalated to certainty a year later when Virginia legislators approved the milestone Clean Economy Act, which championed renewable power by setting production targets.

“People got jazzed about utility-scale solar with that law,” said Abingdon, Va.-based Greg Meade, who directs TNC’s overarching Cumberland Forest Project. “That appetite convinced us to proceed.”

Carbon-curbing VCEA mandates obligate the state’s two investor-owned electric utilities, Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power, to switch to carbon-free portfolios by 2045 and 2050, respectively.

TNC has outlined plans for 509 megawatts of solar—at least 189 MW of panels and 320 MW of storage—via 25 projects across the 253,000 acres it’s restoring in Central Appalachia. That scale of development would be enough to power roughly 85,000 homes.

Granted, those additions would be a relatively small amount of the initial 2,700 MW of energy storage and 16,100 MW of solar (and onshore wind) spelled out at the law’s outset. But they could still contribute to a VCEA-induced solar juggernaut.

Virginia, where utility-scale solar barely registered before 2020, now ranks in the top 10 nationwide for total installed capacity, according to Solar Energy Industries Association statistics. The 7,133 MW up and running are enough to power 817,000 homes. Almost 9% of the state’s electricity now comes from the sun.

However, Virginia’s impressive climb could slow dramatically with recent, Republican-led assaults on federal incentives for renewable energy. In August, for instance, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would cancel $156 million in grant funds for Virginia under Solar for All, a program geared for low- to moderate-income households.

This month, the Department of Transportation took aim at offshore wind projects, announcing it would withdraw $39 million from the Norfolk Offshore Wind Logistics Port and reneging on a $20 million commitment to the Portsmouth Marine Terminal’s Offshore Wind Development Project.

Norfolk-based Jim Purekal of Advanced Energy United isn’t alone with his fears that solar’s meteoric rise in Virginia will be hamstrung by the slashing of investment and production tax credits wrapped into H.R. 1, signed into law by President Donald Trump on Independence Day.

His disquiet is accentuated in an eight-page report issued by the state’s Commission on Electric Utility Regulation in response to H.R.1.

In Virginia, the budget reconciliation measure would squelch the anticipated development of 15 gigawatts of solar capacity and 1.1 GW of battery capacity by 2035, according to the analysis by Energy Innovation, a non-partisan energy policy think tank with an office in Washington, D.C. Combined, solar and batteries would make up the bulk of the 17 GW in energy generation capacity losses in Virginia by 2035, the think tank calculated.

“We need them to make some tough decisions to support clean energy financially and save money for ratepayers.”

Purekal also worries that measures in Trump’s far-reaching federal law will be detrimental to the steady growth of solar jobs in Virginia and the companies that employ 4,938 workers, according to SEIA. Those jobs are connected to the 199 solar companies—27 manufacturers, 80 developers and 92 related entities—across the state.

Virginia’s energy needs are soaring, mostly propelled by a surge in the construction of electricity-hungry data centers. Unconstrained demand for power is predicted to double over the next decade, according to a December independent forecast commissioned by Virginia’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.

João Ferreira, a regional economist with the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center, lauded TNC for being spot-on with its gumption for siting solar developments on reclaimed minelands.

While projects in mountainous settings tend to be smaller and cost more per megawatt, Ferreira said, one silver lining is that they often produce more jobs and related economic benefits.

TNC reached some of those same conclusions in its nationwide “Mining the Sun” report released in 2024. One analysis stated that Virginia had enough reclaimed coal mines and other degraded lands statewide—some within the 153,000 acres in the Cumberland Forest Project—to balance the meeting of VCEA’s solar requirements with keeping mature forests and valuable agricultural land intact.

The strategy outlined in “Mining the Sun” was birthed about six years ago when the country’s largest environmental organization grasped that opposing all development on properties it sought to preserve wasn’t a productive approach to conservation. That realization prompted TNC to propose a blueprint for scoring climate, conservation and community victories by siting clean energy infrastructure on minelands, landfills, brownfields and other industrial sites.

It’s significant for TNC’s initiative that the Clean Economy Act requires Dominion to procure 200 MW of solar or wind on brownfields—which include reclaimed minelands—by 2035. The utility is allowed to venture outside its service territory boundaries to do so. A portion of Dominion’s 50-MW Highlands Solar array will be installed on the Conservancy’s Cumberland Forest acreage.

TNC expects to put the entire Cumberland Forest Project up for sale to a like-minded buyer in the next five or six years. It paid $130 million for the acreage in Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee.

While functioning solar installations will certainly add to the property’s value and boost returns for investors, Meade notes that the presence or absence of such projects “won’t make or break a deal with the types of potential buyers we’re seeking.”

Still, he added, pushing more megawatts across the finish line equates to higher rewards for restoring the environment and the economies of down-on-their-luck communities.

“The primary benefit of solar on minelands is demonstrating that it can be done at all,” Meade emphasized. “That’s a really big deal.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/325b44b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4443x2333+0+253/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F04%2F56%2Fbadaa2814bd5a44627b7ec77d6bd%2Fgreg-meade-dec-2025-at-cf-soalr-site-dec-2024.jpeg,N,,2025-09-11 02:57:49.372899

[8] OECD (2017), The Political Economy of Biodiversity Policy Reform, OECD Publishing, Paris, https://doi.org/10.1787/9789264269545-en.","Tradable permit schemes are economic instruments that set an absolute cap (i.e. limit) on aggregate resource use or pollution and allocate permits to firms that can be traded (hence often referred to as cap-and-trade programmes) (Tietenberg, 2006[1]).1 These schemes align with the polluter pays principle by ensuring that those who are responsible for pollution or environmental degradation bear the costs associated with it (OECD, 2016[2]).

By defining a fixed quantity of allowable resource use or pollution, tradable permits provide certainty over environmental outcomes, distinguishing them from economic instruments like environmental taxes, which set prices but do not guarantee specific quantity reductions. This aspect is particularly important in contexts where ecological tipping points exist or where stringent environmental safeguards are needed (Dasgupta, 2021[3]).

Tradable permits are underpinned by two core economic principles: internalising externalities and promoting cost-effective resource allocation (Pirard, 2012[4]). First, tradable permits address market failures caused by externalities – costs or benefits that affect third parties and are not reflected in market prices. By internalising these externalities, tradable permits should ensure that those who use environmental resources bear the full cost of their actions, aligning individual incentives with social welfare (Tietenberg, 2006[1]).

Second, tradable permits create incentives for polluters to reduce their environmental impact at the lowest possible cost (Bovenberg, Goulder and Gurney, 2005[5]). Entities that can reduce their emissions or resource use more cheaply will do so and sell their excess permits to those facing higher reduction costs. This market mechanism aims to ensure that pollution or natural resource exploitation reduction occurs where it is cheapest to achieve, leading to overall cost-efficient reductions in environmental harm (Bovenberg, Goulder and Gurney, 2005[5]).

There are two main ways of allocating permits. The first approach is grandfathering, where permits are allocated to existing entities free of charge, typically in perpetuity. The other approach is auctioning. If permits are auctioned, these schemes can also mobilise finance (Box 5.1).

Biodiversity-positive tradable permit schemes in the fisheries sector are commonly referred to as Individual transferable quotas systems (ITQs). ITQs set specific Total Allowable Catch (TAC) limits and issue individual quotas that can be traded among fishers.

One of the motivating factors for the establishment of ITQs is to promote sustainable fishing by shifting fisheries away from open-access regimes that often lead to resource depletion. In several cases (e.g. Iceland and the United States), they have been implemented in times of impending collapse of a fishery (Costello, Gaines and Lynham, 2008[11]). The main arguments for introducing ITQs is that they eliminate the need to “race to fish”, thereby increasing economic returns while reducing overcapacity and overfishing (Sumaila, 2018[12]).

Fisheries managed under ITQs not only show lower collapse rates but also tend to achieve higher profitability, increased fish stock biomass, reduced overcapacity and lower emissions compared to those managed under more traditional frameworks. For example, by 2003, the proportion of collapsed fisheries under ITQs was approximately half that of non-ITQ fisheries (Costello, Gaines and Lynham, 2008[11]). These systems not only halted but, in many cases, reversed the downward trajectory of fish stock health (OECD, 2022[13]).

ITQs are effective in maintaining target fish stocks at sustainable levels, however, they alone are insufficient to address the broader ecological impacts of fishing (OECD, 2017[8]). ITQs are one of several fisheries management tools, most of which increased in use from 2019-20 (Figure 5.1). While ITQs have contributed to stock conservation by aligning economic incentives with ecological health, reducing bycatch, and protecting non-target species, to fully achieve their potential ITQs must be integrated into broader fisheries management strategies, including fundamental measures such as gear restrictions, area restrictions, and fishing seasons, alongside adaptive quota setting and bycatch reduction measures. While ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) is often considered the gold standard, its implementation remains limited due to complexity and cost. Additionally, marine protected areas (MPAs) are generally not designed as fisheries management tools, though they may provide indirect benefits for fish stock recovery (Hoshino et al., 2020[14]) (Hoefnagel and de Vos, 2017[15]). Effective implementation requires adapting these systems to the ecological, social, and economic characteristics of each fishery to ensure both stock sustainability and habitat protection (OECD, 2017[8]).

Tradable permit schemes exist also for water management, notably to either address water quantity issues or water quality issues. These systems operate by setting a cap on water use (i.e. water quantity) or pollutant discharge (i.e. water quality) and allocating permits that can be traded among users so that the aggregate cap is achieved at the lowest overall cost.

Water quality trading (WQT) systems have been implemented for reducing or controlling water pollution, reducing the costs of water pollution control following the imposition of a cap on pollutant emissions by regulators (Brears, 2023[28]). They typically involve point sources (such as industrial plants) and non-point sources (such as agricultural runoff), where entities with lower costs of reducing pollution can sell excess reduction credits to those facing higher costs.

The United States (US) established the world’s first WQT system in the 1980s, with WQT schemes now also active in Australia, Belgium (Box 5.4), Canada and New Zealand (Liu and Brouwer, 2023[29]). The United States has implemented water quality trading in various watersheds to reduce nutrient pollution. For instance, the Nutrient Credit Trading programme in the Chesapeake Bay, initiated in 2005, is designed to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus, which contribute to eutrophication in the Bay (DOEE, District of Columbia, 2024[30]). In Australia, the Hunter River Salinity Trading Scheme (HRSTS) in New South Wales (Australia) aims to manage saline water discharges from industries within the Hunter River catchment and the Protection of the Environment Operations and water trading systems regulate water quality and distribution (New South Wales EPA, 2002[31]). The scheme operates by issuing salt credits that regulate discharge opportunities based on river flow and salinity levels. Participants, such as coal mines and power stations, are required to hold regulated licences and can only discharge saline water during high river flows to minimise ecological impacts.

In New Zealand, the Lake Taupo Nitrogen Trading Programme, launched in 2011, is designed to protect the water quality of Lake Taupo, the country’s largest freshwater lake (Duhon, Kerr and McDonald, 2015[32]). By establishing a cap on nitrogen discharges from land use in the lake’s catchment, the programme allocates Nitrogen Discharge Allowances (NDAs) to landowners and enables the trading of these allowances to manage and reduce overall nitrogen pollution.

The second category of water tradable permits is water quantity tradable permits. These water permits allocate a fixed amount of water rights among users, which can subsequently be traded. This approach aims to enhance water use efficiency and sustainability by allowing water rights to move to higher value uses while maintaining overall water withdrawal limits, thereby helping to protect ecosystems (Brears, 2023[34]). Water quantity trading systems are active in Australia, South Africa, UK and US.

The first formal water quantity market in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, was established in the 1980s, with significant reforms and expansions occurring in the 1990s and 2000s. In 2007, in response to the Millennium Drought, the Australian Government enacted the Water Act 2007, establishing the Murray–Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) to create and enforce a Basin-wide plan for sustainable water use. In the Murray-Darling Basin, water trading has allowed allocations to shift to uses with higher economic returns while enabling more efficient resource management (Brears, 2023[34]). While water trading has at times been associated with concerns about social impacts – such as the displacement of small farmers and speculative market behaviour – recent research finds limited evidence to support such concerns. Studies suggest that market mechanisms have generally enabled irrigators to better manage financial stress, adapt to climate variability, and, where necessary, exit farming with more dignity and ease when needed (Wheeler, 2022[35]). Nevertheless, perceptions of inequity and market manipulation persist in public discourse, underscoring the need for transparency and integrity in water market governance, as emphasised in recent reform efforts (DCCEEW, 2022[36]). In 1998, South Africa introduced its water trading system as part of the National Water Act (NWA), which established the legal framework for managing water resources, including the ability to reallocate water use rights through trading. The NWA aimed to promote equitable access, sustainability, and efficient use of water resources across the country.

In US, the Fox Canyon Water Market in Ventura County, California, represents a pioneering example of using tools to address groundwater sustainability challenges (USDA, 2020[37]). Developed as part of California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) of 2014, the market enables agricultural producers to buy and sell groundwater allocations based on their needs (California State Water Resources Control Board, 2024[38]). The system operates as a cap-and-trade programme where groundwater usage is capped, and unused allocations can be traded among producers. Another example is the Stormwater Retention Credit (SRC) Trading Program, implemented in Washington DC by the Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE). This program exemplifies an innovative approach to managing stormwater runoff through a market-based approach (DOEE, District of Columbia, 2024[30]). Launched in 2020, the programme incentivises property owners and developers to install green infrastructure or remove impervious surfaces to reduce runoff, earning tradable credits in return.

In December 2020, the United Kingdom launched the Wheatley Watersource trading platform,3 aiming to facilitate water trading and sharing within the Suffolk East water catchment region. The platform enables license holders of water abstraction, such as agricultural users or golf courses, to trade surplus water (Wheatlye Water Source, 2022[39]). While the initiative aims to support drought resilience, its contribution to biodiversity outcomes depends on whether trading operates within a fixed cap that safeguards environmental flows and prevents over-abstraction.

The environmental integrity of tradable permit schemes depends on well-calibrated caps that reflect ecological limits and incorporate a precautionary approach, ensuring they are set conservatively, sometimes below scientifically established thresholds, to account for uncertainty in ecological processes (Halley, 2024[49]). Setting transparent science-based caps that are also enforceable ensures that permit markets function effectively while preventing resource depletion or excessive pollution. The level of precaution needed depends on the predictability of the resource. For instance, in water management, inflows and outflows are generally measurable, allowing for caps to be set closer to the available supply (Yim and Posniak, 2024[50]). In contrast, fish stocks are subject to complex ecological processes, environmental variability, and data limitations, requiring caps to be set below estimated limits to mitigate the risk of stock collapse (Halley, 2024[49]). This precautionary approach ensures that tradable permit schemes remain robust even under conditions of uncertainty. Periodic reviews and adaptive management strategies should also be embedded in the system design to align with evolving scientific knowledge, changing environmental conditions and policy goals.

Over time, tradable permit schemes in the fisheries and water management sectors have evolved, adjusting caps to improve alignment between economic incentives and environmental objectives. For example, Iceland's ITQ system highlights the importance of tailoring regulatory frameworks to local contexts (Stefánsson, 2024[23]), introducing a system of TACs based on scientific recommendations, in response to declining fish stocks. The ITQs integrate scientific stock assessments to adjust quotas dynamically, ensuring sustainability under changing ecological conditions (Arnason, 2002[51]; OECD, 2017[8]).

In New Zealand, the Quota Management System (QMS) manages one of the world's largest Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), spanning 4.4 million km² and hosting approximately 13 000 fish species. The scheme establishes an aggregate TAC for each stock, measured by volume (e.g. tonnes) in specific zones. The TAC is allocated annually among user categories, including commercial and recreational fishers. Quota owners receive rights to an Annual Catch Entitlement, and financial penalties are imposed on those who exceed their quota to discourage overfishing (Hersoug, 2018[52]). The system has shifted from input controls (e.g. gear restrictions) to output controls (e.g. TACs) and has incentivised fishers to adopt less environmentally damaging and more innovative practices. By setting clear harvest limits and enforcing financial compliance mechanisms, the QMS has helped to significantly decrease fishing effort (Box 5.8).

In contrast to many other countries implementing an ITQ system primarily to restore overfished stocks, the Finnish herring stock biomass had remained fairly stable from 2014 to 2021 and the introduction of the ITQ system was driven primarily by the need to address economic inefficiencies in the fishing sector (Hanstén, Haapasaari and Kuikka, 2021[20]). The previous system allowed open access to the national quota for all registered commercial fishers and led to the ""race to fish"" phenomenon. The open-access quota, which was not scientifically defined and lacked ecological justification, created a highly competitive and unsustainable environment where fishers rushed to catch as much as possible before the quota was exhausted. This management approach often led to mid-season closures, increasing operational inefficiencies in the industry​ (Hanstén, Haapasaari and Kuikka, 2021[20]).

Concerning water management systems, the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council introduced a cap, in 1995, in response to concerns about over-extraction, limiting water diversions to 1993–94 levels to balance consumptive use and environmental sustainability. In 2012, the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, developed by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA), set Sustainable Diversion Limits (SDLs) to manage water extraction and ensure the long-term health of the Basin's rivers and ecosystems. This case involves both permanent water trading (the trade of water entitlements) and temporary water trading (annual trade of water allocations) (Murray-Darling Basin Authority, 2024[53]). Allocations are adjusted annually based on inflow conditions and stored water availability. The programme allows users to adapt to changing water needs and availability while promoting efficiency. In the Murray-Darling Basin, water trading has allowed allocations to shift to uses with higher economic returns while enabling more efficient resource management (Brears, 2023[34]).

The Fox Canyon Water Market system, in Ventura County (US), operates as a programme where groundwater usage is capped, and unused allocations can be traded among producers. Groundwater allocations are set within regulatory limits established under the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), providing a structured framework that allows for broader participation without risking over-extraction (Brears, 2023[28]). SGMA mandates the creation of Groundwater Sustainability Agencies for each groundwater basin, which are responsible for developing and implementing Groundwater Sustainability Plans. These plans are based on hydrogeological assessments, historical extraction data, and recharge rates to define the sustainable yield – the maximum groundwater that can be extracted without causing depletion or land subsidence. In the case of Fox Canyon, the Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency enforces groundwater allocations based on past usage patterns, setting an overall cap to prevent over-extraction. This cap-and-trade system allows water users to trade unused allocations, promoting efficiency while maintaining environmental safeguards (Brears, 2023[28]).

Similarly, the Stormwater Retention Credit Trading Program in Washington, DC, establishes retention obligations that property owners must meet through on-site measures or credit purchases, creating a scalable system that maintains environmental integrity as trading volumes increase (DOEE, District of Columbia, 2024[30]).

In the case of water quality trading programmes, the cap is generally designed based on Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs), which set the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can assimilate without violating water quality standards (Kroetz et al., 2017[54]). The TMDLs must also account for seasonal variations in water quality and include a margin of safety (MOS) to account for uncertainty in predicting how well pollutant reductions will result in meeting water quality standards (US Environmental Protection Agency, 2024[55]).

In New Zealand, for example, the Lake Taupo Nitrogen Trading Programme, with the aim to restore the lake’s water quality to 2001 levels by 2080, capped nitrogen discharges to historical levels, targeting a 20% reduction from the 2001-05 baseline. Addressing diffuse nutrient pollution primarily from agriculture, by 2012, 128 tonnes of nitrogen were removed, with 11% of pastoral land converted to forestry to reduce inputs into the lake (Duhon, Kerr and McDonald, 2015[32]). The reduction of nitrogen, which contributes to harmful algal blooms, thereby improves aquatic habitats and supports the resilience of native species and ecosystems within the lake and its surroundings (Spicer, Swaffield and Moore, 2021[56]).

Similarly to fishery and water management, a clear and well-defined cap is also essential for the efficiency of the tradable development rights programme. In Brazil's Tradable Development Rights programme (Box 5.5), the Environmental Reserve Quotas are defined based on Legal Reserve (LR) requirements and can be issued only on surplus forest areas exceeding the minimum LR thresholds, which mandate that private landowners maintain a minimum proportion of native vegetation on their properties, varying by biome: 80% in the Amazon, 35% in transition zones, and 20% in other biomes such as the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest (Pinillos et al., 2021[43]). These percentage requirements were established under Brazil’s Forest Code, reflecting a combination of ecological considerations, land-use history and political negotiations, rather than being strictly based on habitat value, ecological risk, or biodiversity decline rates. Properties that fall below these requirements must compensate by acquiring CRAs from landowners with surplus native vegetation, ensuring ecological equivalence between traded areas (Frickmann Young and Castro Scarpeline, 2021[57]).

Other transferable development rights programmes, such as those in Montgomery County and King County in the United States, also use predefined conservation quotas to ensure that as trading expands, urban development remains contained within designated growth zones while protected areas retain their ecological function (Harman, Pruetz and Houston, 2015[58]; World Bank, 2018[44]).

Stakeholder engagement is critical to the successful implementation and operation of tradable permit schemes. A participatory approach, involving regulators, industry actors, local communities, and environmental groups, can enhance acceptance, compliance, and legitimacy. Early consultation helps to identify concerns, mitigate potential conflicts and improve equity in permit allocation (Boiral and Heras-Saizarbitoria, 2015[59]). Transparent governance structures, clear communication and mechanisms for ongoing dialogue ensure that permit systems are perceived as fair, leading to improved stakeholder buy-in and sustained participation (Boiral and Heras-Saizarbitoria, 2015[59]).

For example, the introduction of ITQs in fisheries often leads to uneven economic outcomes, generating both ""winners"" and ""losers"" (OECD, 2017[8]). Limited engagement of some stakeholders in the reform process, notably fishers and their communities, contributed to these disparities. For instance, in Iceland, discontent with the way the initial free allocation of fisheries quotas had led to a distinct set of “winners” was an important driver of subsequent policy reforms (OECD, 2017[8]). This lack of meaningful consultation and participation sometimes resulted in reforms that favoured larger, more capitalised fishing operations, while smaller-scale fishers and their communities faced reduced access to resources and economic hardship.

Regulators can also increase stakeholder engagement by maintaining transparency and regularly reporting performance (Section 5.3.2), not only by involving fishers as quota participants but also by including diverse groups such as small-scale operators, Indigenous communities, and civil society organisations in governance and policy design processes. Regulators foster trust and demonstrate accountability, and building public confidence is essential for gaining social licence and ensuring the success of regulatory frameworks. Moral suasion, through evidence-based communication of the system's benefits, strengthens incentives for compliance, while responsiveness to stakeholder concerns ensures that the framework remains equitable, inclusive, and reflective of diverse needs (Halley, 2024[49]). Effective stakeholder engagement is an important element of successful tradable permit schemes, as demonstrated also by the HRSTS in New South Wales. The HRSTS involves a diverse set of stakeholders, including government bodies, industry representatives, and local communities, all of whom contribute to the decision-making process surrounding salinity management (Figure 5.3).

To enhance governance and ensure continued stakeholder input, the HRSTS Operations Committee was established in 2003, several years after the scheme’s introduction, to improve stakeholder engagement and regulatory responsiveness. The committee advises the NSW EPA on the operation and performance of the HRSTS, serving as a platform for stakeholders to voice concerns, provide input on policy adjustments, and collaborate on setting operational priorities (Yim and Posniak, 2024[50]).

Transparency in permit allocation, trading rules, and market operations enhances trust, credibility, and efficiency (Halley, 2024[49]). Publicly accessible registries and digital tracking systems can improve market oversight, reduce information asymmetries, and lower transaction costs for participants. Disclosure of permit ownership, transaction histories, and compliance performance enhances accountability and prevents market manipulation (Yim and Posniak, 2024[50]). Furthermore, clear reporting and independent verification mechanisms reinforce confidence in the integrity of tradable permit systems.

The continuous evaluation of outcomes and the implementation of system improvements are factors for the success of tradable permit schemes. Regular review cycles, as seen, for example, in the Hunter River Salinity Trading Scheme in New South Wales, integrate technological advancements and stakeholder feedback to enhance programme effectiveness (Yim and Posniak, 2024[50]). Moreover, a key component of the scheme is the public registry, which enhances transparency by recording permit ownership, trading activities, and compliance performance (NSW Environment Protection Authority, 2024[60]). This publicly accessible system helps ensure accountability, track market dynamics, and support regulatory oversight, reinforcing trust in the scheme’s governance.

Programmes like the New Zealand QMS and the U.S. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) for water quality trading employ robust data-sharing mechanisms, including fishery-dependent monitoring and water quality trading platforms, ensuring participants and the public have access to accurate and timely information (Bentley, 2024[61]; Halley, 2024[49]). Similarly, for the Iceland’s ITQ system, the establishment of a national registry for quota transactions further enhanced transparency, reducing transaction costs and strengthening trust among stakeholders (OECD, 2017[8]).

Similarly, in Australia, the MDB’s success is underpinned by robust institutional frameworks, including transparent water registers, scientifically determined sustainable diversion limits, and independent oversight by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA). These elements have ensured the enforcement of caps on water extraction and provide confidence and to build trust among market participants (Wheeler et al., 2017[62]).

Blockchain technology’s recent emergence offers new opportunities to enhance transparency and accountability in environmental markets. A study on the MDB water market found that inaccessible or unrecorded transactions hinder effective regulation, while the lack of public data contributes to misconceptions, misinformation, and low market confidence (IBM & Arup, 2023[63]). Moreover, there is currently no single entity responsible for the ongoing and effective monitoring of trading in the Basin. To address these challenges, a blockchain-enabled platform4 has been proposed to modernise market operations, ensuring real-time tracking, secure record-keeping, and improved data accessibility (Shahab and Allam, 2020[64]). Blockchain’s decentralised structure provides an immutable ledger, reducing the risks of data manipulation, fraudulent trading, and incomplete reporting. By integrating smart contracts,5 the system can automate regulatory compliance, preventing unauthorised trades and streamlining administrative processes. This approach aligns with the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) Water Market Inquiry (2021[65]) and the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) Water Market Reform Roadmap (2022[66]), reinforcing the need for greater oversight, enhanced data-sharing, and more transparent governance mechanisms in Australia’s water markets.

The effectiveness of tradable permit schemes depends on robust monitoring, reporting, and verification frameworks. Advanced tracking technologies, such as satellite monitoring, electronic reporting, and automated compliance verification, can enhance enforcement efficiency. Regulatory agencies should implement strong compliance mechanisms, clear penalties for non-compliance, and independent audits to ensure permit holders adhere to environmental limits. Strengthening enforcement capacity helps prevent fraud, maintain market stability, and uphold environmental objectives.

Effective monitoring tools and requisite capacity can help ensure proper implementation of tradable permit schemes. For example, New Zealand’s QMS has developed enhanced monitoring tools, including on-board cameras and trawl surveys, which have improved compliance and reduced illegal practices such as discarding (Halley, 2024[49]). The system also implements financial penalties and compliance payments, increasing the marginal cost of overfishing and deterring quota violations. Additionally, the QMS includes a ‘balancing regime’ that requires permit holders to align their catch with Annual Catch Entitlements (ACE), linking quota pricing to sustainable harvesting behaviour. However, the effectiveness of this system depends on strict monitoring and enforcement, as weak oversight could lead to overfishing or non-compliance with sustainability objectives (Halley, 2024[49]). Despite these advances, ongoing monitoring remains essential to address ecosystem-wide effects, particularly for non-target species and habitats impacted by some fishing methods (Dasgupta, 2021[3]).

ITQs promote self-policing and compliance by granting resource users a vested interest in sustainable management. By giving fishers a sense of ownership, these systems create strong incentives for responsible practices, including participation in monitoring efforts. Effective monitoring can be further enhanced by engaging fishers directly in the process. The Dutch ITQ system incorporated co-management groups, where fishers participate in monitoring efforts, enhancing transparency and compliance while reducing illegal landings (Hoefnagel and de Vos, 2017[15]). Similar monitoring principles apply to water permit schemes, where robust frameworks ensure regulatory compliance and environmental protection. To facilitate the uptake of tradable water permits, Wheeler et al. (2017[62]) proposed a readiness assessment framework consisting of three key steps: (1) assessing hydrological and institutional needs; (2) evaluating market development and implementation issues; and (3) establishing robust monitoring and review systems.

In Australia, the Hunter River Salinity Trading Scheme uses continuous real-time monitoring to track saline discharges during high river flows, protecting aquatic ecosystems from salinity spikes that could harm native species and disrupt habitats (Yim and Posniak, 2024[50]). Monitoring stations along the river measure flow rates and salinity levels, classifying the river’s state into “low flow”, “high flow”, or “flood flow” categories. These real-time data points allow regulators to detect excessive discharges immediately, ensuring that salinity targets are not exceeded and that the total allowable discharge is allocated based on tradable salinity credits (New South Wales Environment Protection Authority, 2003[67]).

For the Fox Canyon Water Market, continuous monitoring ensures compliance, with GSAs required to review and update their GSPs every five years to respond to environmental changes and ensure long-term sustainability (FCGMA, 2024[68]). By integrating adaptive management and market mechanisms, this approach balances water conservation objectives with economic flexibility.

Enforcement mechanisms must also be stringent and include appropriate penalties for non-compliance to deter violations. This can involve regular inspections, audits, and public reporting of compliance status. Transparent and fair enforcement processes build trust in the system and ensure that all participants are held to the same standards. Additionally, regulatory authorities must have the capacity to respond swiftly to violations, maintaining the credibility and effectiveness of the scheme. These enforcement mechanisms are essential for maintaining the integrity of tradable permit schemes, preventing market manipulation, and ensuring long-term compliance with environmental regulations (Boiral and Heras-Saizarbitoria, 2015[59]).

The company anticipates that direct payments for further Section 45X Production Credits will generally be received during the second half of the calendar year.

Syrah Technologies is eligible for Section 45X Production Credits equivalent to 10% of Vidalia’s production costs, encompassing both material costs and tax depreciation. When the 11.25ktpa AAM Vidalia facility operates at full capacity, Section 45X Production Credits are estimated to be approximately US$7-9 million per annum, or about US$0.62-0.80 per kilogram of AAM, before any phase-down.

The Section 45X Production Credits will be phased down to 75% in 2030, 50% in 2031, 25% in 2032, and will be eliminated from 2033 onwards. Syrah has elected to receive direct payments of Section 45X Production Credits from the US Internal Revenue Service, which is treated as an overpayment of tax and is refundable in cash.

A: We don’t expect to see any reduction in opportunities to use C-PACE financing for new construction projects, renovations, or recapitalizations.
The number of states where C-PACE financing can help get a deal done continue to increase, as Georgia, North Carolina, New Jersey, and New York continue to make C-PACE financing available more broadly.
Nowadays, deals require complicated capital stacks to get to the finish line, and this expansion of Opportunity Zones allows for these C-PACE/OZ deals to continue.
Q: How big a role has PACE financing played in OZ projects up until now?","The recent passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) of 2025 has put restrictions on tax credits for renewable energy initiatives. However, Bali Kumar, COO of PACE Loan Group (PLG), doesn’t anticipate any slowdown in the adoption of C-PACE (commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy) financing as a result. In fact, he tells Connect CRE, the OBBB’s expansion of the Opportunity Zone program first enacted in the bill’s predecessor, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, may spur more interest in C-PACE.

Q: Since the recently signed One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) targeted cuts to green funding and renewable energy initiatives, we were wondering how it impacts C-PACE financing. Do you expect a reduction in C-PACE financing as a result?

A: We don’t expect to see any reduction in opportunities to use C-PACE financing for new construction projects, renovations, or recapitalizations. In fact, we expect to see continued growth. The number of states where C-PACE financing can help get a deal done continue to increase, as Georgia, North Carolina, New Jersey, and New York continue to make C-PACE financing available more broadly. C-PACE is unaffected because there are no federal dollars being used, and there is no federal oversight, since C-PACE is made available under state law. As a private, direct C-PACE lender, we are seeing more and more applications come through the door every day.

One specific impact of the OBBB is that certain renewable energy projects need to start before July 4, 2026, and be in service by January 1, 2027 to qualify for certain federal tax credits. Those projects can be financed through C-PACE (and the tax credit can go directly into the borrower’s pocket, so they can “double dip” !), so we are seeing more projects that want to take advantage of the “double dip” of getting the tax credit in addition to getting 100% financing move more quickly toward the closing table.

Q: One area of the OBBB is the expansion of Opportunity Zones (OZ), which had been a temporary policy initiative and now will be made permanent. Will C-PACE financing opportunities also expand?

A: C-PACE financing works well in OZ deals, and we have done a number of those. Nowadays, deals require complicated capital stacks to get to the finish line, and this expansion of Opportunity Zones allows for these C-PACE/OZ deals to continue.

The CRE industry is still uncovering more of the details of the bill, specifically all of the OZ changes. What we do know is that OZs are ripe for significant redevelopment or new development, which is a great fit for C-PACE financing. Redevelopment deals often require upgrades to HVAC, windows, electrical, elevators, and plumbing, all of which can be financed via C-PACE.

OZ projects are allowed to defer taxes for up to 10 years, with the idea that the deferred taxes encourage investing in designated communities. Though we have seen fewer OZ developments in recent months, we expect that this legislation will encourage new commercial development in these areas.

Q: Interest rates haven’t been cut this year as many experts originally predicted. Is that a positive or a negative for C-PACE and PACE Loan Group?

A: C-PACE financing really does work in any market. In our current “higher for longer” market, C-PACE financing has been useful to blend down the cost of capital for projects that are forced to use more expensive construction debt. The one caveat is that all deals right now are DSCR constrained, so we work with our senior lender partners to ensure our joint capital stacks meet our joint DSCR requirements.

Q: How big a role has PACE financing played in OZ projects up until now?

A: When the original OZ legislation was enacted in 2017, C-PACE was in the early stage of adoption, but the savvier Opportunity Zone investors learned early to use C-PACE financing on each of their deals to juice their IRRs and to spread their investment over multiple deals. There is also duration alignment with these projects, since these projects are long-term holds, and C-PACE is long-term financing.

So, C-PACE wasn’t used as often in the original OZ program because it wasn’t as widely available, or as well known. Now that C-PACE is offered in more states, we expect to see many more qualifying projects during this version of the program.

Q: Are there other aspects of the OBBB that could affect the market for PACE financing, whether positively or negatively?

A: While some clean energy credits are expiring, C-PACE is a great way to finance improvements that otherwise would have qualified for clean energy credits. C-PACE has the dual mandate of funding “energy efficiency” projects which result in operational savings because of increased buildings efficiency.

One additional OBBB benefit we are aware of is that owners will be able to depreciate energy improvements 100% in year one. That’s a new benefit that may cause more sponsors to consider improvements that improve energy efficiency.

With the Biden administration's recent executive actions and the Trump-era Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) creating a dual tailwind, investors are now presented with a unique window to capitalize on a sector poised for long-term growth. This analysis explores the federal-nuclear partnership's implications for strategic investment opportunities, focusing on infrastructure firms, advanced reactor developers, and the geopolitical resilience of a reinvigorated U.S. nuclear industry.

Federal Initiatives: A Catalyst for Nuclear Revival

The federal government has emerged as a critical enabler of nuclear energy's resurgence. In May 2025, President Trump's executive orders prioritized nuclear reactor development, uranium mining, and private-sector incentives, directing the Department of Energy (DOE) to allocate up to $900 million for advanced reactor demonstrations, including small modular reactors (SMRs) Government Initiatives Fueling Nuclear Energy Growth in the United States[ 1 ]. This aligns with the IRA's broader $369 billion clean energy framework, which includes tax credits and grants for nuclear projects under Section 48C and the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) program U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS Announce $6[ 2 ].

The DOE's $3.4 billion initiative to expand domestic low-enriched uranium (LEU) production further underscores the administration's focus on securing the nuclear fuel supply chain 11 Big Wins for Nuclear Energy in 2024[ 3 ]. This is not merely an economic play but a geopolitical one: reducing reliance on foreign uranium imports—particularly from Russia and China—strengthens U.S. energy sovereignty at a time of heightened global tensions.

Strategic Investment Opportunities: From SMRs to Uranium Producers

The federal push has catalyzed a wave of private-sector activity. The Nuclear Company, a startup backed by $51.3 million in Series A funding, is evaluating sites for its first fleet of SMRs, with plans to create 100 jobs in South Carolina Nuclear Company Inks Series A Investors, Plans to Hire 100 People[ 4 ]. Similarly, TerraPower, co-founded by Bill Gates, is constructing the Natrium reactor in Wyoming with $880 million in federal support, blending advanced reactor technology with energy storage capabilities VCs have poured billions into a nascent nuclear technology[ 5 ].

For uranium infrastructure, Cameco Corporation and Cortez Rare Earths have secured DOE contracts to modernize enrichment facilities, ensuring a stable domestic supply of LEU 11 Big Wins for Nuclear Energy in 2024[ 3 ]. Meanwhile, NuScale Power and Westinghouse Electric—now publicly traded—have become focal points for investors seeking exposure to SMR deployment and reactor modernization. NuScale's recent $1.2 billion in IRA-related tax credits exemplifies the sector's alignment with federal incentives U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS Announce $6[ 2 ].

Geopolitical Resilience: Nuclear as a Strategic Asset

The global context amplifies the urgency of U.S. nuclear expansion. The World Bank Group's partnership with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to promote SMRs in developing nations highlights nuclear energy's role in addressing energy poverty while reducing carbon emissions World Bank Group, IAEA Formalize Partnership to ...[ 6 ]. However, this also intensifies competition for U.S. firms to secure export markets, particularly in Asia and Africa, where China and Russia have traditionally dominated nuclear infrastructure contracts.

Domestically, the restart of shuttered plants like Michigan's Palisades facility—supported by $1.52 billion in loan guarantees—demonstrates the sector's potential to revitalize regional economies while maintaining grid reliability 11 Big Wins for Nuclear Energy in 2024[ 7 ]. These projects are not just about clean energy; they are about reasserting U.S. leadership in a technology that is central to both climate goals and national security.

Risks and Considerations

Investors must remain

of regulatory hurdles and public perception challenges. Advanced reactor designs require rigorous safety certifications, and the high upfront capital costs of nuclear projects necessitate long-term federal support. However, the IRA's 10-year tax credit window and the DOE's streamlined permitting processes mitigate these risks, offering a degree of predictability absent in other energy sectors.

Conclusion: A Sector at the Inflection Point

The federal-nuclear partnership represents more than a policy shift—it is a strategic repositioning of the U.S. energy landscape. For investors, the confluence of federal funding, technological innovation, and geopolitical imperatives creates a compelling case for allocating capital to nuclear infrastructure and technology firms.
