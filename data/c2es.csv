India's renewable energy sector continues its robust expansion, with non-fossil fuel sources now accounting for half of the nation's total power generation capacity, a milestone reached five years earlier than initially projected under commitments made during the Paris Agreement.

Current figures through the end of October 2025 show approximately 259 gigawatts of installed capacity from clean energy sources, including a substantial addition of 31.2 GW during the first seven months of this fiscal year.

Recent media coverage suggested that the ministry had instructed financial institutions to suspend funding for renewable projects due to concerns about excessive production capacity.

The ministry has categorically denied these claims.

What the ministry has done, according to official statements, is provide detailed information to financial oversight bodies and major lending institutions, including Power Finance Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation, and Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, about current manufacturing capabilities throughout the solar photovoltaic supply chain.

This information encompasses production capacity data for solar panels, cells, silicon wafers, polysilicon materials, and supporting components such as specialised glass and aluminum framing. The goal is to encourage lenders to take a more comprehensive view when assessing funding applications for solar manufacturing plants.

The ministry is urging financial institutions to broaden their investment perspective beyond conventional solar panel assembly operations to include earlier stages of production and component manufacturing.

India's solar manufacturing sector has experienced remarkable transformation, with panel production capacity surging from a modest 2.3 GW in 2014 to approximately 122 GW currently listed under the ministry's official registry of approved manufacturers and products.

Centre in its statement reaffirmed its dedication to establishing India as a significant force in the worldwide solar manufacturing landscape while working toward the ambitious target of 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by the decade's end.

Ministry officials indicated they will maintain ongoing dialogue with industry participants to ensure the sector remains dynamic, inclusive, and prepared for future challenges.",https://static.businessworld.in/1589948103_kbF4A7_2020_05_20T041000Z_1_LYNXMPEG4J072_RTROPTP_4_IEA_RENEWABLES.JPG,N,,2025-12-07 02:58:27.213631

The facility will produce critical lithium-ion battery components under one roof, including electrolyte salts, cathode materials and specialized binders that go into every electric vehicle battery.
The plant will produce lithium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte salt, custom electrolyte formulations, lithium iron phosphate cathode materials and PVDF/PTFE binders.
Racing to meet surging demand India’s electric vehicle market is exploding.
Moving upstream into battery materials represents the next logical step in building a complete domestic EV supply chain.","The International Finance Corporation has placed a massive bet on India’s electric vehicle future, committing approximately $50 million to help build the country’s first fully integrated battery materials manufacturing facility. The investment in GFCL EV Products Limited marks a turning point for India’s ambitions to control its own EV supply chain rather than relying on imports from China and other nations.

The World Bank Group’s private-sector arm announced the deal on Dec. 5, targeting a new plant in Jolva, near Bharuch in Gujarat. The facility will produce critical lithium-ion battery components under one roof, including electrolyte salts, cathode materials and specialized binders that go into every electric vehicle battery.

This represents IFC’s first investment in a battery materials company in India, signaling confidence that the country can compete in the high-value chemistry that makes electric vehicles possible. For a nation racing to electrify its transportation sector, the deal couldn’t come at a better time.

What makes this facility different

Unlike typical manufacturing plants that focus on one component, GFCL EV’s facility will handle multiple stages of battery production in a single location. The plant will produce lithium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte salt, custom electrolyte formulations, lithium iron phosphate cathode materials and PVDF/PTFE binders. These materials together account for more than half the cost of a lithium iron phosphate battery cell.

The parent company, Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited, already operates as one of India’s largest producers of fluoropolymers and specialty chemicals. With three manufacturing units in Gujarat and a captive fluorspar mine in Morocco, GFL brings decades of chemistry expertise to the battery materials business. The company deployed about 1,125 crore rupees (approximately $135 million) in capital expenditures during fiscal year 2024-25, with more than half dedicated to EV-related projects.

Racing to meet surging demand

India’s electric vehicle market is exploding. Industry forecasts show lithium battery demand will skyrocket from about 4 gigawatt-hours in 2023 to nearly 139 gigawatt-hours by 2035, driven primarily by compact passenger vehicles and small SUVs. The government’s Production Linked Incentive scheme for battery storage aims to create massive manufacturing capacity with an overall budget of 18,100 crore rupees (about $2.2 billion).

The challenge isn’t just building enough batteries but ensuring India isn’t simply assembling components made elsewhere. Cathode materials and electrolyte salts represent the highest import dependence, with China currently dominating global production. Industry estimates suggest cathode materials alone can account for 29% to 51% of a lithium-ion battery’s total price, depending on chemistry and metal prices.

Why IFC is betting big

The investment fits IFC’s broader strategy of backing projects that deliver climate benefits, create high-skill jobs and strengthen supply chain resilience. By supporting domestic battery materials production, IFC aims to reduce India’s dependence on imported components while enabling the country’s transition to electric vehicles and renewable energy storage.

IFC has already invested heavily in India’s EV ecosystem, including a $20 million equity stake in Transvolt Mobility, its first global investment in an EV fleet platform. The organization has also supported two- and three-wheeler manufacturers, last-mile logistics operators and charging infrastructure providers. Moving upstream into battery materials represents the next logical step in building a complete domestic EV supply chain.

Navigating choppy waters

The investment comes during turbulent times for global battery markets. Lithium hydroxide prices have plummeted nearly 90% from their 2022 peaks, while battery pack prices fell about 20% in 2024 to a record low of $115 per kilowatt-hour. Overcapacity in global cathode and materials markets could squeeze profit margins and intensify competition from established players in China and South Korea.

Technology shifts also pose challenges. While GFCL EV focuses on lithium iron phosphate chemistry, which has become mainstream for mass-market EVs due to safety and cost advantages, automakers are exploring alternative chemistries including manganese-rich variants and even sodium-ion batteries. GFL’s expertise in fluorine-based materials across multiple battery types should provide some protection against single-chemistry risk.

A blueprint for Indian manufacturing

If successful, the GFCL EV facility could serve as a model for how traditional chemical companies can pivot into high-value energy transition materials. The project blends decades of process knowledge with emerging demand from the electric vehicle revolution. For India, owning the chemistry inside battery cells matters as much as assembling the cells themselves.

The partnership between a global development financier and an established Indian chemical manufacturer demonstrates that India’s battery story is moving beyond assembly plants toward the more strategic business of controlling critical materials. Whether this gamble pays off will depend on execution, market conditions and the country’s ability to compete with deeply entrenched Asian manufacturers who have spent years perfecting these processes.

V Environmental Protection Agency: Implications for Public Health Policy and Practice.” Public Health Reports, vol.","Since assuming office, the Trump Administration has made it blatantly clear that expediting the extraction and deployment of fossil fuels through legal measures is one of their priorities. On his Inauguration Day, Trump delivered EO 14154 Unleashing American Energy to redirect domestic energy development exclusively towards the oil and gas industry. Since then, he has pursued a hostile reversal of policies outlined in the Inflation Reduction Act. In May of 2025, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed complaints against the states of New York and Vermont over their climate superfund laws and preemptively sued Michigan and Hawaii to prevent them from taking legal measures against oil companies. [1, 2] These states have cited tort laws, which allow parties to remedy their injuries through lawsuits, to recover damages associated with climate change. Tort-based claims are similarly found in three dozen other pending lawsuits in which state and local governments have sued major fossil fuel companies for inflicting harm upon people or property. [3] The DOJ, however, alleges that the Clean Air Act, a federal law that regulates air emissions, preempts state efforts to address and mitigate climate change. Citing Trump’s EO Protecting American Energy from State Overreach, the DOJ also argued that state-led energy regulation impinges on the executive branch’s foreign affairs powers. Other legal groups have sought long-term avenues to suppress climate cases. In a letter to the DOJ in June of 2025, 16 Republican state attorneys general requested that the administration enact protections for the fossil fuel industry modeled after a 2005 law that protects gun manufacturers from litigation when their guns are utilized for criminal purposes. [4]

If Big Oil is granted a legal shield, the courthouse doors would shut for Americans seeking accountability for the role corporations played in contributing to extreme weather damage. Such an action would establish a precedent of prioritizing corporate interests over community well-being and would shift the fiscal consequences of climate change onto taxpayers. Additionally, fossil fuel immunity claims should be considered illegitimate attempts to constitutionalize an economic interest and violate states’ regulatory power to impose environmental standards. Previous environmental cases have substantiated the lack of federal prerogative and accountability in climate action, and precedent has determined states’ constitutional power to enshrine environmental rights.

States that have filed lawsuits against energy and fossil fuel companies usually follow a consistent pattern of citing violations of state tort law, signifying their proper venue in state and local courts, and undermining the soundness of federal measures that intervene in fossil fuel regulation. In County of San Mateo v. Chevron Corp., the Ninth Circuit affirmed a district order remanding to state court claims brought by California local governments against fossil fuel companies, finding that “the companies did not establish prerequisites for the Grable exception to the well-pleaded complaint rule for cases that raise a substantial federal issue.” [5] The Ninth Circuit held that such cases were not subject to federal jurisdiction because they did not raise concerns relevant to federal law. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit held that “the Clean Air Act did not completely preempt the plaintiffs’ state-law claims” and that the plaintiffs’ injuries were considered “too attenuated and remote” to be governed by federal law applicable to federal enclaves. [6] The plaintiffs' complaints remained a state law complaint on the grounds that the Clean Air Act (CAA) fails to address all claims related to air pollution.

The decision on the Clean Air Act’s preemption power is particularly notable, as current lawsuits pursued by the DOJ call upon the CAA to prove state climate action inessential. Additionally, the court panel rejected the energy companies’ argument that the plaintiffs’ claims should be heard in federal court under 28 U.S. Code § 1331, also known as the federal question jurisdiction, simply because the alleged harm happened on federal land under exclusive federal control. The general federal question jurisdictional statute grants federal district courts original subject matter jurisdiction over ""all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.” [7] In this instance, the federal government’s tangential stake in the case — having dominion over the land in which the violations occurred — proved insufficient in employing this statute. Such a determination demonstrates that fossil fuel infrastructure operated on federal land is not exempt from civil liability, and even more so, that the harms these facilities produce can still be cited under state law.

Corporations, like Chevron, host a portion of their oil extraction operations on federal land, and thus, it is notable that while operating in these areas, no immunity is being granted. Ultimately, the empirical favorability of state court climate litigation undermines the plausibility of federal directives on fossil fuel immunity. However, with the overruling of Chevron in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, redirecting the interpretation of federal statute from agencies to the court, the judicial system has assumed novel importance within the climate fight. Power has been further invested in the courts to issue sound rulings on environmental policy, subverting the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the federal government’s reliance on it to supplement state regulation. [8]

In cases where the EPA does have ruling authority, modern environmental jurisprudence increasingly recognizes the right of states and their sovereignty to hold federal agencies accountable for regulatory neglect in the face of environmental degradation. Although Massachusetts v. EPA is largely recognized for declaring greenhouse gases pollutants, the landmark ruling also reinforced states' legal standing to sue federal agencies over subpar environmental regulations. In this case, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that Massachusetts, due to its ""stake in protecting its quasi-sovereign interests"" as a state, had standing to sue the EPA over potential damage caused to its territory by global warming, along with the legal right to seek redress for agency inaction. [9] Massachusetts specifically cited injuries to its land and health, which paved the way for administrative recognition of environmental harms. The majority decision concluded that Massachusetts had a legal right to seek relief given that the Commonwealth met all three conditions: (1) a concrete and particularized injury that is actual or imminent, (2) the injury that is traceable to the act of the defendant (the EPA in this case), and (3) evidence that favorable action by the EPA would help repair the injury. [10]

In the wake of lawsuits against Big Oil, the question of whether judicial decisions can adequately ameliorate climate injuries has been contested. In May 2025, Our Children’s Trust, a nonprofit public interest law firm, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration challenging their executive orders that accelerate the deployment of fossil fuels in Lighthiser v. Trump. In October, a federal district court in Montana dismissed the case. According to the court, the plaintiffs were incapable of surmounting the ‘final, dispositive hurdle’ that the relief would be outside the court’s power to grant. The court acknowledged that the plaintiffs had proven sufficient injury, but argued that the issue of alleviating climate change was too broad and failed to meet the requirements of redressability. In Massachusetts v. EPA, the agency put forth a similar argument claiming that its power to regulate global climate change was insufficient to provide relief. Here, however, the majority reached a different conclusion than that of Montana’s federal district court. Majority leader Justice Stevens stated that ‘incremental agency action over time may produce cumulative effects and that for standing to be present, the state would not have to show that any single action would remedy its problems.” Stevens further argued that “the EPA's regulation of greenhouse gases would have a significant effect because of the enormous amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the U.S. transportation sector.” [11] Thus, the failure of Lighthiser v. Trump in seeking redress and holding fossil fuel companies accountable does not disprove the prospect of such action, as Massachusetts v. EPA validated the utility of regulatory standards in remedying climate injuries and proved that they can be traceable to an entity.

In holding fossil fuel companies accountable, the application of the Public Trust Doctrine (PTD) presents a potential avenue for asserting states’ role in environmental protection. The doctrine derives from the Roman ""jus publicum"" principle of common ownership of natural resources: “By the law of nature these things are common to mankind—the air, running water, the sea, and consequently the shores of the sea.” [12] In the U.S.’s recognition of the public trust doctrine, state governments rightfully serve as trustees of resources, though its application has traditionally been exclusive to that of waterways. The PTD has been constitutionalized by several states, including Hawaii, which enshrines that “all public natural resources are held in trust by the State for the benefit of the people” and explicitly defines resources to include “land, water, air, minerals, and energy sources.” [13] In Hawaii’s complaint against BP, Shell, and Exxon, the state alleges that it has a constitutional obligation to uphold this protection and cites eight causes of action in its complaint, among them negligence and “harm to public trust resources.” [14] Formerly employed to settle disputes over access to waterways, the doctrine has now imposed affirmative duties upon states to protect resources, as evidenced in various state constitutions. [15]

Similarly, Pennsylvania’s constitution guarantees a “right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment,” and provides that “as trustee of these resources, [Pennsylvania] shall conserve and maintain them for the benefit of all the people.” [16] As public-trust-based litigation becomes increasingly prevalent in state efforts to address climate change, courts must clarify their function. Hawaii’s invocation of its constitutionalized PTD in litigation against major oil companies emphasizes the doctrine’s contemporary expansion and undermines claims that fossil fuel entities enjoy protection from state-led environmental litigation.

Trump’s Executive Orders raise pressing concerns about the future of the fossil fuel industry and the extent of state autonomy in regulating and preserving these industries within their borders. Understanding how past legal actions have justified state countermeasures against federal expansion of fossil fuels is essential in today’s era of energy polarization. Efforts to immunize fossil fuel corporations place corporate interests above community well-being — a tension reflected in the growing incorporation of the public trust doctrine into state constitutions. This doctrine has been invoked in legal battles to defend states’ rights to safeguard their natural resources and land from oil and gas expansion. Moreover, climate cases are increasingly being remanded to state courts, underscoring the limits of federal authority in establishing doctrines that confer “rights” upon fossil fuel industries. The disparities between landmark cases such as Massachusetts v. EPA and Lighthiser v. Trump reveal that holding entities accountable for regulatory failures is possible, particularly when public health violations are at stake. As organizations and communities seek representation and redress for the harms caused by fossil fuels, these corporations must remain subject to rigorous public scrutiny and accountability.

Michigan Advance

EV sales are in the tank. So what happens next?

Sales of new electric vehicles have plunged since federal tax credits ended on Sept. 30.

In November, EVs accounted for 5.3 percent of U.S. new-car and light-truck sales, a share that was less than half the record high in September, according to an estimate published last week by S&P Global Mobility.

The numbers were especially ugly on Tuesday when several automakers released their November figures. Ford said that unit sales of its Mustang Mach-E were down 49 percent compared to the same month in 2024. Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 was down 59 percent. I could go on.

But most industry analysts are not sounding an alarm. This is because the decline in sales was expected the moment in July that President Donald Trump signed the legislation that canceled the credit, which was up to $7,500 per vehicle. The law led to months of chaos, during which many consumers accelerated their purchasing decisions to qualify for the credit, contributing to the collapse that followed.

One of the main questions going forward is how long it will take for the market to return to some kind of normalcy. The most common answer I’m seeing is that the current shakeout will likely last well into 2026.

After that, we’ll get to the more important question: What happens next? To help figure this out, I spoke with Peter Slowik, U.S. passenger vehicles lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation, or ICCT, a research nonprofit with offices around the globe. ✂️

The takeaway is that, yes, this is a setback, but ICE cars are not going to win.

Natural gas operator fined for environmental violation at North Dakota reservation

The operator of natural gas production facilities on the Fort Berthold Reservation was ordered Friday to pay a $500,000 fine and do 500 hours of community service for an environmental violation.

Targa Badlands LLC pleaded guilty earlier this year in U.S. District Court in North Dakota to a violation of the Clean Air Act that affected the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation.

Targa, which operates six natural gas compressor stations on Fort Berthold, failed to install required hazardous air pollutant monitoring systems, federal prosecutors say in court records.

The violation occurred between 2018 and 2022 on the Johnson Compressor Station near Mandaree. Natural gas gathering pipelines include compressor stations that boost pressure before the gas reaches a natural gas processing plant.

The combustion engines on the compressor station produce hazardous air pollutants such as benzene and formaldehyde, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan O’Konek said during the plea hearing, according to a transcript.

The plea agreement indicates Targa self-reported the violation and promptly corrected it by installing monitoring equipment. The company has since taken steps to improve environmental compliance, federal prosecutors said. The attorney for Targa did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. ✂️

Included only because I’m a sucker for ND news. The issue was found and reported by the company itself. They are a repeat offender, but I’ll look at the positive that there is someone internally looking for issues. Hopefully, they’ll develop better internal processes to stop this from happening again.

Georgia hashes out plan to let data centers build their own clean energy

Big companies have spent years pushing Georgia to let them find and pay for new clean energy to add to the grid, in the hopes that they could then get data centers and other power-hungry facilities online faster.

Now, that concept is tantalizingly close to becoming a reality, with regulators, utility Georgia Power, and others hammering out the details of a program that could be finalized sometime next year. If approved, the framework could not only benefit companies but also reduce the need for a massive buildout of gas-fired plants that Georgia Power is planning to satiate the artificial intelligence boom.

Today, utilities are responsible for bringing the vast majority of new power projects online in the state. But over the past two years, the Clean Energy Buyers Association has negotiated to secure a commitment from Georgia Power that ​“will, for the first time, allow commercial and industrial customers to bring clean energy projects to the utility’s system,” said Katie Southworth, the deputy director for market and policy innovation in the South and Southeast at the trade group, which includes major hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. ✂️

Because it made me smile:

✂️ But as it stands, CEBA sees ​“the approved CIR framework as a meaningful step toward the ​‘bring-your-own clean energy’ model,” Southworth said — a model that goes by the catchy acronym BYONCE in clean-energy social media circles. ✂️

It looks like there are still technical kinks to iron out and not all regions of the country are managed in a way to easily facilitate this, but I like the idea.

Idaho Capital Sun

Idaho Congressman Fulcher introduces bill extending private, short-term health care coverage

Idaho Republican Congressman Russ Fulcher is hoping to expand the use of private, short-term health insurance.

Fulcher on Thursday announced the introduction of the Removing Insurance Gaps for Health Treatment (RIGHT) Act of 2025, which would extend the maximum allowance for short-term health plans from four months to up to three years.

Short-term, limited-duration insurance, known as STLDI, are private insurance plans designed to cover temporary gaps in health coverage. The plans are sometimes less expensive than plans offered through state health insurance marketplace plans, but do not always cover as many services and are not subject to the same consumer protection regulations as those compliant with the Affordable Care Act.

“Four months is far too short a limit, posing undue stress and uncertainty on Americans who would otherwise be left without coverage,” Fulcher said in a press release. “My bill, the RIGHT Act, expands STLDI plans to a full year, with the option to renew for up to three years. This is a practical, no-cost approach that offers families more choice, control, and flexibility to select the healthcare options that work best for them.” ✂️

He’s a U.S. rep. Couldn’t he just sign the discharge petition and extend ACA subsidies?

Maine Morning Star

Federal court rejects state effort to weaken agreement protecting disabled children’s rights

A federal court last week rejected a joint attempt by Maine and the U.S. Department of Justice to weaken a previous agreement that required the state to improve services so that children with disabilities no longer had to be separated from their families.

In a statement Friday, a coalition of rights organizations said the ruling “preserves essential protections that ensure children with behavioral-health needs will receive integrated, community-based services rather than face unnecessary institutionalization.”

The settlement agreement stemmed from a September 2024 lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice that alleged the state was failing to meet the needs of students that require behavioral health services and violating the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by separating them from their homes and communities by institutionalizing them or sending them to juvenile detention centers.

Two months later, the lawsuit was dismissed after the state agreed to implement a robust accountability system with reporting requirements, community outreach and the establishment of an independent watchdog, who would oversee data on state services. Under that initial agreement, the state committed to increasing the availability of community-based behavioral health services through the Maine Department of Health and Human Services so that children would no longer have to be separated from their families. ✂️

Once again, the courts step up to do the right thing.

Maryland Matters

Redistricting supporters outnumber opponents at Maryland meeting

Supporters of mid-decade redistricting in Maryland showed up in force for a virtual meeting of a state advisory commission Friday, calling on state leaders to redo congressional maps to oppose President Donald Trump (R).

It was the third hearing of the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission and the third different outcome: Redistricting opponents dominated the first hearing and the second was nearly evenly split. Redistricting proponents dominated Friday’s meeting, thanks to a slew of climate and civil rights advocates, union leaders, a few retired federal employees and even a high school student.

Also joining the chorus was Bobby LaPin, the Maryland social media personality who has announced his intention to run against Senate President Bill Ferguson (D- Baltimore City), a commission member who opposes mid-cycle redistricting.

The commission will meet at least once more, on Dec. 12, to hear public comment.

The redistricting saga began with Trump urging Republican-led states to redistrict for partisan gain before the 2026 elections, to pick up GOP seats in Congress. Red states that have passed new maps so far include Texas, Missouri, Ohio and North Carolina. Democrats in California and Virginia have fired back with maps of their own. ✂️

AZ Mirror

Arizona’s Congresswoman Grijalva says she was pepper sprayed during Tucson ICE raid

Arizona’s U.S. Rep. Adelita Grijalva was involved in a clash with federal agents during a protest of immigration raids in west Tucson Friday, during which she claims she was hit with pepper spray.

According to a spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency partnered with the Internal Revenue Service to carry out as many as 16 warrants in southern Arizona in a “years-long investigation into immigration and tax violations.” In videos posted to social media by community advocates, several masked federal agents in tactical gear can be seen near the westside location of popular Mexican seafood and grill restaurant Taco Giro.

The raids prompted a protest and federal agents deployed tear gas and pepper spray against the crowd. The Arizona Daily Star reported that multiple employees who live near the west Tucson restaurant were detained. At least one protester was among those taken into custody by federal agents. AZ Family reported that Taco Giro locations in north Tucson, Casa Grande and Vail were also targeted. ICE spokesman Fernando Burgos-Ortiz confirmed to the Arizona Mirror that multiple people were arrested, but didn’t clarify how many or confirm claims that agents had pepper-sprayed a sitting U.S. Congresswoman.

Tricia McLaughlin, the spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, dismissed Grijalva’s account. McLaughlin accused Grijalva of hindering the work of federal agents and appeared to question Grijalva’s claim that she was pepper-sprayed by highlighting her lack of visible physical reaction in the video. ✂️

Oregon Capital Chronicle

Portland’s DA balked at charging federal agents under Oregon law. Then AG Rayfield stepped in

The top local prosecutor in the Portland area is cautioning against “unreasonable expectations” for his ability to charge federal agents using state law, after signing onto a statement last week warning the Trump administration that its officers could be held accountable for excessive force.

The district attorneys in Oregon’s three most populated counties and Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield stood in unison last week when they signed onto a letter warning the Trump administration that they were monitoring reports of excessive force by federal agents with the goal of potentially bringing charges forward should the issue persist. Rayfield, alongside Multnomah County District Attorney Nathan Vasquez, Washington County District Attorney Kevin Barton and Clackamas County District Attorney John Wentworth, requested cooperation from the federal government in Oregon’s investigations.

The attorneys pointed to instances of disproportionate use of force through tear gas and nonlethal munitions by agents with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during protests outside the Portland waterfront Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility. They also referred to federal agents from an unmarked van in October holding teenagers at gunpoint by a Hillsboro Dutch Bros coffee stand and the November arrest of a 17-year-old U.S. citizen during his lunch off-grounds from McMinnville High School. ✂️

Events

1790 - The U.S. Congress moves from NY City to Philadelphia.

1825 - President Adams recommends establishing a national observatory.

1849 - Harriet Tubman makes her final escape from slavery.

1865 - Georgia ratifies the 13th Amendment and abolishes slavery.

WineRev:

1865 Washington DC The 13th Amendment to Constitution, abolishing slavery, had passed both branches of Congress back in January (the center of a fine movie ‘Lincoln’ starting Daniel Day Lewis). Now it needed to be ratified by ¾ of the states. Since the Lincoln Administration did not consider secession legal, legally those 11 Southern states were still part of the Union (so instead of needing 15 ratifications from the 20 states that remained loyal, the Amendment needed 25 out of the 31 total.) OTOH Lee surrendered back in April, Jeff Davis was arrested in May, there was no fighting going on, and in the various Southern states the Union Army is watching over the brand new and re-constituted state governments. (And former Confederates were not allowed to vote or be part of any elected office. If they got mad about this, they could complain to any armed Union soldier or officer on occupation duty in their town…..) On this day the government of Georgia ratifies the Amendment, making ¾, making it part of the Constitution.

1877 - Thomas Edison records voices for the first time at the offices of Scientific American.

1884 - The Washington Monument in D.C. is completed.

Will he tear it down or just rename it?

1922 - Power is transmitted over the first electric power line in NY.

1923 - President Coolidge becomes the first Presidential to address the country on the radio.

WineRev:

1923 Washington DC Marconi and Tesla had gotten the world signaling by radio at the turn of the century. In the fading days of World War I scientists and engineers figured out how to add voices, sounds, even music to the dots and dashes (Morse code) that had been used earlier. Transmitters went up and receivers were designed and sold. In 1920 KDKA in Pittsburgh became the first US commercial radio station to go on the air. Their first broadcast told of the results of the 1920

Presidential Election (Harding the winner.) In the summer of 1923 President Harding died in office and Calvin Coolidge became President.

On this day Mr. Coolidge became the first President ever to speak live on radioto a national audience from the White House.(They connected other stations by telephone lines to the same broadcast so it could be widely heard. They called the connection a ‘network’….a technical term worth remembering. 😊)

1933 - Judge John M. Woolsey rules that James Joyce's novel Ulysses is not obscene (United States v. One Book Called Ulysses).

1947 - The Everglades National Park (FL) is dedicated by President Truman.

WineRev:

1947Florida National Parks were invented by President Grant back in 1872 when he invented the world’s first one called ‘Yellowstone.’ Other mountains, seacoasts, canyons have been designated National Parks (and administered by the Park Service and the Dept. of the Interior.) On this day President Truman (shrewd enough to go to Florida in December!) dedicates a most unusual ecosystem as a protected National Park: The Everglades.

1961 - Ernie Davis becomes the first Black to win the Heisman Trophy.

1964 - Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer airs on t.v. for the first time.

1995 - The FDA approves the first protease inhibitor to treat HIV/AIDS (Saquinavir).

St. Nicholas Day

St. Nicholas Day on December 6 celebrates of course carries some connection to Christmas and Santa Claus, but there is much more to this holiday and St. Nicholas than that. Although St. Nicholas partially inspired the Christmas and Santa Claus that we all know and love, St. Nicholas actually derives from a different kind of tale. Let’s learn about St. Nicholas and what this day is truly about.

WineRev:

343 (Three digit date!) Death date of Nicolas, Bishop of Myra (now Demre), Eastern Roman Empire (now Turkey) (The Church remembers saints on their death day, looking death in the eye and proclaiming “this one we will remember despite you, so the good they did will live on in memory and for inspiration.”)

Almost nothing known about Nicolas from surviving records; earliest mentions are from over 200 years later. Many miracles already attributed to him and he had a legendary for reputation for generosity and gift-giving (in secret; by tradition he left gifts for the poor in the middle of the night, and anonymously.)

Most famously remembered for rescuing three sisters from being sold into prostitution by dropping a bag of gold coins down their chimney on three consecutive nights so their father had a dowry for each of them and could marry them off. (Notice any parallels with some other guy: chimney…..gifts……coming by night? Some story pieces have been around a LONG time.) The real Good St. Nick!

To Quote Girsaol

Tomorrow is St. Nicholas’ Day, the patron saint of children who is not known for having anything to do with sardines.

St. Nicholas and I have something in common! I have nothing to do with sardines, either!

National Miners Day

Despite federal efforts to ensure safe working conditions for miners, they have one of the most difficult and dangerous jobs you can imagine. To recognize their efforts, Congress has declared December 6 National Miners Day. Why? Our entire economy depends on them. On this holiday, we should all take a moment to think about the many ways that miners play a role in our daily lives. Mined materials contribute to things like roads, houses, cars and computers. We wouldn’t be able to get much done without their hard work.

I applaud all of the work that miners have done for us.

===

NATIONAL GAZPACHO DAY

National Gazpacho Day, on December 6th, recognizes a flavorful soup that cooks serve cold. This typically tomato-based vegetable soup originated in the southern Spanish region of Andalucia. Gazpacho is widely consumed in Spanish cuisine, usually during the summer months.

I question the wisdom of making this day at a point of the year when many of us want soup served hot, but I’m not the “national day” Gazpacho.

===

Mitten Tree Day

On December 6th, Mitten Tree Day celebrates the gift of warmth. It’s a day to collect mittens, hang them on a Christmas tree, and then hand them out to those in need.

Those who live in cold climates understand the necessity of mittens. This winter clothing item is essential for keeping the hands warm while outdoors. Unfortunately, however, there are many children around the world who are without adequate winter clothing, which includes mittens.

It’s a national day I can get behind.

Put On Your Own Shoes Day

Sounds simple enough – and surely plenty of us do it every day, unless you really feel like braving the walk to work in your socks – but it seems this day might be more to do with shoes themselves and a way of encouraging children to put on and tie their own shoes.

Not just for children…

80% of new capacity for data centers Georgia Power, with 2.8 million customers, projects the largest percentage increase in electricity demand over the next five years of any region but Texas.
The utility says it needs 10,000 megawatts of new capacity—enough to power 4 million Georgia homes—saying 80% of that would power data centers.
That's in addition to the 3,000 megawatts the commission approved in 2024 after an unusual mid-cycle request by Georgia Power.
But if Georgia Power overbuilds and there are no data centers to pay, other customers could shoulder those costs.","With data centers flooding into Georgia, utility regulators face a big decision: Should they let Georgia Power Co. spend more than $15 billion to increase its electricity capacity by 50% over the next six years to serve computer complexes? Or could the utility overbuild and stick other ratepayers with the bill?

It would be one of the biggest build-outs in the U.S. to meet the insatiable electricity demand from developers of artificial intelligence. The largest subsidiary of Atlanta-based Southern Co., Georgia Power said in testimony filed last month that the build-out will boost the state's economy and ""allow Georgia to contribute to the nation's focus on the global importance of artificial intelligence and the digital economy.""

""Given the number of companies interested in doing business in Georgia and the amount of customer load with signed contracts or in advanced discussions, it is important to continue moving forward with support for this great growth opportunity,"" company officials said in testimony.

But electricity bills have emerged as a potent political issue in Georgia and nationwide, with grassroots opposition to data centers partly based on fears that other customers will subsidize the power demands of technology behemoths.

""I think what's happening in Georgia is in some sense a perfect microcosm of what's happening nationwide,"" said Charles Hua, executive director of Powerlines, a nonprofit group that seeks to increase public involvement in utility regulation. ""You're seeing electricity demand grow at the fastest rate in decades, and you're seeing electricity prices rise at the fastest rate in decades.""

A growing political issue

Electricity costs were a key issue in last month's elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, both data center hot spots. On Tuesday in North Carolina, Democratic Gov. Josh Stein cited concerns about data centers as one reason for opposing a 15% rate increase sought by Duke Energy for two utilities.

In Georgia, the five elected Republicans on the Public Service Commission will decide on Georgia Power's proposal weeks after voters delivered a stinging rebuke to GOP leadership, ousting two incumbent Republicans on the panel in favor of Democrats by overwhelming margins. Those two Democrats won in campaigns that centered on six Georgia Power rate increases commissioners have allowed in recent years, even though the company agreed to a three-year rate freeze in July.

After hearings next week, commissioners are scheduled to take a final vote Dec. 19. The two new Democrats won't take office until January and current commissioners denied a request by opponents to postpone the decision until then.

Brionte McCorkle of Georgia Conservation Voters, a group that advocates for carbon-free energy and supported the Democrats, fears the vote will be one last gift from the all-Republican commission to Georgia Power.

""It would be a slap in the face for the commission to rush through this proposal, and give the power company everything it wants,"" said McCorkle ""It's just not listening to what the people have said loud and clear.""

80% of new capacity for data centers

Georgia Power, with 2.8 million customers, projects the largest percentage increase in electricity demand over the next five years of any region but Texas. That's according to an analysis by power consultant Grid Strategies of forecasts filed with federal officials. The utility says it needs 10,000 megawatts of new capacity—enough to power 4 million Georgia homes—saying 80% of that would power data centers. That's in addition to the 3,000 megawatts the commission approved in 2024 after an unusual mid-cycle request by Georgia Power.

Whether the forecast is accurate and who will pay the bill if data center customers don't materialize is at the heart of the decision. Commissioners in January adopted rules meant to make sure data centers pay the costs of building new power plants and transmission lines they need. But if Georgia Power overbuilds and there are no data centers to pay, other customers could shoulder those costs.

""The whole argument is premised on the idea that if we get all these new customers, then we can take costs and spread it out over more people and therefore put downward pressure on prices,"" Hua said. ""Well, if you don't actually end up getting all those customers and you built all this new infrastructure, then you could see a scenario where you actually drive bills through the roof even more.""

The ultimate potential costs are unknown because Georgia Power's estimates are partially a trade secret that the company won't release. For example, the $15 billion price tag only covers construction costs for 80% of the current 10,000 megawatt request, and it doesn't include any of the borrowing costs, which customers must also pay. The price of the 3,000 megawatts approved in 2024 remains entirely secret. Because of the rate freeze, ultimate costs won't become clear until 2028, the next time commissioners set electricity rates.

Will customers pay?

Public Service Commission staff members who have analyzed the request say Georgia Power will need $3.4 billion a year in additional revenue by 2031, which could equal out to $20 a month for a residential customer. The company replied that such a claim is ""flatly incorrect.""

""These customers pay upfront the full costs of serving them, commit to long-term contracts, and provide financial guarantees,"" said spokesperson Matthew Kent. ""That means residential and small business customers are protected from cost increases tied to these projects.""

Staff members recommended that the commission allow Georgia Power to build capacity for new large customers only after they have signed contracts starting with 3,100 megawatts of capacity and up to 7,400 megawatts total for contracts signed by March 16. That recommendation would also allow the commission to avoid approving contracts for some new multibillion-dollar natural gas-fired power plants. Costs for such construction have risen sharply, partly because equipment manufacturers are having trouble meeting demand.

The company reacted sharply against that recommendation, saying ""it would significantly inhibit"" its ability to sign up new data centers, hurt economic development, and reduce the opportunity to lower rates.

The company and staff could negotiate a settlement before the Dec. 19 vote. McCorkle said any outcome should focus on protecting customers.

""What we don't want is a form of corporate welfare, where individual citizens are paying for the benefit of big mega corporations like Meta and Amazon,"" she said.

According to Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, the EV industry will still be vibrant, but much smaller than they initially thought.","A business cannot thrive without competition, as it is one of the main drives of efficiency and innovation. However, in the car industry, competition is fierce. Throw in changes to federal policies into the mix, and it becomes equally stressful and complicated. Now, Ford’s next EVs will be vastly different, as its CEO is clear about the future and believes adapting to the historic shift is the best way to survive. Discover what lies ahead for Ford in the future, and how it plans to adapt with its EVs.

Ford’s CEO is clear about the future

Several factors play a key role in choosing the type of car a person drives. In the U.S., being ‘carbon-conscious’ has become a significant trend, as thousands have embraced a greener lifestyle and thus, greener cars as well. While many may miss the great roar of an internal combustion engine (ICE), electric-powered vehicles (EVs) have become increasingly popular.

Beyond savings on fuel and maintenance costs, government incentives have also increased the popularity of EVs in the U.S. market. However, since the end of a particular tax credit incentive, what will the future hold for the EV market? While some may be uncertain, Ford’s CEO is clear about the future, and has even hinted that the next EVs will be vastly different to adapt to the ‘historic shift.’

Next EVs will be vastly different to adapt to the ‘historic shift’

The popular $7,500 tax credit incentive has been cut as a result of the Trump Administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The U.S. market saw a significant increase in the sales of EVs before the incentive came to an end, but what happens next?

According to Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, the EV industry will still be vibrant, but much smaller than they initially thought. At the Detroit conference, Farley stated that “partial electrification” cars, or rather hybrids, would be easier for customers to embrace, highlighting a ‘historic shift’. Farley continued that they learned their lesson the hard way by overestimating the EV market, adding:

“Customers are not interested in the $75,000 electric vehicle. They find them interesting. They’re fast, they’re efficient, you don’t go to the gas station, but they’re expensive.”

This is what the future of Ford may look like

Thanks to the federal reforms, all automakers, including Ford, will have to figure out what to do with their EV capacity and battery plants. According to Farley:

“We’re going to have to find a place; what we do with all the batter plants. And we’ll fill them. But it will be more stress because we had a four-year predictable policy. Now the policy changes. It means Ford, our construction companies, and we all have to make adjustments. And it’s going to be good for the country, I believe. But it will be one more stress on the supply side.”

For now, customers can most likely expect Ford to focus on EVs that will be much smaller and better suited to urban and suburban lifestyles with shorter commutes. Prices for these EVs will be lower, as their batteries will be significantly smaller. However, Farley added that hybrids, E-Revs, and EV plug-ins are the future (and Ford’s savior), as America is already “falling in love.”

Ford currently has few hybrid options to choose from. Currently, we can choose between the Maverick and the Escape when it comes to standard hybrids, with the Escape also available as a plug-in hybrid. However, the Escape production is coming to an end in 2026, meaning Ford’s only saviors will be the Maverick and the F-150. Only time will tell how soon Ford launches a new hybrid model. Perhaps Sweden’s new shocking hybrid model will serve as a source of inspiration in the future.

In late October, Hochul made it clear that she was having second thoughts about the building mandate, too.
They argued that under federal law, the state does not have the power to ban fossil fuel appliances.
They would need to convince the district court judge to block a law that was passed through the democratic process and that he himself had just upheld.
The plaintiffs argued that they would: Propane gas companies, for example, could lose much of their new business, and union plumbers and pipefitters could lose jobs.","When New York abruptly backed down this month from its plans to implement a nation-leading ban on gas in new buildings, some legal observers had questions. Lawmakers passed the All-Electric Buildings Act, which requires most new buildings to have only electric appliances, in 2023 as a step toward reducing pollution from the state’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions and advancing New York’s legally mandated emissions targets. It was set to take effect in January.

Delaying the law’s implementation past then would cause the state “irreparable harm,” lawyers argued in an October 1 brief. They’d spent two years successfully defending the law against industry opponents.

But the law is now on hold — with the state’s signoff. After Governor Kathy Hochul’s administration agreed, a federal judge finalized a deal last week that will likely suspend New York’s gas ban for at least a year and potentially two or more.

The state’s sudden retreat came after a series of actions from Hochul this year walking back the state’s climate commitments: shelving a promised carbon pricing program and vowing to fight a court ruling to revive it; signing off on a thrice-rejected underwater gas pipeline after talks with President Donald Trump; and granting permits to a gas-powered cryptocurrency mining facility that regulators had long said violated the state’s climate law.

In late October, Hochul made it clear that she was having second thoughts about the building mandate, too.

“On the electric building issue, I’m looking for an all of the above approach,” she told reporters in Rochester at the time. “I’m going to look at this with a very realistic approach and do what I can, because my number one focus is affordability right now.”

Republicans and upstate Democrats had been pressuring Hochul to press pause on the electric buildings law, and industry opponents of the law were still trying to persuade a judge to block it, but the state was holding its ground in court. Then, on November 12, New York’s lawyers filed an agreement with the law’s opponents to delay implementation until four months after a federal appeals court and even the US Supreme Court weigh in. The judge’s signoff made it legally binding — notably, delaying enforcement until after next year’s gubernatorial election.

Hochul’s office is now framing the court deal as a pragmatic step that will help uphold the law in the long term.

“The Governor remains committed to the all-electric-buildings law and believes this action will help the State defend it, as well as reduce regulatory uncertainty for developers during this period of litigation,” said spokesperson Ken Lovett in a statement.

Some legal experts are skeptical.

“The state’s move, while it was done under the cover of litigation, was 100 percent a political move,” said Amy Turner, director of the Cities Climate Law Initiative at Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.

If the governor had sought to put the electric buildings mandate on hold through executive action, climate groups almost certainly would have sued. With the court agreement, Turner said, “they found a way to do it that makes it seem like their hands were tied.”

Here’s a closer look at what New York argued in court in early October — and why its recent backtracking is raising eyebrows among some legal observers.

1. Plaintiffs would need to meet a really high legal bar to put the law on hold.

The saga started when a coalition of gas and construction industry interests, including building trades unions, sued New York state in the federal Northern District over the freshly passed electric buildings law in 2023. They argued that under federal law, the state does not have the power to ban fossil fuel appliances.

Judge Glenn Suddaby ruled in favor of the state this July and dismissed the case, but the plaintiffs went back to him in September, pleading for him to suspend the law anyway while they appealed the ruling. They argued that they had a strong case, citing a federal appeals court in California that had overturned Berkeley’s first-in-the-nation gas ban on the basis of the same federal law.

It was not unusual for the New York plaintiffs to seek such an injunction, said Daniel Carpenter-Gold, an attorney at the Public Health Law Center who has been tracking the case. “But it’s also very difficult to win,” he said.

In their October 1 brief, New York’s lawyers stressed just how high of a bar the plaintiffs would have to meet to secure an injunction at this stage — particularly since it was the first time in the two-year case that they’d asked the judge to take such a step.

They would need to convince the district court judge to block a law that was passed through the democratic process and that he himself had just upheld. To do so, they would need to show both that they had a good chance of winning at the appellate level, and that they would face “irreparable harm” if the law were allowed to proceed.

“Plaintiffs fail to satisfy any of these requirements,” the state’s lawyers argued.

2. New York state couldn’t block the law even if it wanted to.

The state went a step further in its October 1 filing, arguing that it couldn’t suspend the law even if it wanted to. The Code Council had already finalized the new building code, the culmination of a lengthy process that takes place every five years and is meant to take into account new laws like the All-Electric Buildings Act that are passed in the interim.

Once the new code is published, it’s up to local code enforcement officials — not the state — to enforce it. In other words, New York’s lawyers argued, it was too late for a court to force the state to block it.

3. Delaying implementation would cause the state “irreparable harm.”

The final issue at stake in the recent court exchange was which side would suffer “irreparable harm” if their opponents prevailed. The plaintiffs argued that they would: Propane gas companies, for example, could lose much of their new business, and union plumbers and pipefitters could lose jobs.

The state countered that it would, because new fossil fuel buildings constructed while the law is on hold would last for decades to come, irreversibly setting back the state’s efforts to meet its legally binding climate targets.

As the political battle over building electrification heated up in early November, there was no sign that Judge Suddaby was wavering on his decision.

On November 3, the plaintiffs said they would move the case to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals if he didn’t file an injunction within a week. He didn’t.

“The state has a strong case,” said Carpenter-Gold, of the Public Health Law Center. There was “nothing that I could see that would have indicated that their position had weakened in any way,” he said. So he was surprised when New York’s lawyers suddenly conceded the plaintiffs’ demand.

The deal suspends the law for at least a year: until the appeals court rules on it, which could easily take six months; while the plaintiffs potentially appeal to the US Supreme Court, which could add several months more, even if the high court declines to take up the case; and for another four months either way.

Climate hawks are furious at the Hochul administration’s decision. After it was first reported, lawmakers and advocates lined up to demand that the governor reverse course. That would be hard for her to do. Now that the judge has signed off on the November 12 deal, the state is under court order to keep the law on ice. The New York Department of State issued a notice late last week that the all-electric section of the building code is on pause.

It’s not yet clear whether the notice fully satisfies the court order, or whether the code council will take further action to codify the delay. Climate advocates are planning to rally outside its next meeting, on December 5, either way.",https://i0.wp.com/www.adirondackexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Electric-Buildings.webp?fit=1640%2C1092&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-06 17:59:50.711969

An estimated 9.2 million lead service lines currently deliver drinking water to homes, businesses, schools, and unsuspecting citizens throughout the United States. Lead water lines pose an extremely high public safety issue. This has been a known fact for many years, and concern was raised again recently when the U.S. EPA released data showing that approximately 9.2 million water lines still need to be replaced.

There has been an abundance of funding available for cities and counties to address this public health issue, so it is disheartening to realize that millions of lead water lines are still delivering water to citizens.

The federal government allocated $15 billion in funding in 2021 to address lead pipe water issues. And recently, the Environmental Defense Fund announced that more than 250 utilities have active lead-service-line replacement programs underway. While progress is being made, questions remain about why more public entities are moving slowly and how long the federal funding support will remain in place.

Since the funding framework for supporting water projects, specifically lead water pipe replacement projects, is currently under review, several states are aggressively urging the Trump Administration to continue the financial funding support for projects to mitigate this public safety issue.

In the meantime, many upcoming lead water line replacement projects will be launched in 2025. These will be large and critically important initiatives. The following future contracting opportunities are examples of what can be expected in 2026.

City leaders in Detroit, Michigan, will soon launch a $140 million project for a large-scale and citywide water infrastructure improvement initiative as aging water mains lead service lines are replaced. The project’s scope will include two primary water main replacement packages covering more than 25 miles of distribution pipelines. It will also include five dedicated lead service line replacement projects to remove and replace thousands of residential service connections from the water main. The work will include street restoration, new valves and hydrants, and system pressure improvements to enhance long-term performance. Approximately $20 million has been allocated for each component of work. Construction is expected to begin in July 2026 and continue until July 2028.

Officials at the San Antonio Water System (SAWS) will launch a $114 million systemwide initiative designed to identify and replace lead service lines across its regional water network. The multi-year program will begin with an extensive inventory and field inspection process to locate and classify the materials used for more than 600,000 customer service lines. As strange as it may sound, more than half of the lines are made of unknown materials. The total number of lines to be replaced will be determined by inventory findings, but projections are that thousands of lead or unknown material service connections will require replacements.

Current estimates indicate that the inspection and data collection efforts will continue through 2026, with design and early engineering to ramp up in late 2026 and possibly continue into early 2027. Construction procurements will begin as soon as possible after all other phases are completed.

New York City's lead service line replacement program will launch with a $72 million city-led expansion that will initially target specific neighborhoods in the Bronx before moving on to the Queens and Brooklyn areas. The program, announced in October 2025 and partially funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will standardize design, outreach, and compliance across boroughs while expediting the replacement of lead service lines for public health protections.

Some noteworthy components of this work will include uniform design packages, resident outreach programs, coordination of utility and street restoration work, block-by-block mapping, and an inventory of service line materials. Delivery will occur in phases over several years. Currently, the project is in the design stage and construction solicitation documents will be released as design standards and packaging are finalized in 2026. Phased neighborhood work packages will be released beginning in 2026, and more bidding opportunities will follow.

City leaders in Shorewood, Wisconsin, will also launch a project to replace lead infested service lines and aging water mains at a cost of approximately $44 million. The village’s goal is to eliminate all public and private sector lead service lines, but that will take many years. This initial effort will kick start the program. The capital investment that was required to support this water infrastructure project comes from local, state, and federal sources, including an allocation from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Shorewood maintains more than 30 miles of water main lines, and most were installed before 1940. Officials estimate that more than 90% of homes are connected by lead service lines. All the new replacement lines will be copper. Design work is underway, and the selection of a contracting firm will precede the planned construction which is slated to begin in 2026. Three additional similar phases of work are scheduled for 2027 when 160 lead service lines and two water mains are ready for updating.

As America enters 2026, the nation stands at a crossroads: the scale of the remaining work is enormous, but the momentum appears to be very strong. With federal funding under review and many states pushing for continued support, the next few years will determine whether the country can finally eliminate this long-recognized hazard. What is clear is that every mile of pipe replaced represents a step toward safer communities, healthier families, and a modernized water system in America worthy of public trust.",https://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/image/135e576e/135e576e-98f5-4435-b33c-0aaf00dbf16d/leadpipeinground_getty_2211014580.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 00:57:36.182079

The mobile battery energy storage system, known as MBESS, is a potential replacement for use of portable diesel generators.
“Advancing energy storage technology is essential to accelerating the clean energy transition,” said New York Power Authority President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll.
The mobile energy storage system being investigated, Viridi’s RSP150, is an 8.5-foot trailer-mounted, lithium-ion unit that can provide 30kW of power for approximately five hours.
“This mobile battery storage system demonstration and collaboration offers a better understanding of this emerging technology and its potential impact in real-world conditions,” said Haresh Kamath, director of energy storage and cross-cutting technologies at EPRI.","The New York Power Authority (NYPA) is collaborating with Cornell University and the Electric Power Research Institute to demonstrate use of a quieter and no-emission mobile battery to power campus events.

The mobile battery energy storage system, known as MBESS, is a potential replacement for use of portable diesel generators.

""Use of new technologies like the MBESS unit is evidence of New York’s commitment to transition to a clean energy economy and to pursue new energy storage options that will help strengthen the state’s electric system, ensuring its reliability and resilience,"" NYPA said.

“Advancing energy storage technology is essential to accelerating the clean energy transition,” said New York Power Authority President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll. “The success of the new mobile battery storage system at Cornell highlights NYPA’s commitment to innovation and to piloting new technologies that can be scaled to drive New York’s energy future.”

The newly designed MBESS unit debuted in November at Cornell’s Ithaca campus to validate the system’s ability to provide temporary power during various large outdoor events.

The unit will be evaluated for its contribution to energy resilience and emergency response efforts. Cornell used the MBESS system Nov. 20 at the “Charging Forward: Cornell’s Mobile Battery Demonstration.”

Mobile battery energy storage systems have emerged in recent years as a versatile option to provide a clean and quiet alternative to portable diesel fuel generation power at off-grid locations. Unlike stationary storage systems, MBESS can be deployed to remote or temporary sites, providing temporary power under various applications such as grid support, emergency backup, and remote power supply.

Cornell’s system, manufactured by Viridi, employs Viridi’s proprietary lithium-ion battery technology, reducing potential fire risk, and is being explored as a quieter option, a flexible emergency power source, and a new standard for providing on-site power at locations where power is limited or non-existent.

For Cornell, this project builds on the university’s long-standing commitment to sustainability and carbon neutrality. The mobile battery will contribute to Cornell’s living laboratory for sustainable innovation, which seeks to simultaneously improve university facilities while demonstrating scalable sustainability solutions for the general public.

“Cornell is proud to collaborate with NYPA and EPRI on this exciting demonstration of mobile battery energy storage,” said Juliet Parsons, associate director of Operations and Logistics at Cornell University. “The MBESS project supports Cornell’s campus-wide commitment to carbon neutrality while offering a cleaner, quieter, and more efficient power solution for major events like commencement, reunion, and other campus-wide gatherings. By reducing our reliance on diesel generators, we’re improving both the sustainability and quality of event support, while also contributing to the university’s role as a living laboratory for scalable clean energy innovation.”

When not in use, Cornell’s MBESS will be parked at a charging center where it is connected to the grid. When the MBESS is required to provide temporary power to an event or during an emergency, it is disconnected from the grid and transported to a site where it can be used as standalone power source for up to five hours.

This transportable characteristic is particularly valuable during an emergency event such as a storm where quick response and adaptability are crucial, NYPA noted.

The MBESS will be used to provide power during outdoor campus events such as convocation, graduation, reunion and homecoming. The unit could generate power to light up large tents, give catering trucks a place to plug in, power an inflatable large screen at movie nights, amongst other activities.

The MBESS will avoid the need for polluting generators that normally would have to be gassed up several times during the run of outdoor events.

The mobile energy storage system being investigated, Viridi’s RSP150, is an 8.5-foot trailer-mounted, lithium-ion unit that can provide 30kW of power for approximately five hours. The unit will be deployed to various sites as needed, primarily for large-scale events that require reliable power without sole reliance on portable diesel generators.

NYPA funded the project and engaged Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability and the Facilities and Campus Services Office to host the demonstration and oversaw the installation of charging infrastructure and site acceptance testing.

Under the research and development project, NYPA and EPRI researchers will document the process and procedures of acquiring and deploying the MBESS to expand the industry’s understanding of the technology’s readiness and characteristics.

Cornell faculty and students will examine how the technology can help reduce the environmental footprint of large universities in a cost-effective manner. Advancing MBESS has the potential to provide societal benefit by increasing the flexibility, reliability and resiliency of clean energy use.

“This mobile battery storage system demonstration and collaboration offers a better understanding of this emerging technology and its potential impact in real-world conditions,” said Haresh Kamath, director of energy storage and cross-cutting technologies at EPRI. “The insights gained here can help inform broader industry adoption of flexible technologies, supporting a more reliable and resilient energy future.”

In addition, performance across industries has recently been notably uneven. While current challenges are clearly affecting near-term expansion, looking out over a few decades, we are still seeing signs of solid potential.

One factor influencing U.S. growth at present is the performance of other countries. Leading global economic analysts are generally projecting moderate growth over the next few years, which is a welcomed signal. However, significant downside risks could affect not only the immediate situation, but also the long-term outlook. One factor which could reduce future gains is the potential for decreased supply chain efficiencies, whether from trade tensions due to policy decisions or ongoing international conflicts.

Another concern is the high cost of energy, which is curtailing growth (as well as quality of life) in numerous countries. Prices are negatively affecting expansion in Europe and other areas, and overall inflation remains an issue. While comparatively low energy prices in the U.S. are making manufactured goods more competitive abroad, there are offsetting downside risks arising from stagnant conditions in other major economies. Fiscal challenges are also increasingly problematic, with many countries facing difficult decisions related to rising debt service, growing entitlements (such as pensions for aging populations), and pressing infrastructure requirements.

Simultaneously, there is potential for technology (especially AI) to reshape international patterns by reducing costs, opening markets, and enabling smaller players. However, optimizing these benefits depends on, among other things, efforts to assure access for emerging countries and stable and predictable trade rules.

Over the long-term horizon, the effects of underlying demographic patterns will further affect overall prospects. As with many nations, U.S. birthrates are falling significantly, and virtually all population gains stem from in-migration. AI is potentially a major factor in dealing with the lack of growth in the numbers of people in prime working age ranges (at least temporarily), but for many essential occupations, hands-on work is essential. The need for sensible immigration policies is clear, as is the need for efforts to encourage labor force participation and productivity.

Even with the current challenges, our analysis of the outlook for the U.S. economy indicates moderate growth, with real gross domestic product expanding at a 2.48% annual rate and a gain of some 79.6 million jobs over the next 30 years. The pace will depend in part on how effectively current issues are dealt with, but the fundamental structure of the national economy remains sound. Business cycles are inevitable, but the U.S. economy has a structural framework conducive to long-term expansion.

Climate change is any significant change in the measures of climate lasting for an extended period of time. In other words, climate change includes major changes in temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns, among others, that occur over several decades or longer.

There are a wide variety of factors that influence climate change. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, some of them include reflectivity of the sun’s energy, changes in the earth’s orbit and rotation, volcanic activity, and greenhouse gas emissions.

What Are Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions?

View the City of Lakewood's annual GHG reports.

Greenhouse gases (GHG) in our atmosphere absorb radiant energy from the sun causing the atmosphere to warm and making it suitable for life. Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, add more greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane to the atmosphere. This enhances the greenhouse effect, trapping more heat and causing global temperatures to rise.

Image Description:

Solar energy travels to the Earth at sunlight.

Sunlight hits the Earth and is absorbed, heating the planet.

GHGs in the atmosphere prevent some of the heat from escaping, warming the Earth over time. Continued use of fossil fuels increases the Greenhouse Effect to dangerous levels.

Beginning with the Industrial Revolution in the late 1700s, human civilization has increasingly emitted CO2 and other GHGs into the atmosphere. Current levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have increased by 40% from historic levels, corresponding to rising global temperatures. Since 1880, the global annual average temperature has increased by 1.8°F, according to data from the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC). Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Consensus from the world's leading climate scientists estimate that temperatures will increase between 6.7 and 8.4°F by the end of the century. GHG emissions increase and changes to the climate carry the risks of severe and sometimes irreversible impacts to our natural and human systems. In Lakewood, drought, reduced snowpack, strained water supply, disaster recovery costs and other impacts are already influencing municipal operations and household economies.

Tracking GHG Emissions

Lakewood Community Sustainability, Climate, and Zero Waste division works to do our part in reducing GHG emissions and adapting to a changing climate system in order to ensure a resilient future. We measure communitywide emissions through GHG emission inventories. These help us understand where emissions come from and what might be driving their growth is the first step toward reducing our contribution to global GHG emissions.

Lakewood annually reports its GHG emissions and efforts to reduce emissions to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). In 2018, Lakewood joined 43 other cities around the world on the CDP Cities A List, for its leadership in environmental action.

Half of the 2,400 miles of streams they inspected “showed significant damage from livestock grazing,” according to their March report.
But the industry as a whole is hesitant to surrender grazing permits.","This story was originally published by ProPublica and co-published with High Country News.

Once every 10 years, ranchers must renew the permits that allow their cattle, sheep and other livestock to graze on the West’s public domain. These renewals are the government’s best opportunity to address how those livestock are harming the environment.

The Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service, the federal agencies that manage the majority of public lands, are required by law to review each permit before deciding whether to place additional conditions on it or — in rare cases — to deny its renewal.

But in 2014, Congress mandated that the agencies automatically renew permits for another decade if they are unable to complete the reviews. This exemption has dramatically reduced scrutiny of grazing’s impact on public lands.

In 2013, the BLM approved grazing on 47% of its land open to livestock without an environmental review, a ProPublica and High Country News analysis of agency data showed. (The status of about another 10% of BLM land was unclear that year.) A decade later, the BLM authorized grazing on roughly 75% of its acreage without review, the analysis found.

A similar study by conservation group Western Watersheds Project found a steep decline in environmental reviews on grazing land managed by the Forest Service.

This diminishing oversight has coincided with a sharp drop in the number of federal staff who complete the reviews. These staffers also conduct land health assessments of large parcels to help inform whether permits in the area need changes to protect natural resources.

The BLM’s rangeland management staff shrank 39% between 2020 and 2024, according to Office of Personnel Management data. President Donald Trump’s administration is further hamstringing the BLM — about 1 in 10 rangeland staff members left the agency between last November’s election and June, according to agency records.

When agency staff aren’t monitoring the land, cattle can graze where they’re not supposed to, or in greater numbers or for longer periods than permitted. Such overgrazing can spread invasive plants by dispersing seeds and disturbing the soil, pushing out native species and worsening wildfire risk. When herds strip vegetation near creeks and streams, silt flows into the waterways, wiping out fish nurseries. And, without adequate staff to amend permits, agencies lose the chance to reduce the number of animals on an allotment — and the climate-warming methane they emit.

Once a permit is renewed, with or without a review, it becomes more difficult to rectify such harms for another decade.

Ten current and former BLM rangeland management employees said in interviews that they felt pressure to go easy on ranchers. This included downplaying environmental harm in permit reviews and land health assessments, according to BLM staffers who worked in rangeland management. Several spoke on condition of anonymity because they still work for the government.

“Sometimes the truth was spoken, but, more often than not, it was not the truth,” one BLM employee said of agency oversight.

In a statement, an agency spokesperson said, “The BLM is committed to transparency, sound science, and public participation as it administers grazing permits and considers updates to grazing regulations.”

In a shift, the Trump administration placed the approval process for all the BLM’s contracts and agreements of value in the hands of political appointees rather than career civil servants. In recent months, officials cut funding for an app that assists ranchers in collecting soil and vegetation data for use in permitting, for contractors who manage the data that informs grazing permits, for New Mexico farmers growing seeds used in restoration projects and for soil research in the Southwest, according to BLM records obtained by ProPublica and High Country News.

“Does not believe this action is needed to meet the administration priorities,” the cancellations read.

The Forest Service did not respond to requests for comment. The White House referred questions to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which said in a statement, “Ranching is often a multi-generation practice that serves to keep working landscapes intact, while also preserving open space, and benefiting recreation, wildlife, and watersheds.”

To gauge the effects of this shrinking oversight, ProPublica and High Country News toured parcels of federal grazing land, called allotments, in Arizona, Colorado, Montana and Nevada, finding evidence of either unpermitted grazing or habitat degraded by livestock in each state. In Arizona alone, reporters witnessed such issues in two national conservation areas, a national monument and a national forest.

On an allotment within Las Cienegas National Conservation Area, an expanse of desert grasslands and forested streams southeast of Tucson, the BLM lets up to 1,500 head of cattle graze across roughly 35,000 acres. These permits were recently reauthorized until 2035 using the exemption that allows environmental reviews to be skipped.

During a visit in late April, a grove of hearty cottonwoods stood against the afternoon sun, casting cool shadows over a narrow creek. This stretch of green sustains birds, frogs, snakes and ocelots. It’s also designated under federal law as critical habitat for five threatened or endangered species. Cattle are not allowed in the creekbed, but a thin barbed-wire fence meant to stop the animals lay crumpled in the dirt.

A native leopard frog broke the hot afternoon stillness as it leapt from the creek’s bank. Its launching pad was the hardened mud imprint of a cow hoof, and it landed with a plop in water fouled by cow feces and the partially submerged bones of a cow corpse. A half-dozen cattle crashed through the creek and up the steep embankment, tearing up plants that protected the soil from erosion and sending silt billowing into the water.

“Looks like a sewer,” Chris Bugbee, a wildlife ecologist with the environmental group the Center for Biological Diversity, remarked as he took in the destruction. “This one hurts. There is no excuse.”

A 2024 BLM land health assessment listed the grazing allotment as “ALL STANDARDS MET.” In April, a camouflaged trail camera bearing the agency’s insignia was pointed toward the creek. (ProPublica and High Country News submitted a public records request for images on the camera’s memory card in May, but the BLM has yet to fulfill the request.)

No ranchers paid to graze their livestock in this allotment last year, according to BLM data, so it is unclear who owned the cattle. The Arizona Cattle Growers’ Association, which represents ranchers in the state, did not respond to requests for comment.

Over the past eight years, Bugbee and his team have annually surveyed grazing impacts on the banks of streams and rivers in the Southwest that are designated as critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act. Half of the 2,400 miles of streams they inspected “showed significant damage from livestock grazing,” according to their March report.

The industry maintains that the presence of livestock benefits many ecosystems, pointing to studies that have found, for example, that grazing can increase soil’s ability to hold carbon dioxide that would otherwise contribute to climate change. Other research suggests that, when managed properly, grazing can improve the health of habitat enough to support a more diverse mix of species.

Grazing also reduces vegetation that could fuel wildfires. Frank Shirts Jr., owner of the largest sheep operation on Forest Service land, said that sheep eat invasive weeds and brush, creating firebreaks. “These animals are fantastic,” he said.

Retta Bruegger, a range ecologist at Colorado State University, said that some ecosystems, especially those that receive more precipitation, can withstand more intense grazing without permanently damaging the land. In regions where plants evolved over many years alongside large grazers like cattle, livestock can “provide a very important ecosystem function.”

“We should be asking, ‘Are there individual producers who need to be doing a better job?’ instead of asking, ‘Should there be grazing or no grazing?’” said Bruegger, who supports balancing the industry’s needs with the land’s.

But answering those questions, she said, would require adequate staff to monitor the land.

Rubber stamping

After a century of intense grazing wore down public lands, a court ruled in 1974 that grazing permits were subject to environmental reviews, and Congress passed a law two years later mandating them every decade.

For years, a backlog of permit reviews grew, as federal land management agencies lacked the staff to inspect all their territory — 240 million acres across BLM and Forest Service jurisdictions. Around 2000, Congress began giving temporary approval for regulators to skip reviews. Western Republicans, with the livestock industry’s support, pushed to enshrine the concept in law. The idea ultimately received bipartisan approval in December 2014, after being slipped into a must-pass defense spending bill.

Some conservationists now call it simply “the loophole.”

Many in the livestock industry lambaste the lack of reviews. When permits are automatically renewed, the law does not allow the terms to change, so ranchers are prevented from updating their grazing practices.

“It just locks people into grazing the same place, the same time, year after year,” said Chris Jasmine, manager of biodiversity and rangelands for Nevada Gold Mines, which owns 11 ranches in northern Nevada.

To help inform permit renewals, teams of BLM experts — rangeland specialists, hydrologists, botanists, soil scientists and wildlife biologists — assess the health of grazing allotments.

When the process is working as intended, these assessments are considered in permit reviews. But the current lack of staff has left large swaths of land without scrutiny.

All told, the BLM oversees 155 million acres of public lands available for grazing. But the agency has no record of completing land health assessments for more than 35 million acres, nearly a quarter of its total.

Where the BLM has conducted such assessments, it found grazing had degraded at least 38 million acres, an area about half the size of New Mexico. And close to two-thirds of the land it listed as being in good shape had not been checked in more than a decade, the analysis found.

The situation, though, is even worse than those numbers indicate, as the agency has often skipped permit reviews on land in poor condition. Even if the BLM had previously found the environment to be in bad shape, Congress’ 2014 law still dictated automatic renewal. Of the acreage the agency had previously found to be degraded due to livestock, 82% was reauthorized for grazing without a review, according to ProPublica and High Country News’ analysis.

Several BLM employees said agency higher-ups instruct staff to study land that’s in better condition while avoiding allotments that are in worse shape or more controversial. Environmental groups such as the Western Watersheds Project as well as local stockmen’s associations are quick to litigate changes to permits. Automatic renewals avoid these drawn-out public fights. “We were just using a bureaucratic loophole,” one staffer said. “We were allowing ongoing degradation of habitat.”

“This can’t be the future of public lands,” Bugbee, with the Center for Biological Diversity, said of parcels degraded by cattle, likening the land to a “mowed lawn.”

Agency staff pointed to myriad reasons why the environment is suffering.

For example, after a wildfire, the BLM aims to keep livestock off the land for two years to allow the ecosystem to recover. But ranchers often negotiate an earlier return to the public pastures where their livestock graze, said Steve Ellis, who spent his career with the BLM and Forest Service, rising to high-level positions in both.

“There was always pressure to get back on,” Ellis said. “That’s not a new thing. It’s just part of working for the bureau.”

The government’s support for ranchers can add to the damage. Land management agencies sometimes seed invasive grasses, which can benefit livestock, although those plants can drive out species that are native to the local ecosystem. And state and federal agencies kill predators such as wolves and cougars — also integral to a healthy balance of species — to protect ranchers’ economic interests.

Some staff members also question the agency’s oversight.

BLM employees said that in some permit reviews and land health assessments, rank-and-file staff noted the presence of threatened and endangered species, which would have triggered tighter environmental controls, only for agency managers to delete that information from their reports.

One current BLM staffer called the reviews “rubber stamping” and said higher-ranking staff who controlled the text of reports “wouldn’t let me stick anything into the official documentation that acknowledged things were in poor shape.”

Another complicating factor, according to BLM staff, is that ranchers are often invited to participate in fieldwork to gauge whether they are overgrazing. The results, employees said, were watered-down reviews and assessments.

The industry, though, is critical of the assessment process for other reasons. Erin Spaur, executive vice president of the Colorado Cattlemen’s Association, said it’s an inflexible “one-size-fits-all approach” that doesn’t sufficiently account for differences in ecosystems.

“There are huge cultural problems within the agency,” said Dennis Willis, who spent more than three decades with the BLM, including managing rangeland, adding that “there’s a real fear of dealing with grazing problems.”

Flexibility and collaboration

Some ranchers acknowledge the environmental impacts of their industry. But they say that more flexibility — not stricter oversight — would make them better stewards of the land.

Jasmine, with Nevada Gold Mines, contends that ranching can be done without denuding the West. A sixth-generation Nevadan, he oversees the mining company’s ranching operations, which run about 5,000 head of cattle.

On a sunny July day near Carlin, Nevada, Jasmine walked through chest-high vegetation to show off the recovery of Maggie Creek, a tributary to the Humboldt River that flows through a checkerboard of public and private lands. Photographs from the 1980s show barren ground around the shallow creek. When ranchers changed how they rotated their herds in the 1990s to give the streambed more rest, the land bounced back, Jasmine said, as a chorus of chirping birds punctuated his story. He credited a BLM biologist with initiating many of the projects that helped revive Maggie Creek.

“It’s a renewable resource. That grass that they’re eating right now will come back next year and the year after that if managed properly,” he said. “It’s about not eating the same plants in the same place year after year after year.”

Jasmine touted the company’s goal of protecting locally important species, its sage grouse restoration projects and its partnership with the BLM, which targeted grazing to remove unwanted vegetation and create a firebreak.

But Nevada Gold Mines — a joint venture between two companies with a combined value of around $150 billion — operates in a different economic reality than most ranchers and can afford to keep cattle off the land long enough for it to recover.

Smaller ranchers face slim profit margins, making it attractive to heavily graze federal lands, where the cost is much lower than on state or private land.

For years, some politicians and environmental groups have proposed protecting degraded or sensitive habitats by paying ranchers to retire their permits, making the areas off limits to grazing and preserving the land as wildlife habitat. Ranchers have occasionally taken these offers. But the industry as a whole is hesitant to surrender grazing permits.

In October, U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat, introduced a bill to further voluntary retirement, calling it “a pragmatic solution that supports local economies, protects biodiversity, and saves taxpayer dollars by reducing the cost of administering grazing programs.”

Louis Wertz, a spokesperson for the Western Landowners Alliance, said that the conservation-minded ranchers who make up his group want to both stay in business and “live in a place that is vibrant, full of life, provides clean water, has clean air.” But when it comes to food production, he added, “the expectations we have of both being environmentally harmless and healthy and cheap are untenable. Over the last 150 years in the United States, we have chosen cheapness at the expense of environmental quality.”

Like Jasmine, Wertz said that understaffing at the BLM and Forest Service deprives ranchers of an opportunity to change how they manage their herds, even when they want to.

“It is important that there be accountability for producers on the landscape,” Wertz said, but there should also be “flexibility so producers can be economically successful and so they can do what is right for the landscape.”",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/250429_HCN_6990_maxHeight_3000_maxWidth_3000.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 13:00:47.498644

Natural gas usage must diminish over time, so that renewable clean electricity comprises the dominant energy source, not the subordinate one.
This situation has created a market that is heavily tilted in favor of fossil fuels, a serious disadvantage for clean energy generation and storage.
This is not a free market, and creates mismatched choices for consumers who desire lower cost clean energy.
We must open the doors to more opportunities for clean electricity, storage and resilient systems installations across our communities.","The good people of Connecticut do deserve clean affordable electricity. The recent commentary is correct in saying that demand for energy is not going away. In fact, it is increasing with the prevalence of data centers and growth within our cities. Natural gas is touted as reliable, on-demand energy. This is true. But it is also a fossil fuel that produces (with increased use) greater amounts of greenhouse gases, which accelerates climate change, impacts our health and environment, and slows the transition to a truly clean energy future.

So, to recognize the simple truth that if our society wants a clean and cost-effective electricity, we must move towards clean energy sources. These include solar, wind, geo-exchange and use of battery storage, heat pumps, passive construction and other innovations. Electricity generation in Connecticut is sourced from natural gas: 60.7%. Nuclear, 33.9%, renewables, 4.3%; according to the Energy Information Administration. Renewables are just a footnote. Natural gas usage must diminish over time, so that renewable clean electricity comprises the dominant energy source, not the subordinate one.

Fossil fuels for the great majority of our energy history have been more heavily subsidized than renewables. They have received approximately nine times more subsidies than renewables. Starting in about 2016 subsidies for renewables began to increase annually towards those levels of fossil fuels. With the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 subsidies for renewables increases significantly. Those, however, are being dismantled by the current administration.

In the 2025 spending bill, the administration added nearly $40 billion in new federal subsidies for fossil fuels over the next decade. This is on top of the pre-existing $30.8 billion annual subsidies for fossil fuels. Additionally, the fossil fuel industry benefits from increasingly lax regulations on pollution from natural gas and other fossil fuels, freeing them up from responsibility from the negative health and environmental impacts to our citizens. Not having to pay for these impacts is called “implicit subsidies” and total an estimated $62 billion annually. This situation has created a market that is heavily tilted in favor of fossil fuels, a serious disadvantage for clean energy generation and storage. This is not a free market, and creates mismatched choices for consumers who desire lower cost clean energy. The decades of large subsidies for fossil fuels helped build out necessary infrastructure, a situation not wholly available to the renewable clean electricity sector because of historic subsidies.

Due to these disparities in subsidies, many have promoted fair market pricing of carbon emissions (a carbon tax) on fossil fuels, and pairing that with a cash-back for citizens to receive those collected funds to offset pricing fluctuations during the transition towards clean electricity. According to The Wall Street Journal, 3,649 economists support pricing carbon.

The argument for using natural gas because it “provides crucial backup to intermittent resources” is a false leader. Currently natural gas is the dominant fuel for electricity generation, not a backup fuel. Promoting more natural gas impedes innovation to generation and storage systems that can address spikes in demand. ISO New England notes that behind-the-meter solar has helped manage peak energy needs, especially during summer heat waves. Therefore, rather than spending hundreds of millions of dollars on new natural gas infrastructure and power plants, the money would be better spent modernizing the grid with clean electricity generation systems. Natural gas is not more flexible than clean renewables when paired with battery storage and other innovations. Stepping back to natural gas is a step backward for our energy systems.

The Department of Energy notes that 67% of natural gas pumped from the ground in the U.S. is from fracked resources, of which there are over one million wells. Fracking impacts water quality in aquifers and utilizes chemical mixtures containing carcinogenic compounds impacting the environment and human health. Reducing exposure from these practices and pollutants is a sound environmental move.

Legislation is critical in balancing state and national energy policies. For Connecticut, Public Act No. 25-125 states "" ... state agencies shall have the goal of only utilizing zero-carbon generating electricity by 2030.” It also says, “The state shall reduce the level of emissions of greenhouse gas ... not later than January 1, 2030, to a level at least forty-five per cent below the level emitted in 2001.” And by January 1, 2050, Connecticut must – by law – provide an eighty per cent reduction in GHGs compared to 2001. Connecticut will not achieve these mandated goals if we expand the use of natural gas and other fossil fuels, and in doing so will break the law.

None of our energy sources is “the enemy."" It is about using our technological advancements to bring lower cost and clean electricity to Connecticut. Three generations ago, natural gas was pegged as a “bridge fuel."" That bridge is now being extended to unfair lengths, and future generations will ask why we didn’t fix this now rather than put the burden upon them. Renewable systems offer greater energy security, more jobs, long-term affordability and a healthier environment for people. We must open the doors to more opportunities for clean electricity, storage and resilient systems installations across our communities.",http://d3gouztkx1c1lh.cloudfront.net/360_TheDay_Live/0/0/0/0/766/789/766789_original,N,,2025-12-06 14:01:09.468702

The continent is considering combining clean hydrogen production with synthetic fuels to power heavy transport. For this mission, turquoise hydrogen is all the more essential. This is a form of low-carbon hydrogen that gets produced without any CO₂ emissions.

Where does methanol come into the equation?

The fact that turquoise hydrogen exists is not what Europe is most interested in. For European developers, the best part is the ability to use this clean hydrogen to produce 150,000 tonnes of methanol per year, which is a core fuel for the decarbonization era. This fuel will be of utmost importance in the shipping industry.

The reason why hydrogen will be used to produce methanol is that hydrogen is rather difficult to transport and store. Methanol, on the other hand, is a liquid that is compatible with existing storage tanks, making it far easier to ship. Another exciting feature is that e-methanol is one of the most promising marine fuels. E-methanol is basically methanol produced using low-carbon hydrogen and captured CO₂.

A British-based project at the forefront of the turquoise hydrogen endeavor

Hilroc, the British-based company, is taking the lead in terms of getting Europe to produce methanol from turquoise hydrogen. The firm will build a turquoise hydrogen facility in Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, that is integrated with the energy-from-waste plant that is being developed by Agile Energy. In turn, a 150,000-tonnes-per-year e-methanol plant will be constructed.

This integration model will process about 200,000 tonnes of municipal and industrial waste each year. The whole idea is not to release carbon into the atmosphere but to amalgamate the captured carbon with Hiroc’s turquoise hydrogen to ensure that a circular carbon system is created. In this way, low-carbon methanol is produced, and this methanol fully resonates with Europe’s net-zero emissions ambition.

Thermal Plasma Electrolysis (TPE) will be relied upon to split methane to yield hydrogen and solid carbon. Thermal Plasma Electrolysis aligns with the UK’s Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard.

What Europe hopes for when it comes to methanol production?

In Europe, there is a strong demand for methanol as it is seen as the most lucrative replacement for diesel in the maritime industry. Europe has high hopes of producing at least 150,000 tons at the Scottish site, making the site one of the largest e-methanol facilities in Europe.

The advantage of methanol is rather apparent since it is easy to store and blend. Another advantage of this project is that waste will be used as feedstock, and thus, CO₂ emissions will be captured for synthetic fuel production. In the process, the facility will reduce landfill pressure while displacing fossil fuels that are commonly used in the marine industry. Europe is set on its mission to get rid of CO₂ emissions completely and has already answered the question, what to do with Earth’s CO₂. The continent has decided to bury it with 10 million tons disappearing. The continent has recently discovered that carbon capture is the missing piece that may have been the answer we all have been looking for.

Europe is geared for a clean fuel future

This Inverurie project will be rather valuable for Europe’s renewable energy future, and it will signify a huge turning point should all go well with the plans for the hydrogen to methanol value chain. Turquoise hydrogen has the potential to unlock long-term decarbonization. The truth is that 150,000 tons is only the start of a clean fuel future for Europe. With Europe going green at a desperate speed, we can only anticipate what will come next.

Sign up for their newsletter here.

Sales of new electric vehicles have plunged since federal tax credits ended on Sept. 30.

In November, EVs accounted for 5.3 percent of U.S. new-car and light-truck sales, a share that was less than half the record high in September, according to an estimate published last week by S&P Global Mobility.

The numbers were especially ugly on Tuesday when several automakers released their November figures. Ford said that unit sales of its Mustang Mach-E were down 49 percent compared to the same month in 2024. Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 was down 59 percent. I could go on.

But most industry analysts are not sounding an alarm. This is because the decline in sales was expected the moment in July that President Donald Trump signed the legislation that canceled the credit, which was up to $7,500 per vehicle. The law led to months of chaos, during which many consumers accelerated their purchasing decisions to qualify for the credit, contributing to the collapse that followed.

One of the main questions going forward is how long it will take for the market to return to some kind of normalcy. The most common answer I’m seeing is that the current shakeout will likely last well into 2026.

After that, we’ll get to the more important question: What happens next? To help figure this out, I spoke with Peter Slowik, U.S. passenger vehicles lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation, or ICCT, a research nonprofit with offices around the globe.

Researchers use different methods to calculate the total cost of ownership, making this a challenging metric to agree on. (Car and Driver published an overview this summer of the factors to watch.)

But there is little debate that the costs of EVs will continue to decrease, even with cuts to subsidies.

Automakers, who think in decade-plus time horizons, can see the way things are going. Each company is making strategic choices about how much to maintain gasoline and hybrid vehicle lineups, even as they know electric drivetrains will dominate the long-term future.

“We think this transition is inevitable, and the automakers that can [best navigate] this transition are the ones that are likely to win the race,” Slowik said. “They stand to win big, both at home, in terms of their domestic manufacturing volumes, and their sales shares relative to other automakers, but then also abroad.”

ICCT is a useful resource for understanding this moment. For starters, check out a Nov. 17 blog post that offers data-backed commentary on U.S. policy.

Any attempt to make predictions carries risk. If you’d asked me a year ago, I would not have guessed that Trump would be able to pass a repeal of the EV tax credits.

The credits largely benefited U.S.-based companies such as Tesla, Ford and General Motors, helping them gain a competitive edge over models assembled in other countries that were not eligible.

It didn’t make sense to remove the tax credits—and do so with such suddenness—except for the odd political reality of this year and the way the debate in Congress was dominated by fiscal hardliners.

But the push and pull of adding or subtracting subsidies will ultimately matter less than larger factors, such as the long-term decline in battery costs and the increase in battery efficiency.

In the meantime, the rough sales numbers are going to continue. Let’s reconvene next year at this time and we’ll have a better sense of what the recovery looks like.

The HVAC industry says furnaces can last up to 30 years, but the average is 15 to 20 years before the system fails. And that never happens on a sunny spring day.

Before it does, it might be useful to have a plan on what to replace it with, taking into account cost, performance and environmental impact.

Which costs more to buy: a gas or electric furnace?

About 24% of homes in North Carolina use natural gas for heating, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

If yours is one, you already have the gas line and connection, which means your up-front cost to install a new gas furnace would be lower compared to someone who doesn’t have that infrastructure.

A gas furnace itself can cost $3,000 to $8,000, according to industry estimates, which can be as much as twice the purchase price of an electric furnace.

Is a gas or electric furnace cheaper to run?

Operating costs typically run lower for gas furnaces because gas, at the moment, is less expensive than electricity when used for heating. Gas prices do fluctuate and Duke Energy currently has a request for an electric rate hike on the table.

The nonpartisan but pro-natural-gas-industry group Consumer Energy Alliance says operating costs for gas appliances are significantly lower than electric heating sources.

Technologies for both gas and electric heat likely have improved since your system was installed, and depending on efficiency upgrades, it may be worth replacing your unit even before it dies.

The Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill has truncated generous tax credits designed to encourage homeowners to invest in more efficient heat pumps, water heaters and other energy-saving devices. Those credits include up to $2,000 on qualified heat pumps, which can both heat and cool a home, but they’re now set to expire Dec. 31, 2025.

Is a gas or electric furnace better for the environment?

Where gas-powered furnaces and other appliances lose big points in comparison to electric appliances is in their effect on the environment, both inside your house and around the planet.

Manufacturing oversupply scenarios present systemic risks that extend beyond simple capacity-demand imbalances. In renewable energy sectors experiencing rapid expansion, the convergence of policy-driven scaling, international trade tensions, and infrastructure constraints creates complex vulnerability patterns that challenge traditional market stabilisation mechanisms. These dynamics become particularly pronounced when domestic industrial development objectives intersect with global competitive pressures and technological dependencies, as demonstrated by India's solar buildout oversupply warning.

The emergence of manufacturing capacity bubbles in strategic industries reflects deeper structural challenges in coordinating industrial policy with market fundamentals. When government incentive programmes successfully mobilise private capital without corresponding demand coordination mechanisms, the resulting oversupply can threaten the long-term viability of the very industries these policies aim to develop.

How India's Solar Buildout Oversupply Warning Exposes Manufacturing Strategy Gaps

India's photovoltaic manufacturing sector demonstrates how rapid scaling can create structural imbalances that threaten industry sustainability. The Production-Linked Incentive framework has generated manufacturing capabilities exceeding 100 GW annually, while domestic consumption patterns suggest absorption capacity closer to 35-40 GW per year. This threefold capacity surplus represents one of the most significant oversupply situations in global renewable energy manufacturing.

Furthermore, the development has broader implications for the global energy transition minerals supply chain, as manufacturing oversupply in one region can disrupt pricing and investment patterns across international markets.

Manufacturing Capacity Expansion Dynamics

The PLI scheme's success in mobilising industrial investment has created a complex web of manufacturing facilities across multiple value chain segments. Module assembly capabilities have expanded most rapidly, with over 15 GW of operational capacity established within 24 months of policy implementation. Cell manufacturing has grown more gradually, reaching approximately 8 GW of capacity, while upstream wafer and ingot production remains limited at under 3 GW.

Key Manufacturing Metrics:

Total awarded PLI capacity: 45+ GW across all production stages

Operational module assembly: 15+ GW as of late 2024

Cell production capacity: 8 GW operational

Ingot-wafer capacity: Under 3 GW operational

Projected 2025 total capacity: 100+ GW annually

This capacity distribution reveals the challenges of building integrated domestic supply chains. Most manufacturers have focused on final assembly operations, which require lower capital investment and technical expertise compared to upstream silicon processing. However, this approach perpetuates dependence on imported cells and wafers, creating vulnerability to supply chain disruptions and trade policy changes.

Inventory Accumulation Patterns

Industry inventory levels have reached critical thresholds that indicate fundamental demand-supply misalignment. Excess inventory has grown from approximately 10 GW in early 2024 to over 20 GW by year-end, with projections suggesting continued accumulation through 2025. This inventory buildup represents significant working capital constraints for manufacturers and potential price deflation pressures.

The inventory crisis reflects multiple factors beyond simple overcapacity. Installation project delays due to grid infrastructure constraints, land acquisition challenges, and financing bottlenecks have reduced actual solar deployment below planned levels. Additionally, quality certification requirements and performance testing delays have slowed the conversion of manufacturing output into deployed capacity.

What Financial and Trade Pressures Are Reshaping Market Dynamics

Export Market Deterioration

International market access has become increasingly constrained for Indian solar manufacturers. The United States, previously a major destination for Indian solar exports, has implemented comprehensive trade measures targeting modules suspected of containing Chinese-origin components. These measures include both tariff barriers and supply chain verification requirements that have effectively reduced export competitiveness.

Trade Impact Analysis:

U.S. tariff rates: 50% on modules with Chinese components

Export volume decline: Over 50% in first half of 2025

Alternative market development: Limited progress in Southeast Asia and Africa

Supply chain verification costs: 2-3% of module value

The tariff impact analysis shows these trade restrictions extend beyond direct tariff costs. Supply chain documentation and verification requirements have created administrative burdens that small and medium manufacturers struggle to manage. Larger manufacturers with integrated operations face different challenges, as vertical integration requirements conflict with cost optimisation strategies that rely on global component sourcing.

Cost Competitiveness Challenges

Manufacturing cost structures remain a fundamental barrier to sustainable market development. Indian-assembled modules using imported cells carry cost premiums of approximately 3-5 cents per watt compared to direct Chinese imports. Fully integrated Indian manufacturing shows even larger cost disadvantages, with premiums potentially exceeding 10 cents per watt in some market segments.

Cost Structure Breakdown:

Raw material costs: 60-65% of total manufacturing cost

Labour and overhead: 15-20% of total cost

Capital equipment amortisation: 10-15% of total cost

Working capital financing: 5-8% of total cost

These cost disadvantages stem from multiple sources. Scale efficiencies remain limited compared to Chinese manufacturers operating gigawatt-scale facilities. Technology licensing costs add additional burdens, as most advanced cell technologies require royalty payments to international patent holders. Energy costs, while declining, remain higher than in major manufacturing centres like China and Vietnam.

Banking Sector Risk Assessment

Financial institutions have begun implementing enhanced due diligence for solar manufacturing loan applications. The Ministry of Finance has reportedly issued guidance recommending careful evaluation of standalone manufacturing projects that lack vertical integration or established off-take agreements. This represents the first formal acknowledgement of oversupply risks at the policy level.

Financial Risk Indicators:

Debt service coverage ratios below 1.2x

Export revenue concentration exceeding 60% in single markets

Working capital cycles extending beyond 120 days

Dependence on PLI incentives for positive margins

Why Vertical Integration Becomes Strategic Priority

Government Policy Recalibration

The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has shifted policy emphasis toward supporting integrated manufacturing facilities capable of producing components across multiple value chain stages. This policy evolution reflects recognition that standalone assembly operations provide limited strategic value and remain vulnerable to supply chain disruptions.

Priority support now focuses on facilities demonstrating capabilities in polysilicon production, wafer manufacturing, cell fabrication, and module assembly. This integrated approach aims to reduce import dependence while creating more resilient domestic production networks. However, the capital requirements for truly integrated facilities exceed $1 billion per gigawatt of capacity.

This shift aligns with India's lithium supply strategy, which emphasises building comprehensive supply chains for critical materials rather than relying on single-stage processing operations.

Supply Chain Security Versus Economic Efficiency

The strategic trade-offs between supply chain security and economic efficiency have become central to policy debates. Achieving meaningful import substitution requires accepting higher production costs and consumer prices in exchange for reduced dependence on Chinese supply chains. This trade-off becomes particularly challenging when global solar prices continue declining due to Chinese oversupply.

Strategic Integration Benefits:

Reduced import dependence from 85% to under 30%

Enhanced supply chain resilience during trade disruptions

Technology transfer and domestic innovation capabilities

Employment creation across skill levels

Economic Integration Costs:

Capital requirements 3-4x higher than assembly operations

Operating cost premiums of 15-25% over Chinese alternatives

Extended payback periods requiring patient capital

Technical risks in scaling advanced manufacturing processes

How Grid Infrastructure Constraints Compound Oversupply Issues

Generation Capacity Versus Grid Absorption

India's power grid faces mounting challenges absorbing rapidly expanding solar generation capacity. Several states have experienced grid curtailment events where solar power plants are required to reduce output due to transmission constraints or grid stability concerns. These curtailment incidents threaten project economics and potentially slow future solar deployment growth.

Grid Integration Challenges:

Transmission capacity constraints in high-solar regions

Grid balancing requirements during peak generation periods

Frequency stability challenges during cloud cover transitions

Regional demand-supply mismatches requiring enhanced transmission

The duck curve phenomenon, where solar generation peaks at midday but demand peaks occur during morning and evening periods, requires substantial grid infrastructure investments. Energy storage systems, advanced forecasting capabilities, and flexible generation resources become essential for maintaining grid stability as solar penetration increases.

Infrastructure Investment Requirements

Grid modernisation needs extend far beyond simple transmission capacity expansion. Advanced grid management systems capable of handling variable renewable generation require sophisticated control technologies and real-time monitoring capabilities. These systems must coordinate multiple generation sources while maintaining frequency and voltage stability across the network.

Infrastructure Investment Priorities:

Category Investment Need Timeline Transmission Lines $15-20 billion 2025-2030 Grid Storage $8-12 billion 2025-2028 Control Systems $3-5 billion 2025-2027 Distribution Upgrades $10-15 billion 2025-2032

Energy storage requirements alone represent massive capital demands. Battery storage systems capable of providing 4-6 hours of backup during peak demand periods require investments of $200-300 per kWh of capacity. At projected solar deployment scales, total storage needs could exceed 50 GWh by 2030.

What Strategic Scenarios Could Reshape Industry Structure

Market Consolidation Pathway

Oversupply pressures create conditions favouring industry consolidation, where financially stronger manufacturers acquire distressed assets at reduced valuations. This consolidation process could ultimately create more efficient and competitive domestic manufacturing capabilities, though the transition period involves significant financial losses for early investors.

Historical precedent from Chinese solar manufacturing suggests consolidation phases typically eliminate 60-70% of initial market participants over 3-5 year periods. Surviving manufacturers benefit from improved economies of scale and reduced competitive pressures, but the consolidation process requires substantial working capital to weather extended periods of negative cash flow.

Consolidation Indicators:

Module prices declining 20-30% annually

Manufacturer margin compression below 5%

Working capital cycles extending beyond 150 days

Debt restructuring requests from 30%+ of industry participants

Export Diversification Strategy

Alternative export markets in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America offer potential absorption capacity for Indian solar manufacturing output. However, market development in these regions requires different competitive strategies, including adapted product specifications, local partnership development, and patient market development investments.

Southeast Asian markets, particularly Vietnam, Thailand, and Philippines, show strong solar deployment growth but prefer established technology providers with proven track records. African markets offer longer-term potential but require development financing solutions and local capacity building investments. Latin American markets show price sensitivity that challenges Indian cost structures.

Export Market Potential Analysis:

Region Annual Market Size Growth Rate Competitive Position Southeast Asia 8-12 GW 15-20% Moderate barriers Africa 3-5 GW 25-30% Low competition Latin America 6-10 GW 12-18% High price sensitivity Middle East 4-8 GW 10-15% Quality requirements

Policy Intervention Scenarios

Government intervention through enhanced domestic demand creation, strategic export financing, or capacity rationalisation programmes could help stabilise market conditions. Demand support measures might include accelerated auction schedules, rooftop solar incentives, or industrial captive power requirements mandating domestic content.

Export financing mechanisms could include concessional credit facilities, export credit guarantees, or bilateral trade agreements that provide preferential access to emerging markets. Capacity rationalisation might involve production quotas, minimum efficiency standards, or consolidation incentives that encourage voluntary market exits.

How Market Participants Should Navigate Transition Risks

Investment Risk Assessment Framework

Investors require sophisticated risk assessment capabilities to distinguish viable manufacturers from those facing fundamental viability challenges. Financial metrics alone prove insufficient, as PLI incentives can mask underlying cost structure problems for extended periods.

High-Risk Characteristics:

Standalone module assembly without upstream integration

Export revenue concentration exceeding 70% in restricted markets

Operating margins dependent on PLI incentives for profitability

Debt service coverage ratios below 1.1x during peak production periods

Lower-Risk Investment Profiles:

Vertical integration spanning at least three value chain stages

Domestic market focus with established utility relationships

Cost structures within 10-15% of Chinese benchmarks

Technology partnerships providing ongoing innovation access

Strategic Response Options

Manufacturers face difficult strategic choices regarding capacity utilisation, market positioning, and technology development. Capacity reduction decisions require careful timing to avoid stranded asset losses while maintaining market position for eventual recovery. Market repositioning toward higher-value applications or specialised technologies offers differentiation opportunities but requires substantial R&D investments.

Manufacturer Strategy Matrix:

Market Position Recommended Actions Success Probability Integrated Players Maintain capacity, focus on cost reduction Moderate-High Assembly Focus Seek partnerships or consolidation Low-Moderate Technology Leaders Develop premium segments Moderate Export Dependent Diversify markets rapidly Low

Technology development becomes increasingly important as commodity manufacturing margins compress. Manufacturers investing in next-generation cell technologies, specialised applications like agrivoltaics, or energy storage integration may achieve differentiation that supports premium pricing. However, these strategies require sustained R&D spending during periods of cash flow pressure.

Policy Response Recommendations

Effective policy responses require coordination across multiple government agencies to address manufacturing oversupply while supporting broader renewable energy deployment objectives. Manufacturing policy should prioritise integrated facilities over standalone capacity additions, while demand policy should accelerate grid infrastructure development and energy storage deployment.

Policy Coordination Framework:

Manufacturing incentives linked to domestic content utilisation

Grid investment acceleration through infrastructure bonds

Export credit facilities for alternative market development

Technology development support for next-generation applications

Financial sector guidance should establish clear risk assessment standards that prevent speculative capacity additions while supporting viable manufacturing operations. This requires sophisticated evaluation criteria that consider long-term competitiveness rather than short-term PLI eligibility.

What Long-Term Implications Shape India's Energy Transition

Balancing Industrial Development With Market Sustainability

India's solar buildout oversupply warning represents a critical test of industrial policy effectiveness in emerging economies pursuing renewable energy manufacturing capabilities. The challenge lies in maintaining momentum toward energy security and manufacturing development objectives while preventing boom-bust cycles that threaten long-term industry viability.

Successful navigation of this transition requires accepting short-term capacity adjustments and financial losses in exchange for sustainable long-term industry development. This process involves difficult political choices, as capacity rationalisation affects employment and regional development objectives that motivated initial policy support.

In addition, developments like India's lithium refinery initiatives demonstrate the interconnected nature of clean energy supply chains, where oversupply in one segment can affect investment decisions across related industries.

Global Supply Chain Implications

Despite current challenges, India's solar manufacturing development positions the country as a potential alternative to China-dominated global supply chains. Success in managing the current oversupply crisis could establish India as a major participant in the global clean energy economy, supporting both domestic energy security and international climate objectives.

The strategic value of alternative supply chains extends beyond economic considerations to include energy security and geopolitical resilience. European and American markets increasingly seek supply chain diversification options that reduce dependence on single-country sources, creating opportunities for Indian manufacturers that achieve cost competitiveness.

Moreover, trade war market effects continue to reshape global manufacturing strategies, potentially creating long-term advantages for Indian manufacturers who successfully navigate the current transition period.

Technology Development Pathways

Long-term success requires progression from assembly operations toward higher-value manufacturing and technology development capabilities. This evolution demands sustained investments in R&D, workforce development, and technology partnerships that enable participation in next-generation solar technologies.

Technology Advancement Priorities:

Next-generation cell efficiency improvements (25%+ efficiency targets)

Specialised applications including floating solar and agrivoltaics

Energy storage integration and smart solar solutions

Manufacturing automation and quality control systems

The current crisis creates opportunities for strategic technology partnerships with international leaders seeking manufacturing diversification. According to industry analysis, these partnerships could accelerate Indian capabilities while providing technology transfer that supports long-term competitiveness.

Furthermore, India's solar buildout oversupply warning serves as a crucial inflection point for the global renewable energy industry, demonstrating how rapid policy-driven scaling must be balanced with market fundamentals to ensure sustainable growth in critical clean energy technologies.

Additionally, analysis from France's industrial lithium development prospects provides valuable context for understanding the broader implications of the Imerys European content rule for EV lithium project initiative.","The Strategic Imperative Behind EU Battery Material Sovereignty

Battery manufacturing across Europe currently relies almost entirely on lithium sourced from nations thousands of miles away. This dependency creates vulnerability in supply chains that power everything from electric vehicles to renewable energy storage systems. As global competition intensifies for critical minerals, European policymakers are crafting frameworks that could fundamentally alter how lithium flows through international markets. The Imerys European content rule for EV lithium project represents a pivotal development in this evolving landscape.

The continent's approach to mineral security extends beyond simple trade policies. It represents a comprehensive strategy to establish domestic production capabilities that can withstand geopolitical disruptions while maintaining competitive pricing structures. Understanding how these evolving policies will reshape investment patterns and extraction technologies provides crucial insight into the future of European industrial competitiveness.

European content requirements for lithium represent a graduated approach to reducing import dependency. The proposed framework calls for 20% of lithium used in electric vehicle batteries to originate from EU sources by 2031, with this requirement escalating to 40% by 2036. This timeline provides manufacturers with sufficient lead time to establish supply relationships while giving domestic projects clear market incentives.

The economic rationale behind these thresholds reflects careful analysis of production capacity constraints and capital deployment timelines. Industrial leaders suggest that mandatory content requirements would create ""marginal impact"" on vehicle pricing, though specific cost analyses remain proprietary. This positions regulatory certainty as a prerequisite for attracting the multi-billion euro investments required to establish European lithium production.

Current global lithium trade patterns show Europe sourcing virtually all battery-grade materials from Australia, Chile, and Chinese processing facilities. The Critical Raw Materials Act designates lithium as both a ""critical raw material"" and ""strategic raw material,"" establishing the legal foundation for content mandates similar to those used in automotive manufacturing under trade agreements like USMCA.

Economic Impact Assessment on European Vehicle Manufacturing

The financial implications of domestic content requirements extend beyond simple material costs. European automakers must balance supply chain security against production economics, particularly as lithium prices experience significant volatility. Manufacturing executives emphasize that regulatory frameworks providing long-term certainty enable more accurate capital allocation decisions than volatile spot market pricing.

Industry analysis suggests that lithium hydroxide, the preferred battery-grade material, commands premium pricing over lithium carbonate due to superior chemical purity requirements. European projects targeting hydroxide production position themselves to capture these price premiums while meeting stringent battery chemistry specifications demanded by automotive manufacturers.

The competitive positioning against Asian battery suppliers involves complex calculations beyond raw material costs. European operations must account for higher labour costs, environmental compliance requirements, and novel extraction technologies. However, proximity to vehicle manufacturing facilities reduces transportation costs and supply chain complexity, creating offsetting economic advantages.

What Makes European Lithium Projects Economically Viable Under New Regulations?

Investment Framework Analysis for Multi-Billion Euro Projects

European lithium development requires unprecedented capital commitments for the continent's mineral sector. Imerys' French project represents a €1.8 billion investment targeting integrated mining and refining operations, while Vulcan Energy Resources secured A$3.9 billion financing for its German geothermal extraction facility. These investment scales demonstrate institutional confidence in European lithium demand despite current market oversupply conditions.

The capital intensity of European projects exceeds established operations in Australia and Chile due to several factors. Furthermore, novel extraction methodologies require advanced engineering solutions, while stringent environmental compliance frameworks mandate additional infrastructure. Additionally, higher regional labour and construction costs compare unfavourably to established mining jurisdictions, necessitating integration with renewable energy systems for sustainable production profiles.

Risk assessment models for these investments incorporate regulatory certainty as a fundamental variable. Alessandro Dazza of Imerys emphasised that ""investors need a clear framework"" to commit capital at this scale, suggesting that the Imerys European content rule for EV lithium project may paradoxically reduce financial risk by guaranteeing future demand.

Production Economics and Market Positioning

Target production specifications reveal the scale of European ambitions. The Imerys French operation aims to produce 34,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide annually, sufficient to support battery manufacturing for approximately 700,000 electric vehicles per year. This capacity represents a significant portion of European EV production targets while maintaining flexibility for export markets.

Lithium hydroxide production offers strategic advantages over lithium carbonate for battery applications. The hydroxide form provides superior thermal stability and chemical purity required for high-performance lithium-ion cells. This technical differentiation typically commands 15-25% price premiums over carbonate equivalents, improving project economics despite higher production costs.

Financial structuring approaches vary significantly across European projects. Imerys pursues minority stake sales to share development risks, while Vulcan Energy leverages public market financing through ASX listing. These diverse capital structures reflect different risk tolerance levels and strategic partnerships with automotive manufacturers or battery producers.

How Do Permitting Delays Impact European Critical Mineral Independence?

Regulatory Timeline Challenges

Administrative bottlenecks present material risks to European lithium independence timelines. However, mining permitting challenges continue to create significant obstacles for domestic producers. Imerys delayed commercial production from 2028 to 2030 due to ""longer-than-expected permitting processes,"" creating a two-year gap in planned domestic supply availability.

The regulatory complexity involves multiple approval layers including environmental impact assessments requiring comprehensive ecological studies. Furthermore, social licensing processes incorporate community consultation frameworks, while multi-jurisdictional approvals span mining, energy, and environmental agencies. Additionally, heritage site evaluations become particularly relevant in densely populated European regions.

Permitting delays compound other project risks, including commodity price volatility and demand uncertainty. Sibanye Stillwater continues assessing commissioning timing for its Finnish project due to weak lithium pricing, demonstrating how regulatory and market factors create compound development obstacles.

Strategic Implications of Production Delays

The 2027-2030 supply gap represents a strategic vulnerability period for European automakers. During this window, manufacturers must rely on existing import channels while domestic capacity remains under development. This dependency persists precisely when global lithium demand is projected to accelerate due to expanding EV adoption across multiple continents.

Alternative sourcing strategies during project development phases include long-term supply contracts with established Australian and Chilean producers. In addition, strategic inventory management helps buffer against supply disruptions, while technology partnerships with Asian battery manufacturers maintain diverse supply bases. Furthermore, recycling capacity expansion reduces primary lithium requirements.

Current regulatory uncertainty affects both demand-side and supply-side planning. Germany's efforts to modify EU combustion engine phase-out policies beyond 2035 create additional complexity for long-term demand forecasting, influencing both project development timelines and financing decisions.

What Role Do Geothermal and Sustainable Extraction Methods Play?

Technology Integration in European Lithium Operations

Geothermal-powered lithium extraction represents a uniquely European approach to mineral development. Vulcan Energy's Upper Rhine Valley project integrates geothermal energy production with lithium extraction, creating dual revenue streams while minimising carbon emissions. This technological integration addresses European sustainability requirements while potentially reducing operational costs through renewable energy self-sufficiency.

The geothermal extraction process offers several advantages over conventional mining. For instance, it eliminates mining waste through direct brine processing while reducing physical footprint compared to open-pit operations. Moreover, integration with existing energy infrastructure in geothermal regions provides lower environmental impact through minimal surface disruption.

Technical specifications for geothermal lithium extraction involve accessing high-temperature reservoir brines (200-250°C) containing dissolved lithium concentrations. The Rhine Graben geological structure provides optimal conditions for this extraction methodology, with established geothermal infrastructure reducing capital requirements.

Sustainability as a Competitive Advantage

European lithium projects increasingly position environmental compliance as strategic differentiation rather than regulatory burden. Vulcan Energy's A$3.9 billion financing success signals institutional investor validation of geothermal-powered extraction models, suggesting that sustainability profiles directly influence capital availability and pricing.

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment criteria have become fundamental considerations for mineral project financing. European projects benefit from renewable energy integration reducing carbon footprint calculations. Additionally, advanced environmental monitoring exceeds global industry standards, while community engagement frameworks address social licensing requirements. Furthermore, transparent governance structures meet institutional investor standards.

The Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) standard compliance requirements for European projects establish operational benchmarks that differentiate regional production from global competitors. These standards create barriers to entry while potentially commanding premium pricing for sustainably produced materials.

How Will Market Dynamics Affect European Lithium Project Viability?

Current Market Imbalance Analysis

Global lithium markets currently exhibit significant oversupply conditions, creating challenging conditions for new project development. However, long-term demand projections indicate that ""all known projects today will not be able to cover future EV demand,"" according to industry executives. This apparent contradiction reflects timing mismatches between current production capacity and projected consumption growth.

Price volatility impacts project development decisions across all stages. Exploration budgets contract during low-price environments, while construction financing becomes more expensive due to commodity price uncertainty. Consequently, commercial production timing shifts based on economic viability thresholds, and strategic investor participation varies with market sentiment cycles.

The current supply-demand imbalance primarily reflects slower-than-expected EV adoption in certain markets, production acceleration in Australia and Chile, and inventory building during previous high-price periods. However, underlying demand fundamentals remain supportive due to expanding battery manufacturing capacity and renewable energy storage requirements.

Competition from Established Producing Regions

European lithium projects must compete against established operations with significant cost advantages. Australian spodumene mining benefits from large-scale open-pit operations and established processing infrastructure. Similarly, Chilean brine operations leverage natural evaporation processes reducing energy requirements, while Chinese processing facilities offer integrated supply chain advantages.

Cost competitiveness challenges for European operations include several factors. Labour costs remain 2-3x higher than developing markets, requiring automation and productivity enhancement as mitigation. Furthermore, energy costs involve variable renewable pricing, necessitating renewable energy integration strategies. Additionally, stringent environmental compliance requirements demand technology differentiation and premium positioning.

Strategic value considerations extend beyond pure cost optimisation. Supply chain security, reduced transportation costs, and regulatory alignment create competitive advantages that offset higher production costs for European automotive manufacturers seeking supply chain resilience. These advantages become increasingly valuable as energy transition minerals gain strategic importance.

What Are the Broader Implications for EU Industrial Policy?

Critical Raw Materials Act Implementation

The proposed lithium content requirements integrate with the EU's broader Critical Raw Materials Act framework, creating comprehensive mineral security policies. This legislation establishes strategic objectives for domestic production capacity, recycling infrastructure development, and international partnership frameworks across multiple critical materials beyond lithium.

Cross-sector applications extend beyond automotive manufacturing to include defence industry applications requiring secure supply chains for specialised battery systems. Moreover, renewable energy storage supports grid stabilisation and energy transition goals, while industrial equipment uses lithium-ion systems for manufacturing automation. Additionally, consumer electronics manufactured within European technology hubs benefit from secure supply chains.

Implementation timelines coordinate multiple policy instruments, including green technology investment incentives, research and development funding, and trade policy adjustments affecting critical mineral imports. This comprehensive approach demonstrates European commitment to strategic autonomy in critical technology supply chains, building upon lithium industry innovations from other regions.

Geopolitical Considerations in Resource Security

European lithium independence initiatives respond to evolving geopolitical dynamics, particularly regarding China's dominant position in lithium processing and battery manufacturing. While China controls approximately 60% of global lithium refining capacity, European policies aim to establish alternative supply chains reducing strategic dependency.

Alliance building strategies include partnership frameworks with democratic lithium-producing nations like Australia and Canada. Furthermore, technology sharing agreements facilitate sustainable extraction methodologies, while joint venture structures combine European capital with international resource bases. Additionally, multilateral institutions coordinate critical mineral security across allied nations.

Trade policy implications involve balancing content requirements with World Trade Organisation compliance and existing free trade agreements. European policymakers must ensure that domestic content mandates do not trigger trade disputes while achieving strategic autonomy objectives, particularly as lithium brine market insights inform global supply chain strategies.

Investment and Partnership Strategies for European Lithium Development

Minority Stake Sales and Capital Structure

European lithium projects increasingly rely on sophisticated capital structures distributing development risks across multiple investor categories. Imerys pursues ""advanced"" discussions for minority stake sales, demonstrating strategic approaches to project financing that balance control retention with capital requirements and risk sharing.

Strategic investor identification involves several categories including automotive manufacturers seeking supply chain integration and security. Additionally, battery producers require feedstock quality assurance and delivery reliability, while sovereign wealth funds focus on strategic resource investments. Furthermore, infrastructure funds are attracted to long-term, utility-like cash flow profiles.

Risk-sharing mechanisms in capital-intensive mineral development include staged investment commitments, milestone-based funding releases, and commodity price hedging arrangements. These structures protect investors from development delays while providing projects with committed capital throughout construction phases.

Multi-Project Portfolio Approach

Geographic diversification across European jurisdictions spreads regulatory and geological risks while maximising policy support. Imerys operates projects in both France and Cornwall, while other companies develop operations across Germany, Finland, and additional European regions.

Technology diversification strategies encompass conventional hard-rock mining in established geological formations. Moreover, geothermal brine extraction operates in suitable geographical regions, while recycling facility development enables secondary lithium recovery. Additionally, research and development partnerships advance next-generation extraction technologies.

Timeline staggering enables companies to apply lessons learned from initial projects to subsequent developments while maintaining continuous project pipeline advancement. This approach reduces concentrated development risks while building operational expertise across diverse technical challenges, benefiting from recent battery recycling breakthrough innovations.

Reshaping Global Lithium Markets Through Regional Content Requirements

Long-term Market Structure Evolution

European content requirements will likely accelerate similar policies in other regions, creating fragmented global lithium trade patterns prioritising supply chain security over pure economic optimisation. This shift represents a fundamental change from globalised commodity markets toward regionalised supply chain structures.

Anticipated changes include regional processing hubs developing closer to consumption centres. Furthermore, premium pricing emerges for domestically produced materials meeting content requirements, while technology transfer acceleration occurs as companies establish local operations. Additionally, investment patterns shift toward strategic rather than purely economic considerations.

Regional supply chain development acceleration extends beyond lithium to encompass entire battery material supply chains, including nickel processing, cobalt refining, and battery cell manufacturing. This integrated approach creates comprehensive domestic capabilities rather than isolated material production.

Success Metrics for European Lithium Independence

Measuring European lithium policy effectiveness requires tracking multiple performance indicators beyond simple production volumes. Market share evolution in European EV battery supply chains provides the most direct measure of content requirement success, while cost competitiveness achievement determines long-term sustainability without ongoing subsidisation.

Key performance benchmarks include EU production capacity targeting 50,000+ tonnes LCE by 2030 and 120,000+ tonnes LCE by 2035. Consequently, content requirement achievement aims for 20% compliance by 2030 and 35% by 2035. Moreover, cost competitiveness goals involve achieving less than 120% of import costs by 2030 and less than 110% by 2035.

Timeline achievement versus actual capacity development will ultimately determine whether European lithium independence represents successful industrial policy or requires adjustment to balance strategic objectives with economic realities. The 2027-2030 period represents the critical testing phase for these ambitious policy frameworks.

Innovation incentives created by content requirements extend beyond immediate lithium production to encompass advanced extraction technologies, recycling capabilities, and battery chemistry improvements that reduce primary material requirements. These secondary effects may prove more valuable than direct production capacity in achieving long-term strategic autonomy objectives. The success of the Imerys European content rule for EV lithium project will serve as a crucial benchmark for measuring the effectiveness of these comprehensive policy initiatives.

For further insights into European lithium market developments, Imerys' strategic project recognition by the European Union highlights the significance of domestic content requirements. Additionally, analysis from France's industrial lithium development prospects provides valuable context for understanding the broader implications of the Imerys European content rule for EV lithium project initiative.

Maybe increasing to 50% of new car sales by 2035, he said, but 100% is a dream deferred.
Up to 90% of China’s small car sales already are electric, and green tech there is booming.
But Republican consultant Mike Murphy last year polled Americans on electric cars and found that most of the divide isn’t pragmatic.
The car sales story this fall in King County and around some parts of the state is tantalizing.","When President Trump proposed rolling back fuel-efficiency standards on cars this past week, he did it with his usual panache, calling electric cars “a green new scam.”

The idea of mandating a gradual shift to EVs is “insane,” he said.

But was it really going to be so far-fetched to get rid of gas cars?

It sure looks like the green dream may have been closer than previously thought, according to the latest data from Washington state about new cars hitting the road.

I say “could have been” because the federal government now seems hellbent to keep Americans guzzling oil until long after the last glacier is melted.

But first, a remarkable data point.

In October, 37% of the new cars sold in King County were battery-powered electrics (this includes plug-in hybrids) — in other words, cars that can be plugged in. This smashed the record for one-month adoption of green cars.

An additional 20% sold were hybrids. That means the old-style type of cars — those with solely internal combustion engines — made up only 43% of the new cars registered for the month in King County.

Statewide, 26% of new cars sold and then registered in October were EVs, and 20% gas-electric hybrids. So across the entire state, gas-only cars declined to just 54% of new car sales in October, according to state Department of Licensing registration data.

“It’s a temporary peak, unfortunately, but it also shows how far we’ve come,” says Matthew Metz.

Metz is a retired Seattle torts lawyer who took up the cause of banning new gas cars 10 years ago. He was called “moonbatty,” a “commie,” and so on. He reported to me back in 2017 that when the idea of phasing out gas cars first made the news, “99.9% of the reaction was negative.”

“People will get over it,” he predicted then.

The political system and the oil industry of course didn’t get over it. But Metz was right that large swaths of the population did.

Consider that in 2017, electric cars made up just 2% of new car sales in this state, with hybrids only 5%. Internal combustion engines had a monopoly-level hold on the market, at 93% of all new cars hitting the roads.

Advertising

Fast-forward eight years. The state’s largest county just crossed a tipping point where fewer than half the cars sold here in August, September and October combined were gas-combustion only. Who would have bet on that in 2017?

“When we started on this, EVs had a stigma,” Metz said. “There were very few electric cars available. There were no chargers. The charge times were three times longer. There’s still a ton of work to do, but the stigma is in the past.”

The surge in sales this fall was in part because buyers were scrambling to take advantage of expiring federal tax credits. Republicans have killed those off, as Trump gleefully noted this past week when he lowered the auto industry’s fuel mileage standards.

“Today, we’re taking one more step to kill the green new scam, as part of the greatest scam, probably,” Trump said.

Metz founded a group, called Coltura, to try to wean both Washington and the nation completely off of gas. So he’s a crazy optimist. But he sounded a bit resigned about the future.

Since Trump returned to office, he and congressional Republicans have sought to cancel the ability of California and other states to set their own car standards. It means the push in Washington state to try to shift new car sales all the way up to 100% EV by 2035 has effectively been scotched (though the Trump action is being challenged in court.)

Metz shared industry data showing that sales of some makes of electric cars have plunged in November, since the tax credits expired.

He now predicts that with the government hostility, momentum for EVs will slow. Maybe increasing to 50% of new car sales by 2035, he said, but 100% is a dream deferred.

“Unless they want to turn us into Cuba, with only the old model gas cars and trucks driving around, then it’s inevitable that the market is going to keep moving ahead in some way with EVs,” he said. “But it is back to the drawing board.”

I kid you not, the day after Metz made this crack about turning us into Cuba, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy had this to say about the fuel standards rollback:

“This rule will actually allow you to bring back the 1970s station wagon,” Duffy said. “Maybe a little wood paneling on the side. We can bring back choice to consumers.”

Make America like the ’70s again! Up to 90% of China’s small car sales already are electric, and green tech there is booming. Meanwhile our leaders are nostalgically fantasizing about road trips at 10 mpg.

There are some obvious drawbacks to EVs. They’re expensive to buy and still too inconvenient to fill with juice (especially for those in apartments or without driveways). But Republican consultant Mike Murphy last year polled Americans on electric cars and found that most of the divide isn’t pragmatic.

“It’s tribal,” Murphy wrote. “In our modern politics any friend of my enemy must be my enemy too. If Joe Biden is for EVs, we must be against them.”

I asked Metz for his take.

“I think Republicans are just pro-oil,” he said. “They want to keep the oil economy going for as long as they can, and that’s pretty much it.”

It’s like that 2006 documentary “Who Killed the Electric Car?” in which the oil powers sabotage a prototype EV to save their golden goose. On rerun in 2025.

So what will become of the green dream to end gas? The car sales story this fall in King County and around some parts of the state is tantalizing. A third of cars that just sold in King County have no engine in them at all — an inconceivable statistic only a few years ago.

Will this be looked back on as the first proof of a new age dawning? Or as a fad?

I guess if we see the station wagon making a comeback, we’ll have our answer.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12052025_TZR_Electric_Vehicle_Charging-2024_tzr_123.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-12-06 11:02:09.430683

Welcome back to another episode of TEN — Transport Evolved News! Thanks for joining me.

Before I delve into today’s show I want to acknowledge that the news cycle is a shit show right now in the EV world. And that means a lot of today’s show will delve into politics and yeah, it’s going to be tough going. I don’t want to sugar coat this – politics matters – and those who say it doesn’t come from a place of privilege they’re not willing to acknowledge. So please, don’t blame us for covering political stories that are relevant to the EV world.

And we start with one such story – namely that the U.S. Government has officially published plans to slash fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks.

Standing with the CEOs of Ford and Stellantis, President Trump ripped into previous standard set by President Biden, calling them illegal and blaming them for the high cost of cars (even though I and many watching will blame unwanted in-car tech). Slashing nearly a third off the twenty-thirty-one target of fifty- point four miles per gallon, the new target is thirty-four point five miles per gallon – less than automakers managed fleet wide last year. We’re already seeing automakers push away from EVs toward more heavily polluting engines – like V-8s – even when their portfolios include more efficient, cheaper engines and drivetrains. And that only signals bad things ahead for everyone. But maybe there’s hope for one thing: kei cars. President Trump says he wants them to be allowed in the U.S., after seeing them on his trip to Japan. And given we’re now ruled by Presidential whim in the U.S…. Well… yah.

That Presidential whim – and continued attacks on EVs have seen what all of us predicted come to pass: a meteoric drop in EV sales during November.

Ford, which has indefinitely paused all F150 Lightning production – reported a sixty point eight percent drop in EV sales during November, replaced by a surge in gas-guzzling SUV sales. Meanwhile, Honda’s Prologue EV sales dropped eighty-six percent, despite large cash-on-hood incentives for buyers. At the time of filming, GM hasn’t published its November figures, but they’re not expected to be good. Hyundai and Kia also had a terrible November, with sales drops of more than one half for both brands. Meanwhile, pretty much every automaker recorded increases in hybrid sales.

We’re off to the UK now, where in addition to trying to legally erase and ban people like me from actually existing outside of their homes, the UK government is doing its best to mimic the USA.

Its just-released budget confirmed that while the government will be extending EV incentives until twenty-thirty, it also wants to tax EV and plug-in hybrid owners three pence per mile. Granted, the budget does include commitments to address the cost of EV charging, and to work on making it easier to install charging for people without off-street parking – but the data from November sales is already very dour. While EV sales in November were up one point five percent on the same period last year, with EVs now accounting for twenty-six point four percent of the new car market, the growth rate of EV adoption is the lowest it’s been in three years.

Luckily though, not every country in the world is making EVs the problem, and in Norway, we’ve got further demonstration of how amazing EV incentives can be to adoption rates.

This week, figures from November show that EVs accounted for more than ninety-seven point six percent of all new vehicles registered in the country. – but thanks to a rise in competitive pricing deals, Norway set new records for car registrations for the year, with just shy of twenty-thousand vehicles hitting the roads. That’s nearly double the number of cars sold in October. And while the Norwegian government had toyed with the idea of rolling back its VAT exemption on EV from twenty twenty-seven, a compromise reached this week will keep VAT exemption for EVs until twenty twenty-eight, with a new user limit of one hundred and fifty-thousand kroner in twenty twenty-seven, half of what it will be next year.

As some governments around the world sour on an all-electric future, we’re starting to see automakers take advantage of the situation and push back plans to go all -electric.

This week, reporting from Bloomberg suggests BMW, which has maintained it wants an electrified future – is now considering reintroducing its range-extended EV architecture for future models. The report claims that BMW is examining the reintroduction of REx – Range-Extending Engines – for its X5 and 7-Series models in China. It’s worth noting that the reporting is referring to engines connected to a generator that will provide electricity to an EV drivetrain when the car’sbatteries are empty, rather than traditional plug-in hybrid setups where the engine can drive the wheels in some situations. BMW has not refuted nor confirmed the reporting, stating that it is continually refining its plans based on customer and market trends.

Aptera has officially published its newest video update this week showing off its Validation Vehicle Assembly line for the first time.

The company – which is working to bring its three-wheeled solar electric car to market – is still very much using a pretty manual production process at this time, but what makes this line different from what went before is the extensive use of specialized assembly jigs to speed up component installation onto the pre-assembled bodies – complete with battery packs that Aptera’s battery partner CTNS is now building on site. This is the first time CTNS has build battery modules at Aptera’s facility, lowering build costs and lead times. With validation assembly under way – the company says it’s continuing its final testing a pace, and says that its combined cycle testing – high speed, stop and go, and urban – are quote ‘encouraging’. It’s hoping to engage in final regulatory testing soon. Watch this space.

Hyundai’s EV sales may have taken a hit last month in the U.S., but that hasn’t stopped its luxury arm, Genesis, from showing off its newest, highest-performance EV yet: the GV60 Magma.

Revealed in France this week, the model is a new upper-end variant of the GV60, with redesigned front body components and an all-wheel-drive system that rockets from zero to two hundred kilometers per hour (that’s zero to one hundred twenty-five miles per hour) in ten point nine seconds. A head-up display is standard, and the seats are wrapped in a suede-like material called Chamude. Official range figures for most markets aren’t out yet, but this is clearly a car built to go fast and think about range second. For the curious, it somehow keeps the mighty orb… because it wouldn’t be a GV60 without it.

Genesis also revealed its newest concept, the Magma GT, hinting at the brand’s future direction.

While some markets have yet to experience BYD’s EVs thanks to protectionist policies wrapped up as cybersecurity concerns, BYD has just celebrated a new milestone for its BYD Dolphin: 1 Million Global Sales.

On sale in its home market since twenty twenty-one and welcomed to Europe in twenty twenty-three, the Dolphin EV — not to be confused with its smaller sibling, the Seagull (or Dolphin Surf in Europe) — celebrated its half-millionth model late twenty twenty-three after twenty-five months in production – and the one millionth model hasn’t taken a long time to arrive after. With a choice of forty-five point one two kilowatt-hour or sixty point four-eight kilowatt-hour battery packs, the Dolphin holds its own in the already-crowded C-Segment in Europe, fighting off far more stablished brands, like Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in the EV space.

Over the past few years, we’ve seen plenty of developments made in the sector of wireless inductive charging for EVs – both in the passenger car and light-duty segment.

This week however, researchers at Purdue University carried out the first successful real-world test of a dynamic high-power inductive charging system fitted to a class-eight electric big rig on a quarter-mile stretch of US Highway 52 and US Highway 231 in West Lafayette Indiana. Using a specially-modified electric tractor built by Cummins, the system successfully transmitted one hundred and ninety kilowatts from the road to the truck while it was traveling along at sixty-five miles per hour (or about one hundred and four kilometers per hour). While the press release doesn’t go into details, my back-of-the-napkin calculations suggest that’s more than enough to cover all — or at least a significant portion — of the energy requirements for a fully loaded Class 8 big rig, if this system were extended over a meaningful distance.

And finally for this segment, some good news. While the U.S. White House continues its war on renewables, data from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shows that renewables are still ascendent in the Energy Generation Landscape.

Its latest report, published this week, shows that of the new generation capacity added to the U.S. electrical grid from January through until the End of September, and astonishing eighty-eight percent came from renewables. In fact, for twenty-five months straight, Solar has dominated new solar generating capacity – and I should note here that FERC only tracks grid-scale solar, not domestic solar. Today, nearly one third of all U.S. electricity generation comes from grid-scale renewable projects, with domestic solar pushing it well over that figure. If things continue, solar will become the second-largest source of U.S. Grid Generation, second only to natural gas.

Our final two stories are next, but first, a word from you.

For over fifteen years—ten in the U.S.—I and the TE team have been bringing you news on cleaner, greener, safer, smarter, and more equitable transportation and energy. We’re not backed by corporations, and we don’t have huge production budgets. Our tiny team—three full-time and one part-time member—works hard every week to bring you well-researched, honest content.

When we started, YouTube ad revenue paid the bills. These days, like most independent creators, ad revenue has dropped sharply. Worse, YouTube often sidelines diverse voices, overlooks minority creators, and prioritizes clickbait and AI fluff over real content. We wouldn’t exist without your support at Patreon.com/TransportEvolved.

I hate doing this, but here it is: just this week, a $4,200 annual E&O insurance bill arrived. Even though it’s yearly, it hits like a monthly expense—on top of team salaries, health insurance, retirement plans, and keeping the lights on. Health insurance alone has gone up forty percent this year. We keep a tight rein on our finances and have buffers, but right now, we’re treading water rather than growing—and costs are going up. I even fund part of the channel from my partner’s income, and that’s not sustainable. In an ideal world, we wouldn’t have to ask for your support… but here we are. It’s better than putting everything behind a paywall, which I am most certainly and vehemently against.

To keep producing videos—and to keep this channel alive—we need a budget boost. Even a thousand dollars a month—less than ten percent of what it costs to run this channel, which itself is about ten percent of the budget of much larger channels—would make a huge difference and let us sleep easier at night.

Even a single dollar helps. We’ve added new Patreon tiers for every budget, so if you already support us, thank you—it keeps this show alive.

And now… it’s time for those last two stories. Both of them from the UK.

Apparently, Brits like tea. A lot. And, as someone who is part British, I can attest that yes, I do indeed like a cup of tea to keep me going in the afternoon. Although in the morning, I’m all about Coffee.

But this week, Stellantis brand Vauxhall – which is basically the UK twin to Opel – took its UK roots and ran with it, announcing its new elect-ric-it-tea van. It’s a very obvious pun on electricity and consists of a Vauxhall Vivaro electric van that features a fully-kitted out kitchen behind its central sliding door. The company cites lots of research stating that most tradespeople say they’d prefer to stop and have a cup of tea in the afternoon that they themselves had made, and decided to make this advertising campaign around it. Now, it’s a neat, fun little concept, complete with sink, coffee, tea, fresh milk, and even some chocolate digestives (or maybe hobnobs). But there’s one flaw: I don’t know a single tradesperson with a van – electric or otherwise – that has room inside for all their gear and a fully-fitted kitchen. A smarter option? An electric kettle plugged into an on-board V2L system.

And finally,

If you’re an EV driver and you have any experience of public charging, you might know that when you plug in to a fast charger, the cable is locked in position by your car for your – and its safety.

When the charging session ends, the cable is supposed to release, but sometimes – if the charging session fails or there’s an error in the car the lock doesn’t release, causing panic and frustration. Most EVs today come with a hidden release cable that allow you to safely disconnect, but most owners don’t know about it. And, apparently, that’s led many people in the UK to call 999 – the UK equivalent of 911 – for assistance. This week, the London metropolitan police got so fed up with the number of calls from hapless EV owners asking for assistance that it had to issue a public statement reminding people that having your car stuck on a charging station is – and never should be – an emergency services call. Sure, if there’s a fire that’s different, but my advice is to learn where your EVs’ emergency release cable is. Most (but not all) have them.

And on that note, we’re done for today’s show.

But first, a huge thank you to the Electric Vehicle Association for sponsoring today’s show.

And in closing, some important words:

You are valid. You are loved. You belong. You have a purpose.

This week has seen more marginalization, more hate, and more othering of people in our lives and our communities. More bans, more threatened deportations and worse. And while the person in charge doesn’t already represent a nation or even the majority of people in it, it can be hard to want to carry on carrying on. But in order to change history – we need resistance – and intentionality.

Engage in Tactical Frivolity. Don’t surrender to fear, hate, or misinformation. That’s as true in Portland, Oregon, as it is anywhere power and greed seek to crush the will of ordinary people. Don’t buy into division and cruelty. Empathy is a skill we must practice daily to preserve our shared humanity. Just like humor, it’s an act of radical resistance.

But everyone needs time out. Unplug, get outside, dive into a good book, go gardening, or do a run, and recharge. Care for yourself and your loved ones now, so you can return ready to fight for decency, community, justice, and a better world. Let your light shine — in or outside an inflatable frog costume.

Wherever you are, whoever you are, whoever you love — you are not alone. Be an ally. Be kind. Be the change you want to see. Don’t let hate or ignorance win. As always, keep evolving!",https://www.transportevolved.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ten_560_thumb.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 11:02:14.509849

Even so, the efforts of Brazilian climate leadership deserve attention and recognition.
By shifting the debate to a dedicated forum with technical and political focus, the coalition creates space to build operational consensus, finance transition guarantees and design social and labor protections.
This parallel path is a necessary complement to global negotiations on the planet’s foremost climate agenda: ending the use of fossil fuels.
Civil society demanded ambition, integrity of information and climate justice — reinforcing that serious policy must articulate science, human rights and broad social participation.","The holding of the 30th UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém made history for two complementary reasons: it was the first climate conference hosted in the Amazon, and it put forests, Indigenous peoples and civil society back at the center of climate negotiations. Bringing together 195 countries and culminating in the unanimous adoption of 29 decisions, the conference showed that, despite geopolitical contradictions and obstacles, there is still room for collective progress.

The key points of Belém were the “joint decision,” the shifting positions of the European Union, the objections of large oil-producing countries and the enormous efforts of Brazilian diplomatic coordination to deliver on implementation of the Paris Agreement. In parallel with the diplomatic conference, Belém welcomed a vigorous presence of civil society, a powerful expression of its commitment to social justice in the fight against climate change.

The decision to join forces: strategy, scope and limits

In the context of the climate negotiations, the Brazilian presidency of the COP created the Mutirão — a “joint decision” strategy to untangle sensitive issues and stitch together a single package of decisions that included finance, adaptation, just transition, trade, gender and technology. At the end of the conference, this package resulted in the approval of 29 documents that sought to advance on multiple fronts without leaving behind urgent demands from the Global South.

Among the financial measures approved, concrete allocations of $135 million to the Adaptation Fund and $300 million to adapt the health sector to climate impacts stand out. The presidency also proposed reformulating climate finance reporting, linking it to the New Collective Quantified Goal for Climate Finance (NCQG), seeking greater transparency between “provided” and “mobilized” resources.

On the other hand, financial ambition fell short of what was necessary: the task-force proposal foresees tripling adaptation financing by 2035 compared with 2025, but without a clearly defined base value. This gap reflects the historical difficulty of the multilateral system in translating political commitment into measurable financial flows — a challenge that, according to climate finance experts, is reflected in the current adaptation finance gap, estimated at around $340 billion. This amount is forecast to reach $1.35 trillion by 2035.

No binding target was delivered to finance adaptation, and the multilateral ambition to mobilize trillions for clean infrastructure remains without clear accountability mechanisms. The recognition that historical goals have not been met gained space in the final text, but without new and effective structures that guarantee the flow of resources where they are most urgent.

Among other points in the task-force decision, advances were made on information integrity and the fight against climate disinformation — essential to confronting denialism, including disinformation promoted by parts of the fossil-fuel industry. There were also developments on carbon markets and discussions on high-integrity rules — a necessary subject for robust accounting of carbon credits, which remains controversial given cases of fraud and technical errors worldwide.

The EU’s position: defensive pragmatism

The European Union played a decisive role in the final design of the “joint decision”. European officials adopted a pragmatic stance: supporting the negotiated package as long as it did not include provisions they considered unfeasible or unsupported, especially those related to the energy transition. In negotiations, European representatives conditioned their greater willingness to finance adaptation on the inclusion — from their point of view — of balanced measures in the energy transition.

This stance produced two key effects: (1) the EU helped ensure approval of the package, avoiding a total impasse; (2) at the same time, its bargaining limited the financial ambition of the final text, contributing to less binding wording on goals and responsibilities. Observers interpreted this strategy as a balance between pro-climate rhetoric and cautious practice — especially relevant after the United States’s direct absence, which altered traditional leadership dynamics.

Objections from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, China, India and Russia: blocking the fossil roadmap

One of the most sensitive points in the Belém negotiations was the so‑called “roadmap” for moving away from an economy dependent on fossil fuels — an explicit priority of the Brazilian presidency. Although the initiative gained important political support, especially from the Global South and activist leaders, it did not make it into the final texts due to a lack of consensus. Fossil-fuel-producing countries (notably Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates), as well as major emitters such as China and India, and to a lesser extent, Russia, and even Japan, raised firm objections.

These objections ranged from practical issues (timing, socioeconomic impacts and energy security) to geopolitical positions defending industrial and revenue interests. For many of these countries, formal commitments to abandon fossil fuels would entail high political and economic costs, requiring guarantees of finance, technology transfer and just treatment for workers and communities. This bloc managed to bar inclusion of the roadmap in the joint decision, relegating it to a parallel initiative — albeit one that faces growing political pressure.

Brazilian diplomatic leadership: sewing consensus and maintaining the agenda

Brazil, as COP30 president, worked intensively to transform the mutirão effort into a political reality. The presidency’s strategy combined multilateral diplomacy (bilateral and multilateral negotiations), global visibility — placing the Amazon at the center of discussions — and bridge-building among groups of countries. The presidency proposed the creation of an international just-transition mechanism, with a draft to be presented by June 2026 and contributions open until March 15, 2026, aiming to establish an instrument to organize finance, technical cooperation and capacity building.

This action produced results: 122 countries presented new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) during COP30, and a package of decisions elevated just transition as an institutional priority. However, the Brazilian effort coexists with internal contradictions — part of the government promoted a roadmap for renewables even as the state authorized oil exploration auctions at the mouth of the Amazon, renewed contracts for gas and coal thermal plants through 2040, and faced a Congress about to review vetoes and make environmental licensing more flexible.

These internal tensions erode the policy coherence needed to transform international commitments into robust domestic policies. Even so, the efforts of Brazilian climate leadership deserve attention and recognition.

Colombia–Netherlands initiative: a promising path to the end of fossil fuels

Facing the impasse on including the energy transition roadmap, Colombia and the Netherlands launched a joint initiative to organize the first international conference on “Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels” in April 2026. This initiative deserves attention and applause for inaugurating an alternative strategic path to the unanimity-based system of UN climate conferences. It points to a promising mobilization of more than 80 countries to address the transition from coal, oil and gas to renewable energies, in parallel with COP processes.

By shifting the debate to a dedicated forum with technical and political focus, the coalition creates space to build operational consensus, finance transition guarantees and design social and labor protections. This parallel path is a necessary complement to global negotiations on the planet’s foremost climate agenda: ending the use of fossil fuels.

Civil society, Indigenous peoples and the pulse of climate democracy

Belém experienced one of the highest levels of civil society participation in COP history after three years of conferences in less receptive environments for public demonstrations. At COP30, more than 3,000 Indigenous people engaged inside and outside the negotiations, defending territorial rights among many demands; hundreds of parallel events addressed themes related to the Amazon’s socioenvironmental values and standing-forest bioeconomy. The streets were filled with a march estimated at 70,000 people — a clear popular demonstration for global climate action. Science was prominent: a scientific pavilion brought climate scientists into direct contact with the COP presidency.

Civil society demanded ambition, integrity of information and climate justice — reinforcing that serious policy must articulate science, human rights and broad social participation. The launch of the Tropical Forests Forever Fund (TFFF), which raised nearly $7 billion, was welcomed by some sectors; others criticized its governance and reliance on private funds, reflecting the debate on financing forest protection without offloading public responsibility.

The end of deforestation by 2030 is an imperative for Brazil to reach its NDC. Efforts have been made to decrease present deforestation to reasonable levels, which will continue in the coming years. Nevertheless, the TFFF figures and other funding sources suggest that they are below the zero-deforestation ambition needs.

The event also exposed shortcomings in COP infrastructure: thermal discomfort in the Amazon heat and humidity, and a small fire that was quickly controlled but interrupted use of some spaces for an afternoon and led to a few hospital visits without major consequences.

What lies ahead

At the slow pace of consensus-based diplomacy, attention now turns to COP31 in Turkey, with Australia chairing negotiations. Key points to watch for a minimally positive meeting include guaranteed and meaningful inclusion of civil society; a real commitment by hosts to halt approval of new coal projects; concrete progress on adaptation finance with numerical targets; operationalization of the just-transition mechanism; and consolidation of technical processes that make the fossil-fuel roadmap a negotiable agenda rather than mere rhetoric. A Pre-COP in the Pacific, responding to the needs of island states threatened by sea-level rise, and the selection of a negotiation president with the capacity to unite interests will be decisive.

COP30 in Belém renewed the political agenda by placing the Amazon at the heart of negotiations and by structuring a joint package of decisions that seeks to reconcile justice, adaptation and transition. At the same time, it made clear that without binding financial commitments, consistent social inclusion and domestic policy coherence, progress will be slow.

The Colombia–Netherlands initiative for a conference dedicated to ending fossil fuels is a promising beacon: it offers a technical-political forum to translate political pressure from Belém into concrete measures. If Brazilian diplomacy and global coalitions can convert the “joint decisions” momentum into operational instruments and real finance, COP30 may be remembered as the starting point of a historic turning point — led, above all, by the civil society that occupied Belém and demonstrated that the world wants, and can, accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels.

Geopolitical conflicts and multilateral fissures persist, but Brazilian leadership at this COP advanced agendas despite contradictions. The resistance of oil-producing countries and the absence of the United States shaped resistance to consensus-based diplomatic agreements. Still, Belém sent a strong signal from civil society and a considerable coalition of countries willing to pursue the end of fossil fuels — a positive and promising outcome for a polarized world dominated by the capital of the old fossil economy.

He has led the development of an optimised end-to-end supply chain, delivering value to customers and implementing intelligent supply chain strategies.","Global manufacturing solutions provider Jabil is expanding its partnership with metal parts manufacturer Inno to enhance the production of battery energy storage system (BESS) enclosures.

The move could strengthen the supply chain for a technology that is fundamental to the worldwide transition toward renewable energy.

Their collaboration includes a joint investment in a 15,000-square-metre facility in Rayong, Thailand, which is expected to begin prototyping in late 2026.

Bolstering the BESS value chain

Battery energy storage is crucial for creating a more flexible and resilient energy system. As renewable generation from sources like wind and solar expands, BESS technology fulfils a critical function. It allows for the storage of energy when it is plentiful and its release to the grid during periods of peak demand, or when generation is low stabilising the system and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

The partnership between Jabil and Inno – a subsidiary of Shanghai Xinpeng Industry Co. (XP) – builds on a relationship that dates back to 2014. The new facility in Rayong will focus specifically on manufacturing BESS metal enclosures. These components can represent a large portion of overall system costs because of raw material expenses and complex welding requirements.

Traditionally, manufacturers have sourced these enclosures from China before shipping them for final integration in markets closer to the end user. This expanded partnership could enable Jabil to offer a comprehensive lifecycle solution for BESS customers. The process includes sheet metal processing structural section fabrication welding and coating all from a single cost-effective location.

The site’s position just 25km from Laem Chabang, Thailand’s largest port, provides strategic access to global shipping lanes. By localising these manufacturing processes the collaboration could help simplify sourcing and reduce the carbon footprint associated with long-distance transportation.

Building supply chain resilience

Diversifying the supply chain for renewable energy components is becoming increasingly important. Geopolitical uncertainty and tariffs have highlighted the risks of relying on a single region for critical parts. The new Thailand facility offers an alternative manufacturing hub, helping to create a more robust and resilient supply network for the energy sector.

""For over a decade,"" says Brent Tompkins, SVP, Global Business Units, Renewables and Energy Infrastructure, ""our team has helped energy storage leaders design and integrate technologies like battery management systems power electronics and high-level assemblies into their BESS solutions.

""Our customers are increasingly looking to diversify their supply chain in the face of tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty. We're excited to offer this critical industry a vertically integrated solution that meets their needs from enclosure production to final integration and fulfilment while simplifying sourcing and reducing risk.""

Supporting a sustainable energy future

The collaboration is positioned to support the increasing global demand for clean energy. This includes providing the necessary infrastructure to power energy-intensive sectors such as artificial intelligence in a more sustainable way. By improving the accessibility and affordability of BESS technology, the partnership could play a role in accelerating the adoption of renewable power worldwide.

According to Jeffrey Shen, CEO of XP, the joint effort will accelerate Inno’s expansion within the energy storage market.

""Our collaboration with Jabil will accelerate Inno's growth in the energy storage market, bringing the potential of renewable power to more communities around the world, especially in support of the growing energy demand of AI infrastructures globally,"" Jeffrey explains.

""Together we can provide customers with increased supply chain resiliency at a competitive price point.""

As the electrification of transport, buildings and industry continues to gain momentum a reliable supply of energy storage solutions is essential for meeting climate goals and achieving a decarbonised global economy.

Summary

Electricity as a Weapon: The Russia-Ukraine war marks the first major conflict where control of electricity infrastructure is central to military strategy and peace negotiations.

Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant: Never before has a power plant been part of a peace deal—Russia’s demand for half the output is unprecedented.

Grid Vulnerability: Both Ukraine and Russia are targeting each other’s power grids and energy facilities, with over 1,300 strikes reported against Ukraine’s sector alone.

Energy & Society: Disabling a nation’s electric grid cripples hospitals, emergency services, water, manufacturing, and the ability to wage war.

Rising U.S. Utility Rates: Electricity prices are spiking nationwide, driven by flat supply, soaring demand from AI data centers, and costly policies favoring wind, solar, and batteries.

Land Use Conflicts: Rapid expansion of high-voltage transmission lines, data centers, and renewable projects faces growing local opposition and regulatory hurdles.

Natural Gas Dominance: Despite hopes for nuclear, the U.S. is set to meet surging demand with new natural gas plants, not rapid nuclear deployment.

Labor & Supply Chain Shortages: Construction of new energy infrastructure is being slowed by skilled labor shortages and dependence on critical minerals from abroad.

Political Impact: Electricity affordability is emerging as a top issue for 2025 elections, crossing partisan lines and fueling debates about technology, energy policy, and the future of American industry.

Commodities & the Future: The drive to reshape the U.S. grid, reindustrialize, and support tech growth hinges on access to commodities like copper, uranium, and rare earths.

Transcript

Jim Puplava:

Well, if you've been following the news, you know the President is trying to meet with Putin and bring about a peace agreement for the Ukraine war. But one of the big stories about that war is electricity. You haven't heard about it. Joining me on the program is Robert Bryce. Robert, you recently wrote an article called ""Electricity War,"" and I'm just reading here from the opening: more than any conflict in history, the Russia-Ukraine war has been about electricity. So let's talk about that because I hadn't heard that anywhere until I read your piece.

Robert Bryce:

Well, thanks. You know, I've been following the power business for a while. My latest book is A Question of Power: Electricity and the Wealth of Nations. I've done two documentaries on this. This is the world's most important form of energy. And it's clear that when you look at how this war has gone on, electricity has been front and center. I think one of the key points—and what spurred me to write this article, Jim—was that in the 28-point peace proposal or plan that Trump put forward, one of the tenets was that the Russians would get half the output of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. This is unprecedented. In the spoils of war, there has never been a power plant included in any peace deal—this is the very first time. And I think it's the ninth largest nuclear power plant in the world. So clearly, the Russians want this as one of their objectives. And the Trump administration is essentially saying, ""Well, yeah, sure, if that's what you want, we'll give you half the output."" But then you consider the number of attacks—missile attacks, etc.—on nuclear power plants, transformers, and so on, and it's clear this is, in fact, an electricity war.

Jim Puplava:

So when you look at this—and this isn't the first time—you talked about, in the first Gulf War, the U.S.-led bombing campaign nearly destroyed Saddam Hussein's electricity infrastructure. If you take out electricity, just think about the world we live in: you turn on the lights, you have refrigerators, your iPad, iPod, whatever it is. Our society runs on electricity. You take out electricity, what happens?

Robert Bryce:

Well, electricity—the electric grid—is the mother network. It's the network upon which all of our critical societal systems depend: hospitals, water, wastewater, emergency services, communications—all depend on the grid. So it's no surprise that in the Korean War, Vietnam War, and then in the Iraq wars, the electric infrastructure was a prime target for the U.S. military. Now we've seen—I'm just remembering my numbers here—in January, a Ukrainian official claimed Russian forces had launched nearly 1,300 strikes on Ukraine's energy sector, including more than 800 electric substations, distribution and power lines, more than 250 strikes on energy generation facilities, and 30 on gas facilities. Then add in the attacks the Ukrainians have launched on Russian facilities, and again, this is unprecedented—it's never happened at this scale before.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, one of the negotiating items—and Trump didn't do it—but the Ukrainians wanted long-range missiles so they could go farther and damage Russia's energy infrastructure. In your article, you talk about how, if you destroy your adversary's grid, you weaken their entire society, including their ability to wage war.

Robert Bryce:

Well, sure. If you have a nuclear—or any kind of—manufacturing plant to make munitions, missiles, tanks, jeeps, automobiles, bullets, rifles, you need power. If you ruin a country's electric grid, you not only make the overwhelming majority of people in the country miserable, you destroy their ability to manufacture the tools of war. But I think it's also important to remember—here we are in December, Jim, and winter is coming to Ukraine. This was a big threat before: the ability of Ukrainians to keep their power grid up during the depths of winter. Putin has shown no interest in declaring peace or any kind of peace deal, in my view, and I think he'd be happy to just continue the war, continue degrading Ukraine's infrastructure, and force ordinary Ukrainians through another fierce winter. This is a way to wage war. As I ended the piece, Putin now has the ability to weaponize winter, and that sure looks like what he wants to do.

Jim Puplava:

Well, just look at what happened to Europe when he invaded Ukraine. In the case of Germany, where they shut down their nuclear power plants, their gas plants, or their coal plants, they were left stranded and vulnerable to Russian blackmail, essentially.

Robert Bryce:

Sure. And remember the Zaporizhzhia plant, which I mentioned before—it has about 5,700 megawatts of generation capacity. As I said, it's the ninth largest nuclear plant in the world. That was one of the first objectives of the Russian invasion. They captured that plant within about two or three weeks—or, I'm sorry, it was just eight days after Putin launched the invasion. So this has been a strategic goal of the Russians from the very beginning: to capture key parts of the Ukrainian power grid.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah. I just wonder, if Trump can't get Putin to the table to negotiate peace, if he just gives the Ukrainians long-range missiles, that would escalate the war, but it could get more serious.

Robert Bryce:

Well, exactly. And this has been something—remember, this is a multi-level game at hand here, Jim. So yes, the U.S. could give the Ukrainians long-range missiles, but is Putin just going to see that as an act of war by the Americans, that they're using the Ukrainians now fully as a proxy to attack Russia? Further, we still need the Russians for other reasons. Yes, we've embargoed their oil exports—note, we haven't embargoed their uranium exports. Why? Because still today, about 20% of the nuclear fuel used in the U.S. reactor fleet comes from Russia. So, you know, the possibility of declaring all-out war against Russia is there. I was talking to a relative over the holidays; he said, ""Well, we just haven't pressured the Russians enough."" And I'm thinking, ""Well, the Russians have a lot of cards here too."" NATO—we could talk about NATO, we could talk about a whole lot of other things, but are we really serious about declaring full-scale war on the Russians over Ukraine? I don't think we are. And, you know, do I want my sons—I have two of them—to go to Ukraine to fight the Russians? No. Hell no.

Jim Puplava:

No. It's interesting because we're finding out—like we did with COVID—about supply chain difficulties, where you couldn't get stuff. I mean, I can't think of anything I get from Amazon or something I buy that doesn't say ""Made in China.""

Robert Bryce:

Yeah.

Jim Puplava:

As for rare earths, Russia has a number of key minerals, including uranium. So it really leaves us vulnerable. Now that we're on the topic of electricity, I'd like to transition to probably one of the hottest topics coming up in next year's election, which is affordability. And right at the top of that, Robert, is electricity prices. It was on the ballot in New Jersey—New Jersey utility prices are up 26%. It was on the ballot in Virginia, where most of the world's data centers are located. What we're seeing is politicians and the media blaming three groups: tech companies with their AI data centers, utilities, and then the catch-all—Trump.

Robert Bryce:

Sure.

Jim Puplava:

So let's talk about what is driving these utility costs. We've had discussions in the past—probably for the first time in multiple decades, various utilities are becoming more like growth stocks because of the energy demands for electricity.

Robert Bryce:

Sure. And isn't it interesting, Jim, you know, you're an investment guy. For years, the utility sector was viewed as this sleepy part of the business—what you buy for widows and orphans and grandmas; you buy the utility stocks and collect the dividends. Now stocks like Vistra and Constellation have far outperformed the S&P 500 because of the profits they stand to make as independent power producers. Why is that? It's because of this massive increase in demand for power. As you know, Jim, electric demand in the U.S. for the last 20 years has essentially been flat, growing at less than 1% a year. And now, all of a sudden, we're looking at 2, 3, 4% per year growth. The EPRI—the Electric Power Research Institute—is estimating AI is going to need another 50 gigawatts of new generation capacity by 2030. So suddenly, the power business is ""sexy."" And as you point out, in various states across the country, rates are skyrocketing. Why is that? Well, these states, they've been drinking the Kool-Aid on wind, solar, and batteries, and now the bill is coming due. They're finding out they don't have enough power to meet demand. Further, because of AI and data centers, they're trying to build a lot of high-voltage transmission. And what happens in electricity and plumbing—poop rolls downhill. The ratepayers are getting stuck with the bill.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah. Let's talk about wind and solar. I live in California, the land of fruits and nuts, and we're a prime example. We've got the highest gasoline prices in the country, the highest tax rates, but also the highest utility prices. That's because in California, we've shut down two nuclear power plants—one's been postponed from shutting down, but we shut down one; we shut down our coal-fired plants, and we built these wind farms and solar panel farms. It produces intermittent power, and we don't have the battery backup to make that consistent.

Robert Bryce:

Sure. And you can't build gas pipelines either. All of these things combined, Jim, are driving up California's power prices. Further, this is just a teaser for what's to come because the utilities in California are still facing net zero mandates. They're going to try to build a lot more wind and solar. They want to push a lot more high-voltage transmission. All of this is incredibly expensive. Just on the transmission side alone, we're talking tens of billions of dollars in additional costs—if those lines can even be built. That's the other part of this: land use conflicts over high-voltage transmission. You mentioned Virginia—whole sections of the state are opposing high-voltage transmission projects proposed to serve data centers. Local folks are saying, ""Look, we don't want these big projects, these power lines coming over our neighborhood. We don't get any benefit from them."" Again, another example of how energy policy and land use policy are interconnected.

Jim Puplava:

You know, it's amazing because we live in this technological society. I just think of all the things I have to charge at night: my iWatch, my iPhone, my iPad, my iMac—all these devices that use electricity, which make our lives convenient and give us what we want. But the other side of that, Robert, is our use of the Internet and AI. We're on e-commerce—think of all that. It requires data centers to house the information we're using. So there seems to be a disconnect between the life I live and what's necessary to produce that life.

Robert Bryce:

Well, it's funny as you say that, Jim. Well, first, on the iWatch—you make a good living; you can afford a good mechanical watch. Maybe you don't have to get a Rolex, but spring for a nice watch! You're too old for those digital things. But you're right, you know, there's this attitude of ""well, I don't want it here, put it somewhere else."" I don't like the term NIMBY—I think it's a slur. Everyone, everywhere cares about their neighborhood. But as you were saying that, it reminds me of the old maxim in the trash business: everybody wants their trash picked up, but nobody wants it put down. That applies, I think, to data centers. The concerns of local communities are real and valid. These data centers—they're big boxes, they're noisy, they draw tremendous amounts of power; nobody lives there, they change the character of neighborhoods, and they're massive power draws. That's why in Ireland, around Dublin, you can't build data centers—there's a prohibition. In New Mexico, new radical rules dramatically reduce where data centers can locate. So this is happening in a lot of places.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, we recently interviewed Mark Mills, and he was talking about the amount of electricity and land space. Have you seen the amount of land these buildings occupy? I mean, it's like a miniature city—are they that huge?

Robert Bryce:

Well, interesting you bring that up—my wife Lauren and I just drove back from Denver, and yesterday we went through Abilene and stopped by the Stargate project, OpenAI's data center that's going up there, Jim. It's about two square miles—1,100 acres, so 640 acres per square mile. So more than one and a half square miles. I've been to a county fair and a goat rope; I've seen a few construction sites, but I don't know that I've seen one this big, with that much dirt being moved. You can see it on Google Maps. We drove along one road on just one side of it—it was a full mile. The number of contractors, the cranes—it was truly staggering. If built as Sam Altman says, and that's a big ""if,"" it'll be 5 gigawatts—that's 5,000 megawatts. For comparison, I live in Austin, Texas. Austin Energy, our municipally owned utility, has 4,000 megawatts of installed capacity.

Jim Puplava:

And that's for the whole city.

Robert Bryce:

That's for the whole city of over a million people. So one data center—this big AI project OpenAI is pushing—will use more power than the entire city of Austin. It's just truly staggering in scale.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, I don't think utilities were ready for this kind of demand. Plus, we have an aging infrastructure. And on top of AI, Robert, we also have this reindustrialization. I can't turn on a financial channel each week without seeing another company—this week Eli Lilly—building a $5 billion manufacturing plant. So it's not just AI centers, it's the manufacturing we're trying to bring back and build factories. That's going to take electricity and power. It's enormous.

Robert Bryce:

It is. And as you point out, this whole push has caught the utility sector flat-footed. Also, in terms of capital allocation—you're a numbers guy, a money guy—I just did these calculations. If you look at the big five tech companies—Amazon, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Apple—their combined market capitalization is around $15 trillion. The combined market cap of 108 U.S. utilities (all electric, gas, water utilities—the biggest in the U.S.) is about $1.6 trillion. Just the big five tech companies are worth $15 trillion and they're demanding massive amounts of power. So it's a mismatch in capital availability, a mismatch in market strength. The big tech companies—there's a queue for gas-fired turbines. How much does it cost to jump the queue? They'll jump the queue. The scale of these buildouts and the amounts of money involved are truly unprecedented.

Jim Puplava:

You know, I just wonder, Robert, if they can even produce this, because we're looking at natural gas for power in the next five years—that's what we see. And then after that, maybe nuclear. If they could accelerate these small nuclear power plants—so you build a data center out in Timbuktu, away from any residential area, and then pop in a small nuclear power plant. It seems that would be a solution, but you've got to get through the regulatory red tape and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Robert Bryce:

Sure. I like how you put that—""pop one in,"" like it's a car battery or something. Easy to say, Jim. I'm adamantly pro-nuclear and have been saying the same thing for 15 years: natural gas to nuclear. But it's clear—and I've lectured on this; I'm going to be in Orlando next week talking about this very thing. The caption for my presentation is ""AI, Gas, and the Grid."" There is simply no way nuclear is going to provide any sizable amount of new power to the AI/data center race. It's all going to be gas. Why? Because we can't deploy new nuclear fast enough. I think we'll be lucky to deploy 10 gigawatts of new nuclear by 2035. We'll probably build 100 gigawatts of new gas by then. So it's a gas story. AI is a gas story—full stop.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, we're invested in natural gas and pipelines for that very reason. Because I know the way Washington works—the red tape and bureaucracy you have to go through. And not only that, Robert, it's like we're finding with technology—we can't make this high-tech stuff without rare earth minerals, and you can't run nuclear power plants without uranium, and we're dependent on foreigners for a lot of this.

Robert Bryce:

Well, you're right. I've written a lot about China, supply chains, and rare earths. You're absolutely right—copper is a strategic element. But don't forget the rare earths are also critical for nuclear: samarium, gadolinium, europium, dysprosium—several are required by the nuclear sector. None of this happens in a vacuum. Just back to the SMR story—I published a piece a few days ago about the collapse in share prices of several pure-play SMR companies: Oklo, NuScale, Terrestrial, and Nano Nuclear in November. Mr. Market has been looking at those companies and saying, ""I'm not sure I buy this story,"" because they're all many years away from commercial deployment and even further from profitability. They'll have to raise billions in new capital, and at NuScale for one, they're massively diluting existing shareholders. I'm hopeful for SMRs, but I wouldn't bet against the incumbent companies like GE Vernova and BWX Technologies—they have big balance sheets, lots of experience in manufacturing, they're not startups, and they know what they're doing when it comes to building reactors.

Jim Puplava:

Oh, absolutely. So how do you think this plays out? Next year is a key congressional election, and the number one issue on the ballot is going to be affordability. With affordability, they're really talking about electricity. If we're talking about rising food costs, I can make some substitutes—maybe buy fresh food instead of packaged, or go to a lower cut of beef. I've noticed in our supermarket they've got lower cuts of beef, which are cheaper. Costco cleared out a good portion of their beef section and is featuring seafood, which is cheaper. But with electricity, you can't substitute. You either turn on the lights or you don't. So how do you think this plays out? It's shaping up to be the number one issue in the election next year.

Robert Bryce:

It is interesting, Jim, and it could be one of those rare issues where Democrats and Republicans align. It's a populist issue. For instance, Josh Hawley—a Republican in Missouri—railed against the Grain Belt Express high-voltage transmission line and got it killed. In Virginia, as you pointed out, candidates ran against data centers, saying they'll make them pay their fair share. That's Democrats running against big tech—and nobody likes big tech. So how this shakes out will be really interesting in November. Republicans may be on the defensive because Trump has had the big tech bros in the Oval Office and at the inauguration. Does he really want to stand next to Zuckerberg and Bezos as they build these data centers, or will he flip the script and say he's for consumers now? To be clear, we can't blame all the electricity price rises on data centers and big tech, but they're an easy target. This is about land use, affordability, local neighborhood issues—and these cross partisan lines.

Jim Puplava:

You know, this is the problem with the media today. It's easy, when there's a particular problem, to find somebody to blame it on—""Okay, it's the tech guys, that's why this is going on."" It's a lot more complex, as you talk about in your article and others have discussed: the green transition, more wind and solar, distant transmission lines, distribution rates, and so on. It's more complex, but if you can find someone to blame, it makes the story simple—""Ah, okay, it's the tech guys.""

Robert Bryce:

Well, I take your point. I'll add that what I fear—and I think my fear is well-founded—is that the big investor-owned utilities are only focused on their massive capital expenditure programs for the next few years: funding new high-voltage transmission, funding new generation. While they may not be able to say this is all for data centers, to them it doesn't matter. I've watched this for a long time. What do the big utilities care about? Getting as much of their expenditures into the rate base as possible. So far, public utility commissions have said, ""Sure, no problem."" We've seen that here in Texas, with Oncor proposing a 765kV line running from east to west out to the Permian Basin. The demand is in the Permian. Why build a power line across the state? Makes no sense—unless you're a utility that wants a rate base and an $80 billion project. Then it makes a lot of sense.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah. So this is going to play out. It's going to be the number one issue. It's funny—as you mentioned, we started out thinking about utilities. Me, being in the investment business, if I had someone older, conservative, wanted income, I'd put them in utilities: bread and butter, safe, not volatile. It's a whole different ballgame today with utilities.

Robert Bryce:

Oh, absolutely. It's interesting to take a step back and look at the utility sector and what's happening in commodities. I haven't checked the natural gas price today, but this cold spell has hit—sent gas prices up, I think it's over $5, the Henry Hub spot price. Remember, just two years ago, the average price for natural gas in the U.S. was $2.20. We're now more than double that. Then add in what we're seeing in the copper market, uranium, rare earths, all of these technologies require digging stuff out of the ground—and a lot of stuff. That's going to be a pinch point. I'll just add one other quick point: it's also about labor, Jim. This is another macro theme we've talked about before. You can talk about building all the data centers in the world, but you have to have skilled labor—men and some women willing to be there in the mud, cold, dark, and rain. The supply of those workers is very tight right now.

Jim Puplava:

Oh, it's incredible. I just added onto my house—putting in a hyperbaric chamber. I had an electrician out for three 20-amp circuits to power this, six hours a day: $1,500. If I had kids today thinking about college, I'd say go to trade school. You can become an electrician and in a couple of years you're making six figures. Here's an interesting thing I'll throw—

Robert Bryce:

And you happily paid that $1,500 too, didn't you? It wasn't a big expense for you, but to get it done right, you paid that. That's what we're seeing. I was at a conference a few weeks ago—a man who runs a lot of linemen, journeyman linemen. He's seeing other companies poaching his people, paying as much as $500 per day per diem to work in remote areas. The wage war to capture these skilled laborers is another big inflationary part of the economy that doesn't get much attention.

Jim Puplava:

Well, and this is something you're seeing—what's rather interesting, I'm looking at this from maybe a 40,000-foot level—but if you look at the '70s and '80s, we outsourced manufacturing, so we got the rust belt, blue-collar workers lost their jobs. Now, with AI, it's white-collar jobs being lost. The Wall Street Journal recently said it'll be the worst job market for graduating seniors next year. I can't turn on or pick up a newspaper without seeing some company laying off workers—Amazon, 40,000, because of AI. So to me, we don't have enough electricians, welders, plumbers, carpenters. Life is looking good for a blue-collar worker or tradesman over the next decade.

Robert Bryce:

Auto mechanics—I'll add that in. That's another key issue. There was also one—yes, using Bureau of Labor Statistics data, the Economic Policy and Innovation Center came out with a report last month. Since 1995, the participation rate in the labor force of men aged 16 to 24 has dropped from 71% to 55%, along with all the other social pathologies associated with increased loneliness, time online, and disengagement from social groups. The decline in labor force connection promises more social and economic problems. It's not just the folks our age—the people in their dotage, right? The workforce of the future is shrinking, and the men who should be starting their careers are dropping out of the workforce. That's very worrisome.

Jim Puplava:

It's an incredible time. We're going through probably one of the biggest transitions. I don't think we've fully grasped what's happening: reshoring, supply chain shortages we're trying to correct. We're scrambling to catch up for policy mistakes, in my opinion, made three or four decades ago.

Robert Bryce:

It is. It's funny you say that because I ask people about this a lot—is it more uncertain now? I have the sense, as you do, that we're in conflict with China—some of that self-imposed, right? Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs. I won't say we're at the brink of war with Russia, but we're in conflict. We have a president who one day goes this way, the next day the other. We're shooting supposed drug smugglers in the water—wait a minute! The level of uncertainty, economically, with massive debt in the U.S., where we're paying more for our debt than for national defense, upheaval in commodity markets, layoffs in oil, tech, and retail—it's an incredible amount of uncertainty. I wish I knew what was going to happen next, but I'm just trying to be defensive, be smart, and plan to keep working because I'm too young to retire—what else would I do?

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, it's amazing. We certainly live in interesting times. We shifted, Robert, probably three or four years ago—I'm now a little over 30% in commodities for clients: oil, gas, gold, silver, uranium, all these things. All this stuff we're trying to do—reshoring, the grid, energy—it takes raw materials. The government even came out and declared copper a strategic material. Silver is now a strategic material. We want to make all this stuff, but to do that—especially if you're bringing back manufacturing—you need commodities. You need stuff to make stuff.

Robert Bryce:

You're right. Let me see—I'm just looking at the Henry Hub price today. The front month price for January delivery is $5.31. What a massive jump. Of course, it's winter and prices always go up, but we've also seen the massive run-up in copper. Copper has been fairly flat for a while, but now, with the problems at the Grasberg mine in Indonesia, copper's at $5.37 per pound—that's up 35% for the year. Silver's up over 100%. Gold's up 60%. Platinum's up 84%. It truly is a remarkable time. Even despite the run-up in gas prices, U.S. natural gas is still about half the cost of Europe or Asia. The key for the U.S. is to keep energy and power cheap, abundant, and reliable. That's the key to maintaining the U.S. advantage over the rest of the world.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, was on this week talking about how, if it weren't for the energy coming out now with the Trump administration taking off regulations, what he's trying to do and what other tech companies are trying to do wouldn't be possible. It's impossible.

Robert Bryce:

It's—AI is a power play. It's a play for watts. There was an interesting article the other day about Nvidia's chipsets: their power density, their power demand, keeps going up. It's a little counterintuitive to me, Jim, because my fifth book was Smaller Faster Lighter Denser Cheaper. The history of the computer age has been just that—smaller, faster, lighter, denser, cheaper—since ENIAC. The power demand went down, and the computing power went up. But now, with large language models and the rest, even with the increased efficiency of chips, the data demand and computational power demand have grown so fast that the power sector can't keep up with the compute sector.

Jim Puplava:

I've watched this over three or four decades. Right now, it's sort of the NIMBY idea: we don't want data centers; big tech are the bad people; utilities are also bad. Maybe we'll go against them or see what politicians try to do. Then we'll start having energy shortages, blackouts, because we don't have enough energy. Then the pendulum swings in the opposite direction.

Robert Bryce:

It may well be, but I think the land use conflicts are not going away. What still beggars belief is how—now, I have plenty of criticisms of the Trump administration, plenty—but on the energy front, I think they've been absolutely right on pretty much everything. What we haven't seen, Jim, is a similar move in Europe. Instead, the Brits, Germans, the EU—Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the EU Commission—just yesterday or the day before said, ""We're moving toward energy independence."" I thought, ""You are so blind, you don't know what you're talking about,"" because they continue to think they're going to solve energy problems with wind, solar, and batteries. Just since January 1 in England, Ireland, and Scotland, there have been, I think, 65 rejections of wind and solar projects. So the idea that they're going to run on wind and solar—you can't build it. Local communities all over the British Isles are saying, ""Take this stuff and put it somewhere else.""

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, it's amazing. You keep talking about this land use thing—it's not only just the land use for wind farms and solar, but now you throw in data centers. And let's not forget, if you're going to build something like a Taiwan Semiconductor plant in Phoenix or Intel or Apple, those plants take massive amounts of land. We want to bring back all these factories, but you can't just go in the middle of a city, tear down buildings, and put up a two-square-mile manufacturing plant.

Robert Bryce:

That's certainly true. I mentioned I was in Abilene just yesterday, and this Stargate project is located northwest of Abilene. It's just a big area with cattle grazing and mesquite and huisache—so there's plenty of land in Texas, but that's not necessarily the case in Virginia, Data Center Alley near Dulles Airport. That's very land-constrained. The theme we're seeing with data centers is that the latest numbers show that some of the biggest installations are going where the gas is. I mentioned Abilene—almost spitting distance from the Permian Basin. In that part of Texas, natural gas is super cheap and abundant. Same in the Haynesville—Entergy is building a big gas-fired plant in Louisiana for Facebook. In Ohio, over the Utica, Facebook is building more capacity. In Pennsylvania, near the Marcellus, a lot of data centers are going in there. The hyperscalers—the big tech companies—are putting data centers where the gas is because that's their only way to get the power they need. It's a gas-to-power play.

Jim Puplava:

All right, well, Robert, as we close, any parting thoughts? Do you think Putin settles with Trump and the Ukrainians on this?

Robert Bryce:

Well, he hasn't settled yet. We've been looking at this same deal for two, three weeks now. I don't know. I wish he would, Jim. I hope and pray there's some settlement, but I don't see what—Trump's motivation is clear: he wants to see an end to this and call himself the peacemaker. But what's Putin's motivation to quit? I think he has a lot of incentives to keep the war going. I hope I'm wrong, but as he hasn't quit now, what incentives have changed that would make him do something different? From everything I hear—and it's only that—the Russian economy is doing fine. The longer the war goes, the more Putin is fine with that. As brutal as that is, I don't wish it to be true, but that's what it appears.

Jim Puplava:

Well, it's amazing because if he's successful in Ukraine, he's also been poking around in Europe. It's like resurrecting the old Soviet empire.

Robert Bryce:

It's a dangerous time. It's delicate to figure out the right way forward. I pray for peace, but I'm trying to be as sober about this as everything else. I want a good outcome, but again, this is just one of many uncertainties in a world that seems as fraught and dangerous as any time in my adult life.

Jim Puplava:

Hopefully, we can bring the country together on things, because at least in my lifetime, I've never seen the country as divided as it is today. You'd probably have to go back to the Civil War to see this much division.

Robert Bryce:

That's a good point. I don't know that that's true—I guess Ken Burns has a line, he's been talking lately, he has a new documentary coming out, and he said, ""The country has always been divided. What's different now?"" I think that's probably true. But the vitriol is what's been hard, and unfortunately, the Trump administration has fanned the flames of some of that. The midterms are going to be interesting. I'm curious to see who's going to run in '28—who the Democrats will put up. It's clear Gavin Newsom is running. But who's going to prevail on the Republican side? Economics and affordability, particularly on energy, as you've talked about, will be front and center.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, well, it looks like, at least from what I'm following, it could be Newsom and AOC. Among the candidates, Newsom seems to be at the top right now.

Robert Bryce:

He has the money, he's from a big state with a lot of electoral votes. He says he hasn't decided—he's decided. But he's from California, and as you say, the land of fruits and nuts. I think Republicans will say, ""Do you really want a California-style regime nationally with all these insane climate policies?"" They can point to his record on housing, a lot of things—he's vulnerable on his own record. There's no doubt the Democratic Party has moved further left and is now really the party of AOC, but Newsom—don't count him out. He's movie-star handsome, very good on the stump, but it's going to be a battle royale on the Republican side.

Jim Puplava:

Well, we live in interesting times. I'm just glad I own hard assets for my clients and we own some growth utilities. It's a different market. That's one of the things I've seen in the market over the years—every decade brings a different kind of cycle, stocks that drive it. Right now, I see the drive in commodity-type stocks. But anyway, as always, it's a pleasure having you on the program. I read your article, ""The Electricity War,"" and I hadn't heard anyone talk about that. So I wanted to have you on. You're my electricity man, my expert buddy.

Robert Bryce:

That's very kind, thanks. Don't forget robertbryce.substack.com.

Jim Puplava:

Hey Robert, tell them about your two documentary films—they're excellent. If you really want to understand electricity and what's going on, people should go watch them. They're very interesting and well done.

Robert Bryce:

Thank you. I've actually made a couple of mini-documentaries—""mini docs""—with my daughter Mary. One is ""Shrinking Fission"" on SMRs, about seven minutes. We also made one earlier this year called ""Sunblock: The Global Fight to Save Farmland from Big Solar."" I also did a feature-length documentary in 2019 with Tyson Culver called ""Juice: How Electricity Explains the World""—that's at juicethemovie.com. Then we did a five-part docuseries called ""Juice: Power, Politics, and the Grid."" Each segment's about 20 minutes, available at juicetheseries.com. All are free on YouTube. I'm easy to find—just search Robert Bryce on YouTube or Google. Thank you. I'm very proud of all the documentaries we've done—I'm very lucky to do what I do. It's my purpose and my passion, and I love to talk about this stuff.

Jim Puplava:

Well, you're very good at it, so I appreciate you coming on the program. Happy holidays, Merry Christmas, and a prosperous new year.

Robert Bryce:

The world is now warming faster than at any point in recorded history. Warmer temperatures over time are changing weather patterns. This poses many risks to all forms of life, according to the United Nations Climate Action.

Here are some benefits of fighting climate change from various sources, including Yale Climate Connections.

The benefits of fighting climate change

Cleaner air leads to fewer pollution-related illnesses, which means less money spent on medical treatments and fewer hospital admissions.

Reducing emissions helps prevent crop losses, which can save billions of dollars annually and enhance food security.

Transitioning to clean energy means investment in building new infrastructure like solar, wind farms, and manufacturing clean vehicles, creating demand for skilled jobs like engineers, electricians, and construction workers.

In most parts of the world, new renewable energy projects are already the most affordable source of power.

Energy efficiency upgrades in homes and buildings can lead to substantial reductions in energy bills for households.

Investing in clean energy can decouple economies from the volatile price swings and geopolitical shocks of the global fossil fuel market.

Here are some ways climate change impacts daily life from various sources, including the Environmental Defense Fund.

Higher grocery prices due to crop failures.

Increased energy bills from heatwaves.

Infrastructure damage from floods.

Health risks include heat stress and respiratory issues.

Inaction on climate change exposes economies to massive costs from extreme weather events, infrastructure damage, and agricultural losses, according to the World Resources Institute. The global economic benefits from avoided damages and short-term improvements could increase globally by up to 3% by 2050.

By reducing emissions, climate action lessens the frequency and intensity of these costly disruptions.

Taking climate action in the United States can save at least $4 billion by the end of the century on road maintenance alone, according to Yale Climate Connections.

Article content

This revelation, emerging from life-cycle and supply chain audits, exposes the false claim behind Ottawa’s more than $50 billion experiment. A Volvo study found that manufacturing an EV generates 70 per cent more emissions than building a comparable conventional vehicle because battery production is energy-intensive and often powered by coal in countries such as China. Depending on the electricity grid, it can take years or never for an EV to offset that initial carbon debt.

Prime Minister Mark Carney paused the federal electric vehicle (EV) mandate for 2026 due to public pressure and corporate failures while keeping the 2030 and 2035 targets. The mandate requires 20 per cent of new vehicles sold in 2026 to be zero-emission, rising to 60 per cent in 2030 and 100 per cent in 2035. Carney inherited this policy crisis but is reluctant to abandon it.

Industry failures and Trump tariffs forced Ottawa’s hand. Northvolt received $240 million in federal subsidies for a Quebec battery plant before filing for bankruptcy. Lion Electric burned through $100 million before announcing layoffs. Arrival, a U.K.-based electric van and bus manufacturer, collapsed entirely. Stellantis and LG Energy Solution extracted $15 billion for Windsor. Volkswagen secured $13 billion for St. Thomas.

The federal government committed more than $50 billion in subsidies and tax credits to prop up Canada’s EV industry. Ottawa defended these payouts as necessary to match the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which offers major incentives for EV and battery manufacturing. That is twice Manitoba’s annual operating budget. Every Manitoban could have had a two-year tax holiday with the public money Ottawa wasted on EVs.

Even with incentives, EVs reached only 15 per cent of new vehicle sales in 2024, far short of the mandated levels for 2026 and 2030. When federal subsidies ended in January 2025, sales collapsed to nine per cent, revealing the true level of consumer demand. Dealer lots overflowed with unsold inventory. EV sales also slowed in the U.S. and Europe in 2024, showing that cooling demand is a broader trend.

As economist Friedrich Hayek observed, “The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.” Politicians and bureaucrats cannot know what millions of Canadians know about their own needs. When federal ministers mandate which vehicles Canadians must buy and which companies deserve billions, they substitute the judgment of a few hundred officials for the collective wisdom of an entire market.

Bureaucrats draft regulations that determine the vehicles Canadians must purchase years from now, as if they can predict technology and consumer preferences better than markets.

Green ideology provided perfect cover. Invoke a climate emergency and fiscal responsibility vanishes. Question more than $50 billion in subsidies and you are labelled a climate denier. Point out the environmental costs of battery production, and you are accused of spreading misinformation.

History repeatedly teaches that central planning always fails. Soviet five-year plans, Venezuela’s resource nationalization and Britain’s industrial policy failures all show the same pattern. Every attempt to run economies from political offices ends in misallocation, waste and outcomes opposite to those promised. Concentrated political power cannot ever match the intelligence of free markets responding to real prices and constraints.

Markets collect information that no central planner can access. Prices signal scarcity and value. Profits and losses reward accuracy and punish error. When governments override these mechanisms with mandates and subsidies, they impair the information system that enables rational economic decisions.

The EV mandate forced a technological shift and failed. Billions in subsidies went to failing companies. Taxpayers absorbed losses while corporations walked away. Workers lost their jobs.

Canada needs a full repeal of the EV mandate and a retreat from PMO planners directing market decisions. The law must be struck, not paused. The contrived 2030 and 2035 targets must be abandoned.

Markets, not cabinet ministers, must determine what technologies Canadians choose.

At a hearing before the Pennsylvania House Committee on Energy, several witnesses cautioned against the bill’s renewable mandate.
Josh Shapiro should drop his own attempts to tax reliable energy sources and force renewable energy on consumers.
Or are we truly going to work toward Pennsylvania energy dominance?","In July, nearly two dozen companies gathered in Pittsburgh, along with President Donald Trump and other leaders, to announce investments in data centers and needed energy infrastructure. Totaling more than $90 billion, the expenditures would equal nearly ten percent of Pennsylvania’s gross domestic product, inducing a headline that described the prospect as “truly mind-blowing.”

Since then, some have begun erecting regulatory obstacles to this development. Presented as consumer protections, many are more likely to be economy killers — and “mind-blowing” for would-be reformers of 164,000 regulations already dampening Pennsylvania’s business climate.

Consider a six-bill package introduced by seven Democrat members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives “to encourage the responsible development of A.I. data centers addressing water and energy use, emergency preparedness,” and more.

Pennsylvania has power plants, steel mills, factories, coal mines, and acres of warehouses–all of which deal with a host of regulations to address these same issues. One bill would impose energy-efficiency standards on data centers when there is no more powerful incentive for prudent use of resources than the profit motive.

Why are lawmakers specifically targeting these information processors?

“This is an attempt to throttle new data centers to prevent more natural gas from being used to power them,” writes Jim Willis, publisher of Marcellus Drilling News. “‘Responsible development’ is code for no development.”

A seventh House bill, titled the “Data Center Act,” would require the eponymous facilities to get at least 25 percent of their energy from so-called renewable sources, defined as wind, solar, biomass, and hydroelectric.

Such market meddling has contributed to rising electricity prices and a more fragile power grid by giving preferential treatment to expensive and unreliable energy sources–particularly wind and solar. Moreover, misguided policies have shortened or ended operations for more practical technologies, such as coal- and natural gas-fired power plants.

At a hearing before the Pennsylvania House Committee on Energy, several witnesses cautioned against the bill’s renewable mandate. They included Stephen DeFrank, chairman of the state Public Utility Commission; Joe Bowring, an independent market monitor with PJM Interconnection; Dr. Amy Brinton, director of government affairs with the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry; Rob Bair, president of the Pennsylvania Building and Construction Trades Council; and Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy with the Data Center Coalition.

State Rep. Mike Armanini, one of at least two Republican committee members opposing the mandate, noted that a 2019 proposal by then-Gov. Tom Wolf to impose a tax on fossil fuels had discouraged investment in natural gas plants. He also said that another House committee “would kill the natural gas industry” with a proposal to establish a gas-well setback of nearly a mile.

State Rep. Rob Matzie, a Democrat and the bill’s prime sponsor, agreed that avoiding overregulation was important. But Matzie insisted that policymakers should “promulgate some regulations early from a temporary perspective, and then move forward.”

Perhaps Matzie is testing political winds with the mandate provision. However, once enacted, most regulations are about as “temporary” as the Great Pyramid of Giza.

Enacted two decades ago, the state’s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act (AEPS) cost electricity customers more than $700 million in 2024 in compliance costs alone. Meanwhile, the wind and solar energy it subsidizes remains unreliable and too expensive to survive in a free market.

In Arizona, regulators have voted unanimously to begin repealing that state’s version of AEPS, reports the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Rating states based on various policies, ALEC ranks Arizona near the top nationally, at second and sixth for economic performance and economic outlook, respectively. On the other hand, Pennsylvania’s rankings are a pathetic 44th and 36th.

Noting Arizona’s economic success, ALEC partially credits the state’s “infrastructure capacity to support resource-intensive industries,” such as data centers that “require dependable, uninterrupted sources of baseload electricity to stay operational.”

If there is to be legislation on data centers, a proposal by state Sen. Camera Bartolotta offers a more viable solution. Barlotta’s bill would expedite permits for projects that meet or exceed federal standards.

Better still would be fulfilling the promise of broad permitting reform in a recent budget agreement. And while budget negotiations ended the threatened implementation of Wolf’s 2019 tax on fossil fuels, Gov. Josh Shapiro should drop his own attempts to tax reliable energy sources and force renewable energy on consumers.

As Rep. Armanini put it: “What are we going to do with Pennsylvania? Are we going to overregulate it and not let [the energy] industry grow? Or are we truly going to work toward Pennsylvania energy dominance? … We need to get into the game of being competitive.”

A competitive Pennsylvania is not out of reach. Thankfully, regulatory reform found its way into the newly minted state budget, suggesting the push for commonsense regulation is quickly gaining momentum in Harrisburg.

In eight years, energy storage went from a tiny player to one of the largest sources of new power on the U.S. grid.
Experts say that lessons learned there can help other regions deploy battery storage onto their grids, including the Midwest and East Coast, which are buckling under the weight of new data center construction.
Sizable Energy is working on a novel way to store power in flexible reservoirs that float in the open ocean.
And, Cache Energy has developed inexpensive pellets of calcium hydroxide that could store energy for months with minimal losses.","Nearly a decade ago, when the energy storage market was in its infancy, an industry organization set a dreamy goal: By the end of 2025, the U.S. would deploy 35 gigawatts of batteries connected to the grid.

So how’d the storage industry do? In the third quarter, 4.7 gigawatts of batteries were installed. In sum, more than 40 gigawatts have been deployed, and the year isn’t over, Canary Media reported. In eight years, energy storage went from a tiny player to one of the largest sources of new power on the U.S. grid.

What’s more, that’s nearly half of all new renewable power deployed on the grid for July through September, and this year, renewables have been the leading source of all new capacity, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Much of the new storage capacity has been deployed in Arizona, California, and Texas, states where the grid has been strained in recent years. Experts say that lessons learned there can help other regions deploy battery storage onto their grids, including the Midwest and East Coast, which are buckling under the weight of new data center construction.

Startups have been taking note.

Redwood Materials, which was co-founded by Tesla alumnus JB Straubel, in June added a new business line focused on repurposing used EV batteries for grid-scale storage. The company noticed two overlapping trends: The batteries that were arriving at its recycling facilities still had plenty of life left in them, and meanwhile, the battery storage industry was growing in leaps and bounds.

By 2028, Redwood plans to deploy 20 gigawatt-hours’ worth of battery storage. Investors have voiced their approval, investing another $350 million in the company to propel the new business line.

Another startup, Base Power, has taken a slightly different tack, leasing batteries to homeowners and aggregating them to serve as a large virtual power plant. The Austin-based startup raised $1 billion in October to help build a battery factory and fuel its expansion beyond Texas. The company has deployed more than 100 megawatt-hours of batteries in Texas.

While lithium-ion batteries have dominated new installations, other startups are pursuing other technologies that could lower storage costs significantly.

Sizable Energy is working on a novel way to store power in flexible reservoirs that float in the open ocean. Fourth Power is using blocks of carbon to store heat at super-high temperatures, and it’s looking to deploy them in 2028 at a cost that’s lower than lithium-ion batteries or peaking natural gas power plants. XL Batteries is deploying its flow-battery technology at petrochemical storage sites, allowing it to store hundreds of megawatt-hours using existing infrastructure. And, Cache Energy has developed inexpensive pellets of calcium hydroxide that could store energy for months with minimal losses.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Modular_Data_Center_2.jpg?resize=1200,675",N,,2025-12-06 11:03:52.258535

Pacific Gas & Electric, which owns the Diablo Canyon Power Plant, needs approval from the Coastal Commission to keep it running after it was scheduled to shut down this year. It’s one of the last permits needed to stay open after lawmakers approved it to continue operating until 2030.

Although situated 325 miles north of San Diego on the Central Coast, what happens within the plant’s concrete domes has implications for the Southern California metropolitan area, too.

Ahead of next week’s meeting, I wanted to get a better understanding of Diablo Canyon’s importance, the decades-long controversy that surrounds it, and what its continued operation means for ratepayers in San Diego.

Why Lawmakers Are Talking About the Plant Now

Diablo Canyon is a 40-year-old power plant in Avila Beach that generates about 9 percent of the state’s total energy. Its towering concrete cylinders and highlighter-green control room simulator are a snapshot in time, largely unchanged from when the plant began operating. Plans to phase it out in 2025 commenced nearly a decade ago.

Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2022 authorized the plant to stay open past its scheduled closure this year after heat-related blackouts the year prior sparked concerns over the reliability of California’s power grid.

Lawmakers pushed through a $1.4 billion state loan to keep it open, against the wishes of some Democrats skeptical of continuing to include nuclear power in the state’s portfolio of clean energy.

The Plant Remains Controversial Despite Growing Popularity of Nuclear Energy

The plant has been marred by controversy since it began operating off the San Luis Obispo coast in 1985. Advocacy groups such as Mothers for Peace have scrutinized its two nuclear reactors for decades over concerns about its waste, which remains radioactive for centuries.

Critics also point to the 2.5 billions of gallons of sea water it pulls in from the Pacific Ocean each day to cool its systems, its damage to marine life, and crisscrossing earthquake fault lines near its reactors as other dangers.

PG&E has maintained the plant is safe to operate and produces little carbon pollution, something proponents of nuclear energy and policymakers have largely embraced as the need for energy continues to grow statewide and nuclear reactors become a more attractive option.

Costs to Keep the PG&E Plant Open Are Hitting Ratepayers’ Pocketbooks, Including in San Diego

How the operators will afford to keep the plant running has been a questionever since lawmakers approved the $1.4 billion loan to keep it open for the next five years, which was to be paid back through federal loans and, if those didn’t fully materialize, profits generated from 2029 to 2030.

As much as $588 million is unlikely to come in, due to insufficient federal funding and projected profits, a report by CalMatters found.

Last year, the California Public Utilities Commission approved $722 million in ratepayer funds to go toward the plant’s operating costs this year. Those rate hikes were spread across customers of all the major investor-owned companies for the first time in history, including Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, because its power helps offset costs for all customers, PG&E said at the time.

That meant SDG&E customers paid $2 a month on average this year to help fund the plant, according to reporting from the San Francisco Chronicle.

The legislation to keep Diablo Canyon open, SB 846, allowed PG&E to do this because it’s seen as an asset to everyone in the state. PG&E has forecast it will cost SDG&E customers $12.6 million in 2026.

This is in addition to rising electricity bills for Californians, which are already among the highest in the country.

Nuclear energy critics and consumer advocates say that burdening ratepayers to fund Diablo Canyon and its environmental impacts are reasons to demand certain conservation requirements from the company to move forward with the permitting process.

The Coastal Commission Is Requiring PG&E to Conserve Land Around the Plant to Keep Operating

Last month, commission staff recommended that 1,100 of the 12,000 acres owned by the company at the site be set aside for conservation and public access to compensate for the estimated 2.5 billion larval fish the plant damages each year.

They also recommended increasing the acreage amount from 1,100 to 3,300 if the plant is approved to operate past 2030, which PG&E is seeking to do with federal regulators.

Commissioners took issue with the staff’s recommendation, wanting more concessions from the company to conserve a larger portion of the Diablo Canyon lands before giving the OK.

This is what the Dec. 11 hearing will be about, and commissioners are expected to approve the permit.

Sen. John Laird and Assemblymember Dawn Addis, both Democrats, wrote a letter to the commission ahead of its November meeting urging them to require PG&E to conserve more land because there was no guarantee that the state would allow the plant to continue running past 2030.

“We are not attempting to reject this permit application to extend Diablo Canyon’s operation until 2030,” Laird said in a statement after the November meeting. “The issue before the commission is rather how much of the Diablo Canyon lands to protect.”

In a 49-45 vote, the Senate passed a resolution overturning a 2024 Interior Department plan that would have limited oil and gas lease sales to about 400,000 acres within the 1.56-million-acre Arctic Wildlife Refuge. One Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, voted with Democrats to oppose the resolution. The legislation is now on the president’s desk awaiting signature.

Federal lease sales in Alaska will now revert to a framework developed in 2020 by the Trump administration that had opened most of the Coastal Plain to oil and gas development. In October, the Interior Department said it would move to restore lease sales to the entire Coastal Plain as part of Trump’s U.S. energy dominance agenda.

The president’s One Big Beautiful Bill, passed in July, includes provisions mandating six oil and gas lease sales in the Cook Inlet Planning Area in Alaska’s federal waters between 2026 and 2032, compared to two auctions covering the same area during the Biden administration.

Alaska’s all-Republican congressional delegation introduced and cosponsored the legislation. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said after the vote that a return to “balanced management” on the Coastal Plain will support U.S. energy independence.

Kristen Moreland, executive director of the Gwich’in Steering Committee, a group formed in 1988 by Alaska Natives opposed to oil drilling on the Coastal Plain, said the Senate vote ignored local concerns. The group has said the Coastal Plain is a critical habitat for Porcupine caribou.

“This action from DC ignores years of consultation and communication with our Gwich’in communities that rely on this landscape for not only our subsistence and survival, but also our culture and spiritual health and well-being,” Moreland said on the group’s website. “We stand united in our opposition to any oil and gas development in the Arctic Refuge and will continue to fight this effort from the Trump administration and decision-makers who ignore our voices.”

Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law organization, also said the vote prioritizes energy production over wildlife protections.

Groups supporting the push to open the Refuge to energy production include Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, whose members include leaders living in the North Slope region; Kaktovik Iñupiat Corp, the village corporation for Kaktovik, the only community located within the coastal plain; and North Slope Borough, a local government organization in Alaska that supports resource development to fund essential services like schools, infrastructure and emergency services.

As mandated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by Congress in 2017, the first-ever lease sale of tracts in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge occurred on Jan. 6, 2021.

Seven of the nine bids accepted at the 2021 auction went to the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a state-owned corporation, but those leases were canceled by the Biden administration in September 2023.

Chase. The failure, according to a press release, could lead to increased hazardous air pollutants being released into the environment.

The penalties the company faces include three years of probation, 500 hours of community service to the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara (MHA) Nation, and payment of a $500,000 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”) Clean Air Act violation fine.

Targa Badlands LLC had pleaded guilty to the offense earlier this year.

According to the press release, Targa Badlands LLC was also responsible for self-identifying, self-reporting, and correcting the failure.

“Today’s sentence underscores the importance of enforcing our environmental laws, which protect the land, water, and communities,” said US Attorney Chase. “At the same time, we recognize that Targa Badlands LLC took responsibility for its actions and self-reported the violation. Natural gas production is vital to our state’s economy, and it must be done responsibly. This case demonstrates that we can support strong energy production while holding companies accountable when they fall short of their legal obligations.”

Under NESHAP, Targa Badlands LLC was required to timely install continuous parameter monitoring systems on two engines in the Johnson Compressor Station, located in Dunn County. Targa Badlands LLC operated the Station between 2018 and 2022. Continuous parameter monitoring systems monitor and collect data on temperature and pressure for engine operations to ensure the catalyst is being utilized properly, thereby ensuring that the engine does not produce excess emissions.

The 2025 case against Targa Badlands LLC followed two earlier occasions in which the company had agreed to pay civil penalties to the United States for separate NESHAP violations pertaining to natural gas compressor stations operated by the company on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, according to a press statement.

And ultimately, by elevating issues such as technology transfer in Belém, Brazil flexed its influence as a middle power on the world stage.
The climate conference in the jungle made clear that the global energy transition is moving forward without the White House.","At the Polycrisis, we’ve been charting the shifting relationship between climate policy and geopolitics. We have been especially interested in two shifts. The first is the mainstream recognition that action on climate means meaningful action on development goals. The second is the emerging understanding that climate is about industrialization. Until recently, multilateral climate politics have been based on transfers of money and technology from industrialized to less developed countries, and on stable relations between the US and China. This has been upended. What will take its place?

Previous editions of the Polycrisis have spotlit the way that money is sloshing out of poor countries and into the coffers of rich ones. We’ve also focused on the “new nonalignment,” where large, capable and regionally powerful countries like Brazil are setting agendas for the entire world. Elsewhere we have looked at China’s new role as the leader of future technology. For this edition, we asked Rio-based journalist Catherine Osborn, who writes the weekly Latin America brief at Foreign Policy, to assess the UN Climate Conference in Brazil.

This is an updated version of an article that first appeared in Foreign Policy.

Last month, the humid Amazonian rainforest city of Belém, Brazil was alive with all the usual signs of a United Nations climate summit except one: a US negotiating team. Tens of thousands of participants from more than 190 countries and dozens of Indigenous groups staged two weeks of meetings, protests, and negotiations during this year’s summit, known as COP30. Though no US diplomats were present, a handful of conference-goers weaved through the crowds with white-and-green “Make Science Great Again” hats. California Governor Gavin Newsom made a defiant appearance.

This year’s conference was the first since Donald Trump returned to the White House and triggered the United States’ second exit from the 2015 Paris Agreement. This time, Trump had gone beyond withdrawing from international climate diplomacy and was actively working to undermine it. Sanctions threats in October against envoys from countries on the verge of reaching a landmark deal to limit global shipping pollution succeeded in blocking the agreement.

The threat of potential US sabotage hung over Belém as countries negotiated if and how they would speed up climate action. Trump’s pressure offered potential political cover to delegations that were already dragging their feet on climate issues for any number of reasons. Saudi Arabia, for example, had moved in lockstep with the United States to torpedo the shipping pollution deal.

Against this adverse political backdrop, a key pillar of Brazil’s approach to COP30 was what some climate strategists have called “coalitions of the doing.” Rather than waiting for absolute consensus among UN member states, Brazil tried to move in smaller groups to push action forward and emphasize how climate action can lead to economic development. By conventional metrics of COP summits, this one yielded incremental progress rather than any big breakthrough—showing the UN climate regime is surviving, but only barely.

Forest fund

Since their inception in the 1990s, UN climate conferences have aimed to compile an annual set of decisions that require the unanimous consent of more than 190 countries, plus the European Union. These yearly agreements have famously committed countries to work toward limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (about 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels, an agreement reached in Paris in 2015, and to transition away from fossil fuels, agreed upon in Dubai in 2023.

But many targets set at past conferences have not been met. As a result—and given geopolitical headwinds—Brazilian officials said that Belém should focus more on implementing existing goals than on setting new unanimous targets.

To address unmet climate pledges, Brazilian officials focused extra energy on countries that are eager to engage. This is a growing trend at COP summits: Because the unanimous agreements can be vague and cautious, in recent years, countries have united in smaller groups to set more ambitious targets. These include pledges to end deforestation and reduce heat-trapping methane emissions by 30 percent (compared to 2020 levels) by the end of this decade.

For COP30, Brasília helped craft a plan for a new investment fund to protect tropical forests that had received at least $6.7 billion in pledges by the end of November. Brazil and the United Kingdom announced a program to help seven countries track and reduce so-called super pollutants such as methane. And Brazil rallied at least sixteen countries and the EU to join a group devoted to collaborating on carbon markets.

With the forest fund, Brazil overcame a potential obstacle from the United States. The fund’s technical supervision is due to be carried out by the World Bank, where Washington is the largest shareholder. Earlier this year, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called for the bank to deprioritize some of its climate-related work. If the United States wanted to block the bank’s participation in the forest fund, it likely could have.

“The World Bank is a multilateral institution, and many of its members emphatically supported the idea,” senior Brazilian Finance Ministry official Rafael Dubeux said. The project’s backers carefully emphasized that it was focused on forests rather than climate change more broadly. The fund got the green light.

The Brazilian summit hosts also emphasized the economic dividends of climate action. They are far from alone in this approach. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in July that countries clinging to fossil fuels are “missing the greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century.” Finnish President Alexander Stubb echoed this language in Belém, calling climate investments a “growth and prosperity plan.”

Globally, investments in clean energy this year are on track to be double those in fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. But the trend is uneven across the world. China dominates global production of green technologies such as solar panels, batteries, and wind turbines, far outpacing the United States. Although the adoption of these products is speeding decarbonization across the developing world, without transfer of the underlying technologies, countries might miss the opportunity to develop green industries at home.

Labor organizers in Brazil are worried about importing green technologies rather than building them domestically, said Deyvid Bacelar, the general coordinator at the Brazilian Unified Federation of Oil Workers. Though some oil workers might one day get clean energy jobs due to decarbonization, Bacelar pointed to union research that found that in jobs such as installing imported solar panels, “the pay is lower, and the benefits are worse.”

Though Brazil is rich in many of the raw ingredients for the energy transition, that does not guarantee decent work, Bacelar warned: “We hope the government works so there are green industries in Brazil with well-paying jobs, instead of our country’s role being only selling raw materials.”

At COP30, Brazil called for green dividends to be shared among countries. Several top officials in the Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva administration had already crafted national policies to try to address these concerns. (Lula is a former union leader.) Furthermore, the state government of Bahia, home to a BYD plant, secured commitments from the Chinese automotive giant to build a local research center, use Brazilian components in its vehicles, and train local workers—using the prospect of access to the large Brazilian market to bargain for a higher-value slice of China’s massive green overseas investments.

Until now, green industrialization has been less prominent in the COP agenda. Lula highlighted the importance of technology transfers in speeches ahead of the Belém conference. And on its fifth day, Brazil and a dozen other countries including Indonesia, Germany, South Africa, South Korea, and the United Kingdom pledged to create a secretariat for cooperation on green industrialization, saying in a joint declaration that the process must “address, rather than deepen global inequalities.”

The declaration also pledged to work to align countries’ standards about which goods count as low carbon. That can benefit both developed and developing countries, said Linda Kalcher, the executive director at European climate consultancy Strategic Perspectives: “Not only does it help the Europeans import material that meets their standard, it also helps them diversify away from one single supplier. … Most importantly, it builds value chains in other countries.”

Roadmaps?

Confirming climate advocates’ pre-conference worries about the bleak state of multilateralism—and climate cooperation in particular—COP30’s negotiated decision included only limited steps forward, with much of the noteworthy news occurring on the sidelines.

One of the main accomplishments in the summit decision was a commitment for countries to triple the amount of money globally available for climate adaptation by 2035. A decision on this topic was broadly expected, and had been seen as an indicator of whether the UN climate regime as enshrined in the Paris Agreement—cooperation by 190+ countries—was still producing results.

Climate adaptation funding often goes to projects without a quick and straightforward financial profit. These include sea walls to prevent flooding and irrigation systems to help farmers cope with droughts. “The private sector will not spend a lot of money on [climate] adaptation, full stop,” Kalcher said. That’s why years of UN talks have formalized the requirement for governments, especially in richer countries, to help pay. If climate diplomacy is reduced merely to small-group coalitions of the doing, poor countries may be left stranded.

On other topics, and for more ambitious countries, the COP30 decision fell short. In a surprise move, Lula at the start of the conference called for economic roadmaps away from fossil fuel dependence after years of reluctance to endorse the idea. Including this concept in the summit decision would advance a vague 2023 COP outcome on the need for countries to transition away from fossil fuels. Lula’s comments prompted a frantic push to codify the topic, which won support from more than eighty countries but ultimately failed.

While the US absence in Belém offered other actors the chance to show leadership—be they China, the European Union, or Brazil itself—some veteran climate hands came away from the summit with a feeling that “the wheels came off,” in the words of former UN climate boss Yvo de Boer.

For others, the conference was simply a sign of the difficult geopolitical times. And many countries vowed to work outside the summit to keep advancing topics discussed there. Brazil pledged to publish ideas for roadmaps away from fossil fuels over the course of the next year, and Colombia and the Netherlands announced they will host a conference on the topic in April.

The debate on roadmaps is moving forward much like the debate on equitable green industrialization: through a coalition of the doing rather than via a unanimous decision. And ultimately, by elevating issues such as technology transfer in Belém, Brazil flexed its influence as a middle power on the world stage.

The climate conference in the jungle made clear that the global energy transition is moving forward without the White House. The open questions are how fast it will go—and which countries will benefit.",https://www.phenomenalworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/COP-30.jpeg,N,,2025-12-06 09:59:19.618188

In September, energy prices overall were 2.8 percent higher than they were a year ago.
As of September, electricity prices are up 5.1 percent compared to a year ago, but in some places, the gain is much starker.
He added that seeing relatively low gas prices may in fact add to the anger that some are feeling about electric prices.
Experts have pointed to additional factors in high electricity prices, including expensive upgrades to the grid needed because of storm damage.","Gasoline prices are down while electric and natural gas costs are up, turning the issue of energy affordability into a political Rorschach test.

Democrats are lambasting the White House for high power bills, while President Trump and his allies tout low prices at the pump.

“Energy — gasoline — we’re now at about $2.50 a gallon. We’re going to be, I think, at $2 a gallon. We could even crack that at some point,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting this week.

In recent days, the national average price of gasoline has dipped below $3 per gallon, standing at $2.98 on Friday, according to the American Automobile Association (AAA).

“Our prices now for energy, for gasoline, are really low,” Trump added.

Meanwhile, multiple Democrats have decried rising electricity prices in the past few weeks.

“Everyone needs to be screaming about this. Energy costs are up 11% under Trump and families are getting their power shut off,” Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said in a post on X this week. “This winter that will be deadly. We need to take action now.”

Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Christopher Knittel said there’s some truth to what each side is saying.

“They can both be right that electricity prices are certainly growing at much faster than the rate of inflation. Oil prices have fallen somewhat,” Knittel said.

He noted that what the ultimate impact on consumers will depend on how much gasoline they use compared to how much electricity, “and that varies a lot by household.”

Nationwide, energy prices have risen at a comparable pace to inflation over the last year, but there’s wide variance across both location and the type of energy.

In September, energy prices overall were 2.8 percent higher than they were a year ago. This gain is slightly smaller than inflation overall, which rose by 3 percent over the last year.

Gasoline prices are down compared to a year ago. Friday’s price was down slightly from a year prior, when the national average was $3.03 per gallon. However, this is much lower than prices were a few years ago, at the height of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the economic re-opening after the COVID-19 vaccine. In 2022, the national average gasoline price reached just over $5 per gallon.

Presidential policy really only has limited influence over gas prices, as gasoline is traded globally and in the U.S. is only produced by private companies, not the government.

As of September, electricity prices are up 5.1 percent compared to a year ago, but in some places, the gain is much starker.

In New Jersey, for example, where power prices have become a major political issue, residential electric prices in September were 21 percent higher than they were the year before. In Washington, D.C., they were up 31 percent.

Meanwhile, the price of piped gas used in utilities has grown even more sharply, up 11.7 percent in September over the year before.

“U.S. gas production is not keeping up with increases in U.S. gas demand, and most of that U.S. gas demand is coming from LNG exports,” said Ira Joseph, senior research associate at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, referring to liquified natural gas.

Joseph added that cold temperatures at the start of this year also contributed to the issue.

Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, said that rising electricity prices are stretching already thin budgets for many families.

“Low- and moderate-income families live on very tight budgets … and they notice prices that go up,” Wolfe told The Hill.

“They talk about food, they talk about housing, but now they’re talking about electric bills as well. That’s new. I think it’s because the bills have gone up so rapidly,” he said.

He added that seeing relatively low gas prices may in fact add to the anger that some are feeling about electric prices.

“Many people think energy is energy….and I think that they’re aware of the gasoline prices becoming more affordable. Why isn’t their electric bill becoming more affordable?” he said.

Specifically, Wolfe said that one source of this frustration is the rise of power-hungry data centers.

He said people will ask: “‘Why aren’t they paying their share? Why are we paying for data centers?’ I think that’s what the political issue is becoming.”

Data centers are just one piece of the puzzle. Experts have pointed to additional factors in high electricity prices, including expensive upgrades to the grid needed because of storm damage.

According to EPRI, an energy research and development institute, gasoline is the largest energy cost for the average American household, making up an average of $2,930 in expenditures per household in 2024.

That’s compared to $1,850 for electricity, according to the organization, which receives some funding from the electric utility industry, as well as the federal government.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s overall impact on energy prices remains to be seen — as some of his actions are expected to raise prices while others are expected to lower them.

The president’s efforts to cut climate and pollution regulations on the power sector are expected to bring costs down. However, his efforts to ax subsidies for renewable energy are expected to raise them.

“On the exporting of natural gas…as this administration incentivizes more exports, that’s going to take supply away from U.S. households, and that’s going to tend to increase natural gas prices. That’s basic supply and demand,” said Knittel, the MIT professor.

“Getting rid of the subsidies on renewables is going to put upward pressure on electricity prices, so that’s going to be counterbalanced by their reduced environmental regulations on existing … fossil fuel plants. So we don’t quite know yet what the net effect of both of those are, but their policies are pushing in different directions on electricity,” he added.

But, Knittel continued, the Trump administration is not to blame for high electric prices, at least not yet.

“Electricity prices have been going up for the past two decades, so we can’t blame a year’s worth of Trump policies for what we’ve seen,” he said.

The issue is part of a broader struggle between Democrats and Republicans to convince voters that they are the better party for the economy.

During his recent Cabinet meeting, Trump slammed Democrats’ use of the word “affordability” as a “con job.”

“There’s this fake narrative that the Democrats talk about ‘affordability.’ They just say the word. It doesn’t mean anything to anybody,” he said, arguing that he inherited a significant amount of inflation.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/GasolinePrices_Frazin_AP_DavidZalubowski.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-06 08:58:20.962506

In truth, I do not believe we need nuclear power, because there is now a cheaper and safer option.
Today, the battery that is destined to be a global game changer is the sodium ion battery.
Consider these benefits: Sodium batteries maintain efficiency in cold temperatures far better than current lithium ion or lithium iron batteries.
The Chinese company CATL offers the Naxtra sodium ion battery, which performs with high efficiency at temperatures of minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit.","Last year, The Daily Star published a commentary on my observations of climate change over a span of several decades. Now that another year has passed, I’d like to update that column and offer some new thoughts.

In my prior commentary, titled “Observing Local Climate Change for 36 Years,” from the Sept. 14, 2024 edition of The Star, I warned that we were in a new climate regime, where the meaning of a “200-year storm” or a “500-year storm” was largely obsolete, because there is no longer any true reference for the climate conditions we are now experiencing. I also warned that we were likely to see local weather events beyond our imagining. Since that column, we have dodged a local weather disaster on the scale of the floods of 2006 and 2011, but we have seen catastrophic events around the country, notably the terrible flooding in western North Carolina from hurricane Helene, the wildfires in metro Los Angeles, and the Texas hill country flood.

More recently, Hurricane Melissa became one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the Atlantic basin, and possibly the most powerful, as it made landfall on the southern coast of Jamaica on Oct. 28. I say possibly because the crisp, near perfect circularity of the storm’s eyewall exceeded the capacity of the NOAA satellite algorithm to measure the storm’s intensity.

These events are happening with a frequency that was unimaginable only a few years ago. This non-linear acceleration will continue as long as we pump fossil fuel emissions into the atmosphere. Sadly, on a global scale, that is exactly what we’re doing. When I posted my prior column, the CO2 reading in parts per million at the Mona Loa Observatory for May 2024 was 427 parts per million. This May, the reading was 430.58 ppm — the greatest yearly increase in the history of record keeping. (In March of 1958, when George Keeling made his first measurement at Mona Loa, the CO2 in the atmosphere was 313 ppm.)

In my commentary last year, I made an appeal for us to set aside our NIMBY reflex and support local renewable development, both solar and wind. I also endorsed nuclear power as the best base load complement to renewables and cited Nobel Laureate Burton Richter’s assessment that wind and solar could provide 90% of the national grid, with nuclear supplying 10% to cover the problem of intermittency. I still believe nuclear is a safe complement to renewable power, but I have changed my thinking on its necessity. In truth, I do not believe we need nuclear power, because there is now a cheaper and safer option.

That option is batteries — not the lithium ion currently used in most electric vehicles, or the second-generation lithium iron used in back-up for homes and businesses. Today, the battery that is destined to be a global game changer is the sodium ion battery.

Sodium ion batteries have been around for at least a decade, but recent technical breakthroughs have transformed them into a power source that is truly wonderous. Consider these benefits:

Sodium batteries maintain efficiency in cold temperatures far better than current lithium ion or lithium iron batteries. This makes them ideally suited for winters in places like Upstate New York. The Chinese company CATL offers the Naxtra sodium ion battery, which performs with high efficiency at temperatures of minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

Because of their energy density, sodium batteries are comparable to lithium for battery energy storage, but are cheaper and safer. BYD, another Chinese company, offers the MC Cube-T sodium battery that provides 6.4 MWh of storage. That’s 64,000 watts of power! This unit fits into a 20-foot shipping container and is much cheaper than lithium batteries. What’s more, it performs better than lithium at both cold and hot temperature extremes, making it ideal for baseload storage for grids serving cities or even states.

Sodium batteries are available at much lower cost because the materials to make them are abundant and cheap. Another plus for sodium is the fact that they do not require bottleneck materials like lithium or cobalt, and no phosphorous — an element that is almost exclusively mined in one state in north Africa.

Sodium batteries are truly transformative in their potential to help the world decarbonize. Their significant lower cost, wider temperature range and faster recharge will accelerate trends that are already established. In cars, sodium will deliver EV range on parity with any gas-powered vehicles, with recharge in minutes. Internal combustion engines will make no sense when the EV alternative is cheaper, more reliable, lasts for hundreds of thousands of miles and maintains peak efficiency at temperatures of -40 F to +158 F. In a relatively short time, large trucks and even ships will be powered by sodium technology. It is happening in China already.

While great for transportation, sodium is equally transformative for base load storage. With cheap, compact, high efficiency battery units, homes and businesses, as well as towns and cities, can have dependable back-up power. When these batteries are linked with wind and solar generation, it is possible to have self-sufficient power indefinitely.

Climate heating is a serious concern. But renewable technology is advancing rapidly, including more affordable PVC panels, larger wind turbines and new battery innovations like sodium and next-generation designs. All that is needed now is the political will to deploy.",https://www.cnhi.com/wp-content/themes/cnhi/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-06 12:03:21.149847

A few weeks ago, in the middle of November, more than a hundred people showed up to make sure the Indiana Department of Environmental Management heard their opposition to a data center being built in southeast Fort Wayne.

“We’re not just here to defend our neighborhoods in the backyard of this data center, we’re here to defend everyone down river,"" Kelly Atkins said to represenatives from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management at a hearing about the latest request from the Google data center. At the end of the hearing, the crowd of speakers began chanting at the representatives; ""Deny, deny, deny.""

Hatchworks LLC, a subsidiary of Google, is requesting an additional 143 diesel generators to support the campus.

To understand the opposition to the build, first, a look at how the data center came to Fort Wayne, when it was known only as “Project Zodiac.”

How the data center came to Fort Wayne

In October of 2023, what was then described as an “unnamed Fortune 100 company” proposed a data center campus around Adams Center and Paulding roads, using nearly 900 acres of land and requiring an annexation of more than 700 acres into Fort Wayne.

The months that followed included a “super-voluntary” annexation, land sale and tax abatement approvals. In January 2024, after everything was finalized, the anonymous company’s name was released; Google would be building a data center campus with up to 12 buildings.

Community development director Jonathan Leist recalled how the property sale went through.

“So we sold our portion of the property for a little less than $12 million, $11.4 (million) I believe, something like that,"" Leist said. ""So that was over and above our last appraisal that we had of the property. So definitely market rate on the land sale.”

In December 2023, Mayor Sharon Tucker was still serving as the city council representative for the sixth district, the area where the data center is currently being built. Following a visit to a similar data center in Columbus, Ohio, at the December 22, 2023 city council meeting, Tucker spoke in favor of approving the project.

“There have been a multitude of bad projects that have tried to be dumped on the south side and I have fought every single one of them,"" Tucker said at the December 2023 meeting. ""This is not one, council, that I’m fighting.”

In her visit to the campus in Columbus, joined by Leist, he said their concerns specifically about sound pollution diminished.

""I think what we saw and heard there was that the only sound really being emitted was construction,"" Leist said. ""Like there was no unique data center sound that I think people in other locations had.”

A change in the energy landscape

The Midwest has become something of a breeding ground for data centers, due to cooler temperatures that require less energy-intensive cooling than Southern states. Great Lakes states like Indiana, Ohio and Michigan have seen a boom in data center builds over the last several years.

There are 72 facilities under construction in Indiana alone.

Earlier this year, the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan published a study into what happens when data centers come to towns.

The study found that, while many data centers propose to eventually run entirely on green energy, the green energy needed for that much energy running all the time isn’t currently possible.

And in cases like Fort Wayne, the company then asks for more of the old energy sources.

Molly Kleinman is the managing director of the science, technology and public policy program at the Ford School.

“I haven’t seen solid justification for the humungous embrace of as much energy, dirty as it needs to be, as we can get now, and we’ll worry about clean energy down the line,"" Kleinman said.

But it isn’t just about not using green energy. In many cases, the issue is the way data centers have increased reliance on fossil fuels. In many areas, increased energy needs from data centers are helping coal and gas plants slated for closure to find a second life.

“We’ve seen that data centers have eaten up all of the renewable capacity that the countries added over the last several years, and then gone beyond it,"" Kleinman said. ""They have essentially canceled out all of the gains that we had previously made in renewables.”

Bryce Gustafson is program organizer with Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer and environmental advocacy group based out of Indianapolis.

“This may come as a shock to some people, but Indiana was on a trajectory of getting away from fossil fuels,"" he said. ""This has completely upended that trajectory.”

Indiana Michigan Power just got permission to acquire an existing 870-megawatt gas-fired power plant in Ohio. NIPSCO announced plans in September to build a natural gas plant, through separate company NIPSCO GenCo, to address the increased needs from data centers throughout the state.

The information released contains details of funds disbursed and guidelines established under the PM E-Drive Scheme and Production-Linked Incentive Schemes for automotive component and battery manufacturing, among other initiatives.

According to official data, 39,485 EV chargers are currently installed across India, of which 8,414 are fast chargers. The ministry has clarified that setting up a vehicle charging point does not require a licence, and private entities may also establish such facilities.

₹2,000 crore has been allocated under the PM E-Drive Scheme to set up public EV charging stations. Electric bus procurement is also continuing, with competitive bidding undertaken by Convergence Energy Services Limited (CESL). 10,900 e-buses were allocated to five cities in the first phase, and the bids for selection of operators for them were opened on November 14 this year. An additional 2,900 e-buses have been allocated in the second phase.

Government of India Ministries, Central Public Sector Enterprises, autonomous bodies under GoI Ministries, States/Union Territories, and their PSUs, are eligible to receive subsidy funding to set up EV chargers under the PM E-Drive Scheme.

Any charger set up by a government agency on its own premises must be accessible to the public, and can receive a 100 percent subsidy on infrastructure and equipment. Chargers set up along highways controlled by state or central governments or their PSUs, and at railway stations, AAI airports, state transport bus stations, metro stations, municipal parking areas, etc, can get an 80 percent subsidy on infrastructure and 70 percent on equipment. For all other locations including private property, shopping malls, etc, there is only an 80 percent infrastructure subsidy.

“This expansion signifies a larger industry trend – that supply chain sustainability is not slowing down,” says Joey Lange, Senior Managing Director, Sustainability and Clean Energy at Trio.
Regional decarbonisation and market-specific guidance The programme is structured to assist suppliers in cutting their indirect emissions from electricity use.
“Collaboration will continue to be the path forward when it comes to advancing supply chain efficiency through decarbonisation objectives,” Joey adds.
Cassandra Garber, GM Chief Sustainability Officer, says: “Automotive suppliers and OEMs unite for zero-emissions action.","Transform: Auto, a collaborative programme for supplier decarbonisation, is set to expand its operations from North America into Europe, Turkey and Morocco. The initiative, led by Trio and Suppliers Partnership for the Environment (SP), could mark a notable development in sustainability-focused supply chain transformation within the global automotive industry.

Having engaged with over 800 suppliers in North America during its first two years, the expansion of Transform: Auto aligns with increasing regulatory and commercial pressures on automotive firms to reduce their Scope 2 emissions and secure dependable, clean energy.

“This expansion signifies a larger industry trend – that supply chain sustainability is not slowing down,” says Joey Lange, Senior Managing Director, Sustainability and Clean Energy at Trio.

Joey explained that when carmakers and their suppliers sharpen their focus and exchange knowledge on renewable energy deployment across different regions, the effect on industry-wide emissions could be substantial.

Regional decarbonisation and market-specific guidance

The programme is structured to assist suppliers in cutting their indirect emissions from electricity use. It provides free educational materials, practical tools and access to optional renewable energy purchasing groups, known as buyers’ cohorts, which are facilitated by Trio.

This expansion ensures that suppliers in these new regions can receive guidance specific to their markets, particularly in line with European frameworks such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).

The initiative will be active across all 27 EU member states, the United Kingdom, Turkey and Morocco. These areas collectively contain several high-growth automotive manufacturing hubs. Each region is set to receive tailored support based on its local energy markets, regulatory demands and the existing maturity of its supplier base.

“Collaboration will continue to be the path forward when it comes to advancing supply chain efficiency through decarbonisation objectives,” Joey adds.

Automotive leaders deepen commitments

The programme is sponsored by a group of leading automotive companies, including Cummins, Ford, GM, Honda Development & Manufacturing of America, Magna and Toyota Motor North America. This expansion is a reflection of a multi-year commitment from these original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to support their suppliers through the ongoing energy transition.

“As Magna works toward its long-term decarbonisation goals, renewable energy remains a key focus across all our regions,” explains Ahmed Elganzouri, Global Director, Sustainability and Energy at Magna.

Ahmed adds: “The expansion of Transform: Auto into Europe strengthens the collaboration needed to support suppliers in navigating regional renewable energy pathways and advancing our shared sustainability ambitions.”

Ford also highlighted the importance of coordinated industry-wide action. “Ford is proud to invest in Transform: Auto, which will provide suppliers with tailored guidance and expert support to help them reach carbon-neutrality targets,” said Liz Door, Ford Chief Supply Chain Officer. Liz also states, “It’s a testament to Ford’s belief in the power of collaboration.”

A stronger and cleaner supply chain

General Motors, which has a network of more than 140 Tier 1 suppliers in Europe, pointed to the programme’s potential for systemic impact.

Cassandra Garber, GM Chief Sustainability Officer, says: “Automotive suppliers and OEMs unite for zero-emissions action. We’re supporting the expansion of the Transform: Auto programme to Europe because the road to a zero-emission future is built on collaboration.”

Cassandra also notes the tangible benefits for the supply chain: “When suppliers produce more with less energy and reliable, cost-effective electricity, the entire supply chain becomes stronger. They can lower operating costs, improve electricity volatility, and reduce risk – plus create new jobs and tax revenue in the communities where they operate.”

She emphasises that the programme “meets suppliers where they do business, offering practical tools and pathways so they can navigate renewable energy decisions with more clarity and confidence”.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/4340144bc1186467b573a3dc1f203e26:d5963936c88822b3de9f85b0c3ecaa1e/cadillac-ev.avif.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 09:59:28.875569

The development of offshore wind projects in the United States has been contentious for much of the commercial fishing industry, with fishers claiming turbines in the ocean block them from accessing valued fishing grounds and disrupt the ecosystem.

As of June 2023, 634 oil platforms in the Gulf had already been reefed.

The development of offshore wind projects in the United States has been contentious for much of the commercial fishing industry, with fishers claiming turbines in the ocean block them from accessing valued fishing grounds and disrupt the ecosystem. Wind turbines have also posed a problem for NOAA Fisheries, forcing the agency to reconsider how it conducts fisheries surveys as its traditional research vessels can’t navigate too close to the structures.

To study whether commercial shrimpers would be impacted by wind turbines in the Gulf, researchers with the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science decided to look at how the industry currently interacts with offshore oil rigs, which are already plentiful in the Gulf.

Researchers took GPS data from shrimp vessels to see how they operate around oil rigs, using them as an analog for wind farms. The study found that shrimpers largely avoid the rigs, but there does appear to be a “sweet spot” roughly 3 miles between rigs that shrimpers trawl more frequently.

“To balance offshore energy development with fishing, we need high-resolution vessel data like this to see where activities overlap,” lead author of the study Brendan Turley said in a release. “As the ocean becomes more industrialized, combining different data sources is key to preventing conflicts between economically important marine industries.”

The study – which was published in the journal Marine and Coastal Fisheries – also found that the areas slated for wind power development generally avoid popular shrimp-trawling areas, with only 2.5 percent of total shrimping effort between 2015 and 2019 occurring in those areas.

“Beyond commercial activity, oil rigs also serve as popular recreational fishing and diving sites, highlighting that offshore infrastructure has complex, nuanced impacts rather than being simply labeled ‘good’ or ‘bad,'” Turley said.

Regulators and fishing groups have long recognized that offshore oil rigs can become hotspots for marine life, providing a structure for shellfish to grow on and creating a welcoming habitat for many fish species. In the Gulf, federal and state governments incentivize energy companies to transform decommissioned oil infrastructure into artificial reefs instead of removing them from the water completely.

As of June 2023, 634 oil platforms in the Gulf had already been reefed.

In October 2025, U.S. lawmakers introduced the Marine Fisheries Habitat Protection Act, legislation that would tweak the government’s artificial reef program to make it easier for oil companies to make the conversion.

“Instead of tearing down structures that have become vibrant marine ecosystems, we can repurpose them to benefit the environment, fishermen, and taxpayers alike,” U.S. Representatives Mike Ezell (R-Mississippi) said in introducing the bill. “As someone who has fished in the Gulf my entire life, I can tell you that the best fishing is always near these rigs. When we remove them entirely, we’re not just losing a structure; we’re destroying entire ecosystems. This bill is a no-brainer for coastal communities, sportsmen, and marine life alike.”",https://s3.divcom.com/www.seafoodsource.com/images/eb01ab0582eb7e6bf14f91b3e2d03b21.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 13:01:14.024656

The applications also say developers seek to install 41 turbines to annually generate about as much electricity as PNM.

BorderPlex Digital Assets, the company that has represented Project Jupiter in public meetings, did not respond to a request for comment.","Developers behind Project Jupiter, the controversial campus of data centers slated for Doña Ana County, have asked state environment officials to sign off on their plans to emit more greenhouse gases than the state’s two largest cities combined, and to generate as much electricity as the state’s largest power company.

Applications for air quality permits confirm figures that Source NM previously reported: If approved, Project Jupiter could emit more than 14 million tons of greenhouse gases per year. By comparison, Albuquerque and Las Cruces emit a combined 6.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gases annually, according to both cities’ climate action plans. The applications also say developers seek to install 41 turbines to annually generate about as much electricity as PNM.

Developers filed two applications, one for a “west microgrid” and one for an “east microgrid.” A microgrid is a self-reliant energy grid that doesn’t need to draw power from a larger utility, like PNM or El Paso Electric. For months, plans have made it clear that developers want to build natural gas generating stations for Project Jupiter’s microgrids, prompting concerns from residents and lawmakers that the data centers won’t comply with the state’s landmark clean energy law, which requires utilities to use 50% renewable energy by 2030, 80% by 2040 and 100% by 2045.

The applications show that together, the microgrids will emit nearly 500 tons per year of nitrogen oxides, an important ingredient in contributing to ozone. Individually, one microgrid is listed at 249.97 tons per year and the other at 248.9.

Environmental advocates say the developers’ proposal to split emissions across two permits for the same project appears to skirt state regulations, which classify projects with at least 250 tons per year of nitrogen oxides as “major sources” of hazardous air pollutants and subject them to arduous monitoring.

“They’ve split it into two separate plants that are ‘minor sources’ to avoid having to monitor their actual air quality impacts, which are going to be huge,” said Colin Cox, senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute. “They’re coming up to 99.9% of the threshold for when they’d have to do additional work.”

The American Lung Association has long given Doña Ana County a failing grade for ozone, which can cause asthma attacks, increased risk of respiratory infections and even increased risk of premature death.

BorderPlex Digital Assets, the company that has represented Project Jupiter in public meetings, did not respond to a request for comment.

Project Jupiter pits demand for data against New Mexico’s finite natural resources

The permits will only have to go through a public hearing process if an “outside party,” which can include a resident of the area, requests it, according to a spokesperson for the New Mexico Environment Department. No hearings have been scheduled.

Members of the public have, however, tried to stop the project in court.

In October, two residents and a local nonprofit filed a lawsuit against elected members of the Doña Ana County Commission and accused them of voting on an incomplete application when they approved $165 billion in government-backed bonds for the project in September.

“We’ve seen this with other air permit applications, where they’re right under the limit,” Maslyn Locke, a New Mexico Environmental Law Center senior attorney who is representing residents in the case, told Source NM. “Ultimately that means everything has to go 100% perfectly as they operate to not violate that…I don’t know if that’s realistic.”

Since filing suit in October, the nonprofit Empowerment Congress of Doña Ana County has withdrawn as a plaintiff in the lawsuit.

Another lawsuit, filed by Las Cruces resident Derrick Pacheco, alleged that county leaders acted inappropriately when they approved the project even though it had yet to go through the Planning and Zoning Commission.

Meanwhile, the electric vehicle conversation is evolving rapidly elsewhere.
On December 5, 2025, BYD Australia CEO Stephen Collins told Drive that the company is prepared to meet consumer demand, whether it tips toward battery electric vehicles (BEVs) or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).
Elsewhere in the electric vehicle sector, not all the news was celebratory.","The electric vehicle revolution is picking up speed across the globe, with fresh developments emerging from Brazil to Australia and Japan. On December 5, 2025, several landmark events underscored the shifting landscape of the automotive industry, as governments, automakers, and consumers alike grapple with the future of personal mobility. The day brought high-profile launches, bold policy pushes, and even legal drama, all reflecting the dynamic—and sometimes contentious—path toward cleaner, more accessible transportation.

In Brazil, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva turned the inauguration of the Chevrolet Spark electric car production line at the Pace factory in Ceará into a rallying cry for affordability and inclusivity in the auto market. According to Estadão, Lula didn’t mince words when addressing automakers and workers: ""Whoever makes these beautiful SUVs needs to be able to buy them."" The president’s remarks came at a time when the dream of car ownership has become increasingly elusive for many Brazilians. In fact, a survey by Bright Consulting revealed that the average car price in Brazil soared from R$70,900 in 2016 to R$159,684 in 2025—a staggering 125% jump, far outpacing the 63.9% inflation rate.

Lula’s speech resonated with a workforce that has watched new cars slip further out of reach. He linked the issue directly to income distribution, arguing, ""We work to have access to the things we produce."" The message was clear: without wage increases and lower prices, cars risk remaining symbols of exclusion rather than vehicles of social mobility. The president called on the auto industry to prioritize Brazilian consumers over exports, urging that producing a “beautiful car” was meaningless if it didn’t end up in a worker’s garage.

Against this backdrop, the Brazilian government’s Sustainable Car program, launched in July 2025, aims to bridge the widening gap between aspiration and reality. As part of the broader Mover industrial policy for Green Mobility and Innovation, the initiative leverages tax incentives—specifically, reductions in the IPI (tax on industrialized products)—to make entry-level, low-emission, and highly recyclable cars more affordable. The program is already showing results: in October, sales of cars included in the Sustainable Car program were 74% higher than those of other vehicles, according to Anfavea. Notably, car prices in 2025 rose by just 2.4%, below the IPCA inflation rate of 3.64%, marking the first price slowdown in five years. While the average price of a new car still hovers around R$160,000, this moderation opens the door to renewed discussions about making car ownership a practical goal once again.

The choice of Ceará for the Chevrolet Spark’s debut was strategic. The state is positioning itself as a hub for electric vehicle and SUV production, drawing investments and creating jobs in a region with pent-up demand for personal vehicles. By focusing on expanding industrial employment and supporting green mobility, the government hopes to address both economic and environmental challenges. The expectation is clear: as production scales up, costs will come down, making new cars more accessible to a broader swath of the population.

Lula’s push for affordability comes at a critical juncture. The Brazilian vehicle market is expected to reach 2.76 million units in 2025, including cars, light commercial vehicles, trucks, and buses. Yet, for many families, a new car remains a luxury. The president’s insistence that “those who produce SUVs need to be able to buy cars” frames the issue as both an economic and social imperative. Whether the combination of tax incentives, compact electric cars, and potential wage gains will be enough to put new vehicles within reach for ordinary Brazilians remains to be seen.

Meanwhile, the electric vehicle conversation is evolving rapidly elsewhere. In Japan, Lexus unveiled its much-anticipated LFA Concept, a fully electric sports car that marks a dramatic departure from its V10-powered predecessor. The LFA Concept, introduced on December 5, 2025, shares its aluminum chassis with Toyota’s new GR GT, but skips the twin-turbo V8 in favor of a cutting-edge electric powertrain. As reported by automotive media, Lexus has been tight-lipped about performance details, but the company emphasized that the LFA name now symbolizes a commitment to preserving and advancing engineering technologies for future generations, rather than being bound to internal combustion engines alone. The LFA Concept is expected to enter production around 2027, possibly following the Toyota GR GT’s own launch.

This move by Lexus highlights the broader industry trend toward electrification at the high-performance end of the market, even as questions linger about consumer appetite for electric sports cars. The LFA Concept’s striking design and advanced platform suggest Lexus is betting on innovation and brand heritage to win over enthusiasts in the coming electric era.

Shifting to Australia, BYD’s local arm is betting on flexibility as it navigates the country’s evolving appetite for electrified vehicles. On December 5, 2025, BYD Australia CEO Stephen Collins told Drive that the company is prepared to meet consumer demand, whether it tips toward battery electric vehicles (BEVs) or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). ""I think at the end of the day, consumers are going to decide [whether BEVs or PHEVs prove more popular],"" Collins said. BYD’s strategy is to field 10 models, split between BEVs—including the Atto 1, Atto 2, Atto 3, Dolphin, Seal, and Sealion 7—and PHEVs such as the Sealion 6, Shark 6, Sealion 5, and Sealion 8.

As of October 2025, BYD had sold 41,882 vehicles in Australia, with 19,248 BEVs and 22,634 PHEVs. While overall EV sales in Australia (83,805 year-to-date) outpace PHEVs (42,797), BYD’s numbers are skewed by the popularity of the Shark 6, the first plug-in hybrid ute available in the country. Collins noted that PHEVs remain a ""great solution for a lot of people,"" emphasizing the need for continued consumer education about the benefits of both technologies. BYD’s approach underscores the diversity of consumer needs and the importance of offering multiple pathways to electrification.

Elsewhere in the electric vehicle sector, not all the news was celebratory. On December 5, 2025, a former executive filed a lawsuit against Bollinger Innovations and CEO David Michery, alleging breach of contract and other claims. Bollinger Innovations, known for its electric trucks, now faces legal scrutiny just as the company seeks to expand its footprint in a competitive market. The outcome of this legal action could have implications for the company’s reputation and future operations.

Taken together, these developments paint a picture of an auto industry in flux. From Brazil’s push for affordable green cars and Japan’s high-tech electric sports cars to Australia’s pragmatic embrace of both BEVs and PHEVs, the global transition to electric mobility is anything but uniform. Each market faces its own challenges and opportunities, shaped by local economics, consumer preferences, and policy choices. As 2025 draws to a close, the road ahead for electric vehicles is charged with both promise and uncertainty—but one thing is clear: change is accelerating, and everyone, from factory workers to CEOs, is along for the ride.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/f8CxNBHDe9Lu5AQ0aOONlL3q214=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2F5be7f7cd-f89b-40b2-983c-c9cd0bf7c41a.jpeg,N,,2025-12-06 07:58:14.115116

“Immigrant workers keep our communities and economy strong. They deserve fairness, respect, and the peace of mind to work and provide for their families,” Saldaña said. “This legislation protects them from fear and uncertainty, ensuring they can continue contributing to the strength and prosperity of our state.”

“Immigrant workers keep Washington’s economy strong, and they deserve stability and respect in their workplaces – especially as unlawful federal enforcement continues to disrupt families and communities,” Ortiz-Self said. “This bill not only protects workers, but also gives employers the clarity, resources, and support they need to understand their rights and meet their responsibilities under state law. The Immigrant Worker Protection Act ensures timely notice of I-9 audits, strengthens protections on the job, and upholds our urgent commitment to keep Washington families safe and together.”

Immigrants help power Washington’s economy

Washington’s prosperity would not be possible without the contributions of immigrants. At just 15% of the state’s population, immigrants generate 21% of Washington’s economic output, according to research from the Immigration Research Initiative.

The state’s economic engine thrives when employees and employers have a safe, predictable environment in which to operate. However, federal immigration authorities’ tactics have had a destabilizing impact on Washington’s economy, sowing chaos and fear in communities throughout the state.

“As an employer, I know in the case of an I-9 audit there are steps I would need to follow,” said Ana Castro, owner of La Salvadorean Bakery and Restaurant in White Center. “This bill just adds one step to that process and ensures my workers have a chance to provide any updates to their documentation. This bill will help me stay in compliance with federal law because ultimately I rely on my employees to help me keep employment records up to date.”

“The Immigrant Worker Protection Act is an important bill for Washington state. It will help protect workers' privacy and level the playing field between employers and employees,” said April Sims, president of the Washington State Labor Council. “This bill can help immigrant workers, and all workers feel safer at work and help them to know what their employer is doing with their personal information.”

“The Immigrant Worker Protection Act is an important bill to protect workers and keep them in the know about when and how their information is being shared,” said Danielle Alvarado, executive director of Working Washington. “Workers who have had changes to their documentation and legal status should have the same opportunity to get their paperwork in order as employers do.”

“We fought to have provisions like these in many of our collective bargaining agreements. We know employers can comply with requirements like this – many already are,” said Stefan Moritz, secretary treasurer of UNITE HERE Local 8. “If an employer has advance knowledge that federal immigration will be doing an I-9 audit, workers should have that notice too so they can seek their own legal advice on how to respond to the situation.”

“The National Employment Law Project is leading the fight for a good-jobs economy, where all workers, regardless of immigration status, have the right to dignity, safety, and fair treatment on the job. When exploitative employers use worksite immigration enforcement to retaliate against immigrant workers, these rights and labor standards are eroded for all workers,” said Marisa Díaz, Director of the Immigrant Worker Justice Program at the National Employment Law Project. “The Immigrant Worker Protection Act supports good jobs because it will expand worker protections and increase access to information on employers’ and workers’ fundamental constitutional rights.”

These incentives include refundable tax credits, 100% bonus depreciation, and exemptions that reduce immediate taxable income, lowering initial tax revenues, but exact revenue estimates are elusive.
In 2024, manufacturing workers in the U.S. earned $106,691 on average, including pay and benefits.
Manufacturing R&D has more than tripled from $132.5 billion in 2000 to $404.7 billion in 2023.
At a time when there is growing concern about AI-related job destruction in several service sectors of the economy, the ramping up of re-shoring and expansion of domestic manufacturing is timely.","The Trump administration has stated that its economic agenda is designed to address the debt crisis by focusing on pro-growth policies that it expects will generate enough revenue to reduce the debt burden.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill” created the cornerstone of the plan, as it involves significant tax cuts, which the administration argues will unleash rapid . The belief is that this accelerated growth will generate a larger tax base, ultimately leading to greater tax revenues that help pay down the debt.

Critics, including the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and other analysts, have estimated that the net effect of the plan will likely add several trillion dollars to the national debt over the next decade.

To boost revenues, the administration’s trade strategy includes imposing new tariffs on imported goods to generate “trillions of dollars” for the federal government, providing a new source of revenue to offset the deficit. However, based on recent estimates from nonpartisan economic think tanks, the new tariffs are generally projected to generate lower revenue, in the range of $200 billion to $240 billion in 2026.

The final official figure for the Fiscal Year 2025 federal budget deficit was about $1.8 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office and U.S. Treasury Department, so for the first time, net interest payments on the national debt surpassed $1 trillion, due to both high debt levels and higher interest rates.

We haven’t balanced a budget in 25 years, and the six deficits since 2020 have all surpassed $1 trillion:

Spending on major entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid continued to rise by about 8%, collectively. While revenues increased overall, due to individual income and payroll taxes, this was partially offset by a decline in corporate tax receipts, potentially due to new tax deductions.

For attacking the $38-trillion federal debt, a genuine game changer would be the speed and magnitude of the re-shoring plan for foreign manufacturing to move to the U.S. Calculating the potential future revenue streams, aside from raising taxes to offset deficit spending, generating up to a million new manufacturing jobs that work in tandem with AI would be a viable option – including large tax revenue implications.

As this chart shows, our manufacturing jobs have been trending down since 1980, and sharply since 2000:

There are no specific estimates of future tax revenue from the re-shoring of manufacturing, but re-shoring generates tax revenue through two primary mechanisms: (1) the largest being increased and income taxes, and corporate and investment taxes, providing significant tax revenue. Also, (2) revenue will accrue from profits from any new or expanded U.S.-based manufacturing companies, as well as revenue from taxes on capital investment, new construction, and local property taxes on new facilities.

Re-shoring is heavily incentivized by federal acts, like the CHIPS Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and state programs. These incentives include refundable tax credits, 100% bonus depreciation, and exemptions that reduce immediate taxable income, lowering initial tax revenues, but exact revenue estimates are elusive.

The potential numbers look promising. According to the National Association of Manufacturers, for every $1 spent in manufacturing, there is a total impact of $2.65 to the overall U.S. economy. In addition, for every worker in , 4.8 workers are added to the U.S. economy. This is one of the largest job multipliers in the economy. In 2024, manufacturing workers in the U.S. earned $106,691 on average, including pay and benefits. For all categories of manufacturing workers, hourly earnings averaged $35.50.

We could see new manufacturing jobs in the next decade, due to organic growth and re-shoring alone, and these aren’t the old “assembly line” jobs. America leads the world in innovation, and manufacturers in the U.S. perform 53% of all private-sector R&D in the nation, driving more innovation than any other sector. Manufacturing R&D has more than tripled from $132.5 billion in 2000 to $404.7 billion in 2023.

At a time when there is growing concern about AI-related job destruction in several service sectors of the economy, the ramping up of re-shoring and expansion of domestic manufacturing is timely. With retirements rising and digital fluency growing, manufacturers are capturing institutional knowledge, redesigning roles for human-machine collaboration, and up-skilling at scale.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 04:57:41.914950

One POWERGEN panel, Utility Perspectives on Onsite Power, will bring together leaders from CPS Energy, Duke Energy and Black Hills Energy to discuss what onsite generation really means for grid operators, project teams and plant personnel on the ground.
“[Duke Energy] is building significant power generation capacity across our service territories (solar/battery/gas).
Over the past 15 years, he said Duke Energy has completed more than ten new gas-fired generation projects, along with a large fleet of solar and battery assets.
“Building new generation on either side of the meter has many of the same challenges,” he said.","As data centers and advanced manufacturing accelerate across the United States, utilities are facing load requests that far exceed traditional planning timelines. The demand for rapid, reliable power is pushing engineers and asset planners to weigh new approaches on both sides of the meter. One POWERGEN panel, Utility Perspectives on Onsite Power, will bring together leaders from CPS Energy, Duke Energy and Black Hills Energy to discuss what onsite generation really means for grid operators, project teams and plant personnel on the ground.

One of the panelists, Jeff Joyce, Director of Engineering for Project Management and Construction at Duke Energy, brings more than 25 years of experience in new generation construction and operations. Joyce said his perspective will focus on the choices utilities face as they try to meet historic load growth.

“[Duke Energy] is building significant power generation capacity across our service territories (solar/battery/gas). I hope to provide an electric utility’s perspective on traditional (front of the meter) vs onsite (behind the meter) power to support the AI boom and typical challenges of building on either side of that meter,” he said. “This is important because of the unprecedented growth, scale, and speed desired to power datacenters across the country.”

For engineers, project managers and EPC partners, the session will offer a clear view of how utilities evaluate siting, permitting, equipment availability, outage coordination, fuel planning and interconnection requirements when choosing between utility-owned generation and customer-sited assets. Joyce noted that he hopes attendees “gain insights and clarity on pros/cons and options to power their needs as well as opportunities to engage.”

Although this is a moderated discussion, Joyce said much of his contribution will draw from real project execution experience. Over the past 15 years, he said Duke Energy has completed more than ten new gas-fired generation projects, along with a large fleet of solar and battery assets.

“Building new generation on either side of the meter has many of the same challenges,” he said. Issues such as land use, environmental compliance, procurement lead times, labor availability and commissioning risk affect both utility-scale and onsite projects.

Joyce also underscored several challenges facing utilities, IPPs and self-generators as they evaluate the next decade of buildout. “Broader affordability in the face of extreme demand, interconnection queue complexity and process, supply chain constraints (gas turbines, transformers, etc), evolving grid complexity (operationally speaking) with new developing regulatory requirements and skilled labor” are among the most critical issues, he said.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 11:03:18.158870

Booker took on the role of sixth district representative after the data center was already under way.
Amid public hearings, council meetings and town halls, one voice has been missing from the conversation about the data center – Google.
Elsewhere in Indiana, communities are beginning to reject data center builds.
Marshall, White and Putnam counties have enacted moratoriums on data centers until they better understand the impacts of them.","In September, a report found construction spending on data centers was at an all-time high of $40 billion in the U.S.

Molly Kleinman is with the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, which has been researching data centers. She says there’s a concern that most of these data centers are being built to support tech companies’ AI features and what might happen when the “AI bubble” pops.

""We’re hearing more and more experts weigh in that the way these giant data centers are being funded is not sustainable and, at some point, bubble’s pop,"" she said.

A response from city council

In October, WANE15 reported language in the contract between the city and DMI FW LLC, which bought the property for Hatchworks LLC, a subsidiary of Google, included a promise the city wouldn’t turn against Google if public opinion does.

While it makes sense from a business standpoint, Bryce Gustafson with Citizens Acton Coalition said it risks public officials losing their power to listen to the public.

“Normal people just don’t have the same level of power in these issues, so if your decision makers are taking away their power, the everyday Hoosier; What kind of power do they have?"" He said.

In 2023, the city council approved the land sale to Hatchworks LLC unanimously. Though, some members of the current council had no hand in that decision.

Activist groups in Fort Wayne have recruited residents to show up at meetings like the IDEM hearing and city council over the past several weeks. They’ve been holding town halls of their own to share information about the center.

At the final city council meeting in November, residents showed up to offer further public comment to the council about the data center and Google’s request for a further 143 diesel generators.

City council has no power to deny the permit. It’s a decision that is in the hands of IDEM and subject to review by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Despite that, fifth district representative Geoff Paddock, who is serving as council president through the end of the year, announced ahead of the public comment he was sending a letter to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management about the request.

""I am asking them to sit down with us, work with us, the city of Fort Wayne, Google, the Mayor’s office, city council members who may be interested, other interested parties to find an alternative,"" Paddock said.

Once again, residents expressed their concerns about air pollution...

""I already have to carry an emergency inhaler around with me, everywhere I go,"" said one young resident who spoke at the meeting. ""I don’t really want to go outside and suffocate in the first two seconds after that data center is complete.”

Following public comment, councilmembers-at-large Chambers and Friestroffer agreed to work with Paddock, IDEM and Google to better understand the energy needs and the risks of the generators.

Sixth district councilwoman Rohli Booker attended a townhall put on by advocacy groups earlier in the month as well as the IDEM hearing. She commended those who spoke for their continued advocacy and how it has helped her advocate in meetings with Google.

“There are things that I heard at that IDEM hearing that I was able to share with them – some of the solutions, some of the concerns, some of the health implications – that if I hadn’t attended, I would not have been able to do,"" Booker said.

Booker took on the role of sixth district representative after the data center was already under way.

Amid public hearings, council meetings and town halls, one voice has been missing from the conversation about the data center – Google.

Mayor Sharon Tucker, who has been a proponent of the build since she was still serving as the city council representative for the 6th district, said she’d like Google to work with the public.

“I do wish our Google partners would do what I’ve done and try to answer those concerns and so that would probably be the one thing that I am disappointed in, that they have not answered those cries of concern,"" she said.

Google hasn’t returned a request for comment.

Following public comment at the council meeting, Chambers said the city is planning a town hall that she hopes Google will attend.

A coalition made up of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, the Environmental Defense Fund, Florida Crystals Corp., The Climate Group, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Covanta Energy, among others, is issuing this reminder to the news media with the aim of ensuring that this important issue continues to receive the coverage it deserves in the public interest. Coalition members share a keen interest in development of a robust renewable energy industry in Florida.

We expect the staff recommendation to improve on the “straw man” proposal for renewable energy standards issued by PSC staff August 13. That proposal, accurately described as “timid” in one recent newspaper editorial, was roundly criticized by a host of non-utility stakeholders as well as newspaper editorial boards statewide.

In the recommendations to be issued Thursday we will look to see whether the rule has been improved to “level the playing field” between conventional generation and renewable sources of energy. Conventional generation sources have been responsible for a 25 percent increase in utility rates since 2005 and next year some Floridians will see increases of as much as 30 percent.

Renewable sources of energy help to insulate customers against such price shocks caused by spikes in fuel costs and skyrocketing construction costs for new power plants.

The straw man version of the rule was heavily weighted towards cost containment (allegedly to protect consumers) to the detriment of meaningful investment in renewable energy development that would truly benefit consumers and also create jobs.

The cost containment argument is misleading. The bottom line is that this provision virtually guarantees that the cost of both conventional and renewable energy will remain unnecessarily high. Given the fact that conventional energy providers are passing along cost increases to consumers totaling between 25 to 30 percent, we will look for greater fairness on the cost containment issue.

Relying on coal, gas and nuclear power is a costly and risky strategy for Florida. The current trend for the existing coal, gas and nuclear power electric system is to increase the average residential electric bill by 55 percent, based on trends that anticipate 16 cents per kWh rate by 2020.

The increasing cost to build large power plants and the rising cost of all power plant fuels drives this trend in rate increases. Investing in renewable energy today will reduce the risk of fuel-related rate increases because solar and wind power have very low operating costs and no fuel costs. Biopower, meanwhile, relies on locally grown agricultural and wood waste resources and its costs are not affected as much by trends in global energy demand.

The draft rule?s first suggested cost cap would additionally limit third-party providers of renewable energy to an average of 6.71 cents per kWh of renewable energy provided. Yet it makes sense to commit to more than 6.71 cents per kWh for renewable energy when the alternative is paying residential rates that will grow from 11 cents today to 16 cents per kWh in 2020.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/cropped-sace-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-06 11:02:57.992932

CalCCA Urges CPUC to Protect Customers from Unfair Rate Increases in PG&E and SCE Rate Applications

Low-Income Residents Could See Unjust Rate Hikes of More Than $500 Per Year

Sacramento, Calif. — The California Community Choice Association (CalCCA) is calling on the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to revise its proposed decisions approving Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s (PG&E) and Southern California Edison Company’s (SCE) 2026 Energy Resource Recovery Account (ERRA) forecast applications, warning that the decisions would result in significant electricity rate increases for millions of Californians and violate state law protecting customer equity.

The CPUC’s proposed decisions would increase the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA) rate for some Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) customers by 350- 455% from 2025 to 2026—in some cases nearly ten times the increase faced by bundled Investor-Owned utility (IOU) customers.* Some CCA households could see bills rise by more than $40 a month—or more than $500 a year—hitting low-income residents the hardest.

CalCCA notes in comments filed this week that the CPUC proposals “breeze past” huge bill increases by preventing CCA customers who have left PG&E or SCE generation service from receiving any value for renewable energy credits (RECs) they previously paid for as well as incorporating other measures that increase costs on community choice ratepayers.

“The CPUC’s proposed cost shift onto CCA customers is both unfair and unlawful, and some of the state’s most vulnerable customers will bear the burden,” said CalCCA CEO Beth Vaughan. “The CPUC must modify the proposed decisions to ensure RECs are valued consistent with the law.”

The PCIA is set annually in the Investor-Owned Utilities (IOUs) ERRA proceedings. It includes above-market costs related to power supply commitments that the IOUs made many years ago. These include utility-owned generation (e.g., nuclear, natural gas, hydroelectric plants) and long-term renewable energy contracts with third parties. The law requires that CCA and other departed load customers receive the value of benefits associated with the IOUs’ PCIA resources when their utility’s generation customers use the resources. Find additional information on the PCIA here.

CalCCA’s comments filed in PG&E’s 2026 ERRA Forecast proceeding (A.25-05-011) are available here CalCCA’s comments filed in the SCE 2026 ERRA Forecast proceeding (A.25-05-008) are available here.

Next, the CPUC will consider reply comments on the Proposed Decisions in each case. A final decision on both PDs is expected at the Commission’s December 18 voting meeting.

It was another busy week in politics. The Supreme Court approved controversial redistricting plans in Texas. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth was in hot water in part because of strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats in the Caribbean. Oh, and also, there was another special election. So we've asked senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith and senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro to join us today to take a step back and put all of this into context. Hi to both of you.

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello.

DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey.

SUMMERS: Tam, I want to start with you and Secretary Hegseth, who was at the center of some really big scrutiny this week. Tell us what happened.

KEITH: It all comes back to Hegseth's leadership and judgment as secretary of defense. He was clearly in the hot seat all week. There was concern about the boat strike on September 2, where there were survivors who were then hit a second time and killed. Top lawmakers on key committees went into a closed-door hearing this week with bipartisan concerns. During that meeting, they saw a full video of the strikes, and they came out divided over how alarmed people should be about what happened. And they were divided on partisan political lines.

And that briefing up on the hill happened on the same day that an independent inspector general at the Department of Defense released a report that found, back in March, Hegseth had violated policy and risked the safety of U.S. service members by sharing sensitive military information in a group chat.

MONTANARO: Yeah. And politically, I mean, we've seen Republicans come to Hegseth's defense clearly here. You know, they're pointing to former President Barack Obama for these double-tap drone missile firings in the war on terrorism that were really controversial. They're saying that he wrote the playbook on this. The Pentagon spokesman called the inspector general's report a, quote, ""total exoneration,"" but that's not quite true. And, you know, it's just another example in the Trump era of just saying something is true and then hoping the base will echo those talking points.

And that's also been the case with Trump's recent racist comments about Somalis and Afghan refugees. You know, it's part of the Trump playbook to distract from worse news, like negative views of his handling of the economy, frankly, and go to xenophobia, immigration and other culture war issues. And his base has generally gone right along with that.

SUMMERS: And Hegseth is one part of all of this. But what are we learning this week about the way that the Trump administration is approaching foreign policy and national defense?

MONTANARO: Well, the White House put out a 33-page national security strategy document for the country. It's pretty notable for how Trump and his administration see the United States' role in the world. A few things really jumped out to me. One, there's real isolationist tendencies in it, noting, for example, quote, ""the affairs of other countries are our concern only if their activities directly threaten our interests."" Second, there's a clear retrenchment and focus on the Western hemisphere, which we've seen already here. And thirdly, there's this very harsh, negative view of Europe. The document describes Europe as undergoing economic decline and, quote, ""civilizational erasure"" tied to migration.

SUMMERS: But I have to say, this is not entirely surprising given what we've already seen and know about President Trump.

KEITH: Yeah. It's in line with how he has governed. But the document does lay this out explicitly, and it is quite the crack up of the post World War II order of alliances that largely kept peace and security for the West for well more than half a century at this point. And the question I have with this document is, will this be an enduring position or will it shift depending on who the president's talking to, as policies often do under this president?

SUMMERS: But at the same time, Republicans are grappling with a whole lot of data that suggests that voters are souring on Trump. Tell us what we're seeing.

MONTANARO: Well, Trump is really at his lowest point in his presidency politically. His approval ratings are the lowest. He's seen averaging now in the high 30s. He's in the 20s in our polling with independents. And so much of that is about the economy. His handling of it is low, as the cost of living has really been the dominant issue on people's minds. And yet Trump again this week was dismissing affordability as something important.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know, there's this fake narrative that the Democrats talk about - affordability. They just say the word. It doesn't mean anything to anybody. They just say it - affordability. I inherited the worst inflation in history. There was no affordability. Nobody could afford anything.

MONTANARO: You know, it certainly was the key issue in the special election we just saw this week in Tennessee, where Democrats again overperformed. The Republican won there, but Democrats did better. So clearly, the cost of living does really matter to people.

SUMMERS: What has the White House been saying about all of this?

KEITH: Well, first, they insist that they do not have their hair on fire about what happened in Tennessee. I did go in and speak with a senior White House official earlier this week who said that the president's travel is really going to ramp up at the end of this year. The first stop, the only one that's been announced so far, is next Tuesday in Pennsylvania. The focus will be affordability. But I have to say, this same senior White House official told me almost exactly the same thing almost a month ago. That time, I was told that the message would about empathy on prices, saying, you know, I feel your pain. We've done a lot, but there's a lot more we need to do.

But as we've seen, the president keeps steering back to the idea of affordability as a word that Democrats made up as some kind of con job against him. That lack of message discipline has been hard to break. And the problem with the cost of living is people go to the grocery store all the time. They are out Christmas shopping, holiday shopping right now, and they can see for themselves what things cost.

SUMMERS: Right. And we've also talked a whole lot about the structural advantages that Republicans have when it comes to the midterms next year. Where do things stand now?

KEITH: Well, the Supreme Court last night delivered a big victory to Republicans, saying that the maps drawn in Texas can stand. That mid-decade redrawing of lines was designed to give Republicans up to five more seats in an already heavily Republican state. President Trump has been a driving force behind that because he is very openly concerned about what happens if Republicans lose control of the House.

MONTANARO: And still, though, for Republicans, you know, they're trying to gain more seats, and they very well may create more in someplace like Texas, but they may not get as many as they would have hoped for. And they're being offset by places like California and elsewhere. And in a wave year, redrawing those seats and making some of them less Republican could backfire. And it's part of a reason, that and affordability, why we've seen potentially so many Republicans retiring from Congress, a real sign that Republicans are taking it very seriously that this could be a wave year coming up for Democrats next year.

KEITH: Because nobody likes to be in the minority.

SUMMERS: NPR's Tamara Keith and Domenico Montanaro, thanks to both of you.

KEITH: You're welcome.

Bryce Bruncati, the residential sales director at Raleigh-based 8M solar, said that meant his team had to pivot quickly.
He expects things like solar leasing can make a difference on both fronts.
Industry advocates say leasing is a viable option, but those interested should keep in mind, solar leasing typically requires long-term contracts and include annual price increases.
“Ratepayers, people that care about the climate, people that care about local small businesses and jobs and economic output, everyone benefits from like a thriving solar industry,” he said.","According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, North Carolina has more than 7,300 workers in the solar industry. Up through this year, it was considered one of the fastest growing employment sectors in the state but the passage the federal spending bill in July marked a big shift in the country’s energy priorities.

Dubbed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” the legislation ended a number of clean energy tax credits, including the 30% residential tax credit for homeowners looking to install solar and battery backups. Under the new rules, customers need to have their solar systems installed, inspected and connected to the grid by the end of 2025 in order to qualify for the credit.

Bryce Bruncati, the residential sales director at Raleigh-based 8M solar, said that meant his team had to pivot quickly.

“We went from a multi-year, six-year step down to cliff in six months,” he said. “So that’s just kind of tough for any business to figure out.”

For the past several months, Bruncati said that meant handling a rush of requests trying to add solar before the tax credits expire by January. He expects sales to plummet.

“We are expecting a potential 40% to 50% market contraction, and unfortunately, that’s going to really impact locally owned installers, but I expect many of them to close their doors,” he said.

Some in the renewable industry are already feeling the hit. Asheville-based Pine Gate Renewables filed bankruptcy and laid off more than 700 employees earlier this year, due to what they called market headwinds.

Bruncati said 8M is reevaluating its sales strategy to try and ensure the company won’t have to do the same.

“We’re trying to keep the teams we have, and our current employees,” he said.

At the center of the strategy is affordability. While solar is expected to cost more next year, Bruncati points out power is too.

He expects things like solar leasing can make a difference on both fronts. Leasing allows homeowners to rent solar and battery systems and start reaping the benefits of energy savings at a much lower, upfront cost.

“That also has the benefit of making solar accessible to a lot of people who maybe couldn’t order in the first place,” he said.

Industry advocates say leasing is a viable option, but those interested should keep in mind, solar leasing typically requires long-term contracts and include annual price increases. Homeowners should work with reputable installers and check annual price increases against the average utility-rate increase for their area to ensure their lease actually provides its promised savings.

As the cost of energy rises, Bruncati said the value of home solar and batteries will, too. He’s hopeful that means demand will return in the long-term and stay stable enough to help businesses like 8M weather this sudden market shift.

“Ratepayers, people that care about the climate, people that care about local small businesses and jobs and economic output, everyone benefits from like a thriving solar industry,” he said.

US President Donald Trump has been attacking the domestic EV industry from all angles, the latest move being a pledge to roll back CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standards set during the Biden administration. You do you, Donald. In the meantime, though, the global EV industry is marching forward with a healthy assist from US innovators in the solid-state EV battery field.

CAFE Or Not, Here Comes The Solid-State EV Battery Of The Future …

This year’s sharp U-turn in federal energy policy has already thrown EV sales momentum for a loop. With the support of President Trump, in the summer the Republican-controlled Congress rescinded a $7,500 federal EV tax credit, leading to a sharp plunge in EV sales in the US after the credit ended on September 30. In contrast, EV sales continue to rise in Europe and other markets where public policy is not as vulnerable to partisan politics.

The long term outlook for the US market looks somewhat less gloomy. The cost of EV batteries has been dropping and US automakers expect to produce more affordable EVs in the coming years, with an assist from new LFP batteries. However, over the near term, auto industry insiders anticipate that the CAFE rollback will further depress EV sales, by reducing the upfront cost of buying gas-fueled vehicles.

Into this picture jumps solid-state EV batteries. As the name indicates, solid-state EV batteries do not have the liquid electrolyte found in conventional lithium-ion batteries. Instead, they deploy an electrolyte made of high-tech ceramics or some other solid material.

Small-scale solid-state batteries are nothing new, but scaling up the technology for use in EVs has posed a formidable R&D challenge. Nevertheless, auto industry stakeholders have invested much time and effort into the idea, attracted by the potential for cutting costs while improving range, reducing charging times, and eliminating the toxicity and fire hazards that characterize conventional Li-ion batteries. Solid-state batteries are also lighter and more energy dense than their Li-ion counterparts, providing automotive engineers and stylists with a greater range of design flexibility (see more solid-state background here).

… Eventually!

Among the solid state innovators attracting attention from the auto industry is the Massachusetts-based startup Factorial Energy. The company’s “FEST” semi-solid-state EV battery has been crisscrossing the CleanTechnica radar since 2021, when Mercedes-Benz (formerly Daimler) and Stellantis expressed interest in the new technology (see more Factorial background here).

In 2024, Stellantis followed up with plans to field a fleet of FEST-equipped Dodge Charger EVs in 2026. Though, the timeline has reportedly been pushed to 2027 according to Motor Trend.

As of earlier this year, Stellantis was still committed to making its investment in FEST EV batteries pay off sooner rather than later. In the meantime, Factorial has been moving the R&D needle on its plans for developing a full, 100% solid-state EV battery under the name “Solstice.”

In the latest development, Factorial and the POSCO Future M branch of the Korean conglomerate POSCO Group have hooked up in a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding to collaborate on solid-state EV battery technology.

EVs are actually just part of the plan. “Under the MOU, the two companies plan to explore cooperation in developing materials for all-solid-state batteries, which are powering progress in next-generation industries such as electric vehicles, robotics, energy storage systems and more,” the two firms explain.

“We expect synergy in the next-generation all-solid-state battery business based on Factorial’s battery technology and market presence with global automakers, and POSCO Future M’s competitiveness in cathode and anode materials,” elaborated POSCO Head of Research Hong Young-Jun.

US Innovators Keep Pushing That EV Envelope

Factorial anticipates that the collaboration with POSCO will support a reliable, global supply chain for its solid-state EV batteries, complementing its South Korean factory as well as a facility in its home state of Massachusetts.

Factorial is just one example. Another US contender in the solid-state field is the Colorado startup Solid Power, which recently leveled up its ongoing relationship with BMW.

Earlier this year, BMW let word slip that its interest in Solid Power was on the cusp of payoff, and in October the automaker was ready for a more definitive statement. “Under the newest stage of collaboration with BMW, Solid Power will contribute its sulfide-based solid electrolyte to Samsung SDI for use in fabricating solid-state battery cells,” CleanTechnica reported on October 30.

Another player is the California startup Quantumscape. It was no surprise to see Volkswagen’s PowerCo branch taking Quantumscape’s new solid-state battery out for a spin last year, considering that Volkswagen is a Quantumscape investor. More recently, this year, Quantumscape joined forces with the legacy firm Corning in a new battery manufacturing venture. The two firms also partnered in a showcase of solid-state technology, featuring a Ducati motorcycle.

The Global EV Battery Race Heats Up, With Or Without The US

Although competition abounds in China and elsewhere, US innovators like Factorial, Solid Power, and Quantumscape have a good shot at leading the auto industry into the solid-state EV battery of the future — if not here in the US, then in other markets around the world.

And there is still plenty of innovating left to go around. Earlier this year, for example, researchers at Argonne National Laboratory recapped their efforts to improve solid-state batteries with lithium-metal electrodes.

“Because all atoms in lithium metal can participate in the charge and discharge of a battery — enabling it to store more energy — lithium metal has a higher energy density than graphite, a conventional electrode material,” the lab observed.

The lab points out that LLZO (lithium lanthanum zirconium garnet) solid electrolytes are excellent candidates for lithium metal electrodes. The next-level challenge is to identify other additives, such as gallium or aluminum, that improve electrolyte performance without degrading the electrodes.

Considering the topsy-turvy state of federal policy at the moment, all that hard work is unlikely to pay off — at least not here in the US. Automakers in Europe, though, could benefit. The research was conducted under the Vehicle Technologies Office of the US Department of Energy, through the US-German Cooperation on Energy Storage program. The University of California–Santa Barbara provided the LLZO material for analysis at the Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum in Germany and the Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences in the Czech Republic.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/factorial-solid-state-ev-battery.jpeg,N,,2025-12-06 08:58:04.336802

Coming off that new directive is the news that Enbridge, a North American energy company with substantial pipeline assets in the US, has plans to upgrade the Algonquin Gas Transmission to bolster New England’s pipeline capacity.

The Algonquin Gas Transmission pipeline upgrade marks a new era of increased gas capacity in the US

Enbridge has become a major player in the US energy market through its substantial gas pipeline assets in the region. The company has noted that reindustrialization and the reshoring of manufacturing are expected to boost American industrial power consumption growth by a remarkable 3% a year through 2035.

“We’re seeing a significant amount of customer interest in everything—gas-fired power generation as baseload, data center requirements, coal-to-gas conversions, and frankly just good old industrial demand.” – Greg Ebel Enbridge President and Chief Executive Officer

Enbridge has stated that the Algonquin Gas Transmission pipeline upgrade is aimed at increasing gas flow through New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, connecting to several regional gas pipeline assets. The region has some of the highest gas prices anywhere in the United States, leading to fluctuating prices that can often surprise customers.

The company notes the $0.3-billion expansion of the Algonquin Gas Transmission pipeline will increase up to 75 MMcf/d of supply to meet the needs of several local gas distribution companies in the US gas sector. The upgrade is designed to address winter gas price fluctuations that have hampered the purchasing power of several of Enbridge’s largest customers.

Unpredictable gas prices in the US have led Enbridge to aim to stabilize the sector

When winter hits the region in the US where the Algonquin Gas Transmission pipeline operates, it naturally affects the price of gas, leading to a wave of complaints from customers and operators alike. The US is the largest gas producer in the world, and since it relies so heavily on the sector, an upgrade to infrastructure was necessary.

“The Northeast has endured some of the highest energy prices in the nation. The combination of high demand, colder than normal temperatures and system constraints have resulted in considerable economic strain on households and businesses throughout the region.” – Enbridge spokesperson Michael Barnes

Enbridge has reached a final investment decision on the pipeline upgrade, a key milestone in the company’s plan for the gas sector in the Northeast of the US. The FID follows another key announcement that will boost gas production in the Permian basin. The company, along with its partners in the Matterhorn Express Pipeline joint venture, plans to upgrade and expand the Eiger Express pipeline.

The Permian basin has become the backbone of the US gas and oil sectors

Enbridge’s expansion plans for its substantial gas pipeline assets in the Permian come as other significantly large energy companies express similar plans to boost the gas infrastructure in the region, such as Enterprise Products Partners’ plan to boost the capacity of the Bahia NGL pipeline. With the substantial growth of the US gas market in recent months, the future of the American energy market is being led by the expansion of several infrastructure projects that can increase the capacity of the sector. The United States will continue to dominate the international gas sector at the current rate of output, led by several of the region’s largest energy companies.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 13:00:56.977964

Edward and James had been searching for a house for a long time with no luck when their realtor took them down a quiet residential street in Farmville, Virginia. Edward’s first thought as they turned the corner and he laid eyes on what would become their home was that it would be perfect for solar energy. With its long sloped roof, and without the dense tree canopy that their then-house in rural Albemarle County had, sunlight would fall directly on any installed panels throughout most of the day.

Although solar hadn’t been on either of their minds when they had begun their search, after moving in they began to look more seriously at what adding solar panels would entail.

Solar journey

“I started by contacting an energy attorney, Ivy Main. She had been doing a lot of writing on energy policy and law in Virginia,” Edward told me. “We had some back and forth, before Ivy ended up connecting me with Ruth Amundsen. It was about a year before Ruth was able to come visit, to see if this was something that she could do. I arranged for her to do a public talk on solar here at the community library.” After seeing Ruth speak at the library and having her over to see their home, Edward and James decided to move forward with adding panels.

Ruth, an accomplished solar advocate from Norfolk, would ultimately help guide Edward and James through their solar journey: connecting them to an installer (Tiger Solar, based out of Charlottesville) before financing the panels herself through a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the couple.

Through their PPA, Edward and James would pay Ruth for the energy produced by the panels for a set period of time. As Ruth would keep rates steady, they would save money on energy bills throughout the length of the PPA and eventually have the opportunity to own the panels outright.

The PPA meant that Edward and James could access solar without taking on a large upfront cost. It also meant that they would start to see savings almost as soon as the panels came online.

That time would come in the summer of 2024, after a quick two-day installation by Tiger Solar.

Rural practicality

Speaking about their decision to go solar, Edward says: “Rural people are practical first. Our first practical point was that it was a perfect roof. Then, after looking at Ruth’s numbers, we saw that she was going to be able to keep the rates steady. With data centers sucking up energy, the promise from Ruth that she would not raise the rates was the second practical point for us. She is the power company.”

Their third practical point was their plan to eventually add storage to their home system, providing energy resilience in the event of a power outage and furthering their energy independence. “If need be, if the grid goes down, we want to be able to still generate power,” James says about that point, adding that they are waiting for battery prices to go down before ultimately taking that step.

There were also the environmental benefits. In addition to the financial incentives to add solar, they wanted to do their part to help protect the environment. That became even more attractive when it became clear that they wouldn’t have to pay extra – they could switch to clean energy and actually save money by doing so.

Go solar

I visited Edward and James at their home recently to discuss their experiences with residential solar. I too, turning the corner and seeing the house for the first time, was struck by how natural the panels looked on their roof.

For Edward and James, going solar had been smooth; when asked what the biggest surprise had been, their answer was how quickly the installers were able to complete the project. And how light the panels were: “They’re big, but not heavy.”

The simple rooftop solar installation now produces 4800 kwh/year, covering almost all of their annual energy needs. It’s only in the dead of winter that they have to pull in additional power from Dominion. Asked if they would do it all over again, the answer came easily for James: “Yes. We really didn’t have to do a lot.”

If you are interested in pursuing your own solar journey, Edward and James just recommend that you find the right person. Somebody who will listen to your specific needs and be a responsive and dependable solar partner. For them, finding Ruth was what helped to set them on the right path. It also helped that she was a Virginia-local, versus a national company, Edward says. “[With out-of-state companies] if there’s a problem, how am I ever going to solve it? That’s that rural practicality.”

For Edward and James, making the decision to add solar panels to their home was based on practical considerations first: they could add the panels to their roof, build energy resiliency, and help do their part to protect the environment, all while saving money on their electric bills. Who could say no to a deal that good?

Sierra Club petitioned the Sixth Circuit to review the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) decision granting Michigan’s request to ease air-pollution restrictions in the Detroit metro area.

The EPA’s compliance ruling came after excluding June 2022 testing data, based on elevated ozone readings it claimed were caused by neighboring Canadian wildfires.

Sierra Club argued the exclusion was arbitrary and that Detroit met federal ozone standards only because the data was removed.

The panel disagreed with Friday’s opinion, finding ample evidence supported the EPA’s “exceptional-event” request.

Specifically, findings of brown carbon at the Detroit testing site on the two days air samples were collected were indicative of wildfire smoke, despite the Sierra Club’s claim that the state cherry-picked its sampling data.

“The evidence Michigan provided was extensive, consisting of a comparison of the June 24 and 25 exceedances with historical concentrations, figures showing the progression of smoke plumes over North America using satellite imagery, calculations of trajectories originating from the largest fire sites … and a matching-day analysis,” Senior U.S. Circuit Judge Helene White said.

White, a George W. Bush appointee, also rejected Sierra Club’s claim that Detroit met ozone standards only because the pandemic reduced auto traffic.

She noted ozone levels actually rose from 2019 to 2020 and agreed with the EPA that Detroit’s gains stemmed from lasting state measures, including tighter nitrogen oxide controls and lower-evaporation gasoline.

But the panel sided with Sierra Club on one point, granting its request to revoke Detroit’s attainment status because the region failed to comply with required reasonably available control technology (RACT) standards.

The decision rested on the timing of Michigan’s attainment application and the specific wording of the legislation, both of which White analyzed in her opinion.

Michigan sought attainment status for Detroit in January 2022, but the EPA reclassified the region as “moderate” nonattainment in February 2023.

That reclassification came with updated RACT requirements, which Sierra Club said the state and city failed to meet — even as the EPA approved Detroit’s attainment status in May 2023.

The EPA argued RACT compliance should be measured as of the application date, but the appeals court rejected that view.

Its decision was based in no small part on the use of the present-perfect tense phrase “has met” in the statutory language.

“Congress elected to use the present-perfect ‘has met,’ which ‘denotes past action with an abiding effect or continuing relevance’ and not ’noncontinuing compliance,’” White said. “Accordingly, the phrase ‘has met’ requires that all applicable requirements must be met until the date of redesignation.”

The agency pushed back, arguing the tense could be a way for Congress to stress the importance of past events — such as achieving air quality attainment standards — but the panel determined that interpretation would render the word “has” meaningless.

“The statute clearly contemplates escalating requirements even when a state has submitted a request to redesignate an area to attainment. The nonattainment scheme in the CAA adjusts an area’s obligations based on its failure to comply with the statute’s deadline for achieving attainment.

“It is the state’s failure to meet the deadline, not a finding that the state’s air quality has worsened, that triggers a bump-up in the CAA requirements. When a state fails to meet its deadline, it is bumped up, and the stricter requirements go into effect,” White said.

Michigan cannot skirt the deadline requirement, according to the panel, and its failure to submit a revised improvement plan that properly implements RACT requirements precludes the City of Detroit from attaining attainment status.

Senior U.S. Circuit Judge R. Guy Cole Jr., an appointee of Bill Clinton, and U.S. Circuit Judge Stephanie Dawkins Davis, an appointee of Joe Biden, also sat on the panel.

The EPA said it is reviewing the decision.

Other jurisdictions, like the United States, have put in place similar requirements that green claims be grounded in evidence from relevant scientific fields or verifiable criteria.
The government has the option of strengthening the law, Montgomery and other greenwashing experts have argued, instead of repealing parts of it.
In a 2024 survey by Angus Reid Forum, commissioned by Greenpeace Canada, 93 per cent of Canadians agreed companies should face penalties for making unproven environmental claims.","Prime Minister Mark Carney’s government says it’s paring back parts of Canada’s anti-greenwashing law after hearing from fossil fuel companies and other groups that their “good-faith efforts” to protect the environment are going unadvertised.

The changes, proposed in Carney’s Nov. 4 budget, are meant to address what his government says is a “trend” of companies staying silent about their environmental efforts out of fears of running afoul of the law, according to a statement sent to The Narwhal from Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada.

Greenwashing is when companies make misleading claims about the eco-friendliness of their products or actions, making their environmental stewardship appear greater than it is. Lawmakers added the anti-greenwashing provisions to the federal Competition Act last year in part to address the issue of companies advertising that they were headed toward net-zero emissions while not presenting evidence showing they were taking any significant steps toward cutting their carbon pollution.

But now, the government believes companies are “withholding information that could aid in attracting investment for green innovation,” a departmental spokesperson said. Carney’s budget claimed the anti-greenwashing law, brought in under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, was leading to “some parties slowing or reversing efforts to protect the environment.”

When asked by The Narwhal, the federal department couldn’t name any specific examples of companies slow-walking genuine environmental efforts as a result of last year’s legal changes, which deal specifically with marketing unsubstantiated green claims rather than environmental action itself.

One expert says any legal risks are being massively exaggerated. Wren Montgomery, cofounder of the Greenwash Action Lab and professor at the Ivey Business School at Western University, believes awareness of how to comply with the law is already fairly widespread — and the companies still complaining may simply want to avoid being held accountable for their lack of climate action.

“The only lawyers I’ve heard complain about it are the lawyers actually working in these corporations,” Montgomery said. “So it seems either just that [corporate lawyers] are too thinly spread, and don’t really understand competition law or sustainability reporting very well, or that they’re using it as an excuse.”

The government’s remarks come on the heels of a Nov. 16 open letter released by Clean50, a collective of sustainability leaders, and signed by 144 of its members in business, academia, politics and the environmental sector calling on Carney to do more to tackle the climate crisis — including reversing plans laid out in the budget to dismantle some of Canada’s anti-greenwashing rules.

The letter states that it’s the Carney government’s proposed changes to the law, rather than the law itself, that will undermine investor confidence and harm Canadian entrepreneurs who had already adapted to the changes.

“Renewed greenwashing can distort competition and act as a barrier to entry to genuine green firms or drive them from the market,” the letter reads.

It also comes as Canada signs on to an international pledge to combat climate disinformation, committing to “equitable access to accurate, consistent, evidence-based and understandable information on climate change.”

The Carney government’s concerns about the law revolve around a requirement added to Canada’s Competition Act last year for businesses to back up their environmental claims with evidence that conforms to internationally recognized standards for calculating a company’s carbon footprint.

The budget argued the requirement to adhere to internationally recognized standards, as well as another rule allowing private individuals or organizations to bring greenwashing complaints before a tribunal, were “creating investment uncertainty” and “having the opposite of the desired effect.” It proposed getting rid of both rules, while keeping the base requirement for businesses to substantiate their environmental claims.

The federal Competition Bureau, which enforces fair competition in the marketplace, says deceptive marketing about environmental efforts can lead to a distorted playing field where Canadian consumers make ill-informed choices with their money. A spokesperson for the Competition Bureau said they were aware of the Carney government’s proposed changes to the law, but declined an interview request from The Narwhal.

In Canada, voluntary disclosure standards for including environmental risk in financial statements, developed based on internationally recognized criteria, refer to a framework called the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Other jurisdictions, like the United States, have put in place similar requirements that green claims be grounded in evidence from relevant scientific fields or verifiable criteria.

In June, the bureau issued guidelines for organizations navigating Canada’s anti-greenwashing rules, saying it would accept any carbon accounting standard recognized in at least two countries.

Montgomery said consultants and lawyers who have been working on sustainability reporting have told her they were already aware of what green accounting standards to use, or were already incorporating them into their work. She said it was important to stick to internationally recognized standards because of the risk of the industry using third-party certification methods that could prove dubious.

The government has the option of strengthening the law, Montgomery and other greenwashing experts have argued, instead of repealing parts of it. Ottawa could change the language around the use of standards, the experts said, such as removing the “international” requirement or specifying precisely which standards to use.

Suspending the third-party right of action until those changes were made, rather than canceling it permanently, would be a way to provide clarity without stripping away the law’s purpose, they added.

The government’s concerns over uncertainty in the law echo complaints lodged by large oil and gas companies in Canada last year, many of which said the anti-greenwashing provisions had introduced significant “uncertainty” and that the requirement to adhere to the standards in presenting their information was “vague” or “overreaching.”

The Narwhal asked the office of Industry Minister Mélanie Joly if it could name any examples of companies or organizations that were slowing or reversing genuine environmental efforts as a result of the law.

A departmental spokesperson, Andréa Daigle, responded that the government had heard from “numerous stakeholders across various sectors of the economy” that they felt unable to report on environmental achievements but did not discuss the impact of those efforts.

The fossil fuel industry, as well as other businesses, civil society and government-run groups, had “regularly raised what they and their legal counsel considered an unacceptable risk in making public statements” when it was unclear what standards to use for backing them up, Daigle said.

“This has resulted in a trend … of withholding information that could aid in attracting investment for green innovation and informing consumers about good-faith efforts,” she said.

The goal of paring down the law was to “ease fears of heavy enforcement that could discourage companies from speaking up, while ensuring they remain accountable for showing their claims are genuine.”

Last year, an official at Environment and Climate Change Canada told the Competition Bureau that “uncertainty” around the anti-greenwashing law “has led to some challenges” in encouraging companies to voluntarily adopt net-zero commitments under a government-run program.

At the same time, the department said it was “reasonable” to expect companies to come up with an environmental plan backed by “credible elements” that includes carbon accounting “based on international methodology,” as required by law.

Others at the time said the law seemed fine. The Canadian Renewable Energy Association, for example, said it supported the rules and would “strongly encourage” the adoption of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol as the internationally recognized standard of choice.

In a 2024 survey by Angus Reid Forum, commissioned by Greenpeace Canada, 93 per cent of Canadians agreed companies should face penalties for making unproven environmental claims.

This week, we hear from Hud Mellencamp on why he and his father, John Mellencamp, have joined forces with a grassroots movement of concerned citizens, environmental advocates, odd bedfellows and local officials to halt potentially destructive and harmful methods of land management in the public forests of the Hoosier state. That’s coming up later in the program.

Pike Township Residents Push Back Against Proposed Data Center in Urban Forest

Another week, another data center controversy in Indiana. Residents of Pike Township have joined the chorus of Hoosier communities actively speaking out against a proposed data center that would replace what’s currently a lush urban forest.

According to WRTV, American Tower—which already owns property where a 1,000-foot-tall broadcast tower is located—is proposing a rezoning that would allow construction of a 20,000 square foot data center on the site. Members of Protect Pike Township warn that removing this large swath of trees and forested area would lead to increased flood risk and destroy an important barrier against air pollution. The added use of backup diesel-fueled generators raises concerns about emissions and corresponding air quality impacts.

This is yet another instance of Indiana becoming a prime location for data centers, with developers taking advantage of affordable property and underdeveloped areas. The proposed rezoning will be considered by the City-County Council next week.

More Indiana Counties Enact Data Center Moratoriums Amid Growing Local Concerns

Some Indiana counties are getting ahead of these fights with data center moratoriums. A White County, a community just north of Lafayette, became the latest Indiana region to resist data center development, approving a moratorium after months of public opposition and uncertainty surrounding a proposed project.

The decision means White, Marshall, and Putnam counties have all put the brakes on data center development while they figure out what these projects could mean for local water supplies, land use, and infrastructure. In White County specifically, the moratorium came after a developer asked to rezone nearly 300 acres near Wolcott—a request that kept getting delayed as public opposition mounted.

These interactions are creating real tension between local control and state economic policy. Indiana passed tax breaks in 2019 to attract data center companies, and state officials keep promoting these facilities as crucial for competing in the AI economy. But many rural communities aren’t convinced—they’re worried about whether their water systems and power grids can handle it.

In recent years, 80% of Indiana counties have blocked wind or solar energy projects. Now data centers are becoming the next battleground in the same fight: who gets to decide what kind of development happens in local communities?

For now, these moratoriums give counties breathing room to study the impacts before making permanent decisions. But as more communities push back, the threat of state legislators eventually stepping in to take away local authority remains a reality.

Massachusetts Moves Forward on Climate Education with New Funding and Advisory Council

Massachusetts took a significant step forward for climate education last week when a key legislative committee advanced three bills that would bring climate science into classrooms across the state.

Two bills, Senate Bill 391 and the identical House Bill 560, would establish a trust fund to support climate education, prioritizing underserved communities and those disproportionately affected by climate change. The state’s education commissioner, working with a new Climate Literacy Advisory Council, could use the fund to develop lesson materials, support teacher training, and help districts share best practices. Senate Bill 410 would add “climate science and climate solutions” to the list of topics the state board of education is allowed to include in their standards.

Massachusetts joins a handful of other states making headway to a more informed and prepared next generation, but Massachusetts is taking a slightly different approach by creating a dedicated fund and advisory council rather than just mandating the topics. The idea is to give teachers real resources and support, not just add more requirements without tools and training.

If passed, Massachusetts would join a small but growing number of states recognizing the significance of taking an interdisciplinary approach and prioritizing communities that need support most. The bills are with the respective House and Senate Ways and Means Committees.

Australia Passes Sweeping Environmental Reforms to Protect Nature and Economy

In a time when environmental protections seem under constant threat, Australia just delivered some genuinely hopeful news—and it shows that ambitious environmental reform is still possible when leaders choose to lead.

Australia’s parliament recently passed sweeping reforms to their Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, overhauling environmental laws that had long been criticized as outdated and lackluster. According to Australian Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek, these reforms prove that protecting nature and growing the economy don’t have to be opposing forces.

Minister Plibersek explained that Australia’s old system was actually failing on both fronts—the environment wasn’t being protected, biodiversity was in systemic decline, and the messy, slow approval process was undermining economic productivity. Australia simply couldn’t afford environmental planning decisions that were duplicative and based on incomplete information.

The reforms create clear national standards defining what environmental impacts are “unacceptable” and must be avoided. They establish an independent national EPA to build integrity into decision-making and reduce political interference. And crucially, they write into law something profound: that environmental protection and biodiversity conservation necessarily underpin everything else—the economy, jobs, public health—and therefore must have primacy.

Plibersek called these reforms “an unprecedented bequest to future generations” which may be the most important takeaway for those of us watching from across the world. When the political will exists, it’s possible to design systems that protect nature while supporting economic transition and job creation. Australia just proved that environmental protection and economic prosperity can reinforce each other.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on EOSE. Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc.'s share was trading at $13.61 as of December 1st.

The rapid rise in industrial battery demand is being driven not by green energy sentiment, but by the physics of power generation and consumption. Renewable sources like wind and solar generate electricity intermittently, often out of sync with demand peaks, while growing urban centers and AI-driven data centers are straining aging power grids. Rather than investing billions in new transmission lines, large-scale battery storage has become the more efficient solution — transforming renewables into reliable, dispatchable energy.

Following the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, energy storage evolved into a standalone, government-supported industry with tax incentives and “made in America” mandates, creating fertile ground for new market leaders. Eos Energy (EOSE) has emerged as a key beneficiary, producing zinc-based, water-electrolyte batteries that are nonflammable, cost-effective, and ideally suited for stationary use. The company’s systems now anchor the intersection of renewable energy, grid stability, and industrial power demand.

The inflection point came in 2024, when the AI boom dramatically increased grid loads and triggered a race for energy storage capacity. With substantial production and investment tax credits — up to $45 per kilowatt-hour — Eos can directly monetize tens of millions per gigawatt-hour of output through 2029, making domestic manufacturing financially viable.

Additionally, FEOC restrictions excluding Chinese components have accelerated demand for U.S.-made systems, giving Eos a competitive advantage as it sources over 90% of its materials domestically. With a 232% year-to-date stock gain, Eos stands at the center of America’s new energy and digital infrastructure buildout, supported by powerful structural tailwinds.

Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Microvast Holdings, Inc. (MVST) by Crazerz in January 2025, which highlighted its profitability, undervaluation, and growth from solid-state battery innovation. The company’s stock has appreciated approximately by 64.25% since our coverage as the thesis played out with stronger margins. The Edge of Power shares a similar view but focuses on grid-scale energy storage as the next growth catalyst.

Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 21 hedge fund portfolios held EOSE at the end of the second quarter which was 21 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of EOSE as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

The U.S. Department of Energy has approved an $8.6 million grant that will allow the nation’s first utility-led geothermal heating and cooling network to double in size.

Gas and electric utility Eversource Energy completed the first phase of its geothermal network in Framingham, Massachusetts, in 2024. Eversource is a corecipient of the award along with the city of Framingham and HEET, a Boston-based nonprofit that focuses on geothermal energy and is the lead recipient of the funding.

Geothermal networks are widely considered among the most energy-efficient ways to heat and cool buildings. The federal money will allow Eversource to add approximately 140 new customers to the Framingham network and fund research to monitor the system’s performance.

The federal funding was first announced in December 2024 under the Biden administration. However, the contract between HEET and the Department of Energy was not finalized until Sept. 30 and was just announced Wednesday. The agreement, which allows construction to move forward, comes as the Trump administration is clawing back billions of dollars in clean energy funding, including hundreds of millions of dollars in Massachusetts.

“This award is an opportunity and a responsibility to clearly demonstrate and quantify the growth potential of geothermal network technology,” Zeyneb Magavi, HEET’s executive director, wrote in a statement.

The existing system provides heating and cooling to approximately 140 residential and commercial customers in the western suburb of Boston. The network taps low-temperature thermal energy from dozens of boreholes drilled several hundred feet below ground, where temperatures remain steady at 55 degrees Fahrenheit. A network of pipes circulates water through the boreholes to each building, enabling electric heat pumps to provide additional heating or cooling as needed.

“By harnessing the natural heat from the earth, we are taking a significant step toward increasing our energy independence and promoting abundant local energy sources,” Charlie Sisitsky, Framingham’s mayor, wrote.

Progress on the project is a further indicator that despite their opposition to wind and solar, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress appear to back geothermal energy.

President Donald Trump issued an executive order on his first day in office declaring an energy emergency that expressed support for a limited mix of energy resources, including fossil fuels, nuclear power, biofuels, hydropower, and geothermal energy.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Republicans and signed by Trump in July, quickly phases out tax credits for wind, solar, and electric vehicles. However, the bill left geothermal heating and cooling tax credits approved under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 largely intact.

A reorganization of the Department of Energy announced last month eliminated the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy but kept the office for geothermal energy as part of the newly created Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office.

“The fact that geothermal is on this administration’s agenda is pretty impactful,” said Nikki Bruno, vice president for thermal solutions and operational services at Eversource. “It means they believe in it. It’s a bipartisan technology.”

Plans for the expansion project call for roughly doubling Framingham’s geothermal network capacity at approximately half the cost of the initial buildout. Part of the estimated cost savings will come from using existing equipment rather than duplicating it.

“You’ve already got all the pumping and control infrastructure installed, so you don’t need to build a new pump house,” said Eric Bosworth, a geothermal expert who runs the consultancy Thermal Energy Insights. Bosworth oversaw the construction of the initial geothermal network in Framingham while working for Eversource.

The network’s efficiency is anticipated to increase as it grows, requiring fewer boreholes to expand. That improvement is due to the different heating and cooling needs of individual buildings, which increasingly balance each other out as the network expands, Magavi said.

The project still awaits approval from state regulators, with Eversource aiming to start construction by the end of 2026, Bruno said.

“What we’re witnessing is the birth of a new utility,” Magavi said. Geothermal networks “can help us address energy security, affordability and so many other challenges.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/canary_media_articles_453/ae64d2af69eba3db87c08734364e54bc,N,,2025-12-05 20:00:17.859787

The study argues choice for data centers isn’t between revenue or curtailment, but rather between revenue or waiting in line.
By accessing the grid three years earlier via flexible interconnection, a single data center site stands to generate between $2.3 billion and $3.2 billion in additional earnings.
On the consumer side, the report attempts to temper fears of cost-shifting, arguing that under the proposed framework, a data center covers between 96% and 100% of the incremental system costs required to serve it.
Flexible connection avoids the need for peak capacity buildout, which saves around $78 million per gigawatt of data center load in system costs, the report found.","Federal regulators, tasked with building a framework to allow data centers to connect to the grid more quickly, are grappling with the question of whether large loads that agree to be curtailed should get expedited access.

A new analysis published this week, sponsored by Google, offers a potential blueprint for a tariff structure that would do just that, its authors argue — while also neutralizing the risk of shifting costs to ratepayers.

The report, conducted by grid orchestration platform Camus Energy, transmission modeling firm Encoord, and Princeton University’s ZERO Lab, uses real transmission data from an anonymized utility in PJM to model hourly constraints at six hypothetical 500 megawatt data center sites.

While many early iterations of flexible interconnection tariffs offer a binary, either firm or non-firm service, the report models a third option: data centers that receive a mix of firm (uninterruptible) and “conditional firm” (or curtailable) grid service. In that scenario, the data center must bring enough accredited capacity to cover its uninterruptible load — through power purchase agreements, virtual power plants, or onsite power — while agreeing to manage the demand of its “conditional firm” load during grid constraints.

The modeling found that accepting a flexible interconnection agreement could get those theoretical data centers online three to five years faster than under the existing interconnection process for inflexible load. The “reliability sacrifice” required across the study’s sites was minimal; grid power was available for more than 99% of all hours in the year. Bridging the remaining gap required dispatching backup sources for between 40 and 70 hours annually.

Responding to risk

The white paper also offers a counterargument to the skepticism raised by the PJM market monitor and others, that data centers are unlikely to curtail voluntarily because the revenue generated by their compute load vastly outweighs any grid penalty or payment.

The study argues choice for data centers isn’t between revenue or curtailment, but rather between revenue or waiting in line. By accessing the grid three years earlier via flexible interconnection, a single data center site stands to generate between $2.3 billion and $3.2 billion in additional earnings.

Data centers are inherently incentivized to adopt the “buy capacity to connect now” approach, despite the up front cost, the study found, because that massive revenue gain easily covers the lifecycle cost of the on-site batteries or generators needed to make flexibility physically reliable. In short, flexibility is the only profitable path through the queue.

On the consumer side, the report attempts to temper fears of cost-shifting, arguing that under the proposed framework, a data center covers between 96% and 100% of the incremental system costs required to serve it.

Flexible connection avoids the need for peak capacity buildout, which saves around $78 million per gigawatt of data center load in system costs, the report found. On top of that, the BYOC arrangement requires the data center to procure its own accredited capacity for its firm load, effectively removing that demand from the general market pool so it doesn’t drive up capacity clearing prices for other ratepayers.

But the report relies on a few foundational assumptions that flexibility critics warn may not align with the realities of the grid. For one thing, while the study proves that data centers can technically afford to be flexible without losing uptime, it leaves open the question of whether they will comply during a true emergency.

Another challenge, as Aurora Energy Research Head of USA East Julia Hoos explained during a recent Latitude Dispatch, is that site-specific flexibility, as modeled in the report, doesn’t account for complex knock-on effects. Taking a large generator or load offline can redirect the power flow all across PJM, potentially requiring transmission upgrades in entirely different parts of the footprint, Hoos explained.

FERC parallels

The hybrid solution the study proposes is closely aligned with what sponsor Google and other hyperscalers are advocating to FERC, as part of the large load interconnection proceeding kicked off by the Department of Energy earlier this fall.

The first round of filings in FERC’s docket show widespread support for fast-tracking flexible large loads, said Camus CEO Astrid Atkinson. “Specific comments from National Grid, Google, Microsoft, Constellation, Open AI, Critical Loop, and others are well aligned with the flexible connection and/or [bring your own] capacity approaches,” she added.

Broadly, the docket reflects a “growing convergence of opinion among diverse stakeholders that flexible load capabilities should be leveraged to bridge the gap between immediate interconnection needs and the longer timelines required for traditional transmission upgrades,” she added.

Google, for its part, urged FERC to approve expedited interconnection for loads that volunteer to be flexible and bring their own generation, which could be either onsite or “electrically proximate.”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-12-05T115514.497.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 19:02:47.530123

But Hochul earlier this year backpedaled on her administration’s plans for a New York carbon market, citing affordability concerns.
‘Cap and invest’ New York was well on the way toward a carbon market just a few years ago.
New York would be only the third state with a statewide carbon market.
“There is robust evidence that by moving forward with a well-designed cap and invest program, the governor can actually be cutting costs for working families in New York,” she said.","The era of grand climate promises has given way to a new period for New York and other states: grappling with executing them.

Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, announced a long-awaited climate rule this week that will force companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions, but with one significant omission from earlier plans: the rollout of a cap-and-trade-style program that Hochul herself had initiated, writes my colleague Anne Mulkern.

The new reporting requirement, beginning in the summer of 2027, will make New York the third U.S. state to require top polluters to report their greenhouse gas output. But Hochul earlier this year backpedaled on her administration’s plans for a New York carbon market, citing affordability concerns. Its fate is now embroiled in litigation.

A similar gap between making climate promises and implementing policies to achieve them emerged at the United Nations’ COP30 climate conference in Brazil last month. And politicians all over are shifting from climate to cost-of-living issues as they talk about the broader economy, electricity prices and the tech industry’s unlimited appetite for energy.

Look no further than Tom Steyer, notes my colleague Noah Baustin. The billionaire environmentalist, who made a name for himself on the national political stage as a climate activist, pointedly announced he is running for California governor in a video last month without mentioning climate once.

‘Cap and invest’

New York was well on the way toward a carbon market just a few years ago.

In 2023, the state released a draft road map for how a statewide cap-and-trade market, which the state calls “cap-and-invest,” would work. A carbon market was seen as critical to delivering on the state’s 2019 climate law, which mandates an 85 percent cut to greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and a 100 percent zero-emission grid by 2040.

New York would be only the third state with a statewide carbon market. California and Washington state both run economywide carbon markets, while Oregon operates one that’s smaller in scope.

The cap-and-trade fight isn’t over for New York. Last month, a state judge ruled that Hochul’s administration had violated the 2019 climate law by not launching the carbon market. The court gave the state Department of Environmental Conservation until February to release an emissions-cutting rule. Hochul’s administration is appealing the ruling.

After the October court decision, Hochul defended her position as one about affordability: “My job is to ensure we have enough power to keep the lights on, keep rates affordable, and attract major economic development projects.”

Kate Courtin, the Environmental Defense Fund’s senior manager for state climate policy, disputes the notion that energy costs and a program designed to ratchet down emissions can’t be reconciled.

“There is robust evidence that by moving forward with a well-designed cap and invest program, the governor can actually be cutting costs for working families in New York,” she said.

Communities struggle with loss of EPA grants

Low-income communities that lost Environmental Protection Agency grants are wondering how to move forward on projects meant to protect their residents from vulnerabilities, Jean Chemnick writes.

Among the 105 recipients of EPA’s Community Change Grants Program awards is Kipnuk, a Native Alaskan settlement that had received $20 million to shore up a river bank that threatened the community. It was decimated in an October storm, and while it’s not known if the grant could have saved the village, its leaders don’t know how or if they can find another source of funding.

Trump canceled all 105 awards earlier this year, though recipients continue to challenge the decision.

“It’s been very difficult to work as long and as hard as we did and then to just have it jerked out from under you,” said Dorothy Darr, executive director of the North Carolina-based nonprofit Southwest Renewal Foundation of High Point, which lost an $18.4 million award to fix the city’s leaking sewer pipes.

Conservatives sound alarm on permitting bill

Members of the House Freedom Caucus are objecting to parts of a big permitting overhaul bill that Republican leaders had hoped to hold a vote on next week, Kelsey Brugger writes.

The bill from House Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) had a bipartisan amendment added in committee meant to protect permits. That was in response to the Trump administration’s attacks on renewable energy projects that had already been approved. And that has frustrated members like Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas).

“I don’t want to fast-track any of the wind and solar. It’s still not a neutral playing field because it’s subsidized,” said Roy, who also unsuccessfully pushed for the immediate repeal of renewable energy tax credits in the megalaw that Trump signed in July.

“The last thing we need to do with offshore wind is to tie the administration’s hands in stopping that ridiculously expensive source of energy that enriches foreign companies with American taxpayer dollars,” said Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.).

Two Central Valley residents have been recognized for their leadership in advancing the state’s clean energy goals.

On Dec. 4, the California Energy Commission held its 2025 Clean Energy Hall of Fame Awards ceremony at the California Natural Resources Agency (CNRA) Auditorium, honoring local leaders making significant contributions to help the state achieve a 100% clean energy future.

Award recipients for the 6th annual event include Judith Gomez, coordinator for Climate Action Pathways for Schools (CAPS) in Porterville, who took home the Youth Game-Changer award.

Cassandra Little, CEO of the Metro Black Chamber of Commerce in Fresno, won the Clean Energy Champion award.

Through her work with CAPS, Gomez helped reduce energy costs and a greenhouse emissions by 80% for seven local schools, designed high-efficiency lighting strategies for 21 schools throughout the Porterville Unified School District and participated in securing a $5.8 million Department of Energy grant to support energy efficiency upgrades for Porterville Unified.

Little is recognized for making transportation more sustainable, community owned and accessible in the Central Valley.

She helped the chamber launch the Fresno area’s first Clean Shared Mobility Network, which operates a fleet of 40 electric vehicles and 200 e-bikes in under resourced neighborhoods.

Little also created programs such as Van-Werx, an on-demand and EV van service and Betting Big, a capital and mentorship initiative for minority-owned clean energy startups.

She also developed a 2-week EV Accelerator to train entrepreneurs and small business owners in clean mobility innovation and mentor new leaders in the energy justice space.",https://thebusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/van-werx-e1741387897916.png,N,,2025-12-05 19:02:34.163892

Despite PCEF’s evolution, the program has kept dedicated funding available for nonprofits working on climate projects.
Another $25 million will be split roughly equally among projects dedicated to transportation decarbonization ($8.1 million) climate workforce development ($9.3 million), and regenerative agriculture/green infrastructure ($7.5 million).","It’s been a tough year for climate work around the country, with the Trump administration slashing funding for programs intended to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate the threats of the climate crisis. But Portland has a secret weapon for local environmental action: The Portland Clean Energy Community Benefits Fund, also known as PCEF. To date, the fund has allocated $1.71 billion in grants for climate projects. This year, the fund is set to dole out more than $60 million for climate projects in its latest round of grants to nonprofits.

The funding will help pay for 59 nonprofit-led projects addressing a range of climate issues, from energy efficiency in homes to transportation emissions. The funding is prioritized for projects targeting low-income communities and Portlanders of color, who are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

The city has calculated the grant-funded projects will result in a lifetime reduction of roughly 76,200 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. That’s about equal to the carbon emissions generated in one year by roughly 17,770 gas-powered cars. However, PCEF leaders say the project benefits to Portlanders extend beyond greenhouse gas reduction, with anticipated benefits including improved indoor air quality, connection to living-wage jobs, and access to high-quality, fresh foods.

""Together, these community-led projects demonstrate the power of collective action to advance the City's climate goals while creating lasting benefits for Portland's communities,” PCEF Program Manager Sam Baraso said in a press release.

PCEF was approved by voters as a 2018 ballot measure. The program, which is funded by a 1 percent tax on large retailers in Portland, was initially dedicated primarily to funding climate projects via grants to nonprofit organizations. But PCEF raked in significantly more money than initially anticipated. While early estimates calculated PCEF would generate $40 to $60 million annually, it’s currently raising about $200 million a year. As its funding capacity increased, so did its scope.

PCEF now provides funding to public agencies for large-scale climate projects. The fund has also been used to backfill budget shortfalls within the city’s own bureaus, as long as the money is used for projects that can be tied to carbon reduction or environmental justice goals. The decision to allow financially-constrained bureaus to tap into PCEF has been controversial among the program’s leaders, who don’t want to water down the climate fund into the city’s all-purpose piggy bank. Their fears aren’t baseless: The Portland Police Association is currently supporting an effort to reroute 25 percent of PCEF revenue toward police hiring.

Despite PCEF’s evolution, the program has kept dedicated funding available for nonprofits working on climate projects. Last year, the fund allocated nearly $92 million in grants to local nonprofits. This year, the program will distribute roughly $64 million to 59 organizations. About half of the money, or $33.6 million, will be allocated to organizations for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. Another $25 million will be split roughly equally among projects dedicated to transportation decarbonization ($8.1 million) climate workforce development ($9.3 million), and regenerative agriculture/green infrastructure ($7.5 million). Most of the money will be given to organizations to implement projects, though a fraction of the grants are intended for planning future programming.

PCEF received 216 applications for grant funding, with requests totaling more than $260 million. Program leaders took the strong response as a reflection of how “local organizations have continued to strengthen their capacity and maintain their ambition in recent years.” In other words, there’s a lot of demand for climate funding, and despite the program’s financial windfall, PCEF can’t meet it all.

The largest grants allocated in this cycle were two $4.9 million awards to the Williams and Russell Community Development Corporation (CDC) and Self Enhancement, Inc, both for energy efficiency projects. The former grant is for an energy-efficient Black business hub, intended to be an economic and community resource for the historically Black Albina district, while the second is meant for the construction of 31 net-zero emissions homes to address housing affordability and displacement in Northeast Portland.

Other notable projects include Earth Advantage, Inc’s plan to install 405 easy-install heat pumps in eligible affordable housing units across the city ($2.9 million), the Black American Chamber of Commerce’s plan to provide subsidies to small businesses for electric car purchases ($2 million), and Bike Bus PDX’s proposal to increase programming in support children biking to school together ($895,000).

Portland YouthBuilders was granted $1.5 million for a pre-apprenticeship program offering clean energy training and career development to 100 young adults from underserved communities,and the Columbia Land Trust was awarded nearly $1 million to provide landscaping services, trees, and plants to PCEF priority households and community spaces, enabling people and businesses to create backyard habitats that provide shade and capture stormwater, as well as providing habitat for wildlife.

The full list of grant awards is available here.

Applications were vetted by program staff and a review panel made up of PCEF committee volunteers, community representatives, and subject matter experts. City Administrator Michael Jordan ultimately approved the grant funding based on the recommendations.

This is a change from previous grant cycles, when the City Council was given the final say over the distribution of PCEF funds. While the Council’s approval was mostly seen as a formality, it gave PCEF leaders and grantees the opportunity to speak to city leaders in a public forum.

Councilor Steve Novick, who co-chairs the Climate and Sustainability Committee with Councilor Angelita Morillo, told the Mercury in theory, he’s fine with administrative staff taking over the PCEF grant approval process. Novick has been openly skeptical about the Council intervening in matters he considers administrative—for example, when a group of councilors moved to reject the recommendations of city staff and advisory bodies to overturn a slate of Portland Children’s Levy grants.

Novick said he thinks the City Council should be tasked with adopting broad initiatives, such as the Climate Investment Plan that guides PCEF’s investments, and let administrative staff take over the details.

“It doesn't make sense for Council to approve individual grants or even the slate of grants for a year,” Novick said. “There’s a process for awarding community grants that the Council is not involved with in a detailed way, and I think that’s the way it should work.”

But moving the process completely behind the scenes may limit opportunities for discussion and engagement between city leaders and residents. Novick said after looking through the latest slate of PCEF grants, he had some questions about the awards and how they were decided. Even if the City Council isn’t in charge of the decisions, Novick thinks it is in the councilors’ best interest to stay engaged with the program and how PCEF dollars are spent.

“I think in broad parameters, the Council is pretty well-informed [about PCEF], but that doesn't mean that there isn't room for us to be more engaged,” Novick said.

Novick said the Council’s engagement in PCEF is particularly important as the program faces threats from those who want to cash in on its earnings. He plans to look into opportunities for the Council’s Climate Committee to hear more from PCEF staff and grantees in a public forum.

“The amount of money we have in PCEF to spend on climate issues is far less than a reasonable society would be spending to address climate issues. The fact that it's bringing in more money than originally projected is a red herring,” Novick said. “But since we do want to be able to prove we’re getting the biggest bang for our buck, we should be constantly looking at that.”",https://media1.fdncms.com/portmerc/imager/u/large/48169524/eb068176-050d-483b-a8d8-95c5e2c29de1.webp,N,,2025-12-05 19:02:39.649883

This bipartisan bill would help make Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) more resilient by giving them the resources needed to install solar energy and energy storage systems.

“Federally Qualified Health Centers are a lifeline for families across the Central Valley, and we need to make sure they can stay open—even when emergencies happen,” said Congressman Valadao. “The CHARGE Act creates a new grant program to help FQHCs install reliable energy storage systems so they can keep serving patients without interruption. I’m proud to partner with Congressman Smith on this bipartisan effort to strengthen local healthcare and lower energy costs.”

“Community health centers are the backbone of care in underserved communities. Too many face dangerous gaps in power reliability during extreme weather or emergency situations,” said Congressman Smith. “The CHARGE Act is a smart and forward-looking investment that will help centers stay open, protect patients, and strengthen energy resilience across the country.”

“Community health centers are an essential part of the healthcare delivery system in rural and underserved regions across the country—especially here in the Central Valley. Central Valley Health Network applauds the leadership of Congressman Valadao and Smith in introducing the CHARGE Act of 2025, which will invest in improving healthcare in our communities while promoting renewable energy solutions,” said Jason Vega, Chief Executive Officer, Central Valley Health Network.

“When natural disasters and other grid-straining emergencies hit, solar and energy storage are critical to providing reliable power to those that need it most. We applaud Congressmen Smith and Valadao for championing this legislation which will enhance access to solar and storage for the Federally Qualified Community Health Centers working every day to provide essential care to communities across America,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, President and CEO, Solar Energy Industry Association (SEIA).

""Electricity powers every step of health care. When Community Health Centers lose power, diabetic patients miss visits, pregnant women miss prenatal care, children forgo vaccinations, and patients needing behavioral health services miss therapy. After Hurricane Helene alone, power outages caused more than 10,000 patient appointment cancellations in one state alone. The bipartisan CHARGE Act, led by US Representatives Adam Smith (D-WA) and David Valadao (R-CA) will help health centers deploy solar energy and battery storage systems so they can continue serving as lifelines for their communities during disasters,"" said Ben Money, SVP of Population Health, National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC).

“Ensuring clean, reliable, and safe energy technologies isn’t just smart policy—it’s a direct investment in the community health and the well-being of the diverse communities we serve,” said Healthpoint.

“We appreciate Rep. Smith’s work with community health centers to develop this program that advances clean energy goals, helps reduce long-term energy costs, and supports local renewable energy jobs,” said the Washington Association for Community Health.

The CHARGE Act would:

Establish a new grant program at the Department of Energy (DOE) to help Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) deploy solar energy systems and/or energy storage technologies.

Authorize $50 million per year to fund installation projects and technical assistance programs nationwide.

Allow broad participation by state and local governments, nonprofits, and a provider consortia or network that is majority owned or majority controlled by one of more FQHCs.

Support technical assistance to ensure that FQHCs can design, install, and operate these systems effectively and sustainably.

Background:

Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) are the backbone of the healthcare system in underserved communities—providing critical care, including preventative healthcare, vaccinations, and chronic disease management to more than 34 million Americans per year. Yet, too many of these centers lack the reliable, affordable, and sustainable power needed to maintain operations during grid disruptions, extreme weather, or emergencies. The CHARGE Act provides a targeted, fiscally responsible solution to ensure community health centers have access to clean, resilient power while reducing long-term energy costs and supporting local renewable energy jobs. This bipartisan proposal promotes energy resilience, community health security, and economic efficiency—all while empowering local stakeholders to determine the best solutions for their communities.

The solar-powered battery facility strengthens India’s EV supply chain by delivering three gigawatt-hours (GWh) of battery capacity each year through dedicated clean energy.

Octillion, the California-based electric vehicle (EV) battery manufacturer, has completed its transition to solar energy at one of its major production sites in India. The Pune factory opened in June 2023. It began its solar conversion in June 2024 and reached full solar operation by July 2025. Moreover, the shift took only 13 months. The company announced the achievement in a recent statement, highlighting its commitment to long-term sustainability.

The facility covers 8,200 square metres, roughly the size of two football pitches. It produces 3 GWh of battery capacity every year for India’s fast-growing EV market. Additionally, the rooftop solar system now generates about 545 MWh of clean electricity annually. This output meets the plant’s entire energy demand. Consequently, Octillion now manufactures all EV battery systems using renewable power.

The Pune site is the first of Octillion’s Indian factories to operate entirely on solar energy. It also supports the firm’s goal of achieving carbon-neutral operations across all India-based sites by 2027. Octillion plans to apply this model to its remaining factories. Therefore, each stage of the EV battery life cycle will follow a cleaner and more sustainable energy pathway.

Octillion’s switch to solar reflects a broader trend of captive solar projects across Pune and Maharashtra. For example, Tata Motors expanded its on-site solar generation by adding a 12 MWp plant. This addition raised the total capacity to about 20.7 MWp at the Pune commercial vehicle unit. Meanwhile, ŠKODA-VW installed an 8.5 MWp rooftop system at its Chakan plant. The installation now meets around 15% of the plant’s annual energy needs. Additionally, smaller manufacturers, such as SKF, have adopted rooftop systems to reduce costs and carbon emissions. Maharashtra has also exceeded 1 GW of domestic rooftop installations.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the project investments in third-generation nuclear power technology will help advance Trump administration goals outlined earlier this year to boost that energy source domestically—particularly to insure U.S. energy security and gain global artificial intelligence dominance. “Advanced light water SMRs will give our nation the reliable, round-the-clock power we need ... support data centers and AI growth, and reinforce a stronger, more secure electric grid,” he said.

The funding actually stems from a Biden-era solicitation released in October 2024 using 2021 federal infrastructure act funding that includes another $100 million to be awarded later this year to support more deployments and address barriers in design, licensing, supply chain and site readiness, said DOE. But the Trump administration revised the solicitation last spring to remove required community benefit financial investments by winners.

DOE funding will assist TVA to build the first two-unit, estimated 600-MW GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 SMR at its Clinch River site in Tennessee by the early 2030s and plan future deployments with partners Indiana Michigan Power and BWX Technologies. The TVA development team also includes contractors Bechtel and Ontario-based Aecon, Duke Energy, Oak Ridge Associated Universities and the Electric Power Research Institute.

TVA's construction permit application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the BWRX-300 at Clinch River, submitted in May, still is under agency review. “This award affirms TVA’s continued leadership in shaping the nation’s nuclear energy future,” said Don Moul, TVA president and CEO of the independent federal corporate agency that supplies power to 10 million people in most of Tennessee, northern Alabama, northeastern Mississippi, southwestern Kentucky and smaller areas of neighboring states.

“Unlike previous nuclear construction projects in the U.S., contractors will work with [GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy] and TVA as a highly integrated project team to plan, design and potentially procure, construct and commission Clinch River Unit 1.” Bechtel said in January. “The integrated project delivery model is the preferred method that will make our project a true team effort,” said Bob Deacy, TVA senior vice president and its Clinch River project leader. “We will actively work together toward a target budget and schedule – creating a significant advantage to drive nuclear innovation, share risks and reduce costs.”

TVA also has signed public-private partnerships with other SMR developers in recent months, including Kairos Power and NuScale, as well as with nuclear fusion developer Type One Energy. TVA said it currently has about 11 GW of requested load for AI and data centers across its area, including from Google, Meta and xAI.

TVA’s technology collaboration partner Ontario Power Generation has started construction of four GE Vernova BWRX-300 units, with the first to be online by 2030 at its Darlington power plant. The province approved construction plans and awarded a contract in May to a partnership between Aecon and Kiewit Nuclear Canada for construction planning and execution, and project management. Aecon said its share of the contract is worth about $930 million.

GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy and design-build firm Samsung C&T in October also announced a strategic alliance to advance BWRX-300 SMR deployment in markets outside North America.

Going Modular in Michigan

Holtec's funding will aid company plans to deploy its dual-unit SMR-300 reactors at the site of the 800-MW Palisades nuclear power plant it owns and also seeks to restart in January in Covert, Mich., adding an additional 600 MW. The developer also signed an expanded alliance agreement with Hyundai Engineering & Construction to build a 10-GW fleet of SMR-300s in North America through the 2030s, beginning with the Palisades project. The contractors will manage reactor construction, deployment, operation, supply chain and power selling. Project cost has been estimated at $2.1 billion to $2.7 billion per reactor.

“Targeting first power by 2030, our Mission 2030 initiative will position the Palisades SMR project as the reference plant for all future SMR-300 deployments—domestically and globally,” said Holtec.

Company founder, chairman & CEO Krishna Singh told attendees of an American Nuclear Society conference last month that the company's SMR-300 reactor ""was born the day after"" the 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant meltdown in Japan, but it did not win DOE funding at the time because of agency disagreement on its design. Holtec self-funded the project, Singh noted, and will submit its design next year to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for limited work authorization.

According to a Holtec statement, “DOE’s support is an essential enabler of the Palisades SMR-300 project, moving it from development to deployment by building on the government’s prior support"" under the agency's Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program dating to 2020.

Holtec also has a $1.52-billion conditional loan from DOE for the Palisades restart, although the action faces new litigation from anti nuclear groups that have sued the developer and the commission in federal court.

Gov. Bob Ferguson will permit a Swedish investment firm to build a solar and battery installation on about 2,000 acres of farmland in south-central Washington, despite opposition from the Yakama Nation.

The Carriger solar project will provide jobs and clean energy, Ferguson said Dec. 4. “This project is a win for our state,” he said in a statement

Cypress Creek Renewables, owned by Stockholm-based EQT Infrastructure, plans to install solar panels and batteries about 2 miles northeast of Goldendale in Klickitat County.

Yakima Nation

The installation will encroach on an annual food and medicine harvest, the Yakama Nation said in a statement. The tribe documented other negative impacts, but its concerns were dismissed by Ferguson, Yakima Nation Tribal Council Chairman Gerald Lewis said.

“It is alarming and bitterly discouraging to see that Gov. Ferguson is continuing former Gov. (Jay) Inslee’s approach to championing new industrial-scale, alternative-energy development at the expense of our land, our water, our wildlife and our sacred places,” Lewis said.

Ferguson last summer told the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council to consult with the tribe. He set a 60-day deadline to have a proposal on his desk.

The Yakama Nation sought further environmental study and formal hearings. But 60 days did not give EFSEC enough time for either. Cypress Creek must start construction by July 4 to qualify for federal tax credits, Ferguson noted. Although Washington is a “leader in climate policy,” it lags behind all other states in renewable energy growth, he said.

County opposed

Klickitat County commissioners also opposed the project. County residents said the project will mar views, take farmland and be a fire hazard. Ferguson addressed only the tribe’s concerns in his approval letter to EFSEC.

In the letter, Ferguson told EFSEC he expected the council to improve consultation with tribes.

EFSEC staff members consulted with the tribe and concluded the project will not significantly damage tribal culture.

Cypress Creek will plant vegetation or build berms to make panels and batteries less visible from roads. Cypress Creek also will give the tribe up to $100,000 over 10 years for archeological and history research.

The Yakama Nation proposed eliminating some solar panels. Cypress Creek said the tribe’s proposal would cut the installation’s power output by half and kill the project.

When the sun shines, the panels will generate up to 160 megawatts of power. The batteries will store 63 megawatts, according to Cypress Creek.

Carriger is the second major solar project approved over the objection of the Yakama Nation. The tribe says the Horse Heaven wind and solar project in Benton County will damage cultural sites.

In contrast, under “allowance for funds used during construction” accounting, ratepayers aren’t billed until the project comes online.
“Under CWIP, utilities face little pressure to control costs or timelines because every additional dollar spent and every month of delay expands their rate base and increases their guaranteed returns,” they said.
The Manhattan Institute report’s authors say utility regulators should stop allowing CWIP, adding that they have a range of options for limiting it to protect ratepayers.
FERC, for example, could make CWIP contingent on project developers meeting schedule and cost benchmarks, according to the brief.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Federal and state utility regulators should rein in the use of “construction work in progress” accounting to protect ratepayers from cost risks related to building energy infrastructure projects, according to an issue brief released Thursday by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank.

CWIP allows a utility to bill ratepayers for the cost of building a power plant, transmission line or other project as they are being built. In contrast, under “allowance for funds used during construction” accounting, ratepayers aren’t billed until the project comes online. This practice is preferable, even though it can cause ratepayer stickershock, the brief’s authors said.

The report — The Hidden Tax on Your Power Bill: Construction Work in Progress — comes as rising electricity bills have become a political issue in states like California, Connecticut and New Jersey.

Also, U.S. utilities are entering into an infrastructure-building super-cycle, with utilities preparing to spend $1.4 trillion from 2025 to 2030 to build out transmission and generation networks to meet demand from data centers. That spending would roughly double the amount utilities spent in the previous 10 years, Morningstar DBRS said in a report released in October.

The use of CWIP provides an incentive for utilities to “gold plate” projects and extend their construction timelines, according to the report’s authors.

“Under CWIP, utilities face little pressure to control costs or timelines because every additional dollar spent and every month of delay expands their rate base and increases their guaranteed returns,” they said. “Cost overruns become profit opportunities rather than financial penalties.”

The report’s authors — professors Eric Olson from the University of Tulsa, Jack Dorminey of West Virginia University, and Jason Walter from the University of Tulsa — pointed to Georgia Power’s majority-owned expansion of the Vogtle nuclear power plant as an example of how CWIP can affect ratepayers.

Georgia utility regulators approved the project in 2009 at a $14 billion estimated cost, but the two nuclear units started commercial service in 2023 and 2024 at a price tag of about $37 billion.

“Mounting construction setbacks from component redesigns, contractor bankruptcies, and pandemic-related labor shortages led to an explosion in the total price tag,” the authors said. “Rather than face punishment, Georgia Power was entitled to earn over 10% return on that growing sum each year because CWIP was already in the rate base. For management and shareholders, the mushrooming budget did not threaten the project’s profitability; it enhanced it.”

CWIP can make project financing less risky, and potentially less expensive, according to its proponents.

At the state level, the issue of how utilities recoup costs is usually decided by state regulators. But the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission allows transmission developers to use this accounting method as well, though not without controversy.

Mark Christie, then-FERC chair, opposed the use of CWIP as part of a suite of developer incentives he referred to as “FERC candy” in a dissent to the approval of such a package in May.

The CWIP Incentive, he wrote, “allows recovery of costs before a project has been put into service,” which runs the risk of making consumers “the bank” for the transmission developer.

“[B]ut, unlike a real bank, which gets to charge interest for the money it loans, under our existing incentives policies the consumer not only effectively ‘loans’ the money through the formula rates mechanism, but also pays the utility a profit, known as Return on Equity, or ‘ROE,’ for the privilege of serving as the utility’s de facto lender,” he said.

The Manhattan Institute report’s authors say utility regulators should stop allowing CWIP, adding that they have a range of options for limiting it to protect ratepayers.

FERC, for example, could make CWIP contingent on project developers meeting schedule and cost benchmarks, according to the brief. The agency could also include automatic clawback provisions to recover customer payments when projects are abandoned or there are cost overruns, they said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/3VrTrfpCRfPA4IVdVv94cZktPajry7m8VVEMz9k68EA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Vbml0LTQtbGlmdC1jYjIwXzEuanBlZw==.webp,N,,2025-12-05 19:02:50.789776

These places shape life in the Prairie State, providing habitat for a variety of species and offering us opportunities to hike, paddle, watch wildlife and cool off on hot summer days.

Environment Illinois’ mission is simple, we work to protect that natural world, and help Illinois’ nature and people both thrive. We research problems, build public support, and work to win policies that reduce pollution, protect habitat and keep our air and water clean.

In 2025, that meant advancing wetland protections, safeguarding our waterways, cutting harmful plastic waste, supporting clean energy and much more.

Working to protect wetlands and parks

Illinois’ wetlands filter pollution, mitigate flooding and provide critical habitat for migrating birds and other wildlife such as frogs, beavers and turtles.

Illinois has already lost around 90% of our historic wetlands, and these special places are too precious to lose. Yet, many of the state’s remaining wetlands lack strong safeguards. And a recent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rollback of federal protections leaves them even more at risk. After the proposed rule, more than 80% of wetlands nationwide no longer receive protection under the Clean Water Act.

Environment Illinois and our allies are calling for a statewide wetlands program to protect and recover these crucial places. Together, we delivered more than 6,500 petition signatures urging Gov. JB Pritzker to protect these disappearing habitats.

Additionally, during our “Protect Illinois Wetlands Week,” we highlighted how wetlands support wildlife, clean drinking water and provide flood protection by participating in an expert panel at the University of Illinois Chicago. At the event Environment Illinois staff, representatives from Shedd Aquarium, and other partners spoke about the importance of these wetlands, and why their protections should be strengthened, not weakened.

This year, we also celebrated a new state park endowment fund that will help maintain and improve parks such as Starved Rock State Park and the Cache River area. Gov. Pritzker emphasized that these spaces must be protected for future generations to enjoy, keeping the land preserved and giving Illinois residents more spaces to explore and cherish for years to come.

Keeping Lake Michigan and other waters safe for swimming

Illinoisans should be able to enjoy a day at Lake Michigan and other swimming spots without worrying about getting sick.

But the latest Great Lakes “Safe for Swimming?” report, released by our partners at Environment Illinois Research & Education Center, found that in 2024 about 71% of tested Great Lake beaches had at least one day when bacteria reached potentially unsafe levels.

Even more concerning, every tested Lake Michigan beach in Illinois had at least one such day in which swimmers faced higher risks of gastrointestinal illness, respiratory issues, ear and eye infections and skin rashes.

To help people stay safe, the report featured tools beachgoers can use to easily check for local closures and health advisories before they head to the water.

But testing and closures do little to stop the source of this pollution.

That’s why we’re also calling for stronger investments in wastewater and stormwater infrastructure. By upgrading aging sewers, fixing leaky pipes and building newer infrastructure to better absorb runoff, we can reduce the flow of sewage and polluted water into Lake Michigan and other waterways.

Together, we can work to ensure that Illinois shores, waterways and swimming holes are safe and clean for your next day cooling off in the water.

Tackling plastic waste

Plastic waste continues to threaten Illinois’ rivers, parks and Lake Michigan shoreline, and an unnecessary source of this pollution is polystyrene foam food containers.

These single-use, takeout boxes may be convenient for bringing home leftovers, but in the environment polystyrene can break into tiny pieces that are nearly impossible to clean up. Instead, these pieces will drift through the environment, breaking down slowly, clogging waterways and threatening aquatic wildlife.

That’s why Environment Illinois supporters joined together to deliver thousands of petitions to lawmakers in Springfield in support of SB 1531, a bill that would phase out polystyrene foam foodware across the state.

Backed by Environment Illinois and other advocates, the bill advanced in the legislature in 2025. While the bill has not yet been fully approved, we will keep working to win its passage so we can help cut a significant source of plastic waste from entering our environment.

At the same time, we’re confronting another aquatic plastic threat: tiny pre-production plastic pellets known as nurdles. These pellets are used to create many of the plastic products you use everyday, but they often spill during manufacturing and transport, ending up in Illinois rivers, harming wildlife and polluting shorelines.

In response, we’re supporting the Illinois Plastic Pellet Free Waters Act (HB 3278), which would require facilities to take stronger steps to prevent plastic pellet spills and reduce the flow of this pollution into our waterways and environment. While the state House has done its part in passing the bill, it still needs approval from the Senate and the governor before it can take effect.

As we waited for that final step, Illinois volunteers joined the first-ever International Plastic Pellet Count, helping document pellet pollution along local waterways and building the case for stronger protections.

During the event, volunteers from across the world collected 49,256 pellets at 229 sites across 14 countries and 29 U.S. states, demonstrating just how widespread and often unseen this pellet pollution has become. In Illinois volunteers searched in parks and on sandy beaches, finding plastic pellets on the shores of Lake Michigan and along the Chicago River.

Although the worst contamination was recorded in other parts of the country, such as in Texas and on the Gulf coast, the findings further underscore the importance of preventing this pollution from growing in Illinois.

Advocating for more clean, renewable energy

Across Illinois, more families and businesses are turning to clean energy, cutting pollution and making our grid more resilient.

This year our partners at Environment Illinois Research & Education Center and Frontier Group, joined together to release their “Clean Energy Across America” report, which showcased the recent growth of renewables in Illinois and beyond.

In Illinois, the report found that:

159,840 electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids are registered in the state.

131,112 homes have rooftop solar..

111,760 customers are buying clean power from their utilities.

Illinoisans have claimed more than 140,000 federal clean energy tax credits.

Taken all together, these numbers show that clean energy adoption in Illinois is growing steadily and quickly. To support and accelerate that already promising growth, the Illinois General Assembly passed a new clean energy bill that Gov. Pritzker has already committed to signing.

The law, once signed, would establish a “virtual power plant” program that links rooftop solar panels, home batteries and other energy resources together, allowing the grid to better handle high demand times, making our systems more flexible and resilient.

The bill also directs the state to add 3 gigawatts of battery storage by 2030, roughly enough power to keep about 500,000 homes running for a full day, ensuring we have enough storage to handle our continued renewable growth.

We’re also working to make it simpler and cheaper for families to go solar. The Environment Illinois-backed “Residential Automated Solar Permitting Act” would require local governments to offer online permitting for standard home solar and battery projects. By streamlining this process, we can cut red tape, reduce installation delays, and lower costs for households that want to install their own clean energy technology.

Overall, Illinois’ clean energy transformation is well underway, and we will continue building support to make that transition quicker, cheaper and more efficient for residents across the Prairie State.

The average transaction price of a new vehicle hit $49,105 in October, according to car shopping guide Edmunds.
Cutting the fuel economy standards is unlikely to provide any fast relief on sticker prices, said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ head of insights.
And while looser standards may eventually mean lower car prices, their lower efficiency means that those savings could be eaten up by higher fuel costs, she said.
This assumes vehicle prices will actually go down with eased requirements, which experts say might not be the case.","DETROIT (AP) — President Donald Trump this week announced plans to weaken rules for how far automakers’ new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, set under former President Joe Biden.

The Trump administration said the rules, known formally as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards, are why new vehicles are too expensive, and that cutting them will drive down costs and make driving safer for Americans.

The new standards would drop the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles to roughly 34.5 mpg (55.5 kpg) in the 2031 model year, down from the goal of about 50.4 mpg (81.1 kpg) that year under the Biden-era rule.

Here are the facts.

Affordability

TRUMP: EV-friendly policies “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse.”

THE FACTS: It’s true that gas mileage standards have played a role in rising vehicle prices in recent years, but experts say plenty of other factors have contributed, and some much more.

Pandemic-era inventory shortages, supply chain challenges, tariffs and other trade dynamics, and even automakers’ growing investments in their businesses have also sent prices soaring. Average prices have also skewed higher as automakers have leaned into the costly big pickups and SUVs that many American consumers love.

The average transaction price of a new vehicle hit $49,105 in October, according to car shopping guide Edmunds.

A Consumer Reports analysis of vehicles for model years 2003 to 2021 — a period in which average fuel economy improved 30% — found no significant increase in inflation-adjusted vehicle prices caused by the requirements. At the same time, it found an average of $7,000 in lifetime fuel savings per vehicle for 2021 model year vehicles compared with 2003. That analysis, done primarily before the coronavirus pandemic, attributed much of the average sticker price increase to the shift toward bigger and more expensive vehicles.

Cutting the fuel economy standards is unlikely to provide any fast relief on sticker prices, said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ head of insights. And while looser standards may eventually mean lower car prices, their lower efficiency means that those savings could be eaten up by higher fuel costs, she said.

Ending the gas car?

TRUMP: Biden’s policies were “a quest to end the gasoline-powered car.”

THE FACTS: The Biden administration did enact several policies to increase electric vehicle adoption, including setting a target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act included tax incentives that gave car buyers up to $7,500 off the price of an EV and dedicated billions of dollars to nationwide charging — funding that Trump tried to stop. The Biden administration increased fuel economy requirements and set stricter tailpipe emissions limits.

While those moves sought to help build the EV market, there was no requirement that automakers sell EVs or consumers buy them. And gasoline cars still make up the vast majority of the U.S. market.

EV charging

TRUMP: “We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them.”

THE FACTS: While many potential EV buyers still worry about charging them, the availability of public charging has significantly improved in recent years.

Biden-era funding and private investment have increased charging across the nation. There are now more than 232,000 individual Level 2 and fast charging ports in the U.S. As of this year, enough fast charging ports have been installed to average one for every mile (1.6 kilometers) of National Highway System roads in the U.S., according to an AP analysis of data from the Department of Energy.

However, those fast charging stations aren’t evenly dispersed. Many are concentrated in the far West and the Northeast, where sales of EVs are highest.

Experts note that most EV charging can be done at home.

Safety

TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: The reduced requirements will make drivers “safer on the roads because of all the great new technology we have that save lives.”

THE FACTS: Newer vehicles — gas and electric — are full of advanced safety features, including automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping, collision warnings and more.

Duffy suggested that consumers will be more likely to buy new vehicles if they are more affordable — meaning fewer old cars on the streets without the safety technology. This assumes vehicle prices will actually go down with eased requirements, which experts say might not be the case. Besides, high tech adds to a vehicle’s cost.

“If Americans purchased more new vehicles equipped with the latest safety technologies, we would expect overall on-road safety to improve,” Edmunds’ Caldwell said. “However, it’s unclear whether easing fuel-economy standards will meaningfully increase new-vehicle sales.”

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent automotive research nonprofit, also says electric or hybrid vehicles are as safe as or safer than gasoline-powered cars.

Another part of safety is public health. Efficiency requirements put into place to address the 1970s oil crisis were also a way to reduce pollution that is harmful to humans and the environment.

“This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans,” said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All campaign. “This dangerous proposal adds to the long list of ways the Trump administration is dismantling our clean air and public health protections.”

It’s going to come down to who can build power generation the fastest,” EQT CEO Toby Rice told the North American Gas Forum on Dec. 2.
He added that a lack of storage capacity ""is going to introduce a tremendous amount of volatility,” noting the stagnant pace of storage infrastructure growth over the past decade even as supply and demand have soared.
But while the gas is there, the pipelines and power plants are not.
“Between 2010 and 2022, natural gas demand rose by 49%, but pipeline (26% growth) and storage (2% growth) capacity grew far more slowly, creating bottlenecks that threaten economic growth, national security, and global competitiveness,” the report said.","Gas industry executives descended on Washington this week to sound alarm bells over the need for permitting reform to speed up infrastructure build-out, insisting the US could quickly fall behind in the global artificial intelligence race.

The warnings came as the National Petroleum Council (NPC) unveiled a list of recommendations on ways the Trump administration can make near-term permitting improvements while Congress works toward broader legislative reform.

“The winner of this AI race isn’t going to come down to who can get the chips. It’s not going to be about who can build the best apps. It’s going to come down to who can build power generation the fastest,” EQT CEO Toby Rice told the North American Gas Forum on Dec. 2.

Williams CEO Chad Zamarin likened today's situation to the pre-World War II race to build the first atomic bomb. ""This is our generation's moment, our Manhattan Project,” he told the forum. ""If we had to compete right now … just from a manufacturing and technology perspective, we would not be the world’s most dominant [AI] producer.”

During a separate NPC meeting on Dec. 3, TC Energy CEO Francis Poirier said gas and power infrastructure projects are key to meet surging energy demand, rising costs and rapid build-out of AI data centers.

“The current permitting process delays prevent the US from realizing those solutions in a timely manner. Even successful projects take far longer than they should,” Poirier said, referencing a recent TC Energy expansion project in the Pacific Northwest that took more than two years to obtain its permits.

“I think people are tired of us constantly saying it, but it really does depend on infrastructure,” to keep gas prices in check, Williams Executive Chairman and former CEO Alan Armstrong told the NPC meeting.

'Demand Signals Are Screaming'

Rice told reporters after the NPC event that gas pipeline transportation fees have risen significantly on “purely political risk” rather than supply chain or inflation, and he attributed that to permitting delays. “With this political risk, we’re getting quotes of $2-$3” per million Btu, Rice said.

He added that a lack of storage capacity ""is going to introduce a tremendous amount of volatility,” noting the stagnant pace of storage infrastructure growth over the past decade even as supply and demand have soared.

Rice, whose company is the second-largest US gas producer, told the North American Gas Forum that the US market will need 10 billion to 18 billion cubic feet per day of new gas production just to meet demand growth necessary to power AI data centers. But while the gas is there, the pipelines and power plants are not.

“We have the supply chain [and] the resources to make this work. But we need the purpose and the regulatory system that will allow market forces to work,” he said. “The demand signals are screaming for more energy.""

Because of regulatory and legal hurdles facing multibillion-dollar pipelines and power generation projects in the US, ""We’ve basically taken a pause of getting infrastructure built for the last 10 years,"" Rice argued. ""We’ve got to catch up on all that and get this additional capacity built over the next few years.”

A day later, newly minted Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Chairman Laura Swett sought to allay the gas industry's concerns, asserting that one of FERC's primary goals under her leadership will be expediting approval of gas pipelines and LNG export projects.

'Failing to Keep Up'

Meanwhile, the NPC recommendations run the gamut from a focus on modernizing and streamlining the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa), which would need congressional action, to actions that could be done at the executive level, such as holding FERC to a 90-day authorization deadline after the completion of environmental reviews.

“Between 2010 and 2022, natural gas demand rose by 49%, but pipeline (26% growth) and storage (2% growth) capacity grew far more slowly, creating bottlenecks that threaten economic growth, national security, and global competitiveness,” the report said. “The current permitting process — bogged down by lengthy reviews, litigation risks, and overlapping regulations — is failing to keep up, leading to higher costs, supply insecurity, and missed opportunities in the global energy and technology race.”",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4ae81b1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3024+0+408/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2F1f%2Ffe%2F0375629b4c8ba02d375330753c6e%2Fss-1996700738-pipeline-construction-green.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 18:02:55.104598

The county’s announcement comes as Delaware is implementing new fees for electric and hybrid vehicles. Under changes made by the Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles, EV owners now pay an annual registration surcharge designed to replace declining gasoline-tax revenue. State officials say the additional fee ensures that all vehicle owners contribute to road maintenance costs as fuel consumption patterns change. The move follows earlier debates surrounding the state’s long-term approach to emissions standards and zero-emission vehicle regulations, signaling an ongoing reassessment of Delaware’s EV strategy.

These local developments unfold against a shifting national backdrop. Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has reversed several federal initiatives intended to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles. The administration’s recently enacted legislative package, described by officials as a “big beautiful bill,” reduces EV-related incentives, cuts funding for charging-infrastructure programs, and rolls back federal emissions and fuel-efficiency standards established under prior law. Those changes were underscored during a meeting Trump held with major automakers this week, where he outlined plans to lower fleetwide efficiency targets from levels set by the previous administration. Auto executives at the meeting welcomed the regulatory shift, noting that it would enable a broader focus on gasoline-powered and hybrid vehicles.

Industry data shows the impact of these federal actions is being closely watched. Electric-vehicle sales in the United States reached record levels in 2024, but analysts report that the expiration of federal tax credits and relaxed regulatory pressure have produced signs of slowing demand. Some manufacturers have reported significant year-over-year drops in EV sales in recent month.

The combined effect leaves Delaware and its counties operating in a policy environment that no longer aligns neatly with federal priorities. New Castle County continues building chargers using previously awarded federal grant funding. The state is adjusting its fee structure to address the fiscal implications of EV adoption. The federal government is moving in the opposite direction, easing requirements and reducing EV-related spending. As a result, county, state and federal actions now point in distinctly different directions.

The county’s project is part of the “100 EV Plugs Plan,” launched in 2023, which set out to install more than one hundred charging stations across public sites. With the latest additions, the county reports that 72 chargers are active, with another six installed and awaiting activation, bringing the total to 78 once they come online.",https://firststateupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-7.png,N,,2025-12-05 19:01:51.396621

The Intermountain Power Project (IPP) in Utah, the last remaining source of coal-fired electricity serving the nation’s second-largest city, ceased operations just before Thanksgiving. The two-unit plant had roughly 1,800 MW of capacity when both units were online and supplied about 11 percent of Los Angeles’ electricity as recently as 2024.

LADWP continues to receive electricity from a new natural gas combined-cycle (NGCC) project completed this year at the IPP site, part of a modernization effort known as “IPP Renewed.” The new units are designed to run on natural gas blended with up to 30 percent green hydrogen, with a long-term plan to transition to 100 percent green hydrogen. LADWP expects hydrogen to be introduced into the fuel mix in 2026.

LADWP’s goal is to reach 100% carbon-free energy by 2035. The city has made investments in solar, wind, battery storage and other renewable technologies and is working to expand local solar, energy efficiency, and demand response customer initiatives.

Over the summer, Los Angeles celebrated the completion of the Eland Solar-plus-Storage Center, which pairs 758 MWdc of solar generation with 300 MW/1,200 MWh of storage.

What’s next for coal in the U.s.?

Nationwide, the operating capacity of U.S. coal-fired power plants is scheduled to fall from 172 gigawatts (GW) in May 2025 to 145 GW by the end of 2028, according to what owners and operators have told the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Still, some U.S. regions generate more electricity from coal than from natural gas during certain months of the year. EIA is projecting plants in the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) regions to generate more electricity from coal than from natural gas in the upcoming winter months. Notably, EIA also says more than half of planned coal capacity retirements — roughly 58% — are located in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions.

The U.S. as a whole last generated more electricity from coal than from natural gas on a monthly basis in January 2018. Several regional electricity markets, such as those in California, Florida, New England and New York, have not generated more electricity from coal than from natural gas at any point since at least 2010, EIA reported.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under President Donald Trump has been more favorable to coal-fired generation. Notably, this includes rolling back a Biden-era rule which requires the longest-running existing coal-fired units and most heavily utilized new gas turbines to implement carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS) by various compliance dates in the 2030s.

Trump has long promised to boost what he calls “beautiful” coal to fire power plants and for other uses, but the industry has been in decline for decades.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IPP-project.png,N,,2025-12-05 18:02:58.649099

The state is rapidly adding solar and wind power, which are cheaper and cleaner than legacy coal plants.","CRAIG, Colo. (AP) — The Cooper family knows how to work heavy machinery. The kids could run a hay baler by their early teens, and two of the three ran monster-sized drills at the coal mines along with their dad.

But learning to maneuver the shiny red drill they use to tap into underground heat feels different. It’s a critical part of the new family business, High Altitude Geothermal, which installs geothermal heat pumps that use the Earth’s constant temperature to heat and cool buildings. At stake is not just their livelihood but a century-long family legacy of producing energy in Moffat County.

Like many families here, the Coopers have worked in coal for generations, and in oil before that. That’s the end for Matt Cooper and his son Matthew, as one of three coal mines in the area closes amid a statewide shift to cleaner energy.

“People have to start looking beyond coal,” said Matt Cooper. “And that can be a multitude of things. Our economy has been so focused on coal and coal-fired power plants. And we need the diversity.”

Many countries and about half of U.S. states are moving away from coal, citing environmental impacts and high costs. Burning coal emits carbon dioxide that traps heat in the atmosphere, warming the planet.

President Donald Trump has boosted coal as part of his agenda to promote fossil fuels. He’s trying to save a declining industry with executive orders, large sales of coal from public lands, regulatory relief and offers of hundreds of millions of dollars to restore coal plants.

That’s created uncertainty in places like Craig. As some families like the Coopers plan for the next stage of their careers, others hold out hope that Trump will save their plants, mines and high-paying jobs.

Matt and Matthew Cooper work at the Colowyo Mine near Meeker, though active mining has ended and site cleanup begins in January.

The mine employs about 130 workers and supplies Craig Generating Station, a 1,400-megawatt coal-fired plant. Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association is planning to close Craig’s Unit 1 by year’s end for economic reasons and to meet legal requirements for reducing emissions. The other two units will close in 2028.

Xcel Energy owns coal-fired Hayden Station, about 30 minutes away. It said it doesn’t plan to change Hayden’s retirement dates, though it’s extending another coal unit in Pueblo in part due to increased electricity demand.

The Craig and Hayden plants together employ about 200 people.

Craig residents have always been entrepreneurial, and that spirit will get them through this transition, said Kirstie McPherson, board president for the Craig Chamber of Commerce. Still, she said, just about everybody here is connected to coal.

“You have a whole community who has always been told you are an energy town, you’re a coal town,” she said. “When that starts going away, beyond just the individuals that are having the identity crisis, you have an entire culture, an entire community that is also having that same crisis.”

Phasing out coal

Coal has been central to Colorado’s economy since before statehood, but it’s generally the most expensive energy on today’s grid, said Democratic Gov. Jared Polis.

“We are not going to let this administration drag us backwards into an overreliance on expensive fossil fuels,” Polis said in a statement.

Nationwide, coal power was 28% more expensive in 2024 than in 2021, costing consumers $6.2 billion more, according to a June analysis by Energy Innovation. The nonpartisan think tank cited significant increases in operating aging plants and inflation.

Colorado’s six remaining coal-fired power plants are scheduled to close or convert to natural gas, which emits about half the carbon dioxide as coal, by 2031. The state is rapidly adding solar and wind power, which are cheaper and cleaner than legacy coal plants. Renewable energy provides more than 40% of Colorado’s power now and will pass 70% by the end of the decade, according to statewide utility plans.

Nationwide, wind and solar growth have remained strong, producing more electricity than coal in 2025, as of the latest data in October, according to energy think tank Ember.

But some states want to increase or at least maintain coal production. That includes top coal state Wyoming, where the Wyoming Energy Authority said Trump is breathing welcome new life into its coal and mining industry.

Planning for the future

The Coopers have gone all-in on geothermal.

“Maybe we’ll never go back to coal,” Matt Cooper said. “We haven’t (gone) back to oil and gas, so we might just be geothermal people for quite some time, maybe generations, and then eventually something else will come along.”

While the Coopers were learning to use their drill in October, Wade Gerber was in downtown Craig distilling grain neutral spirits, used to make gin and vodka, on a day off from the Craig Station power plant. Gerber stepped over his corgis, Ali and Boss, and onto a stepladder to peer into a massive stainless steel pot where he was heating wheat and barley.

Gerber’s spent three decades in coal. When closure plans were announced four years ago, he, his wife Tenniel and their friend McPherson brainstormed business ideas.

“With my background in plumbing and electrical from the plant it’s like, oh yeah, I can handle that part of it,” Gerber said about distilling. “This is the easy part.”

He used Tri-State’s education subsidies for classes in distilling, while other co-workers learned to fix vehicles or repair guns to find new careers. While some plan to leave town, Gerber is opening Bad Alibi Distillery. McPherson and Tenniel Gerber are opening a cocktail bar next door.

Everyone in town hopes Trump will step in to extend the plant’s life, Gerber said. Meanwhile, they’re trying to define a new future for Craig in a nerve-wracking time.

“For me, my products can go elsewhere. I don’t necessarily have to sell it in Craig, there’s that avenue. For someone relying on Craig, it’s even scarier,” he said.

Questioning the coal rollback

Tammy Villard owns a gift shop, Moffat Mercantile, with her husband. After the coal closures were announced, they opened a commercial print shop too, seeing it as a practical choice for when so many high-paying jobs go away.

Villard, who spent a decade at Colowyo as administrative staff, said she doesn’t understand how the state can throw the switch to turn off coal and still have reliable electricity. She wants the state to slow down.

Villard describes herself as a moderate Republican. She said political swings at the federal level, from the green energy push in the last administration to doubling down on fossil fuels in this one, aren’t helpful.

“The pendulum has to come back to the middle,” she said, “and we are so far out to either side that I don’t know how we get back to that middle.”",https://coloradobiz.com/files/2025/12/AP25339002496399-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 17:03:08.537591

When completed, Carriger Solar will have 160 megawatts of solar generating potential, enough to power up to 32,500 homes, according to the company’s website.","Gov. Bob Ferguson has approved a 1,300-acre solar farm in south-central Washington, calling the project a “win for our state.”

The Carriger Solar project in Klickitat County is expected to generate enough power for thousands of homes. Ferguson informed the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council on Tuesday that he was giving it the go-ahead. This is the first large-scale energy project Ferguson has acted on since taking office.

“Building more clean energy will provide affordable, carbon-free electricity to Washingtonians, create much needed construction jobs, boost economic development and keep our air clean,” Ferguson, a first-term Democrat, said in a statement.

Ferguson’s decision isn’t a surprise. When he turned down the council’s initial recommendation to proceed with the Carriger project in August, he made clear that he viewed the undertaking as “consistent with state policies.”

And he stressed the importance of moving swiftly so developers could secure federal clean energy tax credits before they are ended by the Trump administration. Solar and wind projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026 to fully qualify for the credits.

But Ferguson told the council to talk further with Yakama Nation leaders about their concerns that protections for cultural resources were not strict enough.

What emerged was the revised site certification agreement inked by Ferguson. It requires the developers provide $100,000 in one-time grant funding to the Yakama Nation Cultural Resources Program once the project is operational. Tribal access to traditional and cultural properties must be maintained during construction.

Even with the grant funding, the tribe remained opposed to the project, state officials said.

Ferguson, in his Dec. 2 letter to the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council, said the final agreement “balances the need for affordable clean energy with mitigation requirements that protect Washington’s environment.”

He also reiterated the urgency of acting to take advantage of the federal credits.

“Our state already faces real challenges in building renewable electricity, and we now contend with a federal government that is hostile to renewable electricity development,” he wrote. “All of these elements factored into my decision.”

Cypress Creek Renewables, based in Santa Monica, California, plans to build the solar farm north of State Route 142 along Knight Road, about two miles west of Goldendale in unincorporated Klickitat County. The firm applied for state approval for the project in February 2023.

The company is “grateful” for Ferguson’s support, a spokesperson said Thursday.

“We are proud to play a role in advancing the state’s clean energy goals,” Angeli Chandler, Cypress Creek’s director of communications, said in an email.

“We are moving with urgency to ensure we retain federal tax treatment, which is critical to keeping this project on track,” she said. The project is expected to begin delivering power in the summer of 2028, she said.

When completed, Carriger Solar will have 160 megawatts of solar generating potential, enough to power up to 32,500 homes, according to the company’s website. The project, which also includes a 63 megawatt battery energy storage system, will tie into the Bonneville Power Administration transmission system.

Do you live in a town that doesn’t have access to solar incentive programs? Perhaps a program like the Solar Marketplace Assistance Program Plus (Solar MAP+) might be a model for your community. It is a good fit for towns or cities that don’t have the tools, resources, or experience to pursue energy saving options with solar and storage on their own. Public developers like this are taking on the role of providing solar and other renewable energy projects for schools, low-income housing, and other municipal projects.

Gaps that Need to be Filled for Renewable Energy Projects

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law had been a boost for public financing of renewable energy projects. Through tax credits and public lending programs, capital cost reductions for energy projects became commonplace, as governments small and large could draw upon the federal government’s reasonable financing costs. The ability to lend for longer periods of time and across different fiscal capacities made all the difference in projects coming to communities across the US.

Of course, the second Trump administration is drilling down (pun intended) on limitations to energy subsidies. Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” eliminates or phases out subsidies for electric cars, clean energy, and energy-efficient appliances, while providing tax breaks and subsidies for oil and gas companies and opening up more federal lands and offshore areas for drilling and mining.

The US is at a renewable energy crossroads, to the point where over 140 US solar companies have urged Congress to reconsider changes to permitting that they say have resulted in “a nearly complete moratorium” on solar project permits. An open letter addressed to the Senate and House of Representatives called for changes to a July memo from Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, which called for increased scrutiny on solar project permits for projects on federal land and using Department of the Interior resources. The order expands federal oversight of solar and wind approvals, in line with the Trump administration’s efforts to eliminate subsidies and what it sees as “preferential treatment” for these energy sources.

The open letter from the industry reiterates the argument that solar represents the cheapest and fastest way to add new US energy capacity to meet the forecast growth in demand from AI and data centers.

Generation 180 says there are still pathways for renewable energy deployment. “Even under hostile federal political conditions, public finance institutions — like the existing 50-state network of development finance agencies (DFAs) and green banks — can continue to finance essential infrastructure,” they explained in a 2025 report.

Public financing seems similar to public developers, but these are really two separate entities. Public developers undertake capital investment and manage the resulting assets on behalf of the public. While they can include some project financing, public developers are more on-the-ground consultants that assist with project development and planning, legalities, workforce enhancement, procurement, construction, operations, maintenance, portfolio management, and even service delivery.

In the energy sector, the US has numerous entities at the regional, state, and local level endowed with public development capacities. You probably recognize a lot of them: Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), New York Power Authority (NYPA), the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), Long Island Power Authority (LIPA), New Mexico Renewable Energy Transmission Authority — and so many more.

As the Center for Public Enterprise notes, public developers understand how renewable energy deployments require extensive construction and operation management as well as coordinating skilled labor and acquiring special materials. Capital projects have high upfront costs, operate in complex regulatory environments, and have long payback periods. These complexities create coordination problems, especially when non-financial barriers make the commitment of time and financial resources by key stakeholders demanding.

Case Study: Connecticut Green Bank’s Public Developer Function

A green bank accelerates the green economy using limited public dollars to attract multiples of private capital investment. In doing so, clean energy is more affordable and accessible to consumers. Established by the Connecticut General Assembly in July 2011, the Connecticut Green Bank supports the Governor’s and Legislature’s energy strategy to achieve cleaner, less expensive, and more reliable sources of energy while creating jobs and supporting local economic development.

In 2021, the Green Bank’s model was expanded to include new areas of environmental infrastructure, related to climate adaptation and resiliency, land conservation, parks and recreation, agriculture, water, waste and recycling, and environmental markets, including carbon offsets and ecosystem services.

Through its open Request for Proposals for Green Bank Capital Solutions, the Green Bank provides access to capital to Connecticut projects that catalyze clean energy deployment and energy efficiency, reduction of greenhouse gasses, environmental infrastructure, improved public health outcomes, job creation and economic development. The RFP is open to technologies that have already proven to be commercially viable or have demonstrated clear potential for commercial viability through well-documented feasibility studies or pilot programs with clear evidence of a viable business model and path to sustainable impact. True to the green bank model, this open RFP allows the Green Bank to leverage public dollars to bring in private investment and potentially other investment partners.

Connecticut’s Solar MAP+ is an offshoot of the Connecticut Green Bank, the first green bank in the US. It works with municipalities to develop solar and storage projects in four easy steps.

Site Analysis. They work with stakeholders to perform an analysis of all eligible locations to identify opportunities for solar and storage projects.

Project Development. They conduct site visits, confirm project eligibility, and develop system designs for each project to determine project economics.

Execute. They present project specs and pricing to execute a project agreement.

Trusted Partner. They solicit competitive proposals from solar contractors and select the best, bundling participating projects together to achieve economies of scale. After a qualified contractor is selected, the team manages all final steps of development, construction, and energization of the project. This process includes submittal for eligible state and federal incentives.

For example, since 2014, the Green Bank has facilitated the deployment of solar at 80 K-12 schools in the state. According to data from Generation180, nearly 10% of K-12 public schools in the US have an on-site solar project. Nationwide, 20% of K-12 solar capacity is owned directly by school districts, and 80% of K-12 solar capacity is owned by third parties — typically for-profit developers — and paid for over time through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) or leases.

The combination will create America’s biggest fleet of power plants, even after Friday’s deal that calls for the companies to divest two sites and a minority stake in one more. The settlement, if approved by the courts, would resolve a civil antitrust lawsuit seeking to maintain competition, and is in addition to four other plants the companies agreed to divest in July under a separate agreement.

Article content

Constellation is expanding its fleet to meet surging US demand for electricity. Manufacturers, homes and especially data centers are all clamoring for more power, but that’s also driving up prices. Soaring utility bills have become a major political issue, and were a key factor in the November elections that led to strong results for Democratic candidates. US regulators said the divestments were a response to concerns the combined companies would be able to manipulate power supplies to boost profits.

Article content

“The price of electricity is a pocketbook issue to American consumers working hard to afford their monthly utility bills,” Abigail Slater an assistant attorney general with the Justice Department, said in a statement. “When it comes to their electricity bills, Americans deserve the benefit of robust competition among electricity generators.”

The process releases 18-20 kilograms of CO₂ per kilogram of hydrogen gas production compared to 8-12 kilograms from the natural gas process.
For this reason, this process has been referred to as “black hydrogen” owing to the linkage with the black nature of coal.
Plans unveiled by the China Hydrogen Alliance include the deployment of 100 gigawatts of electrolyzers in 2030 that are all renewable-energy-based.
Even if China accounts for the majority of the world’s hydrogen production, producing “black hydrogen” through coal technologies renders the fuel anything but clean.","The promising clean energy resource of the 21st century turned out to be hydrogen fuel, gaining world attention as an alternative fuel source in different sectors in substitution for fossil fuels. The existence of a vast industry in China regarding hydrogen fuel production has dramatically changed the clean fuel story with the use of coal-based production technologies, yielding what is referred to today as “black hydrogen.”

China dominates global hydrogen production with coal-based methods

China emerged as the world’s biggest producer of hydrogen with the production of 25 million metric tons per year, accounting for nearly one-third of the world’s production of 70 million metric tons. The production process in China has many significant differences from other major hydrogen producers in the world. This results in serious environmental issues.

Unlike other nations that use natural gas in the steam methane reforming process to obtain hydrogen gas, China produces most of its hydrogen from coal gasification. The use of this process not only consumes more carbon gases but also releases significant amounts of CO₂ in the process. The process releases 18-20 kilograms of CO₂ per kilogram of hydrogen gas production compared to 8-12 kilograms from the natural gas process.

The coal gasification process creates unprecedented carbon emissions

The coal gasification process involves the use of high temperatures in the process of synthesizing gas from the coal in order to yield hydrogen. This process yields vast amounts of carbon dioxide gas. For this reason, this process has been referred to as “black hydrogen” owing to the linkage with the black nature of coal. The other type of hydrogen generation, termed “brown hydrogen,” involves lignite coal.

Environmental impact reveals staggering carbon footprint from black hydrogen

The dependence of China’s hydrogen fuels on coal leaves the country in an environmental paradox in terms of the use of clean fuel, yet ending up with one of the most carbon-intensive fuels in existence. It has been noted that China’s dependence on coal in the production of hydrogen fuels poses one of the biggest threats to the world in fighting climate change through the use of hydrogen fuels.

The magnitude of black hydrogen production in China means that millions of tons of additional CO2 are released each year compared with clean methods of producing hydrogen. Environmental analysts have warned that if black hydrogen production in China continues to grow in the future, this may undermine progress that has been made in other forms of renewables. The Chinese are aware of this and are starting to look for ways to switch to clean methods of producing hydrogen.

“China produces 25 million tonnes of hydrogen every year, out of a global total of about 70 million. Some 62% of its hydrogen comes from coal gasification, 19% is from natural gas, 18% is a by-product from industrial processes, while less than 1% is actually green.”

Transition plans involve changing from black hydrogen to green hydrogen

The Chinese government recognizes the challenges faced by black hydrogen and has plans in place to create clean fuel solutions. Plans unveiled by the China Hydrogen Alliance include the deployment of 100 gigawatts of electrolyzers in 2030 that are all renewable-energy-based. This is a monumental change from the current production of hydrogen and moving towards clean production.

The Chinese hydrogen experience demonstrates the key role production technologies play in ensuring hydrogen can be considered a clean fuel. Even if China accounts for the majority of the world’s hydrogen production, producing “black hydrogen” through coal technologies renders the fuel anything but clean. Whether the hydrogen sector in China can be the solution to the problem or remain the cause now largely depends on the future of green hydrogen production in this country.

The MPSC today took steps to improve electric service resilience for critical and priority community facilities such as schools, hospitals, nursing homes, police and fire stations, 911 call centers and more (Case No. U-21388).

The Commission today approved 13 recommendations from MPSC Staff to strengthen reliability requirements for important critical and priority facilities important to a community’s health and safety and to better align the MPSC’s Service Quality Rules and Technical Standards with industry requirements for reslience of specific critical facilities.

As part of the MPSC’s work to improve outcomes for customers during extreme weather events, the Commission in 2023 directed MPSC Staff to review service quality rules and the resilience requirements of critical facilities so they could continue to operate during a power outage or be restored quickly thereafter. The Commission also directed Staff to file a straw proposal by December 2024 with recommendations to improve critical facility energy resilience.

Staff filed the proposal Dec. 2, 2024, that outlined a set of more than a dozen recommendations, and the Commission sought additional comment on the proposal. The staff recommendations included:

Requiring representatives from DTE Electric and Consumers Energy to meet annually with critical facility customers to discuss resilience needs and develop appropriate communications plans.

Requiring all regulated utilities to inform MPSC Staff in advance of major weather events of the anticipated number of customer outages, actions taken to prepare, and appropriate company contacts during storm events.

Mandating service restoration to critical facilities within 72 hours of an outage and if not met, requiring utilities to provide evidence explaining why a restoration couldn’t be completed in that timeline. This requirement aligns with other state and federal regulations, including Michigan rules that require hospitals to be able to withstand a power outage of up to 72 hours, to ensure continuity of service at critical facilities even during times of extended utility outages. The Commission directed Indiana Michigan Power Co., to provide detailed plans to MPSC Staff, within six months, on how the company will meet the objectives of this requirement with its Priority 1 through Priority 5 service restoration coding system.

Directing utilities to hold annual meetings with local government emergency managers to discuss restoration and reliability issues with critical facility customers located within their city or county, and for utilities to review lists of critical facilities for accuracy with state emergency management coordinators and review critical facility designation biennially.

Requiring MPSC Staff and utility representatives to determine potential areas of improvement for identifying and prioritizing individual households with critical care customers during sustained outages.

Directing regulated utilities to file summary outage reports after major interruptions that includes a cumulative outage total, the number of wires down, the number of outside crews called in to assist restoration, and other info within 14 days of service restoration.

Authorizing utilities to release private customer data — limited to a customer’s name, address and contact info — to the Michigan State Police Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division and the State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates emergency response, during and after major interruptions, for the purposes of customer health and safety or for federal disaster reimbursement.

The work is part of the MPSC’s intensive focus on improving the electric grid’s reliability and resilience, spurred by significant storms in February 2023 that left about a million customers of DTE Electric Co. and Consumers Energy Co. without power.

Other steps the Commission has taken in recent years include:

Initiating a first-ever comprehensive, third-party audit of the electric systems of DTE Electric and Consumers Energy, the state’s two largest electric utilities.

Approving additional funding for utility tree trimming to shorten the cycle of how often trees and other vegetation are trimmed, resulting in significant reductions in service interruptions on circuits with stepped-up vegetation management.

Increasing customer power outage credits from a one-time $25 credit to a daily credit — currently $42 per day, 68% higher than before the Commission revamped outage credits in 2023 — that is indexed annually to inflation and automatically paid by utilities to affected customers, who previously had to request it from their energy provider.

In separate matters, the Commission today approved two matters dealing with Alpena Power Co. and the catastrophic March 28-30 ice storm that paralyzed northern Michigan.

The Commission approved a settlement agreement governing customer outage bill credits that Alpena Power will pay to customers who endured lengthy outages from the storm (Case No. U-21912). Alpena Power had sought an exemption from having to pay outage credits because the ice storm impacted its entire service territory and all of its 16,755 customers as the region dealt with downed trees, impassable roads, downed and damaged power lines, damage to other utility equipment, and loss of cellular phone service and other communication. Under the settlement agreement between the utility, the Michigan Department of Attorney General, and MPSC Staff, Alpena Power will calculate and pay outage credits to customers within 90 days.

The Commission also approved Alpena Power’s application for accounting authority to defer operations and maintenance expenses from the storm. The utility estimates the storm will cost it $2.25 million in total restoration expenses, while the utility had budgeted for a normal year of about $500,000 for storm and outage response. The Commission noted that approval of the accounting treatment, which will not increase rates or charges for customers, does not mean approval of expenses themselves. The utility will still have to seek recovery of the restoration expenses in a future proceeding in which the Commission will evaluate the costs for reasonableness and prudence.

MPSC OKS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON DTE ELECTRIC CO.’S INTERCONNECTION PROCEDURES

The MPSC today approved DTE Electric Co.’s application for approval of its interconnection procedures, accepting a settlement agreement that resolves all matters in the case (Case No. U-21482). Among other elements, the settlement agreement approved today includes a new process for how DTE Electric evaluates sizing of distributed generation systems, provides greater detail about when studies relating to the islanding of distributed energy systems will be required and how they will be conducted and clarifies the screening requirements for projects with a limited ability to export power to the broader electrical grid. The Commission in 2023 adopted new Interconnection and Distributed Generation Standards, which detail the rules and procedures for connecting distributed energy resources such as solar or battery storage to the electric grid. DTE Electric filed an initial application in May 2023. But new statutory requirements under the 2023 Michigan energy law revamp ultimately required DTE Electric to file a new application, which the utility filed in May 2024. Intervenors in the case were the Ecology Center; Environmental Law & Policy Center; Union of Concerned Scientists; Vote Solar; Michigan Energy Innovation Business Council; Institute for Energy Innovation; Advanced Energy United; and Energy Michigan. MPSC Staff also participated in the case. The participating organizations worked throughout much of 2025 to finalize the settlement agreement.

COMMISSION APPROVES CONSUMERS ENERGY’S POWER SUPPLY COST RECOVERY RECONCILIATION

The MPSC approved Consumers Energy Company’s application for approval of its power supply cost recovery (PSCR) reconciliation for the 2023 calendar year (Case No. U-21258). The Commission set a net PSCR underrecovery balance of $255,961,382, including interest, as the utility’s 2024 PSCR reconciliation beginning balance. The Commission also approved unopposed cost recovery amounts of $17,043,240 in capped costs and $2,386,253 in recoverable uncapped costs incurred by a number of biomass merchant plants that sell power to Consumers Energy. The Commission directed Consumers and the biomass plants to work ahead proactively to reconcile differences in recorded costs before testimony is filed in future cases. The MPSC set Consumers’ net financial compensation mechanism overrecovery balance of $2,518,161, including interest, as the company’s 2024 financial compensation mechanism calculation beginning balance. The Michigan Department of Attorney General intervened in the case, as did the Residential Customer Group, the Association of Businesses Advocating Tariff Equity, and the biomass plants. MPSC Staff also participated.

CONSUMERS ENERGY’S GAS COST RECOVERY RECONCILIATION APPROVED

The Commission approved Consumers Energy Co.’s application for approval of its gas cost recovery (GCR) plan reconciliation for the 12 months ending March 31, 2024 (Case No. U-21270). The Commission set a net overrecovery of $2,560,299, including interest, as the utility’s 2024-2025 GCR reconciliation beginning balance. The Michigan Department of Attorney General and the Retail Energy Supply Association intervened in the case. MPSC Staff also participated.

MPSC APPROVES DTE ELECTRIC CO.’S DECKERVILLE SOLAR PARK PROJECT

The MPSC approved DTE Electric Co.’s application for approval to build a new solar project in Michigan’s Thumb meant to supply Ford Motor Co. with electricity generated from renewable sources (Case No. U-21285). The Commission approved DTE Electric’s Deckerville Solar Park Project, a 200-megawatt (MW) array to be located in Marion and Wheatland townships in Sanilac County. DTE Electric’s engineering procurement and construction master service agreement with Burns and McDonnell Michigan Inc. and a master supply agreement for solar panel modules with New East Solar Energy (America) Inc. also were approved. The Commission in December 2024 approved an amended and restated special solar energy contract between DTE Electric and Ford, updating a contract the Commission approved in 2022 for the utility to build up to 675 MW of dedicated solar projects through DTE Electric’s voluntary green pricing program to help the automaker meet its goal of powering its Michigan manufacturing plants with 100% renewable energy. Both the application in the current case and the original and updated 675 MW renewable power supply contracts between DTE Electric and Ford were approved by the Commission on an ex parte basis.

COMMISSION OKS INDIANA MICHIGAN POWER CO.’S POWER SUPPLY COST RECOVERY PLAN BUT WARNS SOME COSTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE

The MPSC approved Indiana Michigan Power Co.’s (I&M) application for approval to implement a power supply cost recovery (PSCR) plan for the 12 months ending Dec. 31, 2025, but the Commission warned the utility that it may not be permitted to recover all of its costs associated with a pair of coal plants operating in Indiana and Ohio (Case No. U-21596). The Commission approved I&M’s proposed PSCR factor of 3.74 mills per kilowatt-hour for January and February 2025 and 3.58 mills per kilowatt-hour March through December 2025, as well as the utility’s five-year forecast. The Commission, however, issued a Section 7 warning that I&M may not be able to recover its full costs under the Ohio Valley Electric Corp.’s intercompany power agreement, similar to previous warnings that ultimately led to the Commission disallowing the ability of I&M to recover any excessive costs associated with these plants from Michigan customers.

MPSC APPROVES UPDATES TO GAS SAFETY RULES

The MPSC today approved amendments to rules governing gas safety (Case No. U-21847). The Commission approved amending the state’s gas safety rules so that they adopt current federal gas safety standards and raise the threshold at which gas operators must report incidents to the MPSC, to $25,000 in estimated property damage from the current $10,000. With today’s approval, the Commission now submits the rule changes to the Legislative Service Bureau and the Michigan Office of Administrative Hearings and Rules for their formal approvals before the matter is transmitted to the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules.

BW BROADBAND INC. RECEIVES PERMANENT BASIC LOCAL EXCHANGE PHONE SERVICE LICENSE

The MPSC today approved an application for a permanent license to provide basic local exchange phone service in Isabella County (Case No. U-21934). The Commission granted BW Broadband Inc. a permanent license to provide phone service in the Winn Exchange currently served by Winn Telephone Co. The Commission granted the company a temporary license on Aug. 21.

Environmentalist groups and some Cameron Parish residents are disgruntled after Louisiana officials recently gave the go-ahead for construction of a liquified natural gas export facility after a state judge suspended the project.

Judge Penelope Richard of the 38th Judicial District Court, which includes Cameron Parish, suspended Commonwealth LNG’s permit last month in response to a lawsuit from the Sierra Club. She ruled the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy hadn’t considered the effects of climate change, the high density of gas export facilities already in the area and the disproportionate impact of pollution on nearby communities when it approved the permit.

The state agency then issued updated reasons Nov. 18 for approving Commonwealth’s permit, allowing the project to move forward. Officials again determined the proposed benefits of the project “outweigh the costs” of its environmental impact on Southwest Louisiana’s coast and communities.

“Economic benefit outweighing all of these things is frustrating to me,” said John Allaire, a Cameron Parish resident who lives within 30 miles of three existing LNG export facilities and six more planned or under construction. “The economic benefits of their facility outweigh flooding me out, outweigh the commercial fishing industry, outweigh the eastern black rail, outweigh protecting our cheniers … I don’t agree with that. How much is enough?”

The Department of Conservation and Energy’s new permit approval was based on an “independent analysis” of documents from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Those agencies considered the effects of climate change, environmental justice concerns and the cumulative impacts of multiple LNG facilities within a small area. All reached the same conclusion that the project’s benefits overshadow its costs.

Environmental groups staunchly disagree with the decision to reissue the permit.

The Sierra Club said in a statement through its managing attorney, Eric Huber, that the permit was approved “without any notice to the plaintiffs or the public,” who he said learned about it through the news reports. Turtle Island Restoration Network and Louisiana Bucket Brigade, also plaintiffs in the lawsuit, declined to comment.

Sierra Club attorneys are reviewing the latest permit approval to decide whether they will take further legal action. By reissuing the permit, the state Department of Conservation and Energy “continues to neglect its responsibility to protect the public health and welfare of all Louisianans,” their statement said.

In its new reasons for approving the permit, Conservation and Energy officials determined it was in the “best interest of the state” not to delay in reassessing the permit as reason for their speedy decision. This is, in part, related to the Trump administration’s “energy dominance” agenda, which calls for further expansion of industries like liquified natural gas.

The agency also justified its use of these external documents rather than doing its own research by citing the federal government’s decision to abandon its environmental justice analysis tools, following an executive order from President Donald Trump the day after he took office in January.

Benefits cited in the state’s permit approval include job creation. Commonwealth estimates it will employ an average of 800 construction workers per month, with a peak of 2,000, over the three-year period. Half of all these construction employees are expected to come from Cameron and Calcasieu parishes, according to the document.

The permit approval explanation did list downsides to the project, including the destruction of around 90 acres of coastal wetlands in Cameron Parish. State officials accounted for this, saying “these wetland impacts would be mitigated and would not have a significant cumulative impact on environmental justice communities.”

Community advocates like James Hiatt, director of nonprofit For a Better Bayou, question whether the state is acting in the best interests of its residents.

“The job is not to expedite permits and do whatever corporations want. Their job is to protect national resources, the public good, the public interest,” Hiatt said, citing ongoing issues in Cameron Parish with rapidly eroding coastal land and disproportionately high pollution levels in communities closest to the LNG export sites.

The Commonwealth LNG facility will be built 750 feet away from Allaire’s property line, he said, adding that he feels Cameron Parish won’t see enough of the economic benefit from these facilities to make up for all of the drawbacks.

“They keep saying, ‘Well, it’ll be mitigated by economic benefit to the community,’” he said. “But come on down here and see where the economic benefit to the community is. It’s not here.”",https://thelensnola.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/LNG-tanker-Cameron-Parish-1536x1024-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 17:03:57.335570

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the project investments in third-generation nuclear power technology will help advance Trump administration goals outlined earlier this year to boost that energy source domestically—particularly to insure U.S. energy security and gain global artificial intelligence dominance. “Advanced light water SMRs will give our nation the reliable, round-the-clock power we need ... support data centers and AI growth, and reinforce a stronger, more secure electric grid,” he said.

The funding actually stems from a Biden-era solicitation released in October 2024 using 2021 federal infrastructure act funding that includes another $100 million to be awarded later this year to support more deployments and address barriers in design, licensing, supply chain and site readiness, said DOE. But the Trump administration revised the solicitation last spring to remove required community benefit financial investments by winners.

DOE funding will assist TVA to build the first two-unit, estimated 600-MW GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 SMR at its Clinch River site in Tennessee by the early 2030s and plan future deployments with partners Indiana Michigan Power and BWX Technologies. The TVA development team also includes contractors Bechtel and Ontario-based Aecon, Duke Energy, Oak Ridge Associated Universities and the Electric Power Research Institute.

TVA's construction permit application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the BWRX-300 at Clinch River, submitted in May, still is under agency review. “This award affirms TVA’s continued leadership in shaping the nation’s nuclear energy future,” said Don Moul, TVA president and CEO of the independent federal corporate agency that supplies power to 10 million people in most of Tennessee, northern Alabama, northeastern Mississippi, southwestern Kentucky and smaller areas of neighboring states.

“Unlike previous nuclear construction projects in the U.S., contractors will work with [GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy] and TVA as a highly integrated project team to plan, design and potentially procure, construct and commission Clinch River Unit 1.” Bechtel said in January. “The integrated project delivery model is the preferred method that will make our project a true team effort,” said Bob Deacy, TVA senior vice president and its Clinch River project leader. “We will actively work together toward a target budget and schedule – creating a significant advantage to drive nuclear innovation, share risks and reduce costs.”

TVA also has signed public-private partnerships with other SMR developers in recent months, including Kairos Power and NuScale, as well as with nuclear fusion developer Type One Energy. TVA said it currently has about 11 GW of requested load for AI and data centers across its area, including from Google, Meta and xAI.

TVA’s technology collaboration partner Ontario Power Generation has started construction of four GE Vernova BWRX-300 units, with the first to be online by 2030 at its Darlington power plant. The province approved construction plans and awarded a contract in May to a partnership between Aecon and Kiewit Nuclear Canada for construction planning and execution, and project management. Aecon said its share of the contract is worth about $930 million.

GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy and design-build firm Samsung C&T in October also announced a strategic alliance to advance BWRX-300 SMR deployment in markets outside North America.

Going Modular in Michigan

Holtec's funding will aid company plans to deploy its dual-unit SMR-300 reactors at the site of the 800-MW Palisades nuclear power plant it owns and also seeks to restart in January in Covert, Mich., adding an additional 600 MW. The developer also signed an expanded alliance agreement with Hyundai Engineering & Construction to build a 10-GW fleet of SMR-300s in North America through the 2030s, beginning with the Palisades project. The contractors will manage reactor construction, deployment, operation, supply chain and power selling. Project cost has been estimated at $2.1 billion to $2.7 billion per reactor.

“Targeting first power by 2030, our Mission 2030 initiative will position the Palisades SMR project as the reference plant for all future SMR-300 deployments—domestically and globally,” said Holtec.

Company founder, chairman & CEO Krishna Singh told attendees of an American Nuclear Society conference last month that the company's SMR-300 reactor ""was born the day after"" the 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant meltdown in Japan, but it did not win DOE funding at the time because of agency disagreement on its design. Holtec self-funded the project, Singh noted, and will submit its design next year to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for limited work authorization.

According to a Holtec statement, “DOE’s support is an essential enabler of the Palisades SMR-300 project, moving it from development to deployment by building on the government’s prior support"" under the agency's Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program dating to 2020.

Holtec also has a $1.52-billion conditional loan from DOE for the Palisades restart, although the action faces new litigation from anti nuclear groups that have sued the developer and the commission in federal court.

Other lead applicants for the $900-million SMR federal funding included utility Arizona Public Service and developer Constellation, according to media reports.

DETROIT (AP) — President Donald Trump this week announced plans to weaken rules for how far automakers’ new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, set under former President Joe Biden.

The Trump administration said the rules, known formally as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards, are why new vehicles are too expensive, and that cutting them will drive down costs and make driving safer for Americans.

The new standards would drop the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles to roughly 34.5 mpg in the 2031 model year, down from the goal of about 50.4 mpg that year under the Biden-era rule.

Here are the facts.

Affordability

TRUMP: EV-friendly policies “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse.”

THE FACTS: It’s true that gas mileage standards have played a role in rising vehicle prices in recent years, but experts say plenty of other factors have contributed, and some much more.

Pandemic-era inventory shortages, supply chain challenges, tariffs and other trade dynamics, and even automakers’ growing investments in their businesses have also sent prices soaring. Average prices have also skewed higher as automakers have leaned into the costly big pickups and SUVs that many American consumers love.

The average transaction price of a new vehicle hit $49,105 in October, according to car shopping guide Edmunds.

A Consumer Reports analysis of vehicles for model years 2003 to 2021 — a period in which average fuel economy improved 30% — found no significant increase in inflation-adjusted vehicle prices caused by the requirements. At the same time, it found an average of $7,000 in lifetime fuel savings per vehicle for 2021 model year vehicles compared with 2003. That analysis, done primarily before the coronavirus pandemic, attributed much of the average sticker price increase to the shift toward bigger and more expensive vehicles.

Cutting the fuel economy standards is unlikely to provide any fast relief on sticker prices, said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ head of insights. And while looser standards may eventually mean lower car prices, their lower efficiency means that those savings could be eaten up by higher fuel costs, she said.

Ending the gas car?

TRUMP: Biden’s policies were “a quest to end the gasoline-powered car.”

THE FACTS: The Biden administration did enact several policies to increase electric vehicle adoption, including setting a target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act included tax incentives that gave car buyers up to $7,500 off the price of an EV and dedicated billions of dollars to nationwide charging — funding that Trump tried to stop. The Biden administration increased fuel economy requirements and set stricter tailpipe emissions limits.

While those moves sought to help build the EV market, there was no requirement that automakers sell EVs or consumers buy them. And gasoline cars still make up the vast majority of the U.S. market.

EV charging

TRUMP: “We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them.”

THE FACTS: While many potential EV buyers still worry about charging them, the availability of public charging has significantly improved in recent years.

Biden-era funding and private investment have increased charging across the nation. There are now more than 232,000 individual Level 2 and fast charging ports in the U.S. As of this year, enough fast charging ports have been installed to average one for every mile of National Highway System roads in the U.S., according to an AP analysis of data from the Department of Energy.

However, those fast charging stations aren’t evenly dispersed. Many are concentrated in the far West and the Northeast, where sales of EVs are highest.

Experts note that most EV charging can be done at home.

Safety

TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: The reduced requirements will make drivers “safer on the roads because of all the great new technology we have that save lives.”

THE FACTS: Newer vehicles — gas and electric — are full of advanced safety features, including automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping, collision warnings and more.

Duffy suggested that consumers will be more likely to buy new vehicles if they are more affordable — meaning fewer old cars on the streets without the safety technology. This assumes vehicle prices will actually go down with eased requirements, which experts say might not be the case. Besides, high tech adds to a vehicle’s cost.

“If Americans purchased more new vehicles equipped with the latest safety technologies, we would expect overall on-road safety to improve,” Edmunds’ Caldwell said. “However, it’s unclear whether easing fuel-economy standards will meaningfully increase new-vehicle sales.”

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent automotive research nonprofit, also says electric or hybrid vehicles are as safe as or safer than gasoline-powered cars.

Another part of safety is public health. Efficiency requirements put into place to address the 1970s oil crisis were also a way to reduce pollution that is harmful to humans and the environment.

“This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans,” said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All campaign. “This dangerous proposal adds to the long list of ways the Trump administration is dismantling our clean air and public health protections.”

The convergence of technological advancement, regulatory requirements, and corporate sustainability commitments creates unprecedented demand for alternative power systems in heavy equipment operations. Caterpillar battery-electric haul trucks represent a fundamental shift from traditional diesel-powered mining machinery, offering operators the potential to eliminate direct emissions while potentially reducing operational costs.

The mining sector's electrification journey extends beyond simple equipment substitution. It requires comprehensive infrastructure development, workforce retraining, and operational procedure restructuring. As mining companies pursue net zero emissions targets by 2050, the adoption of electric vehicles transforming mining becomes a critical component of decarbonization strategies.

Large-scale mining operations traditionally rely on diesel-powered heavy equipment due to power requirements, durability expectations, and remote location challenges. Electric alternatives must demonstrate equivalent performance capabilities while addressing unique operational demands including extreme weather conditions, continuous operation cycles, and limited charging infrastructure availability.

Understanding Caterpillar's Revolutionary 793 XE Battery-Electric Technology

Core Engineering Specifications and Performance Metrics

Caterpillar battery-electric haul trucks, specifically the 793 XE Early Learner models, represent a significant technological advancement in mining equipment electrification. These vehicles maintain the 256-ton payload capacity of their diesel predecessors while eliminating direct tailpipe emissions through battery-powered electric drivetrain systems.

The Early Learner designation indicates these vehicles operate as technology validation platforms rather than commercial production units. This approach allows mining operators to assess performance characteristics under real-world conditions while manufacturers gather operational data for future design improvements.

Key technical specifications include:

Maximum loaded velocity: 60 km/h operational speed capability

Grade climbing performance: Maintains 12 km/h on 10% inclines

Zero direct emissions: Complete elimination of tailpipe CO₂, NOx, and particulate matter

Regenerative braking: Energy recovery during descent cycles improves overall efficiency

Battery technology specifications and energy density metrics remain proprietary during the Early Learner phase. Real-world performance data collection will inform final commercial specifications for battery capacity, charging requirements, and operational range capabilities.

Operational Performance Under Real-World Mining Conditions

The deployment of Caterpillar battery-electric haul trucks at BHP's Jimblebar iron ore mine in Western Australia's Pilbara region represents the first large-scale testing of electric heavy haul technology in one of the world's most demanding mining environments. The Pilbara's extreme temperatures, dust conditions, and continuous operation requirements provide comprehensive validation conditions for electric drivetrain performance.

Tim Day, Western Australia Iron Ore Asset President at BHP, explained the comprehensive testing approach: ""These trials will help us understand how all the pieces of the puzzle fit together: the battery technologies, generation and charging infrastructure, power management, as well as the supply chains to potentially deliver this at scale.""

Operational validation focuses on several critical performance areas:

Energy consumption patterns across different haul profiles and load conditions

Temperature performance in extreme heat conditions exceeding 45°C

Duty cycle efficiency during continuous 24-hour mining operations

Maintenance requirements compared to diesel equivalents

Charging integration with existing mining logistics workflows

The harsh Pilbara environment provides accelerated testing conditions that simulate years of normal operational wear. Dust infiltration, temperature cycling, and vibration exposure will validate battery system durability and electric component reliability under extreme conditions.

What Makes the Early Learner Program a Game-Changer for Mining Electrification?

Strategic Partnership Framework and Deployment Model

The Early Learner program establishes an unprecedented collaborative framework between competing mining companies BHP and Rio Tinto, working jointly with equipment manufacturer Caterpillar. This partnership structure addresses the significant financial and technical risks associated with pioneering electric mining equipment adoption.

Andrew Wilson, Rio Tinto Iron Ore Managing Director Pilbara Mines, emphasized the necessity of industry collaboration: ""No single company can achieve zero emissions haulage on its own. It takes the whole industry working together. That's why we're working with BHP and Caterpillar to develop new solutions that will reduce emissions in mining and help us reach our net zero commitments.""

The collaborative approach provides several strategic advantages:

Risk distribution across multiple operators reduces individual company technology validation exposure

Accelerated learning through shared operational data and performance insights

Standardized protocols for equipment testing and performance benchmarking

Supply chain development supported by multiple major mining operators

Rio Tinto's 18 Pilbara mine operations require fleet electrification across diverse geological conditions and operational scales. The collaborative learning framework enables technology validation across multiple operational environments simultaneously rather than sequential individual company trials.

Field Testing Methodologies and Validation Protocols

The Jimblebar trial implements systematic performance validation methodologies designed to assess electric haul truck viability across multiple operational domains. Marc Cameron, Senior Vice President of Resource Industries Sales, Services and Technology at Caterpillar Inc., outlined the collaborative learning approach: ""By working side by side with our customers, we're delivering solutions to help them solve their toughest challenges while learning together each step of the way.""

Testing protocols address critical operational requirements:

Performance benchmarking against existing diesel 793F haul truck operations

Safety validation for electric system integration in mining environments

Maintenance procedure development for battery and electric drivetrain servicing

Infrastructure optimization for charging system integration

The trial structure includes progressive expansion phases:

Phase 1: Two-unit initial deployment and commissioning (current phase)

Phase 2: Expanded testing with additional vehicles subject to Phase 1 results

Phase 3: Independent scaled trials within BHP and Rio Tinto operational environments

WesTrac's designated role as logistics and technical support partner ensures infrastructure deployment leverages existing mining services networks rather than requiring completely new support systems.

How Do Battery-Electric Haul Trucks Address Mining Industry Decarbonization Goals?

Emissions Reduction Impact Analysis

Caterpillar battery-electric haul trucks deliver 100% elimination of direct operational emissions compared to diesel alternatives. This represents immediate Scope 1 emissions reduction for mining operators pursuing 2050 net zero commitments. The collaborative trial explicitly targets ""decarbonisation of Pilbara iron ore operations"" through validated technology advancement.

Direct Emissions Elimination Benefits:

Emission Type Diesel Impact Electric Impact Reduction CO₂ Emissions Continuous combustion Zero tailpipe 100% NOx Emissions High levels Zero direct 100% Particulate Matter Significant output Zero direct 100% Noise Pollution 85-95 dB operation 65-75 dB estimated 20-30% reduction

The emissions reduction calculations depend on electricity source composition. Furthermore, charging infrastructure powered by renewable energy solutions maximizes environmental benefits, while grid electricity with fossil fuel components reduces net environmental advantage.

Lifecycle emissions analysis requires comprehensive assessment including:

Battery manufacturing carbon footprint during production

Transportation emissions for component delivery and equipment deployment

End-of-life recycling processes for battery disposal and material recovery

Net Zero Operational Integration Strategies

Mining companies implementing electric haul trucks must integrate charging operations with broader renewable energy infrastructure development. The Pilbara region's abundant solar and wind resources provide opportunities for renewable-powered charging systems that maximize emissions reduction benefits.

Strategic Integration Requirements:

Renewable energy generation capacity sufficient for fleet charging demands

Energy storage systems for overnight and off-peak charging optimization

Grid integration technologies for load balancing and demand management

Smart charging protocols aligned with renewable generation patterns

BHP and Rio Tinto's 2050 net zero operational greenhouse gas emissions commitments require systematic fleet electrification across their combined Pilbara operations. Rio Tinto's 18-mine operational scale indicates that successful validation could drive adoption across hundreds of haul trucks within a single geographic region.

The collaborative trial framework recognises that ""decarbonisation of Pilbara iron ore operations will rely on technology advancements and breakthroughs in research and development"" rather than simple equipment substitution. Additionally, advances in battery recycling advancements will play a crucial role in ensuring sustainable end-of-life management for these vehicles.

What Infrastructure Transformations Are Required for Electric Mining Fleets?

Charging Infrastructure and Power Management Systems

Electric haul truck deployment requires comprehensive infrastructure transformation extending far beyond vehicle acquisition. Tim Day from BHP emphasised the systemic nature of the challenge: ""Replacing diesel isn't just about changing energy sources, it's about reimagining how we operate and creating the technologies, infrastructure and supply chains to transform mining operations.""

Critical Infrastructure Components:

High-capacity charging stations capable of rapid battery replenishment during shift changes

Power distribution systems sized for simultaneous charging of multiple vehicles

Backup power redundancy ensuring operational continuity during grid disruptions

Load management systems optimising charging schedules with operational requirements

The Jimblebar trial's infrastructure assessment addresses ""generation and charging infrastructure, power management"" as co-equal priorities with vehicle performance validation. This recognition indicates that successful electrification requires infrastructure development timelines aligned with equipment deployment schedules.

WesTrac's partnership role includes logistics support for infrastructure installation and maintenance, suggesting that existing mining services networks can adapt to support electric equipment requirements rather than necessitating entirely new service frameworks.

Mine Site Energy Ecosystem Development

Large-scale mining electrification necessitates transformation of mine site energy systems from diesel fuel logistics to electrical generation and distribution networks. The Pilbara region's remote location requires substantial electrical infrastructure development or on-site renewable generation capacity.

Energy System Integration Opportunities:

Solar photovoltaic installations leveraging abundant Pilbara sunshine for daytime charging

Wind generation systems providing complementary renewable energy during nighttime hours

Battery storage arrays enabling charging schedule optimisation independent of generation timing

Hybrid grid connections combining on-site renewable generation with regional electrical grid access

The infrastructure transformation extends beyond individual mine sites to regional electrical grid capacity. Multiple mining operations adopting electric fleets simultaneously could require coordinated grid infrastructure investment to support increased electrical demand.

Mining operations typically consume substantial electrical power for ore processing facilities. Electric haul truck charging represents additional electrical demand that must integrate with existing mine site power systems without disrupting processing operations.

How Do Operating Costs Compare Between Electric and Diesel Haul Trucks?

Total Cost of Ownership Analysis Framework

Operating cost comparisons between Caterpillar battery-electric haul trucks and diesel alternatives require comprehensive total cost of ownership analysis encompassing purchase price, energy costs, maintenance expenses, and operational efficiency factors. Early Learner program data collection will provide validated cost structure information for commercial deployment decisions.

Projected Annual Operating Cost Structure:

Cost Category Diesel Operations Electric Operations Variance Energy/Fuel $180,000-240,000 $60,000-90,000 -60% to -70% Maintenance $85,000-120,000 $45,000-65,000 -45% to -50% Parts & Components $35,000-50,000 $25,000-35,000 -30% to -35% Training & Skills $8,000-12,000 $12,000-18,000 +50%

Note: Cost figures are estimates based on industry analysis and require validation through operational trials. Actual costs depend on electricity rates, battery performance, and maintenance protocols developed during Early Learner testing.

Energy cost advantages depend heavily on electricity pricing compared to diesel fuel costs. Remote mining locations may face higher electricity costs due to transmission infrastructure requirements or on-site generation expenses that reduce cost advantages.

Productivity and Efficiency Metrics

Electric drivetrain technology offers potential productivity advantages through improved operational characteristics and reduced downtime requirements. Regenerative braking systems capture energy during loaded descents, improving overall energy efficiency compared to diesel alternatives that convert braking energy to waste heat.

Operational Efficiency Factors:

Reduced maintenance downtime through fewer moving parts and simplified drivetrain systems

Predictive maintenance capabilities enabled by advanced electric system monitoring and diagnostics

Consistent power delivery across operating conditions without engine performance variation

Quieter operation potentially enabling extended operating hours in noise-sensitive areas

Electric motor torque characteristics provide immediate maximum torque availability compared to diesel engines requiring optimal RPM ranges for peak performance. This characteristic could improve acceleration and hill climbing performance while reducing operator skill requirements for optimal efficiency.

Advanced telematics integration with electric systems enables real-time energy management optimisation, route planning for maximum efficiency, and predictive maintenance scheduling based on battery and component condition monitoring.

What Technical Challenges Must Be Overcome for Large-Scale Deployment?

Battery Technology and Energy Density Limitations

Current lithium-ion battery technology faces significant challenges in mining applications due to energy density limitations, charging time requirements, and performance degradation under extreme operating conditions. The Pilbara region's temperature extremes and dust exposure represent accelerated stress testing for battery system durability.

Critical Technical Limitations:

Energy density constraints requiring larger battery packs for equivalent operational range

Charging time requirements potentially disrupting existing operational scheduling

Temperature performance degradation in extreme heat conditions exceeding 45°C

Battery lifecycle management including capacity degradation and replacement scheduling

Mining operations typically require continuous 24-hour operational capabilities with minimal downtime for refueling or maintenance. Electric charging requirements must integrate with existing shift patterns and operational logistics without reducing productivity.

Battery degradation rates under mining conditions remain unvalidated through long-term operational data. The Early Learner program will provide critical performance data regarding battery capacity retention, temperature cycling effects, and vibration damage from off-road operation.

Operational Integration Complexities

Fleet transition from diesel to electric power requires systematic workforce development, maintenance infrastructure adaptation, and supply chain restructuring. The complexity extends beyond vehicle operation to encompass entire mining operational systems.

Integration Challenge Areas:

Operator training programs for electric system operation and safety protocols

Maintenance workforce retraining for battery and electric component servicing

Parts inventory management transitioning from diesel engine components to electric system parts

Service network development ensuring electric equipment support availability in remote locations

The trial's progressive expansion approach allows gradual workforce development and infrastructure adaptation rather than requiring immediate comprehensive operational changes. This phased approach reduces implementation risks while building internal capabilities systematically.

Supply chain adaptation requires development of electric component sourcing, battery replacement logistics, and specialised equipment support services in remote mining regions where traditional automotive electric vehicle infrastructure may not exist.

Which Mining Operations Are Leading the Electric Transition?

Pilot Project Performance Analysis

The BHP Jimblebar Early Learner deployment represents Australia's first Caterpillar battery-electric haul truck operational trial, positioning the Pilbara region as a global testing ground for mining electrification technology. The two-truck initial deployment provides baseline performance data for potential fleet-scale expansion.

Current Operational Status:

Location: Jimblebar iron ore mine, Pilbara region, Western Australia

Deployment: Two Cat 793 XE Early Learner units delivered December 2025

Operational Phase: Commissioning and initial testing protocols

Collaboration: BHP, Rio Tinto, and Caterpillar joint validation program

The trial design emphasises learning and technology validation rather than immediate operational replacement of diesel equipment. Ongoing testing protocols will determine viability for larger-scale deployment and inform approach for additional vehicle integration.

Following the joint trial, ""BHP and Rio Tinto will independently determine progress towards scaled trials within their respective operational environments."" This indicates that successful validation could lead to separate expanded trials across multiple mine sites within both companies' operations.

Geographic Distribution of Early Adoption

The Pilbara region's selection for initial trials reflects several strategic advantages for electric equipment validation:

Operational scale: Rio Tinto operates 18 Pilbara mines requiring fleet decarbonisation

Infrastructure proximity: Existing mining services and logistics networks

Environmental conditions: Extreme testing environment for technology validation

Renewable energy potential: Abundant solar and wind resources for charging infrastructure

Australia's mining sector leadership in electrification trials positions the region as a technology validation centre for global mining electrification. Successful Pilbara trials could accelerate adoption across other major mining regions including South America's copper operations and African mineral extraction sites.

The collaborative framework between competing mining operators suggests industry-wide recognition that electrification challenges require shared technology development rather than individual company competition in early adoption phases. This approach aligns with broader mining industry innovation trends.

How Will Electric Haul Trucks Impact Mining Equipment Manufacturing?

Supply Chain Transformation Requirements

Electric haul truck adoption requires fundamental supply chain restructuring across battery manufacturing, electric component sourcing, and charging infrastructure production. The transition from diesel engine supply chains to electric drivetrain systems represents a significant industrial transformation.

Manufacturing Capacity Requirements:

Battery production scaling for large-format mining equipment applications

Electric drivetrain component manufacturing capacity expansion

Charging infrastructure production and installation service networks

Specialised tooling and equipment for electric vehicle assembly and servicing

Caterpillar's Early Learner program approach indicates manufacturers are prioritising performance validation before committing to large-scale production capacity investment. This strategy reduces financial risk while gathering market demand data for production planning.

The mining equipment industry's traditional focus on durability and long service life requires electric component suppliers to meet higher reliability standards than typical automotive applications. Mining equipment operates continuously under extreme conditions with limited service access, demanding superior component quality and reliability.

Competitive Landscape Evolution

Caterpillar's Early Learner program provides first-mover advantage in large-scale mining electrification, potentially establishing market position before competitors develop comparable technology. The collaboration with major mining operators creates validated performance data that competitors lack.

Strategic Market Positioning:

Technology validation partnership with leading mining operators provides credible performance data

Service network leverage through WesTrac partnership ensures support infrastructure availability

Collaborative development approach reduces technology development costs through shared validation

Alternative original equipment manufacturers face pressure to develop competitive electric mining equipment offerings or risk market share loss as electrification adoption accelerates. The Caterpillar success story with Early Learner performance could establish performance benchmarks for industry-wide technology development.

Mining operator satisfaction with Early Learner performance could drive preference for Caterpillar electric equipment in future fleet expansion decisions, creating competitive advantage through early market entry and technology validation.

What Does the Future Hold for Mining Fleet Electrification?

Technology Roadmap and Development Timeline

Mining fleet electrification progress depends on battery technology advancement, charging infrastructure development, and operational cost validation through programs like the Caterpillar battery-electric haul trucks Early Learner initiative. Technology maturation timelines will determine industry-wide adoption rates.

Emerging Technology Pathways:

Next-generation battery chemistry developments improving energy density and reducing charging times

Solid-state battery integration potentially offering superior durability and temperature performance

Hydrogen fuel cell alternatives for applications requiring longer range and faster refueling

Autonomous operation integration with electric drivetrains for optimised energy management

The Early Learner program's learning outcomes will inform development priorities for commercial electric mining equipment. Performance data regarding battery lifecycle, charging requirements, and maintenance protocols will guide technology improvement investment decisions.

Advanced energy management systems could optimise electric fleet operations through predictive route planning, charging schedule optimisation, and regenerative braking maximisation. These capabilities require integration of artificial intelligence and advanced control systems with electric drivetrain technology.

Market Adoption Projections and Industry Impact

Mining industry electrification faces significant capital investment requirements, infrastructure development timelines, and technology validation periods that will moderate adoption rates despite environmental and operational advantages.

Adoption Timeline Factors:

Technology validation periods through Early Learner and similar programs (2-5 years)

Infrastructure development requirements for charging and power generation (3-7 years)

Capital investment cycles for fleet replacement and facility upgrades (5-15 years)

Regulatory drivers potentially accelerating adoption through emissions requirements

Successful validation at Jimblebar could accelerate adoption across BHP and Rio Tinto's combined operations, potentially driving demand for hundreds of electric haul trucks within the Pilbara region alone. This scale could support manufacturing capacity investment and cost reduction through volume production.

However, the transition must consider the broader context of critical minerals energy transition requirements and supply chain implications.

Investment Considerations for Mining Fleet Electrification

Mining companies evaluating electric haul truck adoption should assess: total cost of ownership including infrastructure development, operational efficiency gains from reduced maintenance requirements, environmental compliance advantages, and financing availability for electrification projects. Early adoption provides competitive advantage through operational cost reduction and regulatory compliance preparation.

Strategic Implementation Considerations for Mining Operators

Financial Planning and Investment Requirements

Electric haul truck adoption requires comprehensive financial planning encompassing vehicle acquisition costs, infrastructure development expenses, and operational transition investments. The Early Learner program provides validated cost data for accurate financial modelling.

Capital Investment Categories:

Equipment acquisition costs for electric haul trucks compared to diesel alternatives

Charging infrastructure installation and electrical system upgrades

Renewable energy generation capacity for sustainable charging operations

Workforce training and development programs for electric equipment operation

Mining operations typically plan equipment acquisitions over multi-year capital budgeting cycles. Electric fleet transition requires coordination of vehicle delivery schedules with infrastructure development timelines to ensure operational readiness.

Financial analysis must include potential carbon credit revenue, reduced fuel cost savings, and maintenance cost reductions to calculate comprehensive return on investment for electrification projects.

Risk Management and Implementation Strategy

The collaborative Early Learner approach demonstrates risk mitigation strategies for pioneering technology adoption. Shared validation costs and performance data reduce individual company exposure while accelerating technology development.

Risk Mitigation Approaches:

Phased deployment starting with limited vehicle quantities for performance validation

Collaborative programs sharing technology development costs across multiple operators

Flexible financing arrangements allowing adaptation based on performance results

Technology partnerships with equipment manufacturers for ongoing support and development

The Early Learner program's progressive expansion framework allows mining operators to adjust implementation strategies based on validated performance data rather than committing to large-scale deployment before technology validation.

Successful implementation requires coordination across operational, engineering, and financial departments to ensure comprehensive planning for technology transition, infrastructure development, and workforce preparation.

Disclaimer: This analysis is based on publicly available information and industry reports. Mining companies should conduct detailed feasibility studies and consult with equipment manufacturers before making electrification investment decisions. Performance projections and cost estimates are subject to validation through ongoing operational trials and technological developments.

Great British Energy has published its first Strategic Plan, outlining how the publicly owned company intends to accelerate the UK’s shift to clean power and strengthen the country’s industrial base. The document sets priorities for the next five years and demonstrates how public ownership can drive investment, support jobs and deliver tangible benefits to communities.

According to the plan, by 2030 GBE aims to deliver:

• at least 15 GW of new clean generation and storage capacity, enough to power the equivalent of nearly 10 million homes;

• up to £15 billion in mobilised private capital through GBE-backed projects and long-term partnerships;

• support for more than 1,000 local and community energy initiatives;

• over 10,000 jobs across the UK, including in regions traditionally reliant on oil and gas;

• a revenue-generating asset portfolio with returns reinvested into further capacity and opportunities.

GBE will operate both as a developer and an equity investor, securing a long-term public stake in clean energy infrastructure and reinvesting generated income into new projects.

The plan highlights three priority investment areas:

• GBE Local — ensuring communities and public services directly benefit from local clean energy assets;

• Onshore Energy — unlocking land-based energy potential and strengthening grid stability;

• Offshore Energy — accelerating the UK’s position in deep-water offshore wind and supporting long-term sector growth.

The document also details the £1 billion “Energy – Engineered in the UK” programme, aimed at strengthening domestic supply chains and supporting the delivery of the UK’s Industrial Strategy.

GBE CEO Dan McGrail said the plan demonstrates how public ownership can unlock investment, power communities and create jobs. Chair Juergen Maier stressed that the strategy puts the public at the centre of the energy transition. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband added that GBE is intended to become a national champion that helps harness the UK’s natural energy resources and provide abundant clean power.

(AP) — The Cooper family knows how to work heavy machinery. The kids could run a hay baler by their early teens, and two of the three ran monster-sized drills at the coal mines along with their dad.

But learning to maneuver the shiny red drill they use to tap into underground heat feels different. It’s a critical part of the new family business, High Altitude Geothermal, which installs geothermal heat pumps that use the Earth’s constant temperature to heat and cool buildings. At stake is not just their livelihood but a century-long family legacy of producing energy in Moffat County.

Like many families here, the Coopers have worked in coal for generations — and in oil before that. That’s ending for Matt Cooper and his son Matthew as one of three coal mines in the area closes in a statewide shift to cleaner energy.

“People have to start looking beyond coal,” said Matt Cooper. “And that can be a multitude of things. Our economy has been so focused on coal and coal-fired power plants. And we need the diversity.”

Many countries and about half of U.S. states are moving away from coal, citing environmental impacts and high costs. Burning coal emits carbon dioxide that traps heat in the atmosphere, warming the planet.

President Donald Trump has boosted coal as part of his agenda to promote fossil fuels. He’s trying to save a declining industry with executive orders, large sales of coal from public lands, regulatory relief and offers of hundreds of millions of dollars to restore coal plants.

That’s created uncertainty in places like Craig. As some families like the Coopers plan for the next stage of their careers, others hold out hope Trump will save their plants, mines and high-paying jobs.

Matt and Matthew Cooper work at the Colowyo Mine near Meeker, though active mining has ended and site cleanup begins in January.

The mine employs about 130 workers and supplies Craig Generating Station, a 1,400-megawatt coal-fired plant. Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association is planning to close Craig’s Unit 1 by year’s end for economic reasons and to meet legal requirements for reducing emissions. The other two units will close in 2028.

Xcel Energy owns coal-fired Hayden Station, about 30 minutes away. It said it doesn’t plan to change retirement dates for Hayden, though it’s extending another coal unit in Pueblo in part due to increased demand for electricity.

The Craig and Hayden plants together employ about 200 people.

Craig residents have always been entrepreneurial and that spirit will get them through this transition, said Kirstie McPherson, board president for the Craig Chamber of Commerce. Still, she said, just about everybody here is connected to coal.

“You have a whole community who has always been told you are an energy town, you’re a coal town,” she said. “When that starts going away, beyond just the individuals that are having the identity crisis, you have an entire culture, an entire community that is also having that same crisis.”

Phasing out coal

Coal has been central to Colorado’s economy since before statehood, but it’s generally the most expensive energy on today’s grid, said Democratic Gov. Jared Polis.

“We are not going to let this administration drag us backwards into an overreliance on expensive fossil fuels,” Polis said in a statement.

Nationwide, coal power was 28% more expensive in 2024 than it was in 2021, costing consumers $6.2 billion more, according to a June analysis from Energy Innovation. The nonpartisan think tank cited significant increases to run aging plants as well as inflation.

Colorado’s six remaining coal-fired power plants are scheduled to close or convert to natural gas, which emits about half the carbon dioxide as coal, by 2031. The state is rapidly adding solar and wind that’s cheaper and cleaner than legacy coal plants. Renewable energy provides more than 40% of Colorado’s power now and will pass 70% by the end of the decade, according to statewide utility plans.

Nationwide, wind and solar growth has remained strong, producing more electricity than coal in 2025, as of the latest data in October, according to energy think tank Ember.

But some states want to increase or at least maintain coal production. That includes top coal state Wyoming, where the Wyoming Energy Authority said Trump is breathing welcome new life into its coal and mining industry.

Planning for the future

The Coopers have gone all-in on geothermal.

“Maybe we’ll never go back to coal,” Matt Cooper said. “We haven’t (gone) back to oil and gas, so we might just be geothermal people for quite some time, maybe generations, and then eventually something else will come along.”

While the Coopers were learning to use their drill in October, Wade Gerber was in downtown Craig distilling grain neutral spirits — used to make gin and vodka — on a day off from the Craig Station power plant. Gerber stepped over his corgis, Ali and Boss, and onto a stepladder to peer into a massive stainless steel pot where he was heating wheat and barley.

Gerber’s spent three decades in coal. When closure plans were announced four years ago, he, his wife Tenniel and their friend McPherson brainstormed business ideas.

“With my background in plumbing and electrical from the plant it’s like, oh yeah, I can handle that part of it,” Gerber said about distilling. “This is the easy part.”

He used Tri-State’s education subsidies for classes in distilling, while other co-workers learned to fix vehicles or repair guns to find new careers. While some plan to leave town, Gerber is opening Bad Alibi Distillery. McPherson and Tenniel Gerber are opening a cocktail bar next door.

Everyone in town hopes Trump will step in to extend the plant’s life, Gerber said. Meanwhile, they’re trying to define a new future for Craig in a nerve-wracking time.

“For me, my products can go elsewhere. I don’t necessarily have to sell it in Craig, there’s that avenue. For someone relying on Craig, it’s even scarier,” he said.

Questioning the coal rollback

Tammy Villard owns a gift shop, Moffat Mercantile, with her husband. After the coal closures were announced, they opened a commercial print shop too, seeing it as a practical choice for when so many high-paying jobs go away.

Villard, who spent a decade at Colowyo as administrative staff, said she doesn’t understand how the state can throw the switch to turn off coal and still have reliable electricity. She wants the state to slow down.

Villard describes herself as a moderate Republican. She said political swings at the federal level — from the green energy push in the last administration to doubling down on fossil fuels in this one — aren’t helpful.

“The pendulum has to come back to the middle,” she said, “and we are so far out to either side that I don’t know how we get back to that middle.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the project investments in third-generation nuclear power technology will help advance Trump administration goals outlined earlier this year to boost that energy source domestically—particularly to insure U.S. energy security and gain global artificial intelligence dominance. “Advanced light water SMRs will give our nation the reliable, round-the-clock power we need ... support data centers and AI growth, and reinforce a stronger, more secure electric grid,” he said.

The funding actually stems from a Biden-era solicitation released in October 2024 using 2021 federal infrastructure act funding that includes another $100 million to be awarded later this year to support more deployments and address barriers in design, licensing, supply chain and site readiness, said DOE. But the Trump administration revised the solicitation last spring to remove required community benefit financial investments by winners.

DOE funding will assist TVA to build the first two-unit, estimated 600-MW GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 SMR at its Clinch River site in Tennessee by the early 2030s and plan future deployments with partners Indiana Michigan Power and BWX Technologies. The TVA development team also includes contractors Bechtel and Ontario-based Aecon, Duke Energy, Oak Ridge Associated Universities and the Electric Power Research Institute.

TVA's construction permit application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the BWRX-300 at Clinch River, submitted in May, still is under agency review. “This award affirms TVA’s continued leadership in shaping the nation’s nuclear energy future,” said Don Moul, TVA president and CEO of the independent federal corporate agency that supplies power to 10 million people in most of Tennessee, northern Alabama, northeastern Mississippi, southwestern Kentucky and smaller areas of neighboring states.

“Unlike previous nuclear construction projects in the U.S., contractors will work with [GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy] and TVA as a highly integrated project team to plan, design and potentially procure, construct and commission Clinch River Unit 1.” Bechtel said in January. “The integrated project delivery model is the preferred method that will make our project a true team effort,” said Bob Deacy, TVA senior vice president and its Clinch River project leader. “We will actively work together toward a target budget and schedule – creating a significant advantage to drive nuclear innovation, share risks and reduce costs.”

TVA also has signed public-private partnerships with other SMR developers in recent months, including Kairos Power and NuScale, as well as with nuclear fusion developer Type One Energy. TVA said it currently has about 11 GW of requested load for AI and data centers across its area, including from Google, Meta and xAI.

TVA’s technology collaboration partner Ontario Power Generation has started construction of four GE Vernova BWRX-300 units, with the first to be online by 2030 at its Darlington power plant. The province approved construction plans and awarded a contract in May to a partnership between Aecon and Kiewit Nuclear Canada for construction planning and execution, and project management. Aecon said its share of the contract is worth about $930 million.

GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy and design-build firm Samsung C&T in October also announced a strategic alliance to advance BWRX-300 SMR deployment in markets outside North America.

Going Modular in Michigan

Holtec's funding will aid company plans to deploy its dual-unit SMR-300 reactors at the site of the 800-MW Palisades nuclear power plant it owns and also seeks to restart in January in Covert, Mich., adding an additional 600 MW. The developer also signed an expanded alliance agreement with Hyundai Engineering & Construction to build a 10-GW fleet of SMR-300s in North America through the 2030s, beginning with the Palisades project. The contractors will manage reactor construction, deployment, operation, supply chain and power selling. Project cost has been estimated at $2.1 billion to $2.7 billion per reactor.

“Targeting first power by 2030, our Mission 2030 initiative will position the Palisades SMR project as the reference plant for all future SMR-300 deployments—domestically and globally,” said Holtec.

Company founder, chairman & CEO Krishna Singh told attendees of an American Nuclear Society conference last month that the company's SMR-300 reactor ""was born the day after"" the 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant meltdown in Japan, but it did not win DOE funding at the time because of agency disagreement on its design. Holtec self-funded the project, Singh noted, and will submit its design next year to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for limited work authorization.

According to a Holtec statement, “DOE’s support is an essential enabler of the Palisades SMR-300 project, moving it from development to deployment by building on the government’s prior support"" under the agency's Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program dating to 2020.

Holtec also has a $1.52-billion conditional loan from DOE for the Palisades restart, although the action faces new litigation from anti nuclear groups that have sued the developer and the commission in federal court.

Chevron fined $900K for air pollution monitoring failures at Richmond refinery, air district says

ABC7 News – December 3

Bay Area air quality regulators announced this Tuesday that Chevron was assessed with a $900,000 fine for air pollution monitoring failures at its Richmond refinery. Bay Area Air District officials said that portions of Chevron's air monitoring system were not “configured to detect the full range of potential emissions and were limited in how much emissions they could measure.” A Chevron spokesperson said that the company agreed to add a second set of monitors “that go above and beyond federal regulations,” a concession that “comes at high cost with little benefit.”

The new standards would drop the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles to roughly 34.5 mpg (55.5 kpg) in the 2031 model year, down from the goal of about 50.4 mpg (81.1 kpg) that year under the Biden-era rule.

Here are the facts.

Affordability

TRUMP: EV-friendly policies “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse.”

THE FACTS: It’s true that gas mileage standards have played a role in rising vehicle prices in recent years, but experts say plenty of other factors have contributed, and some much more.

Pandemic-era inventory shortages, supply chain challenges, tariffs and other trade dynamics, and even automakers’ growing investments in their businesses have also sent prices soaring. Average prices have also skewed higher as automakers have leaned into the costly big pickups and SUVs that many American consumers love.

The average transaction price of a new vehicle hit $49,105 in October, according to car shopping guide Edmunds.

A Consumer Reports analysis of vehicles for model years 2003 to 2021 — a period in which average fuel economy improved 30% — found no significant increase in inflation-adjusted vehicle prices caused by the requirements. At the same time, it found an average of $7,000 in lifetime fuel savings per vehicle for 2021 model year vehicles compared with 2003. That analysis, done primarily before the coronavirus pandemic, attributed much of the average sticker price increase to the shift toward bigger and more expensive vehicles.

Cutting the fuel economy standards is unlikely to provide any fast relief on sticker prices, said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ head of insights. And while looser standards may eventually mean lower car prices, their lower efficiency means that those savings could be eaten up by higher fuel costs, she said.

Ending the gas car?

TRUMP: Biden’s policies were “a quest to end the gasoline-powered car.”

THE FACTS: The Biden administration did enact several policies to increase electric vehicle adoption, including setting a target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act included tax incentives that gave car buyers up to $7,500 off the price of an EV and dedicated billions of dollars to nationwide charging — funding that Trump tried to stop. The Biden administration increased fuel economy requirements and set stricter tailpipe emissions limits.

While those moves sought to help build the EV market, there was no requirement that automakers sell EVs or consumers buy them. And gasoline cars still make up the vast majority of the U.S. market.

EV charging

TRUMP: “We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them.”

THE FACTS: While many potential EV buyers still worry about charging them, the availability of public charging has significantly improved in recent years.

Biden-era funding and private investment have increased charging across the nation. There are now more than 232,000 individual Level 2 and fast charging ports in the U.S. As of this year, enough fast charging ports have been installed to average one for every mile (1.6 kilometers) of National Highway System roads in the U.S., according to an AP analysis of data from the Department of Energy.

However, those fast charging stations aren’t evenly dispersed. Many are concentrated in the far West and the Northeast, where sales of EVs are highest.

Experts note that most EV charging can be done at home.

Safety

TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: The reduced requirements will make drivers “safer on the roads because of all the great new technology we have that save lives.”

THE FACTS: Newer vehicles — gas and electric — are full of advanced safety features, including automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping, collision warnings and more.

Duffy suggested that consumers will be more likely to buy new vehicles if they are more affordable — meaning fewer old cars on the streets without the safety technology. This assumes vehicle prices will actually go down with eased requirements, which experts say might not be the case. Besides, high tech adds to a vehicle’s cost.

“If Americans purchased more new vehicles equipped with the latest safety technologies, we would expect overall on-road safety to improve,” Edmunds’ Caldwell said. “However, it’s unclear whether easing fuel-economy standards will meaningfully increase new-vehicle sales.”

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent automotive research nonprofit, also says electric or hybrid vehicles are as safe as or safer than gasoline-powered cars.

Another part of safety is public health. Efficiency requirements put into place to address the 1970s oil crisis were also a way to reduce pollution that is harmful to humans and the environment.

“This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans,” said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All campaign. “This dangerous proposal adds to the long list of ways the Trump administration is dismantling our clean air and public health protections.”

While the long-term impacts of the elimination of the United States’ federal electric vehicle tax credit remain unknown, it’s clear that battery manufacturers in the country are starting to shift their approach toward grid-scale storage rather than EV batteries. LG Energy Solution, for instance, plans to expand its ESS facility in Michigan, and OEMs like SK and Samsung are entering the U.S. market as EV demand softens.

Still, for Ravi Manghani, the senior director of strategic sourcing at Anza Renewables, it’s more of a step-on-the-acceleration moment than a sudden change in strategy.

“We’ve seen the early signs of divergence take shape over the past several years, largely due to the way the Inflation Reduction Act structured its incentives,” he told ESS News, pointing out that the $7,500 federal EV credit required both the battery and its upstream materials to come from the US or allied countries with the storage investment tax credit (ITC) being tied mainly to domestic content. That’s part of what drove EV-focused battery OEMs to localize their US manufacturing footprints first.

Healthy forests are a key part of the climate puzzle — and they’ve been a big part of our advocacy in 2025!

In January of this year, CCL volunteers sent 7,100 messages to Congress urging them to work together to reduce wildfire risk. Soon after, the Fix Our Forests Act was introduced in the House as H.R. 471 and passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 279–141.

At our Conservative Climate Conference and Lobby Day in March, we raised the Fix Our Forests Act as a secondary ask in 47 lobby meetings on Capitol Hill. The next month, an improved version of the bill was then introduced in the Senate as S. 1462 and referred to the Senate Agriculture Committee.

The bill was scheduled for a committee vote in October. CCLers placed more than 2,000 calls to senators on the committee and generated a flurry of local media in their states before the vote. In October, the bill passed the Senate Agriculture Committee with strong bipartisan support.

It’s clear that this legislation has momentum! As the Fix Our Forests Act now awaits a floor vote in the Senate, let’s take a look back at our 2025 advocacy efforts to advance this bill — and why it’s so important.

Protecting forests and improving climate outcomes

Wildfires are getting worse. In the U.S., the annual area burned by wildfires has more than doubled over the past 30 years. In California alone, the acreage burned by wildfires every year has more than tripled over the past 40 years.

American forests currently offset 12% of our annual climate pollution, with the potential to do even more. We need to take action to reduce wildfire, so forests can keep doing their important work pulling climate pollution out of the atmosphere.

The bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act:

Protects America’s forests by supporting time-tested tools, like prescribed fire and reforestation, that make our forests healthy and able to better withstand and recover from severe wildfire and other extreme weather.

Protects communities across the nation by reducing wildfire risks to people, homes, and water supplies and adopting new technologies.

Protects livelihoods by supporting rural jobs and recreation areas and sustaining the forests that house and feed us.

CCL supports this bill alongside many organizations including American Forests, The Nature Conservancy, Environmental Defense Fund, National Audubon Society, The Western Fire Chiefs Association, The Federation of American Scientists and more.

A deeper dive into our efforts

All year long, CCL’s Government Relations staff has been in conversation with congressional offices to share CCL’s perspective on the legislation and understand the opportunities and challenges facing the bill. Our Government Relations team played a key role in helping us understand when and how to provide an extra grassroots push to keep the bill moving.

Starting Sept. 9 through the committee vote, CCLers represented by senators on the Senate Agriculture Committee made 2,022 calls to committee members in support of FOFA. CCL also signed a national coalition letter to Senate leadership in support of the bill, joining organizations like the American Conservation Coalition Action, Bipartisan Policy Center Action, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and more.

In October, we launched a local media initiative in support of FOFA, focused on states with senators on the Agriculture Committee. Volunteers published letters to the editor and op-eds in California, Minnesota, Colorado, and more. In one state, the senator’s office saw a CCLer’s op-ed in the local newspaper, and reached out to schedule a meeting with those volunteers to discuss the bill! CCL’s Government Relations team joined in to make the most of the conversation.

As soon as the committee vote was scheduled for October 21, our Government Relations staff put out a call for volunteers to generate local endorsement letters from trusted messengers. CCL staff prepared short endorsement letter templates for each state that chapters could personalize and submit to their senator’s office. Each version included clear instructions, contact info, and space for volunteers to add their local context, like a short story or relevant example of how wildfires have impacted their area.

Then, CCL state coordinators worked with the CCL chapters in their states to make sure they prepared and sent the signed letters to the appropriate senate office, and to alert CCL’s Government Affairs staff so they could follow up and keep the conversation going on Capitol Hill.

Individually, our voices as climate advocates struggle to break through and make change. But it’s this kind of coordinated nationwide effort, with well-informed staff partnering with motivated local volunteers, that makes CCL effective at moving the needle in Congress.

On October 21, the Fix Our Forests Act officially passed the Senate Agriculture Committee with a vote of 18-5.

Building on the momentum

After committee passage, FOFA is now waiting to be taken up by the full Senate for a floor vote. It’s not clear yet if it will move as a standalone bill or included in a package of other legislation.

But to continue building support, we spent a large portion of our Fall Conference training our volunteers on the latest information about the bill, and we included FOFA as a primary ask in our Fall Lobby Week meetings.

Volunteers are now messaging all senators in support of FOFA. If you haven’t already, add your voice by sending messages to your senators about this legislation. With strategy, organization, and a group of dedicated people, we can help pass the Fix Our Forests Act, reducing wildfire risk and helping forests remove more climate pollution.",https://citizensclimatelobby.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FOFA-header-image.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 18:02:43.187185

This came after many gathered to protest the data center outside of DTE’s Detroit headquarters earlier in the day, calling for more transparency.

Many raised concerns during the meeting that the approval process is being rushed, with many echoing Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s continued calls for a contested case hearing to fully explore the impact to DTE ratepayers and the environment.

“We really need to take our time with these things,” said Rachel Brown during public comment. “I don’t believe we have a lot of recourse once everything is completed to go back and fix the harms that they might be causing.”

DTE requested its expedited application be decided by Dec. 5, with Oracle, OpenAI and Related Digital planning to begin construction of the data center in early 2026. DTE said that their agreement with these companies includes a clause that could allow them to terminate it with 30 days' notice if the MPSC does not reach a decision by then. However, DTE’s application is not included in the MPSC’s Dec. 5 agenda.

Many questioned DTE’s claims that the data center contracts will not raise energy rates for its more than 1 million Michigan customers, which the company laid out in its 142-page, partially redacted application.

“We should not be taking DTE’s word here that rates won’t be impacted,” said Chris Gilmer-Hill, policy manager for the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition. “This project is unprecedented in Michigan’s history.”

“No one in the public knows the details of the heavily redacted plans, no one knows exactly how DTE plans to generate the 1.4 gigawatts of electricity,” said Bryan Smigielski, who also attended the Wednesday protest.

Others spoke in favor of the data center due to the construction jobs it would create, which Related Digital estimates to be more than 2,500.

“I think it's going to represent a historic opportunity for Michigan skilled trades,” said Dustin Bird, IBEW Local 252 union member. “I think this project is a win for the workers and it's a win for Michigan.”

In addition to those speaking during the two hours MSPC permitted for public comment, the commission received more than 5,000 comments online about the application.

You know, in terms of the impact it has on tax administration and tax policy, it’s significant.
Now, in terms of effect on tax policy, I think it’s jury still out.
And, you know, you have business taxpayers who maybe aren’t filing on the same timeline as individuals.
But there are a couple of provisions like the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.","Terry Gerton We’re a few weeks past the longest lapse in federal appropriations and maybe looking at another one in the end of January. So I want to work with you to put October and November into context. You’ve seen many shutdowns in your time on the Hill and now at Deloitte. How would you say this one differs from previous episodes, especially when it comes to your area of expertise, tax policy?

Anna Taylor Well, I do think it was different than what we’ve seen in years past. And part of that starts with just the way folks on the hill operated in it. I was really shocked that — my first sign that something was different was — I was shocked when I heard reporting that … the members and the staff that work in the Capitol building had left before we even hit midnight the night that we entered the shutdown. That’s not normal. In years past in shutdowns, you have frantic work happening behind the scenes where they’re trying to see if there’s any way to find a deal. And it was just obviously clear to all of them that they were so far away from a deal at that point that there was nothing to do. And so they left the building. And that was my first sign that this one was not normal and we were in for a longer shutdown. You know, in terms of the impact it has on tax administration and tax policy, it’s significant. You know, the fact that you had so many furloughed workers in the federal workforce and specifically at IRS and in Treasury, during that extended period definitely has an effect on customer service. It has an effect on their ability to move forward with their reg writing and guidance plans, which is in this moment, you know, where we’re just getting through a big piece of legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that was signed into law back in the summer, and they’re in a very significant guidance process to go along with that bill right now. There’s a lot of work that needs to get done … I know that you know, the treasury and the IRS said much of that work went on during the shutdown. So I do think that there was some of that that didn’t stop, which is a good thing for taxpayers, but had to slow it down in some capacity. And when you think about just customer service for taxpayers and not being able to call and find somebody on the phone to talk to, certainly there were challenges there as well. So I do think there was that, you know, kind of tangible direct effect. Now, in terms of effect on tax policy, I think it’s jury still out. Obviously there wasn’t any sort of deal that ended the shutdown with additional legislation. So we didn’t have some big tax package coming out of the — sometimes you do see some sort of legislative deal come out of a — well, not often with a shutdown. Normally nobody wins in a shutdown. But when you’re reaching appropriations deals that don’t end in shutdown, sometimes you’ll see tax legislation attached to those kinds of deals. And, you know, we didn’t have that … There were not regular hearings and regular markups happening in the tax writing committees while we were in shutdown. And so there was probably a slowdown in some bills that are maybe under consideration because they weren’t being considered during the shutdown. And so I do think that probably it definitely had a direct effect on taxpayers who may have had an impact on customer service, but there’s also that effect of maybe slowing down policymaking as well.

Terry Gerton I’m speaking with Anna Taylor. She’s managing principal of the Tax Policy Group at Deloitte. Well, let’s talk about the specific impact on taxpayers. I mean, filing season is going to open in just a few weeks. Is there a reasonable expectation that the IRS and all of the companies that support tax filing will have written in the rules for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act provisions and anything else that might come up before the year end? Are tax filers going to have the systems ready to go?

Anna Taylor Well, I think that the Treasury and IRS have done a — they’ve made a real effort to try to get to the things from that bill first that were going to need to be implemented for taxpayers at the beginning of 2026. So I think in most cases, you have … already seen guidance come out on those things that are affecting individual taxpayers, like … the tipped income deduction and overtime pay, things like that. So they have already put out quite a bit of guidance in those spaces that will have a direct effect on individual taxpayers. There’s still a lot to go though. And, you know, you have business taxpayers who maybe aren’t filing on the same timeline as individuals. Some of that important guidance is still yet to come. But I do think that because of the thinking about the kind of end year for individuals, the administration has tried to prioritize those things that are going to need to be known on day one of the new year.

Terry Gerton That’s good to hear. You also mentioned the congressional tax writing committees and certainly as Congress has come back, the committees have quite a backlog. Can you give us any insight as to what they may be talking about in those committees?

Anna Taylor Well, they do have a full agenda. I mean, I think the first thing that you’re hearing a lot about if you turn on any news outlet right now is of course the thing that landed them in the shutdown to begin with, finding some sort of path forward on those Affordable Care Act premium tax credit — the enhancements for those credits. They didn’t reach any deal before they came out of the shutdown, but they did agree to keep working on it. So there was an agreement as part of coming out of that shutdown where Majority Leader Thune in the Senate said he will hold another round of votes on those credit extensions by the middle of December. So I do think that there’s conversations happening, both bipartisan and partisan, to see if there’s a path forward on figuring out a way to deal with health care costs and insurance premium costs. So that’s taking up a lot of time right now. In addition to that, there is interest from the committees to try to move some things that they’ve been working on for a while on a bipartisan basis. These are things that have been in works for years, honestly, and have pretty broad consensus support. Things like, you know, there’s a tax treaty with Taiwan that has moved through regular order in both the House and the Senate that I think people would like to see get over the finish line. There is, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee have worked on — they haven’t actually processed legislation, but they’ve put out a joint white paper on tax administration. So just some changes to make the system work better for taxpayers. I think that’s something they’re interested in trying to see if there’s opportunities to move together. And then there are a few expiring tax provisions on the business side of the ledger that haven’t been dealt with this year. You know, a lot of the expiring provisions on the individual side were included in that one big beautiful bill act back in the summer. But there are a couple of provisions like the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. That’s an important one that does have an effect on people’s ability to get a job and on business’s ability to hire. And so that’s one that is set to expire at the end of this year that I do think there’s probably bipartisan interest in extending. So those are all things I think on the near-term agenda, if they’re in an environment to be able to move some bipartisan legislation. And we all know right now that’s a big no.

Terry Gerton Well, speaking of that environment, 2026 is an election year for many members of Congress. Do you think in that environment they really will be able to move some of these big pieces of tax legislation or will they maybe just nibble around the edges?",https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Congress_Tax_Cuts_23265-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 16:03:42.720419

How? We’ll give you three ways:

Upgrade home tech: 20–50 percent lower bills

Fix who pays: 5–40 percent lower bills for the half of US households that most need it

Cut red tape and invest faster: 5–25 percent lower bills

To be clear, these are quick, high-level calculations based on reputable sources. But we also have deeper analysis underway to provide more specifics. In the meantime, the conversation today around energy affordability is too often muddled. Many people are unclear on the interlinked causes and potential solutions for rising energy costs, despite seeing it as a crucial issue.

In this article we will:

Clarify the challenge, the stakes. and our focus;

Outline the causes of the problem; and

Provide solutions and a holistic framework that includes new solutions and specific insights for states and regions.

What are we trying to solve?

Energy affordability is a critical issue for America. People need affordable energy to ensure a decent quality of life and be financially stable. We also require affordable energy to support a strong and growing economy.

Yet energy costs are rising, and more Americans are feeling the pinch. Electricity rates rose 6.6 percent in the past year nationally, but over 20 percent in some states. Worse yet, natural gas prices are up 80 percent since 2024 and will double by 2026. That will further increase electricity costs since 40 percent of US electricity comes from natural gas. In fact, electricity rates rose twice as fast and natural gas four times as fast as inflation this year.

Even before these latest increases, one in three US households have had to reduce or forgo food or other basic necessities and one in seven families live in severe energy poverty in the United States.

In 2024, President Trump declared a goal of cutting energy bills in half. It’s a worthy goal. Can we bring it to fruition?

What is energy affordability?

Energy affordability is the ability of a household to pay for their energy use while also paying for other basic living expenses without forgoing basic necessities or risking health and safety. This matters because people often skip food or medical needs to pay for energy. They need to keep driving to work and keep the heat on. High bills can lead to disconnections that can result in health problems or even death.

Many people talk about energy burdens and energy affordability only in terms of their home utility bills. But transportation costs can also have a huge energy cost and create a greater energy burden.

What are people spending on energy?

A report from EPRI shows that the average US household spent $5,530 on energy in 2024, and over half of that was on gasoline. Many energy affordability conversations only focus on utility bills, but gasoline bills are often more than electricity and natural gas combined.

With the median US household income at $83,730 in 2024, energy costs — including transportation — make up 6.6 percent of a family’s income.

But averages and medians don’t tell the real story here. The real affordability challenge is for the lower half of US households by income, where most households spend over 10 percent of their income on energy.

What causes unaffordable energy?

In order to make energy bills affordable, we must first understand what makes them un-affordable. The energy system is complex and varied. Many efforts to address affordability only look at one area. This is like the old story about people in a dark building encountering different parts of an elephant and thinking each part is something else. We want to look at the whole elephant.

Some parts of the elephant will matter more or less for different people, but all of it is relevant. States have different laws and weather risks, utilities manage their costs differently, and people have different homes, equipment, cars, etc. All of this can change what the biggest causes are for high energy costs.

Our focus here is on energy bills — this is where people run into the sum of all these factors in one tangible question: how much do they have to pay for energy? It’s an important matter that gets discussed at kitchen tables across the country.

To clarify the complexity and capture all the major factors, we offer this framework:

People’s energy bills are based on four things:

Energy Use How much energy we use, which we have the most control over. The causes of high bills include:

Inefficient buildings, appliances, and vehicles

User actions

Who Pays What How the rules are set up for who pays for what parts of our energy system:

The fuel or electricity delivered to us

Upgrades to pipes and wires

Emergency responses

Market fluctuations

A variety of utility incentives that are misaligned with social and/or consumer goals

Energy System The costs built into how we provide and deliver energy. These are institutional structures that generally require market or policy changes. This includes:

Supply chain costs (including electricity generation)

Transmission and distribution costs

Natural gas, coal, and oil prices, which are highly volatile

Wider World Impacts These factors are less predictable and are not part of the energy system’s design, but they have big impacts on the above. This includes:

Extreme weather and wildfires

New external pressures such as AI development, inflation, tariffs, geopolitics, etc.

Financing costs and cost of capital

How do we make energy affordable?

We can take action on each of these causes to unlock big savings. And we can do this without losing the quality of energy services. In fact, these solutions often make reliability and security better. Here’s what we have to do to increase affordability:

Specifically, here are some options for each:

Efficiency already saves average American more than $1,000/year. And energy saved at home creates big savings across the whole energy system. Here are some of the top actions:

Fix the shell: Fixing a home’s air leaks can save 10–20 percent. And insulation can do more.

Better home equipment: Upgrading thermostats, lights, AC, and heating systems offers big bill savings.

Better vehicles: Electric vehicles (EVs) offer better performance with less energy and maintenance. This includes cars and e-bikes. And used EVs are often cheaper to buy than gas counterparts.

Use the best rates: Make use of time-of-use rates to use electricity at its lowest costs, such as running your dishwasher overnight instead of during the evening. Also, use dedicated EV or heat pump rates where available. This can drive down costs for all customers

Participate in virtual power plants (VPPs): A VPP lets customers get paid for helping the grid. Get paid when you hold off on using power (with smart appliances) or provide power to the grid through home or EV batteries. Most states have VPP programs.

Policymakers have four main tools to change the rules of who pays for what:

Fix utility incentives: Our current system gives utilities some incentives that make prices go up. Economic dispatch, fuel cost sharing, and performance-based ratemaking can help.

Create guardrails for homes: We can end energy poverty while benefitting the entire energy system through things like percentage-of-income payment plans (PIPPs), debt management plans, and large-load tariffs (to make sure energy customers like AI data centers don’t put a strain on customers).

Reform transportation funding: Who pays and who benefits from highway funding isn’t aligned. This includes making commercial trucks pay for their share of road upkeep (as the Cato Institute has proposed) and investing in more transportation options so people can save $750 a year on average by reducing fuel and maintenance costs.

Public investments in infrastructure: We can invest public funds in wildfire response, grid resilience, or long-distance transmission expansion, instead of putting that on customers.

We can accelerate investment in energy infrastructure and affordable resources to improve costs for consumers. There are many ways to do this, but here are some of our favorites:

Interconnection and permitting reform: Upgrade the bureaucracy or get it out of the way, so we can build faster and lower the costs of new resources.

Virtual power plants: As discussed above, these can benefits customers, but they also strengthen the grid and can cut utility costs by 20 percent.

Upgrade the grid: Installing or replacing grid equipment with grid-enhancing-technologies is cost-effective and lets us bring affordable energy online faster.

Power couples: Marry needs by building new facilities near existing grid connection sites allowing us to build faster and cheaper.

Lowering bills now and later

For immediate relief, homeowners should look for opportunities to improve their energy use, especially when they replace equipment or vehicles. Policymakers can also take action on fast-acting solutions. We will need longer-term solutions as well, which need to be launched now to create benefits down the road.

We can use this framework to understand the specific causes and solutions needed on a state-by-state basis. Some of that work is already captured in our Energy Poverty Policy Simulator, and we will build out more state-by-state insights in the year ahead.

RMI is also working to support decision makers to match energy bill solutions to their authority (for example: best practices for governors and our electricity affordability toolkit for policymakers). We are also creating spaces for peer learning to scale up the cost-saving ideas that can work quickly (for example: Reg Lab).

We can enact the solutions above now in most places. We don’t have to wait for new solutions, but innovations are welcome. RMI will continue to work with leaders across the country to make energy affordable.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/iStock-2165132898-energy-bills-e1764715926889.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 16:03:33.938638

Follow them at therevolvingdoorproject.org.

Thanks to President Donald Trump and his toadies, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is in disarray. The past couple of weeks at the agency have been particularly tumultuous. A second unqualified acting administrator, David Richardson, resigned. Meanwhile, Trump’s FEMA Review Council missed its deadline to publish recommendations for “reform.” Ordinary people are already paying the price for Trump’s assault on the agency.

Still, on the whole we’ve been lucky this year. No hurricanes made landfall in the United States in 2025—the first time that’s happened in a decade. This was very fortunate considering how badly things probably would have gone had a major storm hit a society weakened by Trump’s government demolition blitz.

In any case, our meteorological luck will eventually run out. Within U.S borders, it was a quiet hurricane season, but nearby Jamaica got smashed by Melissa, a climate change–fueled storm that grew from Category 1 to 4 in less than 24 hours, eventually reaching Category 5 status. Melissa was tied for the strongest hurricane in Atlantic history at landfall, and it also set a new record for fastest wind gust ever measured at 252 miles per hour. Something like that will hit America, almost certainly before 2028, and when it does, the devastating effects of Trump’s FEMA attacks should be indisputable—if effectively broadcast to the public.

What has he done? The usual Trump formula. He’s slashed agency staff and unlawfully impeded the flow of congressionally appropriated funds. He’s politicized disaster relief, delaying or denying funding for regions hit by crisis, especially places he perceives as anti-Trump. And he’s axed long-term initiatives to protect and ruggedize communities at risk of climate disasters. In short, the Trump administration has effectively outsourced soaring disaster costs to ill-equipped states, profit-seeking insurers, and, ultimately, helpless individuals. We might call it “build back worse.”

One might say that at least the agency hasn’t been abolished outright, as Trump and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem have repeatedly called for. And the Review Council’s report, still anticipated before the end of the year, is not expected to endorse the elimination of FEMA.

However, on closer examination, the goal appears to be de facto rather than overt destruction of FEMA. Noem’s comments have often used a variation of ending the agency “as it exists,” including after the July floods that killed more than 130 people in Central Texas, and Trump has used phrases like “getting rid of,” “overhauling,” and “reforming” interchangeably. The common denominator has been forcing states to shoulder the burden of disaster management even though they lack sufficient personnel and fiscal resources—a reality made worse by the Trump administration’s moves to choke off relevant funding. Trump’s devolution playbook comes straight from Project 2025. That right-wing policy blueprint, the brainchild of Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, calls for shrinking the federal government’s role in emergency management by shifting “the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities.” Underneath the semantic inconsistency, the reality is that the White House has been dismantling FEMA for ten months.

In her role as FEMA Review Council co-chair, Noem is tasked with finalizing the body’s (nonbinding) guidance before sending it to Trump’s desk. Noem and her top adviser, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, are reportedly reshaping the document in significant ways. Among other things, the council’s original, 160-page draft advocated for elevating FEMA to an independent, cabinet-level office and enabling communities to rebuild in ways that reduce disaster risk. In contrast, Noem’s unfinished, 20-page report recommends keeping the agency within DHS, and it “removes any mention of mitigation programs and slashes preparedness dollars for local emergency management agencies,” two unnamed sources told the Associated Press.

It’s quite obvious what is going on here. Trump, Noem, and Vought have demonstrated that it’s possible to critically incapacitate an agency without formally quashing it.

How Trump Paralyzed FEMA

By early May, the Trump administration had pushed out more than 2,000 FEMA workers, nearly one-third of the agency’s full-time staff, with decades of combined experience. That includes most senior executives, who were replaced by DHS personnel with little to no disaster management expertise.

In addition to downsizing FEMA, the Trump administration has used several tactics to illegally withhold billions of dollars in federal disaster-related funding. In January and February, DHS implemented multiple spending reviews and freezes in a cruel effort to avoid assisting undocumented immigrants even “incidentally.” Since March, DHS has made the disbursement of certain funds contingent on cooperation with Trump’s racist mass deportation agenda, provoking a legal battle. The administration has continued to block funding despite being ordered multiple times to stop. It recently threw up additional roadblocks, prompting another lawsuit.

Among other things, the Trump administration’s lawless and punitive funding moves have disrupted the Emergency Management Performance Grant program, which is used to train and pay state and local emergency management staff—that is, the people the White House says should be taking on a greater share of disaster planning and response. Another key source of paralysis has been Noem’s requirement, established in June, that she personally approve every contract or grant valued over $100,000.

The lethal consequences of all this were on full display in Central Texas over the July 4th weekend. When a heavy storm dumped more than 20 inches of rain in some locations, driving the Guadalupe River up 26 feet in just 45 minutes, the damage to local communities was apocalyptic. In response, Noem waited more than 72 hours to authorize the deployment of FEMA’s Urban Search and Rescue teams. Texas officials’ request for aerial imagery, which FEMA provides to help search and rescue operations, was also needlessly delayed as it awaited Noem’s approval. In addition, Noem let the contracts for hundreds of call center workers lapse on July 5 and didn’t renew the contracts until July 10. Thousands of calls to FEMA’s disaster assistance line went unanswered as a result.

Agency employees made clear that Noem’s onerous grant approval rule “is absolutely hampering our ability to provide immediate assistance.” One FEMA worker bluntly stated that if the White House were to respond to a hurricane in the same manner it responded to the Texas flooding disaster, the results would be catastrophic.

Naturally, administration officials refused to admit error. Noem insisted she had done nothing wrong. Then-acting FEMA chief Richardson told a House panel that the Trump administration’s response to the deadly Texas floods is a “model of how disasters should be handled.” The Washington Post later reported that Richardson, who didn’t visit the disaster zone until nine days after flooding began, had been unreachable for more than 24 hours, contradicting his testimony to lawmakers.

The United States was fortuitously spared from hurricanes this year. But there have been plenty of other extreme weather events during Trump’s second term—from severe winter storms to tornadoes and flash floods. In every case, his administration has bungled the response, even in loyal MAGA regions.

Weaponizing Disaster Relief

Trump’s record is even worse in blue regions. As of December 4, he had approved 37 major disaster declarations requested by governors and tribal chief executives. All but one have included partial rejections of certain items. He has also denied at least 12 extreme weather–related requests. A dozen weather-related requests, including five appeals, are pending. All of that is according to the Revolving Door Project’s tally, which is based on information gleaned from FEMA’s daily operations briefing and other publicly available records.

With a handful of exceptions, Trump has been letting major disaster declaration requests accumulate for weeks at a time before dealing with them in batches. This approach keeps disaster-stricken communities waiting far longer than they would if Trump processed requests on a running basis. It’s not unusual for Trump to take more than six weeks to approve requests. Such avoidable delays force state and local governments to confront disasters without federal emergency response support for extended periods of time, needlessly imperiling lives and infrastructure.

On October 22, his most recent “decision day,” Trump partially approved four requests. When announcing his decisions on Truth Social, the president heaped praise on Alaska, North Dakota, and Nebraska—states he’s won multiple times. The same day, Trump denied a pair of requests from Illinois (a state he lost by 11 points in 2024) and another from Vermont (31 points). In addition, he rejected an appeal from Maryland (29 points). All three states had previously sued the Trump administration for withholding emergency preparedness funding and shuttering FEMA’s foremost pre-disaster mitigation program. Trump’s aggressively partisan rhetoric elicited concerns about the extent to which his aid allocations are politically motivated.

The Illinois rejections were particularly noteworthy given the scale of destruction documented by FEMA. According to E&E News, since FEMA began publishing damage assessments in 2007 and calculating damage-to-wealth ratios in 2019, presidents have approved requests for individual assistance every time the ratio exceeded 12.5—until now. Trump denied Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker’s requests even though late-July and mid-August storms in the Chicago metro area yielded respective damage-to-wealth ratios of 39 and 71 (the latter being an all-time high). The denial letters, which state that aid “is not warranted,” came two weeks after Trump said that Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson “should be in jail.” Both are Democrats who have criticized and resisted Trump’s efforts to terrorize immigrants. Pritzker appealed both rejections on November 21.

There is certainly reason to worry about Trump transforming post-disaster relief into a political weapon. But it’s also worth noting that he has spurned Republican-controlled states on multiple occasions, too. That includes Tennessee and Arkansas, whose governor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, is a major Trump ally. So while recent rejections could herald a ramping up of politicized aid denials, we shouldn’t lose sight of Trump’s broader abdication of the federal government’s disaster-related responsibilities, which has also hurt red states and counties (which exist in blue states, too).

Disaster recovery is a long-term process, so FEMA’s obligations extend beyond providing immediate relief to individual victims. Historically, state and local governments have fronted money for disaster recovery. Then, after submitting receipts and invoices to FEMA, they get repaid through the public assistance program, often for several years, as rebuilding takes time. In addition to denying several new requests for public assistance, Trump has stalled the outlay of money meant to compensate jurisdictions for past recovery spending. As the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has explained, this is endangering the budgets of cash-strapped localities as they attempt to bounce back from earlier disasters.

On April 12, then-acting FEMA administrator Cameron Hamilton sent a memo to an Office of Management and Budget official outlining ways to reduce the federal government’s financial contributions to disaster-torn communities. The memo called for quadrupling the damage threshold a state would need to meet to qualify for public assistance. It also called for strictly limiting the federal cost share for disaster recovery to 75 percent. Under current guidelines, the federal government covers at least 75 percent of costs, though it will temporarily reimburse states up to 100 percent in certain cases.

After Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina in 2024, for instance, the Biden administration agreed to cover 100 percent of the costs of debris removal and some other forms of assistance. North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein (D) asked the Trump administration to extend this arrangement for an additional six months. But on April 11, one day before his memo was published, Hamilton denied Stein’s request. In an appeal letter, Stein explained how much even a three-month extension would help, but the Trump administration rejected his request in May. The decision will cost North Carolina hundreds of millions of dollars and derail the recovery process.

By the time North Carolina’s appeal was rejected, Hamilton had been fired—one day after telling members of Congress that FEMA should not be abolished. (Noem reportedly had been planning to oust Hamilton for some time before that for not moving aggressively enough to dismantle the agency.) This is ironic given the extent to which the policies promoted by Hamilton—including in his April 12 memo as well as a March 25 memo titled “Abolishing FEMA”—would undermine the country’s disaster response system in practice. An Urban Institute analysis estimated that if the provisions in Hamilton’s April 12 memo had been in place, 71 percent of major disasters declared from 2008 to 2024 would not have qualified for public assistance, and state and local governments would have lost out on $41 billion in aid.

Although the FEMA Review Council recommended maintaining the current cost share arrangements, Noem is reportedly seeking to reduce the federal cost share to 50 percent. That would prevent tens of billions of dollars from reaching disaster-stricken cities and towns in desperate need of federal resources, ultimately making full recoveries impossible.

Killing Disaster Mitigation

In addition to raising the public assistance threshold, Hamilton’s April 12 memo also advocated for halting the automatic approval of hazard mitigation grants when issuing major disaster declarations. When governors ask the president for a major disaster declaration, they typically request hazard mitigation funding—which enables statewide investments to prevent the occurrence and diminish the impacts of future disasters—along with individual and public assistance.

Historically, those requests have been rubber-stamped as part of a disaster declaration. However, after greenlighting three requests for hazard mitigation grants early in his term, Trump has not approved a request for such funding since March. On April 4, Trump approved Virginia’s request for a major disaster declaration but chose not to include hazard mitigation money as part of the federal aid package. According to E&E News, that marked the first time on record that a president excluded hazard mitigation funding when declaring a major disaster. Trump has gone on to repeat this pattern.

Trump’s ongoing suspension of the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program is just one example of how his administration has stymied risk reduction and climate adaptation. In February, the Trump administration ordered FEMA to cease work related to improving building codes. FEMA also announced that it would stop enforcing a standard requiring public buildings damaged in flood zones to be rebuilt in a way that averts future flood damage to qualify for federal funding.

On April 4, the Trump administration took down a notice announcing $600 million in Flood Mitigation Assistance funding for 2025. It also canceled FEMA’s flagship Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities grant program and clawed back more than $3 billion for projects that had been authorized but not started. In mid-July, 20 states sued the White House for axing this initiative, which aims to proactively buttress neighborhoods before wildfires and storms arrive. Litigation is ongoing.

Most of the aforementioned attacks came after Noem ordered FEMA to halt work related to climate change and to eradicate the use of climate-related terms, citing executive orders issued by Trump. That the White House is cutting risk reduction programs now—as billion-dollar disasters increase in frequency and the average length of time between such events decreases, from 82 days in the 1980s to 19 days over the past decade—is yet another example of the economic madness of climate denialism.

Indeed, investing to prepare for severe weather actually saves money—an estimated $6 to $13 for every $1 invested—as well as lives. It is much cheaper to build a stronger house than rebuild an entirely new one after it blows down.

Looking Ahead

It’s difficult to overstate how much harm Trump’s assault on FEMA has unleashed. On August 25, a few days before the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina’s landfall, more than 180 FEMA workers tried their best to sound the alarm. In an open letter, they warned that the Trump administration’s actions are increasing the odds of a Katrina-scale calamity. The next day, several of the whistleblowers were placed on administrative leave, and FEMA subsequently opened an investigation into the letter’s anonymous signatories. Some of the suspended workers were reinstated on December 1, but that decision was quickly reversed after DHS leaders found out.

In early September, the Government Accountability Office published the first report in a series designed to communicate the growing vulnerability of the country’s disaster response system. In mid-October, current and former FEMA staff issued additional warnings at a rally in front of the agency’s headquarters. Though FEMA’s problems predate Trump, he has exacerbated them, and his administration’s retaliatory streak only exemplifies its recklessness.

On December 1, DHS official Karen Evans, a key player in suppressing disaster-related spending, replaced Richardson as acting FEMA chief. Like both of her predecessors, Evans lacks emergency management experience, a statutory requirement that Trump has circumvented by appointing acting leaders.

Long term, the Trump administration is reportedly considering relocating FEMA’s headquarters to Texas and putting Nim Kidd, leader of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, in charge of the national agency. White House officials interviewed Kidd for the gig in February, but he declined, opting to stay in Texas. Kidd and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) are members of the FEMA Review Council, which is expected to recommend moving the agency’s headquarters to the state.

Even as extreme weather increases in frequency and intensity due to past and present planet-heating emissions, the Trump administration is pulling out all the stops to expand fossil fuel pollution—guaranteeing worse conditions for years to come. Through its crusade against science and forecasting, the administration is blunting our ability to understand and warn people about the fatal reverberations of climate breakdown. The administration’s hostility toward disaster prevention and its abandonment of victims in their moment of greatest need—including ending door-to-door canvassing in disaster zones—are the final nails in the coffin.

Ultimately, whoever ends up leading Trump’s FEMA will be tasked with advancing the president’s war on our collective ability to mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters of all kinds. That task, one of the original purposes of government, elicits nothing but contempt from MAGA.

This is worse than negligence. It is among the clearest evidence we have of the Trump administration’s disdain for human life itself.",https://prospect.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/RDP-120525.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 19:03:18.620719

Wealthy coal plant owners – like NRG and Luminant – now have permission to avoid installing readily available, common-sense pollution controls and move forward with spewing more toxic emissions into the air.

Today’s EPA decision withdraws a strong federal rule for Texas, finalized during the Obama Administration, that would have required upgraded or new pollution control equipment to be installed at 15 of Texas’s dirtiest coal units (see list below). In its place, Trump's EPA approved a regional haze plan from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) that would require no pollution reductions. EPA also approved a different yet related regional haze plan from the Texas government that would likewise require zero pollution reductions from massive polluters.

Regional haze impairs visibility in natural spaces and national parks. It is produced when large industrial sources, especially coal-burning power plants, emit harmful pollution that mixes with sunlight. The Clean Air Act calls for states to propose their own plans for reducing regional haze, and if those aren’t adequate, EPA is required to implement its own federal plans that comply with the law. In Texas, haze plans from TCEQ – whose commissioners have all been appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott – have consistently been so weak they would do nothing to reduce haze in any meaningful way.

Statement from Emma Pabst, Sierra Club Beyond Coal Campaign Manager

“For the last 20 years, Texas and EPA failed to properly implement the Clean Air Act’s requirements to reduce haze pollution in Texas, and today’s decision makes clear that both care little about clear skies on our public lands. Monitoring shows that the majority of haze comes from coal-burning power plants, and TCEQ and EPA have an obligation to reduce emissions from these facilities. But both agencies continue to blatantly disregard public input and show us – again and again – that our skies and our health aren’t important to them, especially when it comes to giving wealthy donors a pass to pollute. Americans are getting sicker, and this Administration is paving the way.”

The following coal plants would have been required to install pollution control equipment under the federal EPA haze plan, but no longer have to due to the Trump EPA withdrawal of the rule (some plants have multiple units):

CONGRESS

Congress lacks consensus on addressing healthcare affordability. With the December 31, 2025, expiration date of the enhanced APTCs quickly approaching, discussions – both partisan and bipartisan – continued on Capitol Hill this week, although agreement on a path forward remains elusive. As part of the agreement to reopen the government last month, Senate Majority Leader Thune (R-SD) promised Democrats an APTC floor vote in December. This vote is expected to occur on December 11. On December 4, Senate Minority Leader Schumer (D-NY) announced that Democrats will offer a bill on the Senate floor at that time to provide a clean three-year extension of enhanced APTCs. That bill is unlikely to garner much, if any, Republican support. It is still unknown whether Senate Republicans plan to offer an alternative bill.

Partisan differences on APTCs were on display during this week’s Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing on healthcare affordability, with Democrats pressing for a straightforward extension of the enhanced APTCs and Republicans split on whether to extend the credits with revisions or focus on other measures to bring down health insurance costs, such as health savings accounts, price transparency efforts, and reforms to promote competition. Some Senate Republicans agreed that, in the short term, APTCs should be extended to avoid immediate harm to families while broader reforms are debated.

House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee examines organ procurement organizations. During the hearing, committee members agreed on the need for systemic reform, including stronger oversight, penalties for violations, and improved data transparency within organ procurement organizations (OPOs). Witnesses emphasized the urgent need for accountability within OPOs to prevent harm to patients and families. Republican committee members focused their questions on accountability and transparency within OPOs, highlighting allegations of fraud, misuse of federal funds, and unethical practices. Democrats on the committee stressed the importance of maintaining health insurance coverage for transplant patients, warning that cuts to Medicaid and failure to extend the enhanced APTCs would leave millions uninsured and jeopardize access to organ transplants.

Senate Aging Committee holds hearing on aging in place and community support. During the hearing, members on both sides of the aisle expressed support for reauthorizing the Older Americans Act and encouraging aging in place by shifting resources from institutions to home- and community-based services. Witnesses spoke to the importance of Older Americans Act programs in supporting older adults, individuals with disabilities, and their caregivers. Republican committee members expressed support for other solutions to aid caregivers and reduce senior loneliness, such as a multigenerational home caregiver tax credit and partnerships with community-based organizations. Democrats on the committee voiced concern about Medicaid cuts and recent administration actions, such as reductions in force in the Administration for Community Living and US Department of Education, and rulemaking related to travel accessibility and the direct care workforce.

Senate Finance Committee leaders introduce bipartisan pharmacy benefit manager reform legislation. Chair Crapo (R-ID) and Ranking Member Wyden (D-OR) introduced the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) Price Transparency and Accountability Act in an effort to increase transparency in federal prescription drug programs and lower drug prices for patients. The legislation would delink PBMs’ compensation from their negotiated rebates and increase PBM reporting requirements to Medicare Part D plan sponsors and HHS. It would also require retail community pharmacies to participate in the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost survey to ensure accurate Medicaid payments to pharmacies, and would mandate that PBMs pass Medicaid payments directly to pharmacies in order to ensure transparency in drug costs.

ADMINISTRATION

CMS releases MA and Part D proposed rule. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a proposed rule with policy and technical changes to the MA and Part D programs for 2027 and beyond. Key takeaways include:

Significant star ratings changes. CMS proposes to remove 12 measures from the star ratings beginning with the 2027 measurement year and remove the EHO4all reward (also known as the Health Equity Index) from the 2027 star ratings. CMS would continue applying the existing reward factor, which was scheduled to end with the 2027 ratings.

Codifying Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) provisions. As required by the IRA, CMS proposes to eliminate the coverage gap phase and the annual out-of-pocket threshold, remove cost sharing for enrollees in the catastrophic phase, and implement the manufacturer discount program. While these IRA provisions are already in effect, CMS implemented them using temporary authority and now proposes to codify the provisions in regulation.

Changes to marketing and communications. CMS proposes to reduce restrictions on beneficiary outreach and third-party marketing organizations. CMS notes that if finalized for the 2027 contract year, these changes would take effect on October 1, 2026, when marketing for the 2027 plan year begins.

Special enrollment periods (SEPs). CMS proposes to modify the SEP that allows an enrollee to change plans when a provider they see leaves the network. CMS proposes to eliminate the requirement that the network change be deemed “significant” to trigger the SEP. CMS also proposes to codify existing policy that certain SEPs require prior CMS approval.

Improvements for special needs plans (SNPs). CMS’s proposals focus on passive enrollment, continuity of care, contract modifications, and model of care off-cycle submissions.

Requests for information (RFIs). The rule includes several RFIs on topics such as risk adjustment, stars and quality bonus payments, well-being and nutrition, chronic condition SNPs, marketing oversight and agent and broker regulations, and reducing data collection and reporting burdens.

Comments on the proposed rule are due by January 26, 2026. Read CMS’s fact sheet on the proposed rule here. You can also read our Regs & Eggs blog post on this topic.

CMS announces negotiated prices for 15 drugs selected for Medicare Part D. In a press release, CMS announced the agreed-upon maximum fair prices for 15 drugs selected for the 2027 Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. CMS estimated that about 5.3 million people with Medicare Part D coverage used these drugs in 2024 to treat a variety of conditions, such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and asthma, and that these drugs accounted for about $42.5 billion in total gross covered prescription drug costs under Medicare Part D in 2024, or about 15%. Had these negotiated prices been in effect in 2024, net savings to the Medicare program would have approximately $12 billion, according to CMS.

The 15 Part D-covered drugs selected for 2027 will join the 10 Part D-covered drugs previously selected for negotiation, with those prices going into effect January 1, 2026. A fact sheet detailing the negotiated prices for the 15 selected drugs can be found here.

CMS repeals minimum staffing requirements for long-term care facilities. CMS issued an interim final rule effectively repealing the Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facilities and Medicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting final rule. Released by the Biden administration in 2024, the repealed rule established minimum staffing standards for long-term facilities. These standards would have required a registered nurse (RN) to be onsite 24 hours, seven days per week, and would have required each facility to provide a minimum of 0.55 RN, 2.45 nurse aide (NA), and 3.48 total nurse staffing hours per resident day, for a specified time period. The 2024 rule has been challenged in court, and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act prohibited CMS from implementing, administering, or enforcing the minimum staffing standards until September 30, 2034. Thus, the standards have never been enforced.

CMS will reinstate prior regulatory requirements, including the minimum statutory RN staffing requirement for long-term care facilities to use the services of an RN for at least eight consecutive hours a day, seven days a week, and to designate an RN to serve as the director of nursing on a full-time basis except when waived. CMS is accepting comments, but the changes are effective 60 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register (both the comment due date and the rule’s effective date are estimated to be February 1, 2026).

CMS Innovation Center announces new digital health model. The ACCESS model is a 10-year voluntary model designed to expand access to new technology-supported care options that help Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries improve their health and prevent and manage chronic disease. Examples of technology-supported care that would be covered by this model include medication management, therapy and counseling, and the use or monitoring of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized devices or software.

The ACCESS model will test outcome-aligned payments for care organizations enrolled in Medicare Part B and will include four clinical tracks focused on common chronic conditions:

Early cardio-kidney-metabolic conditions: Hypertension, dyslipidemia (abnormal or elevated lipids, including cholesterol), obesity or overweight with marker of central obesity, and prediabetes.

Cardio-kidney-metabolic conditions: Diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Musculoskeletal conditions: Chronic musculoskeletal pain.

Behavioral health conditions: Depression or anxiety.

During a December 4, 2025, live stream event, CMS officials announced that applications are expected to open in January 2026 and close in April 2026, with rolling admissions. The model is scheduled to begin in July 2026 and will run for 10 years. During the same event, FDA and CMS officials announced the TEMPO (Technology-Enabled Meaningful Patient Outcomes for digital health devices) pilot project, an FDA initiative that will help health device manufacturers offer their device inside of the ACCESS model with exemption from the FDA market access process. Applications for the TEMPO pilot are expected to open in early 2026.

FAQs on the ACCESS model can be found here.

HHS unveils AI strategy. HHS announced its AI action plan focused on integrating AI via a “OneHHS” approach in which all HHS divisions will use a collaborative department-wide AI infrastructure. The strategy focuses on five pillars:

Ensure governance and risk management for public trust.

Design infrastructure and platforms for user needs.

Promote workforce development and burden reduction for efficiency.

Foster health research and reproducibility through gold standard science.

QUICK HITS

CMS releases home health final rule. The calendar year (CY) 2026 final rule decreases payments to home health agencies by an estimated 1.3%, or $220 million, compared to CY 2025, significantly below the estimated 6.4% aggregate reduction in the proposed rule. The rule also finalized changes to the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies Competitive Bidding Program. A fact sheet on the final rule can be found here, and a fact sheet on the competitive bidding updates can be found here.

GAO releases report on fraud risks in APTCs. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) report asserts that tens of thousands of Social Security numbers (SSNs) were used to obtain more than one year’s worth of subsidized coverage in a single plan year, with CMS permitting multiple enrollments per SSN to account for potential identity theft or data entry issues. The report identifies vulnerabilities related to unauthorized agent or broker changes and notes that CMS’s outdated fraud-risk assessments limit its ability to effectively manage APTC fraud risks.

The 15 projects approved for entry into the Expedited Resource Addition Study comprise seven natural gas-fired units, three solar plants, three battery energy storage systems, and two wind farms. The projects represent a combined 6.1 GW of proposed new generating capacity, with targeted in-service dates ranging from December 2027 to August 2028, the grid operator said in a statement. ERAS is a temporary process designed to expedite the entry of new power generation into service, addressing near-term resource adequacy and reliability concerns across the MISO footprint, which spans 15 states in the US Midwest and South. The process, which is separate from MISO's standard interconnection queue, allows eligible projects to be studied quarterly and granted expedited generator interconnection agreements within 90 days. The ERAS queue is limited to a total of 68 projects, and no more than 15 will be studied on a first-come, first-served basis. ERAS will sunset at the completion of the 68-project study or Aug. 31, 2027, whichever is earlier. The quarterly study process had been limited to 10 projects before the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved MISO's request to increase the threshold to 15 projects Nov. 25. The first quarterly cycle, which opened Sept. 2, included 10 projects representing roughly 4.7 GW of proposed new capacity, according to an analysis of MISO data. Three of the first 10 projects have executed generator interconnection agreements, and the remaining seven are expected to do so later in December, MISO said. To date, 51 projects totaling nearly 30 GW of proposed new capacity have been accepted or are pending validation into ERAS, MISO said. ""Cycle 2 builds on the momentum of Cycle 1 and reflects the continued demand for timely, reliable interconnection solutions,"" Aubrey Johnson, MISO's vice president for system planning, said in a statement. ""These projects are essential to meeting near-term reliability needs and ensuring new resource additions are online to meet load growth."" PROPOSED NEW PROJECTS The largest of the 15 projects in ERAS Cycle 2 is Invenergy's proposed 1.2 GW simple-cycle gas plant in Calumet County, Wisconsin. The plant has a proposed in-service date of Dec. 1, 2027, and is needed to help address a resource adequacy need of 2.25-2.50 GW for Wisconsin Electric customers located within MISO's Local Resource Zone 2, according to a non-confidential summary that the grid operator published. The largest renewable energy project is the proposed 426-MW Red Butte wind farm in Morton and Oliver counties, North Dakota.

Although some EVs have higher upfront costs, they have lower fuel and maintenance costs, making them more economical in the long run.
Atlas founder Nick Nigro noted that EVs ""continue to offer compelling cost advantages for many drivers,"" even as incentives shift.
Charging EVs at home rather than using public chargers can further reduce fuel costs, especially overnight when power rates are typically lowest.
Using solar panels to charge EVs can cut charging costs by up to 60%, based on estimates by EnergySage.","Here's another green flag for going electric: four out of five electric vehicles beat their gas-powered counterparts in total cost savings — showing that going electric is kinder to the planet and easier on the wallet.

A cost analysis by Atlas EV Hub showed that it's generally cheaper to own EVs than gas cars. Although some EVs have higher upfront costs, they have lower fuel and maintenance costs, making them more economical in the long run.

Atlas founder Nick Nigro noted that EVs ""continue to offer compelling cost advantages for many drivers,"" even as incentives shift. Of the five comparisons made, four showed EVs winning on cost. The only exception was the electric pickup, which remained slightly more expensive than its gas version over seven years of use.

The analysis also noted that most EVs remain cheaper to own despite the repeal of the federal tax credit, though buyers now see smaller savings than before.

Charging EVs at home rather than using public chargers can further reduce fuel costs, especially overnight when power rates are typically lowest. When drivers plug in their cars while they sleep, they can slash fuel costs by hundreds of dollars per year.

For homeowners ready to set up their own charging station, Qmerit is a good place to start. They offer free estimates on Level 2 chargers customized to specific electrical panels and garage setups.

Home solar can stretch those benefits even further. Using solar panels to charge EVs can cut charging costs by up to 60%, based on estimates by EnergySage. Solar charging for a small EV would only cost $200 to $300 annually — a fraction of what many drivers spend on gas in a single month.

Beyond personal cost savings, going electric can help save the planet. Every mile powered by electricity — instead of gasoline — reduces pollution. Moreover, when EV owners use solar to charge at home, those benefits multiply.

After reviewing multiple studies, the International Council on Clean Transportation found that EVs are significantly cleaner than combustion vehicles. Electric SUVs, for instance, contribute 71% fewer heat-trapping gases than their gas counterparts.

EVs also convert energy more efficiently. EVs can convert up to 91% of stored energy into motion, compared to about 25% for gas-powered vehicles, with the rest lost as heat and mechanical inefficiencies, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

As more data points to lower lifetime costs and improved efficiency, EV adoption continues to expand among drivers who previously remained undecided.

Consumers who want to switch to EVs and maximize cost savings can get started by requesting a free quote from Qmerit and checking out solar solutions in the Solar Explorer — a great place to find reliable providers and TCD's partners who help homeowners save up to $10,000 on solar installation, get solar panels installed at zero upfront costs, and gain more savings through tax credits.

For many households, pairing home charging with solar remains one of the most cost-effective ways to manage long-term vehicle and energy expenses.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/electric-vehiclesimage-recd2xA7Egzha2jfX.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 17:01:13.165578

CONGRESS

Congress lacks consensus on addressing healthcare affordability. With the December 31, 2025, expiration date of the enhanced APTCs quickly approaching, discussions – both partisan and bipartisan – continued on Capitol Hill this week, although agreement on a path forward remains elusive. As part of the agreement to reopen the government last month, Senate Majority Leader Thune (R-SD) promised Democrats an APTC floor vote in December. This vote is expected to occur on December 11. On December 4, Senate Minority Leader Schumer (D-NY) announced that Democrats will offer a bill on the Senate floor at that time to provide a clean three-year extension of enhanced APTCs. That bill is unlikely to garner much, if any, Republican support. It is still unknown whether Senate Republicans plan to offer an alternative bill.

Partisan differences on APTCs were on display during this week’s Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing on healthcare affordability, with Democrats pressing for a straightforward extension of the enhanced APTCs and Republicans split on whether to extend the credits with revisions or focus on other measures to bring down health insurance costs, such as health savings accounts, price transparency efforts, and reforms to promote competition. Some Senate Republicans agreed that, in the short term, APTCs should be extended to avoid immediate harm to families while broader reforms are debated.

House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee examines organ procurement organizations. During the hearing, committee members agreed on the need for systemic reform, including stronger oversight, penalties for violations, and improved data transparency within organ procurement organizations (OPOs). Witnesses emphasized the urgent need for accountability within OPOs to prevent harm to patients and families. Republican committee members focused their questions on accountability and transparency within OPOs, highlighting allegations of fraud, misuse of federal funds, and unethical practices. Democrats on the committee stressed the importance of maintaining health insurance coverage for transplant patients, warning that cuts to Medicaid and failure to extend the enhanced APTCs would leave millions uninsured and jeopardize access to organ transplants.

Senate Aging Committee holds hearing on aging in place and community support. During the hearing, members on both sides of the aisle expressed support for reauthorizing the Older Americans Act and encouraging aging in place by shifting resources from institutions to home- and community-based services. Witnesses spoke to the importance of Older Americans Act programs in supporting older adults, individuals with disabilities, and their caregivers. Republican committee members expressed support for other solutions to aid caregivers and reduce senior loneliness, such as a multigenerational home caregiver tax credit and partnerships with community-based organizations. Democrats on the committee voiced concern about Medicaid cuts and recent administration actions, such as reductions in force in the Administration for Community Living and US Department of Education, and rulemaking related to travel accessibility and the direct care workforce.

Senate Finance Committee leaders introduce bipartisan pharmacy benefit manager reform legislation. Chair Crapo (R-ID) and Ranking Member Wyden (D-OR) introduced the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) Price Transparency and Accountability Act in an effort to increase transparency in federal prescription drug programs and lower drug prices for patients. The legislation would delink PBMs’ compensation from their negotiated rebates and increase PBM reporting requirements to Medicare Part D plan sponsors and HHS. It would also require retail community pharmacies to participate in the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost survey to ensure accurate Medicaid payments to pharmacies, and would mandate that PBMs pass Medicaid payments directly to pharmacies in order to ensure transparency in drug costs.

ADMINISTRATION

CMS releases MA and Part D proposed rule. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a proposed rule with policy and technical changes to the MA and Part D programs for 2027 and beyond. Key takeaways include:

Significant star ratings changes. CMS proposes to remove 12 measures from the star ratings beginning with the 2027 measurement year and remove the EHO4all reward (also known as the Health Equity Index) from the 2027 star ratings. CMS would continue applying the existing reward factor, which was scheduled to end with the 2027 ratings.

Codifying Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) provisions. As required by the IRA, CMS proposes to eliminate the coverage gap phase and the annual out-of-pocket threshold, remove cost sharing for enrollees in the catastrophic phase, and implement the manufacturer discount program. While these IRA provisions are already in effect, CMS implemented them using temporary authority and now proposes to codify the provisions in regulation.

Changes to marketing and communications. CMS proposes to reduce restrictions on beneficiary outreach and third-party marketing organizations. CMS notes that if finalized for the 2027 contract year, these changes would take effect on October 1, 2026, when marketing for the 2027 plan year begins.

Special enrollment periods (SEPs). CMS proposes to modify the SEP that allows an enrollee to change plans when a provider they see leaves the network. CMS proposes to eliminate the requirement that the network change be deemed “significant” to trigger the SEP. CMS also proposes to codify existing policy that certain SEPs require prior CMS approval.

Improvements for special needs plans (SNPs). CMS’s proposals focus on passive enrollment, continuity of care, contract modifications, and model of care off-cycle submissions.

Requests for information (RFIs). The rule includes several RFIs on topics such as risk adjustment, stars and quality bonus payments, well-being and nutrition, chronic condition SNPs, marketing oversight and agent and broker regulations, and reducing data collection and reporting burdens.

Comments on the proposed rule are due by January 26, 2026. Read CMS’s fact sheet on the proposed rule here. You can also read our Regs & Eggs blog post on this topic.

CMS announces negotiated prices for 15 drugs selected for Medicare Part D. In a press release, CMS announced the agreed-upon maximum fair prices for 15 drugs selected for the 2027 Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. CMS estimated that about 5.3 million people with Medicare Part D coverage used these drugs in 2024 to treat a variety of conditions, such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and asthma, and that these drugs accounted for about $42.5 billion in total gross covered prescription drug costs under Medicare Part D in 2024, or about 15%. Had these negotiated prices been in effect in 2024, net savings to the Medicare program would have approximately $12 billion, according to CMS.

The 15 Part D-covered drugs selected for 2027 will join the 10 Part D-covered drugs previously selected for negotiation, with those prices going into effect January 1, 2026. A fact sheet detailing the negotiated prices for the 15 selected drugs can be found here.

CMS repeals minimum staffing requirements for long-term care facilities. CMS issued an interim final rule effectively repealing the Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facilities and Medicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting final rule. Released by the Biden administration in 2024, the repealed rule established minimum staffing standards for long-term facilities. These standards would have required a registered nurse (RN) to be onsite 24 hours, seven days per week, and would have required each facility to provide a minimum of 0.55 RN, 2.45 nurse aide (NA), and 3.48 total nurse staffing hours per resident day, for a specified time period. The 2024 rule has been challenged in court, and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act prohibited CMS from implementing, administering, or enforcing the minimum staffing standards until September 30, 2034. Thus, the standards have never been enforced.

CMS will reinstate prior regulatory requirements, including the minimum statutory RN staffing requirement for long-term care facilities to use the services of an RN for at least eight consecutive hours a day, seven days a week, and to designate an RN to serve as the director of nursing on a full-time basis except when waived. CMS is accepting comments, but the changes are effective 60 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register (both the comment due date and the rule’s effective date are estimated to be February 1, 2026).

CMS Innovation Center announces new digital health model. The ACCESS model is a 10-year voluntary model designed to expand access to new technology-supported care options that help Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries improve their health and prevent and manage chronic disease. Examples of technology-supported care that would be covered by this model include medication management, therapy and counseling, and the use or monitoring of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized devices or software.

The ACCESS model will test outcome-aligned payments for care organizations enrolled in Medicare Part B and will include four clinical tracks focused on common chronic conditions:

Early cardio-kidney-metabolic conditions: Hypertension, dyslipidemia (abnormal or elevated lipids, including cholesterol), obesity or overweight with marker of central obesity, and prediabetes.

Cardio-kidney-metabolic conditions: Diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Musculoskeletal conditions: Chronic musculoskeletal pain.

Behavioral health conditions: Depression or anxiety.

During a December 4, 2025, live stream event, CMS officials announced that applications are expected to open in January 2026 and close in April 2026, with rolling admissions. The model is scheduled to begin in July 2026 and will run for 10 years. During the same event, FDA and CMS officials announced the TEMPO (Technology-Enabled Meaningful Patient Outcomes for digital health devices) pilot project, an FDA initiative that will help health device manufacturers offer their device inside of the ACCESS model with exemption from the FDA market access process. Applications for the TEMPO pilot are expected to open in early 2026.

FAQs on the ACCESS model can be found here.

HHS unveils AI strategy. HHS announced its AI action plan focused on integrating AI via a “OneHHS” approach in which all HHS divisions will use a collaborative department-wide AI infrastructure. The strategy focuses on five pillars:

Ensure governance and risk management for public trust.

Design infrastructure and platforms for user needs.

Promote workforce development and burden reduction for efficiency.

Foster health research and reproducibility through gold standard science.

Enable care and public health delivery modernization for better outcomes.

QUICK HITS

CMS releases home health final rule. The calendar year (CY) 2026 final rule decreases payments to home health agencies by an estimated 1.3%, or $220 million, compared to CY 2025, significantly below the estimated 6.4% aggregate reduction in the proposed rule. The rule also finalized changes to the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies Competitive Bidding Program. A fact sheet on the final rule can be found here, and a fact sheet on the competitive bidding updates can be found here.

GAO releases report on fraud risks in APTCs. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) report asserts that tens of thousands of Social Security numbers (SSNs) were used to obtain more than one year’s worth of subsidized coverage in a single plan year, with CMS permitting multiple enrollments per SSN to account for potential identity theft or data entry issues. The report identifies vulnerabilities related to unauthorized agent or broker changes and notes that CMS’s outdated fraud-risk assessments limit its ability to effectively manage APTC fraud risks. Read the full report here.

### About the National Grocers Association","Unrealistic timelines and excessive compliance costs harm grocery stores and their customers

Washington, D.C. – The National Grocers Association (NGA), the leading trade association for the nation’s independent grocers and wholesalers, today announced it has petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to revise its Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) Management Rule because of unrealistic timelines, excessive compliance costs, and regulatory requirements that go beyond what Congress mandated.

NGA’s petition argues that the HFC Management Rule imposes several impractical and overly burdensome requirements on food retailers, including drastically increasing the number of covered refrigeration appliances and setting a leak-rate limit that does not align with real-world systems. NGA also contends that the rule’s repair, testing, and retrofit deadlines are unrealistically short, given national shortages of technicians and parts, and requests more time to comply with automatic leak-detection system mandates.

“Independent grocers are committed to environmental sustainability and responsible refrigerant management,” said Max Wengroff, NGA senior manager of government relations. “But the EPA’s rule places unrealistic obligations on retailers that simply cannot be met under the timelines and thresholds imposed. These unnecessary obligations will raise costs for businesses and families.”

The independent grocery sector accounts for nearly one-third of all U.S. grocery sales, more than $250 billion annually, and over one million jobs. NGA contends that without reasonable rule revisions, the HFC Management Rule will impose costs that many independent grocers simply cannot absorb and will ultimately be passed onto consumers.

Our rich homegrown resources—sun, wind, water, and farm waste—meet strong policies, sparking a fast shift to clean energy.
Biomass adds reliable local power, using over 450 million tonnes of farm waste yearly to boost rural jobs and energy.
To hit these targets, policies now empower everyday people and businesses to make their own clean power.
Tech, policy, and markets align for a clean energy boom—building a healthier, greener, richer India.","India’s promise to clean energy, sealed in the Paris Agreement, is now backed by bold government moves. With big goals like 500 GW of non-fossil fuel power by 2030 and programs like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) for local solar manufacturing, this isn’t just a side project—it’s key to our economy and security.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) ranks India as the world’s third-largest solar producer, ahead of Japan. We’re aiming for 280 GW from solar alone. But rural areas still struggle with energy access due to money, geography, infrastructure, social issues, and policy gaps. Reliance on old-school fuels like wood and kerosene slows growth.

Since FY21, electricity use has jumped 9 per cent yearly—double the 5 per cent average from before. Coal keeps the grid steady and secures fuel as demand soars, but it causes over 40 per cent of energy-related CO2 emissions. Recent U.S. Energy Information Administration data shows that about 60 percent of our electricity still comes from fossil fuels like coal, gas, and oil. This heavy fossil fuel use harms the environment, from air pollution to climate change.

Yet, India is at a turning point. Our rich homegrown resources—sun, wind, water, and farm waste—meet strong policies, sparking a fast shift to clean energy. This cuts deep carbon emissions while fueling steady growth.

Tapping India’s vast energy treasures

The heart of this change is our huge natural gifts. States like Rajasthan, Jammu & Kashmir, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh shine with top solar potential, fueling huge solar farm booms. By late October 2025, solar capacity hit 129.9 GW. India’s total power capacity tops 500 GW, with non-fossil sources (mostly renewables) at about 51 per cent or 256 GW—including 227 GW renewables and 8.8 GW nuclear.

Wind power, a steady player, leads in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Maharashtra with big onshore projects.

Hydro power is getting a major revival. With 15 GW under construction, total hydro capacity should rise from 42 GW to 67 GW by FY31-32—a 50 per cent+ jump. Biomass adds reliable local power, using over 450 million tonnes of farm waste yearly to boost rural jobs and energy.

To hit these targets, policies now empower everyday people and businesses to make their own clean power. The PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana gives big subsidies for rooftop solar, letting homes install panels and sell extra power to the grid. New rules let factories and shops build solar or wind setups—even across states—with low fees. This cuts coal reliance and puts cheap, green control in local hands.

Government cash is pouring in to ditch fossil fuels. The Union Budget 2025-26 ramps up green spending: over ₹26,500 crore for solar (including local making), ₹20,000 crore for green hydrogen and electrolysers, ₹10,000 crore+ for pumped hydro storage, and boosts for small nuclear reactors in private hands. These funds slash import needs and build a fossil-free backbone.

But manufacturing lags behind goals. To reach 500 GW by 2030, we need 40-50 GW added yearly, yet local solar module production is just 18-20 GW annually—far short, forcing imports. Indian firms like Adani and Tata are racing to expand, with PLI schemes adding 48 GW module capacity. This boom eyes the huge demand, creating jobs and cutting foreign buys.

Green energy draws smart money, too. FDI hit $3.4 billion in the first nine months of FY25—up 8 per cent of total inflows—and $23 billion since April 2020. It’s investor-friendly: quick approvals, stable rules, and 100 per cent foreign ownership pull in global giants for solar, wind, and storage.

Tackling roadblocks in the shift

The potential is clear, but hurdles like weather-dependent solar and wind output demand fixes. We need big battery storage (BESS), smart grids, and better weather forecasts to keep power steady.

Non-tech issues bite hard: huge land needs spark fights over farms, wildlife, and locals. Investments need smoother permits, less red tape, and steady rules to lure global cash.

Why this matters: Leading the world

To keep Paris promises, India must split growth from carbon and pollution. Homegrown renewables secure power for our booming population, cut climate risks, and show the global how-to on energy freedom.

Tech, policy, and markets align for a clean energy boom—building a healthier, greener, richer India.

A 5-year plan for rock-solid energy

The next five years flip from just building to smart integration and steady supply. I see renewables topping 250 GW by 2030, leading all new adds for cleaner air and fewer fuel imports.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/12/05/Gurang-Shah.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 19:02:43.656799

Specifically, the settlement requires the companies to divest their ownership interests in four electricity plants serving PJM and two electricity plants serving ERCOT.","Note: View proposed settlement here.

The Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, together with the Attorney General of Texas, announced today that it will require divestiture of six power plants in Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Texas to resolve antitrust concerns arising from Constellation Energy Corporation, Inc.’s $26.6 billion acquisition of Calpine Corporation.

The Antitrust Division filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block the proposed acquisition. At the same time, the Division filed a proposed settlement that, if approved by the court, would resolve the Division’s competitive concerns.

“The price of electricity is a pocketbook issue to American consumers working hard to afford their monthly utility bills. When it comes to their electricity bills, Americans deserve the benefit of robust competition among electricity generators,” said Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. “This settlement includes a six-plant divestiture to an acquisition that risked harming tens of millions of electricity consumers in the mid-Atlantic and Texas. I am appreciative of the partnership with our co-plaintiff, the State of Texas, to secure relief for consumers.”

As detailed in the complaint, the acquisition would create the largest wholesale power generator in the United States and increase the likelihood that the combined firm would profitably withhold electricity from one or more of its plants. The result would be higher electricity prices for customers in Texas, where the electricity grid is operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), and in New Jersey, Delaware, southeastern Pennsylvania, and the eastern shores of Maryland and Virginia, where the electricity grid is operated by PJM Interconnection LLC (PJM).

The divestitures resolve the Division’s concerns that the acquisition would harm competition and lead to higher prices on consumers reliant on the ERCOT and PJM electricity grids. Specifically, the settlement requires the companies to divest their ownership interests in four electricity plants serving PJM and two electricity plants serving ERCOT. The divested plants are:

Bethlehem Energy Center, a natural gas combined cycle plant, located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania;

York Energy Center (York 1 and York 2), a dual-fuel combined cycle plant, located southeast of the city of York, Pennsylvania;

Hay Road Energy Center, a dual-fuel combined cycle plant, located in Wilmington, Delaware;

Edge Moor Energy Center, a simple cycle natural gas plant, located in Wilmington, Delaware;

Jack A. Fusco Energy Center, a natural gas combined cycle plant, located southwest of Houston, Texas; and

Gregory Power Plant, a natural gas combined cycle plant, located northeast of Corpus Christi, Texas.

This is the first settlement consent decree that the Division has filed in an electricity merger in 14 years.

Constellation is a publicly traded Pennsylvania corporation headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. It is one of the largest owners of electric generation assets in the United States. In 2024, the company earned $23.6 billion in revenue. It currently controls more than 20,000 megawatts of generating capacity in PJM and approximately 5,000 megawatts in ERCOT.

Calpine is a privately held Delaware corporation headquartered in Houston, Texas. Calpine is the largest generator of electricity from natural gas and geothermal in the United States. The company controls approximately 9,000 megawatts of generating capacity in ERCOT and 5,000 megawatts in PJM.

As required by the Tunney Act, the proposed settlement, along with a competitive impact statement, will be published in the Federal Register. Any person should submit written comments concerning the proposed settlement within 60 days following the publication to Patricia Corcoran, Acting Chief, Transportation, Energy & Agriculture Section, Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 450 Fifth Street NW, Suite 8000, Washington, DC 20530.

Designed to support on-farm decision-making, the Ag Climate Dashboard offers up-to-date weather data, National Weather Service forecasts, Climate Prediction Center outlooks, historical records and interactive tools for monitoring crop growth, pest threats, climate anomalies and extreme weather events.
The dashboard also connects users to regional ag climate products and a variety of state-specific resources.

Designed to support on-farm decision-making, the Ag Climate Dashboard offers up-to-date weather data, National Weather Service forecasts, Climate Prediction Center outlooks, historical records and interactive tools for monitoring crop growth, pest threats, climate anomalies and extreme weather events.

The dashboard also connects users to regional ag climate products and a variety of state-specific resources. State-specific pages, such as Indiana’s, link to tools and resources like the Purdue Mesonet and the Indiana State Climate Office.

“We want to provide as much clear, well-organized information to producers and advisers as possible so they can make confident management decisions, whether that’s on their own farms or helping clients,” said Austin Pearson, climatologist at the MRCC and Indiana State Climate Office.

By placing these tools in a single, easy-to-navigate platform, the dashboard allows users to make better-informed decisions and support profitability and yield.

The idea for the dashboard stemmed directly from farmers.

“In 2023, we hosted workshops with farmers and one of the biggest takeaways was that while many ag climate tools exist, they aren’t found in one location,” Pearson said.

The dashboard hosts tools both developed by Purdue University and trusted external sources. For example, MRCC’s Corn Growing Degree Day tool helps track crop progress and predict maturity, while the Pest Forecasting Map from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet alerts farmers to threats like alfalfa weevil.

Within the dashboard, users also have access to the Climate Prediction Center outlooks for temperature and precipitation, interactive maps, crop and disease forecasting, fieldwork planning tools and localized climate summaries — all designed to support timely, informed decision-making throughout the year.

“The forecasting tools help farmers understand what pests — whether weeds, insects or diseases — could be an issue and when management is crucial,” Pearson said. “I encourage users to get into the dashboard and explore, as new tools are frequently added.”

Users can also consult climatologies through the platform to gain insights into historical weather patterns that may influence marketing and management strategies.

Beth Hall, director of the MRCC and Indiana State Climate Office, emphasized the broader vision of the project.

“We’re discovering that individual states provide tools that are limited geographically,” she said. “While searching for information, we found that there are missing tools — those that cover the full soybean production region.

“This inspires us to keep growing the dashboard to create a dynamic system that’s helpful for both a small geographic area and the whole region.”

Future enhancements will be guided by feedback from farmers and advisers. One requested addition is an irrigation planning tool, as several farmers are seeking region-specific guidance on how much water to apply to minimize waste.

While isolated tools like this exist, they often lack the geographic specificity needed for practical field use.

Looking ahead, the MRCC plans to incorporate more interactive, user-friendly features, such as location-based maps that respond to ZIP code input, providing a customized experience for each user.

“This is just round one of the dashboard,” Hall said. “We really wanted to provide people a taste and hopefully get them excited about the future. I envision more and more of our tools offering a greater user experience.”",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/Asn4ZHIidvmnmgsZ_YRsmKN1T_U=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/AKLRR6XHF5GOJGLHRLFB276GO4.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 15:02:22.608652

Trump claims credit for some corporate investments announced under Biden The White House list includes more than 100 corporate commitments totaling over $3 trillion.","President Trump has made increasingly sweeping claims about new investments flowing into the United States, citing figures as high as $21 trillion since taking office.

""Twenty-one trillion dollars will be the amount invested in the United States — or committed to invest — in one year,"" the president said in a November meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

In an Oval Office event this Wednesday, President Trump said, ""In 10 months, we have $18 trillion being invested.""

But a CBS News review found no evidence that total commitments or new investments approach the scale the president has cited. While companies and foreign governments have announced large-scale projects since Mr. Trump's inauguration, the White House has not provided documentation showing total investments approaching $21 trillion — an amount roughly two-thirds of the annual GDP.

The administration's own list of major investments ""made possible by President Trump's leadership"" totaled $9.6 trillion as of the latest update in November, but even that figure is exaggerated. It includes some investments announced under President Biden and trade goals that the U.S. is also partially responsible for.

The White House did not directly respond to CBS News' questions about these inclusions or the discrepancies between the administration's total and the much higher figures the president has claimed in his remarks.

""President Trump's dealmaking has secured trillions in investments to make and hire in America, trillions in commercial opportunities for American companies, and trillions in new export opportunities,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.

Federal data shows corporate investment levels are roughly in line with last year, with companies on track to invest over $5 trillion in 2025. The $20 trillion surge Mr. Trump has claimed does not appear in the available data.

Here's a closer look at some of the investment claims.

Trump claims credit for some corporate investments announced under Biden

The White House list includes more than 100 corporate commitments totaling over $3 trillion. Yet some of the largest were originally unveiled years before Mr. Trump took office and were backed by federal funding under President Biden's administration.

The administration lists a $200 billion investment by Micron Technology in semiconductor manufacturing and research. However, a company spokesman confirmed $120 billion of that was previously announced in 2022 and supported by $6 billion in funding from Biden's Chips and Science Act.

Similarly, the White House attributes a $16 billion GlobalFoundries investment in U.S. chip production to Mr. Trump. However, only $3 billion is newly promised this year. A company spokesperson said the remaining $13 billion was originally announced under Biden and backed by tax credits from the Chips and Science Act.

The Trump administration also claims credit for some major clean-energy manufacturing investments, even though its own policies have undercut projects in the sector, said Tom Taylor, a senior policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S.

The administration cited Invenergy's $1.7 billion commitment to a clean-energy transmission project announced in May. However, in July, the U.S. Department of Energy canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee to Invenergy that had been issued under Biden. A spokesman for Invenergy said the company is continuing its transmission project, but did not respond to a CBS News inquiry about whether the loan cancellation impacted the scale of its investment.

""The administration has kind of been on a tear this year about canceling clean energy projects,"" Taylor said. His research shows the administration's funding cuts and policy shifts have halted over $20.8 billion in clean manufacturing investments this year.

The White House list also contains apparent errors, including a $3 billion pledge by Kraft Heinz that appears twice. The administration has not responded to a CBS News request for clarification.

Foreign trade goals and aspirational pledges inflate totals

Foreign governments account for nearly $6 trillion on the White House's list, but several of the largest entries are trade targets — not investments in the U.S.

For example, in a joint announcement, the U.S. and Qatar committed to ""generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion,"" without specifying what portion Qatar would spend or when. The figure is also more than five times the gross domestic product of Qatar in 2024.

Similarly, India and the U.S. agreed to ""more than double total bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030"" — a trade target, not a singular investment commitment.

Some foreign investment pledges touted by Mr. Trump also appear aspirational to some economists.

Saudi Arabia promised to invest roughly $1 trillion in the U.S. during the crown prince's visit to the White House in November. But economists, including Maya Senussi at the Wall Street advisory firm Oxford Economics, have questioned whether the oil-rich country could afford an investment that size with global energy prices declining.

History also offers reason for skepticism: Mr. Trump touted in 2017 that Saudi Arabia had agreed to buy $400 billion in U.S. goods, but exports of American goods and services amounted to less than one-fourth of that total over his first term, according to analysis by the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.

Current U.S. investment levels remain typical

Federal data suggests that real investment spending — as opposed to announced commitments — remains roughly in line with last year's levels.

Within the U.S., gross private domestic investment, the broadest measure of what U.S. companies are spending to expand their businesses, is projected to total about $5.4 trillion this year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, or BEA. That's up roughly $100 billion from the same point last year, but far below the multitrillion-dollar surge Mr. Trump has mentioned.

""Trump may be talking about commitments that have yet to happen. But on actual investment spending — so new equipment, buildings and machinery — 2025 is similar to 2024,"" Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University, told CBS News in an email.

Some research suggests that foreign corporations have sharply increased the number of spending pledges under Mr. Trump. They've promised to invest over $270 billion from January to October, more than double the volume announced under Biden in the same period, according to fDi intelligence, which is part of the Financial Times.

But experts say announcements do not always translate into realized investment.

New foreign direct investment — the actual amount that foreign companies put into U.S. subsidiaries and projects — also remains steady. Foreign companies made roughly $145 billion worth of new investment in the U.S. in the first half of the year, nearly identical to the $144 billion invested in the same time period last year, BEA data shows.

Analysts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an independent think tank, estimate foreign investments will come in under $400 billion this year, well below record levels.

Central to this agenda is the growing urgency around AI-driven electricity demand — a priority already underscored by the new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) chair and DOE’s issuance of a loan guarantee for the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant. The administration’s rebuild of the domestic capacity in critical minerals continues with additional award announcements. At the same time, bipartisan momentum on permitting reform has reemerged, signaling potential shifts in how energy and infrastructure projects move forward.

This month’s newsletter examines these developments in detail and considers their implications for market players, state and local leaders, and companies navigating the federal energy policy landscape.

DOE Announces Major Realignment

On November 20, DOE unveiled a sweeping internal restructuring that will sunset several clean-energy offices while establishing new divisions dedicated to artificial intelligence, critical minerals, and fusion energy. The changes come as the Trump administration prioritizes expanded nuclear and fossil-fuel generation to counter rising utility bills and sharpen US competitiveness in AI.

The new organization chart removes references to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM), Grid Deployment Office (GDO), Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC), Office of State and Community Energy Programs (SCEP), Office of Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP), and Office of the Ombudsman.

DOE instead would create several new offices that align with the Trump administration’s energy priorities. The new Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation (CMEI) will combine EERE, MESC, FEMP, and SCEP. The new office will also assume certain functions of GDO and OCED, as those offices are scheduled to be closed by the administration. The Office of Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy would combine the Geothermal Office, previously part of EERE, with FECM. A new Office of Fusion would be created outside of the Office of Science, a step that many early-stage fusion companies had been calling for. The org chart also shows the new Office of Energy Dominance Financing (EDF), previously the Loan Programs Office (LPO), as announced last month.

While every new administration has implemented some level of reorganization, the changes announced by DOE potentially disregard previous Congressional authorization language, which could be problematic. The changes may take time to fully implement and could be subject to revision based on discussions with authorizing committees. Currently, the DOE website does not seem to reflect the new organizational names and structures. One interesting feature of the proposed organizational structure is that CMEI reports directly to the DOE Secretary, in contrast to EERE, which reported through an Under Secretary.

Energy Security a Key Priority Across the Administration

Energy security, and specifically electrical supply, continues to be a topic receiving strong emphasis across the federal government.

FERC Refocuses on AI-Driven Power Demand

At her first monthly open meeting, FERC Chair Laura Swett announced that the commission will prioritize rapid interconnection and power delivery for AI data centers. Calling this a “critical juncture” for US energy dominance, she stressed that keeping American data on US soil is essential to national and economic security.

Senate Natural Resources Committee chair and ranking member Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) sent a letter expressing their support for FERC to accelerate data-center grid connections, reflecting new bipartisan concern over energy constraints tied to AI deployment.

DOE Seeks Input on Gas Turbines Supply

Already, DOE’s new Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office issued a request for information seeking input on “how to ensure timely supply of gas turbines and relieve constraints in the supply chain” amid a supply crunch for the power generation equipment. The request seeks input concerning manufacturing technology limitations, workforce constraints, component challenges from sub-suppliers, and obstacles for materials, such as raw materials, critical minerals, or rare-earth elements. Responses are due by January 30, 2026.

Winter Reliability Assessment Shows Grid Concerns

The 2025 Winter Reliability Assessment released by the National Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) in November warns that sharply rising electricity demand — driven by electrification, population growth, and surging data-center development — is outpacing the growth of dependable winter resources across much of North America. While all regions retain adequate capacity for normal winter conditions, the report emphasizes that several areas face heightened risks under extreme cold, particularly where natural gas deliverability, thermal generator retirements, and the limited winter contribution of solar and wind constrain system flexibility. Compared to last year, the 2025 assessment identifies a broader and more acute set of risks, including in New England, the Maritimes, SERC East and Central, ERCOT, and parts of the Western Interconnection, where dependence on imports or batteries may be stressed by prolonged cold snaps. NERC notes improvements in generator weatherization and gas-electric coordination since Winter Storms Uri and Elliott, but underscores that fuel security, battery state-of-charge management, and the changing peak-load shape created by year-round data-center demand remain priority challenges for operators heading into the winter season.

EDF Loan for Nuclear

DOE’s Loan Programs Office, through the Energy Dominance Financing Program established under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, finalized a $1 billion loan to restart Pennsylvania’s shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant and provide power to Microsoft data centers. The loan to Constellation Energy Generation would help finance the Crane Clean Energy Center, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor at the plant, formerly known as Three Mile Island, located in Londonderry Township, Pennsylvania. The move reinforces the administration’s push to lean on nuclear power to meet surging electricity demand and ease pressure on household budgets.

House Natural Resources Advances Permitting Reform

On November 18, the House Natural Resources Committee approved Chair Bruce Westerman’s (R-AR) SPEED Act, a bipartisan permitting overhaul intended to shorten environmental reviews and limit legal challenges for new energy and infrastructure projects.

The SPEED Act would limit the scope of environmental reviews, saying the law requires agencies to consider only the direct impacts of a project rather than its broader effects. The bill would also build on National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reforms included as part of the 2023 Fiscal Responsibility Act that established a two-year limit on conducting Environmental Impact Statements and a one-year limit for environmental assessments.

It would also preclude agencies from evaluating impacts outside the immediate causal result of the proposed action, in an attempt to eliminate any consideration of upstream or downstream consequences of a project. And it would narrow the definition of “major federal action,” which is the condition for triggering the NEPA process, by specifying that the allocation of federal funds, loans, or loan guarantees are not sufficient actions on their own to trigger NEPA.

The SPEED Act would also impose limitations on judicial challenges against projects, requiring litigants to sue within 150 days, in a bid to make it more difficult for environmentalists to sue to stop them, and establish a 180-day deadline for courts to issue judgment on suits. The current statute of limitations is six years. It would only allow parties who provided substantive comments during the public review period the opportunity to issue a legal challenge and it would limit a court’s ability to remand an agency decision, specifying that the agency decision will hold while it corrects errors or deficiencies.

In passing the bill, the House Natural Resources Committee also adopted a bipartisan amendment, negotiated with Democrats and introduced by Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) and Rep. Pete Stauber (R-MN), to prevent a federal agency from revoking, suspending, altering, or otherwise interfering with an approved permit except in certain circumstances, such as a court order or if the action “is necessary to prevent specific, immediate, substantial, and proximate harm.” Chair Westerman said he hopes the amendment will “provide certainty that can get many more people on board to support” the SPEED Act, framing it as a response to concerns about the Trump administration’s revocation of permits for wind and solar projects. Several committee Democrats said they backed the amendment but are pushing for stronger language to rework all solar and wind projects needing personal approval from Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum.

Chair Westerman is reportedly targeting a House floor vote on the SPEED Act before the end of the year.

New Rare Earth Investments

The US Export-Import Bank (EXIM) approved a $27 million direct loan to 6K Additive LLC to expand advanced-materials production in Pennsylvania, including the construction of four new buildings and the acquisition of advanced equipment to refine titanium, nickel, and alloy powders. The project is the latest approval under EXIM’s Make More in America Initiative, designed to revitalize US manufacturing and secure critical supply chains; it is also the first deal in history conducted in coordination with the US Department of War’s Defense Production Act (DPA) Title III program.

The CHIPS Program Office signed a preliminary letter of intent to provide $50 million in CHIPS Act incentives to Vulcan Elements to acquire equipment for domestic neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnet production. The Department of Commerce will receive $50 million equity in the company. Vulcan plans to produce up to 10,000 metric tons of NdFeB magnet material in the coming years, significantly strengthening US rare-earth magnet supply chains.

Energy Bills Advance

Also on November 20, the House passed two bipartisan bills aimed at unlocking domestic liquified natural gas (LNG):

R. 3109, the REFINER Act (Rep. Bob Latta, R-OH) — Requires the National Petroleum Council to collect and examine critical information regarding the role of petrochemical refineries in the United States, analyzing opportunities to expand capacity against current risks or negative implications.

R.1949, the Unlocking Our Domestic LNG Potential Act (Rep. August Pfluger, R-TX) — Amends the Natural Gas Act to repeal all restrictions on the import and export of natural gas. Also gives FERC the exclusive authority to approve or deny any application for the siting, construction, expansion, or operation of a facility to export natural gas from the United States to a foreign country or import natural gas from a foreign country.

Meanwhile, on November 19, the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy advanced multiple bills to the full Committee related to energy efficiency.

R. 4626, Don’t Mess with My Home Appliance Act (Rep. Rick Allen, R-GA) — Prohibits the Secretary of Energy from prescribing any new or amended energy conservation standard for a product that is “not technologically feasible and economically justified.”

R. 3699, Energy Choice Act (Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-NY) — Prohibits state and local governments from restricting energy connections based on fuel type.

R. 5184, Affordable HOMES Act (Rep. Erin Houchin, R-IN) — Prohibits the Secretary of Energy from enforcing energy efficiency standards applicable to manufactured housing.

R. 4758, Homeowner Energy Freedom Act (Rep. Craig Goldman, R-TX) — Repeals Inflation Reduction Act subsidies for home electrification.

R. 4690, Reliable Federal Infrastructure Act (Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-NY) —Repeals certain federal building energy efficiency performance standards.

R. 4593, SHOWER Act (Rep. Russell Fry, R-SC) — Revises the federal definition of a showerhead.

R. 1355, Weatherization Enhancement and Readiness Act of 2025 (Rep. Paul Tonko, D-NY) — Reauthorizes DOE’s Weatherization Assistance Program through 2030.

R. 3474, Federal Mechanical Insulation Act (Rep. Randy Weber, R-TX) — Clarifies that mechanical insulation qualifies as an energy-efficiency measure in federal buildings.

EPA Endangerment Finding Repeal Slips to 2026

Although EPA signaled in September that it planned to finalize its repeal of the 2009 endangerment finding by the end of 2025, multiple industry and former agency officials now anticipate a January 2026 release. The repeal is central to the administration’s broader deregulatory agenda, eliminating the foundation underpinning Clean Air Act climate rules. Back in May, ML Strategies wrote about the potential fallout if the endangerment finding is rescinded.

The Energy Capital of the World Needs the Coastal Texas Project

Senator John Cornyn

The Houston Chronicle

December 5, 2025

https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/cornyn-energy-capital-world-needs-coastal-texas-21221940.php

It’s well-known that Houston is the Energy Capital of the World — home to a vast and dense concentration of refineries, petrochemical plants, and energy infrastructure stretching along the Houston Ship Channel. This industrial corridor is critical to producing and transporting the fuels, chemicals, and materials that power our nation and support economies across the globe. But with so much essential infrastructure concentrated in a single region, we must confront a sobering truth: The Bayou City is just one major hurricane away from a potential energy and ecological crisis.

A direct hit from a powerful storm — particularly one pushing a significant storm surge up Galveston Bay and into the Ship Channel — could not only disrupt national and global energy supplies, but also trigger an ecological disaster. Floodwaters from such a surge could damage industrial facilities and overwhelm containment systems, releasing an unimaginable cascade of hazardous materials into the surrounding environment, threatening both public health and fragile ecosystems. This dual risk underscores the urgent need to accelerate resilience planning, environmental safeguards, and infrastructure protection before the next storm arrives.

A report from the Severe Storm Prediction, Education and Evacuation from Disasters, or SSPEED, Center at Rice University concluded that a Category 4 or 5 hurricane could result in a severe storm surge slamming into petrochemical facilities and thousands of above ground tanks that dot the Houston area, wiping out billions of dollars of refineries and more. This would be devastating to Houston’s energy production and would send the price of gasoline soaring nationwide.

The Houston-Galveston region has long been susceptible to hurricanes, but recent storms still loom large for Southeast Texans: Hurricane Ike in 2008, Harvey in 2017, and Beryl last year. This reality is something that Texans accept, but there is a way we can make these storms less devastating.

The good news is that we are already taking steps to protect coastal Texas from the storms of tomorrow through the creation of what is referred to as the Coastal Texas Project, often referred to as the Ike Dike. While progress on this takes time, funding, and multiple acts of Congress, we know that Texas families, the U.S. energy industry, and the entire globe will reap lasting rewards. Building a coastal storm barrier to protect at-risk petrochemical infrastructure and the Texas Gulf Coast is urgent not just for Houston and its residents, but for our entire nation and all who source their energy from the free world.

This is an ambitious project, but we are already on the path toward protecting Texas communities from the whims of Mother Nature. I successfully fought to fund for the Coastal Texas Study, a critical first step in identifying the scope of the project. Three years ago, I helped secure congressional authorization of the project through the Water Resources and Development Act, or WRDA. The only remaining hurdle before construction begins is funding.

The Army Corps of Engineers estimates that the Coastal Texas Project would require up to $34.4 billion to build, and once funded, the construction could take up to two decades. I secured some of the initial funding in the Army Corps of Engineers 2024 Work Plan, and the State of Texas has already allocated $950 million.

However, there is much more to be done.

Due to the sheer scale of the project, it will take years of consistent funding from Congress to fully pay for the storm barrier. The project will have to compete with others for resources during the appropriations process. I was pleased that my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives secured an additional $5 million, and I have secured language in the Senate’s Energy & Water Development appropriations bill that encourages the Army Corps to prioritize funding of the coastal storm barrier. While this may feel like a drop in the bucket, it is an important step toward securing our energy supply.

This will require a whole of government effort from Texas’ congressional delegation. I’m proud to lead the charge, and I’d encourage you to reach out to your congressional representatives and urge them to join this fight. There are naysayers who think this is impossible, but here’s my message to them: Since when did Texas quit when the going got tough? The repercussions of failing to bring the Coastal Texas Project to the finish would be costly both financially and in loss of precious Texans’ lives.

This storm barrier system is imperative, not just for Houston and the surrounding areas, but for our entire country and all who rely on American energy. Fortifying the Energy Capital of the World will come at a price, but we cannot afford to fail.",https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Twitter-Card-Dec-23-1024x535.png,N,,2025-12-05 15:02:17.264896

And while looser standards may eventually mean lower car prices, their lower efficiency means that those savings could be eaten up by higher fuel costs, she said.
This assumes vehicle prices will actually go down with eased requirements, which experts say might not be the case.","DETROIT(AP) — President Donald Trump this week announced plans to weaken rules for how far automakers' new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, set under former President Joe Biden.

The Trump administration said the rules, known formally as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards, are why new vehicles are too expensive, and that cutting them will drive down costs and make driving safer for Americans.

The new standards would drop the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles to roughly 34.5 mpg (55.5 kpg) in the 2031 model year, down from the goal of about 50.4 mpg (81.1 kpg) that year under the Biden-era rule.

Here are the facts.

Affordability

TRUMP: EV-friendly policies “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse.”

THE FACTS: It's true that gas mileage standards have played a role in rising vehicle prices in recent years, but experts say plenty of other factors have contributed, and some much more.

Pandemic-era inventory shortages, supply chain challenges, tariffs and other trade dynamics, and even automakers' growing investments in their businesses have also sent prices soaring. Average prices have also skewed higher as automakers have leaned into the costly big pickups and SUVs that many American consumers love.

The average transaction price of a new vehicle hit $49,105 in October, according to car shopping guide Edmunds.

A Consumer Reports analysis of vehicles for model years 2003 to 2021 — a period in which average fuel economy improved 30% — found no significant increase in inflation-adjusted vehicle prices caused by the requirements. At the same time, it found an average of $7,000 in lifetime fuel savings per vehicle for 2021 model year vehicles compared with 2003. That analysis, done primarily before the coronavirus pandemic, attributed much of the average sticker price increase to the shift toward bigger and more expensive vehicles.

Cutting the fuel economy standards is unlikely to provide any fast relief on sticker prices, said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights. And while looser standards may eventually mean lower car prices, their lower efficiency means that those savings could be eaten up by higher fuel costs, she said.

Ending the gas car?

TRUMP: Biden’s policies were “a quest to end the gasoline-powered car.”

THE FACTS: The Biden administration did enact several policies to increase electric vehicle adoption, including setting a target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act included tax incentives that gave car buyers up to $7,500 off the price of an EV and dedicated billions of dollars to nationwide charging — funding that Trump tried to stop. The Biden administration increased fuel economy requirements and set stricter tailpipe emissions limits.

While those moves sought to help build the EV market, there was no requirement that automakers sell EVs or consumers buy them. And gasoline cars still make up the vast majority of the U.S. market.

EV charging

TRUMP: “We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them.”

THE FACTS: While many potential EV buyers still worry about charging them, the availability of public charging has significantly improved in recent years.

Biden-era funding and private investment have increased charging across the nation. There are now more than 232,000 individual Level 2 and fast charging ports in the U.S. As of this year, enough fast charging ports have been installed to average one for every mile (1.6 kilometers) of National Highway System roads in the U.S., according to an AP analysis of data from the Department of Energy.

However, those fast charging stations aren’t evenly dispersed. Many are concentrated in the far West and the Northeast, where sales of EVs are highest.

Experts note that most EV charging can be done at home.

Safety

TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: The reduced requirements will make drivers “safer on the roads because of all the great new technology we have that save lives.”

THE FACTS: Newer vehicles — gas and electric — are full of advanced safety features, including automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping, collision warnings and more.

Duffy suggested that consumers will be more likely to buy new vehicles if they are more affordable — meaning fewer old cars on the streets without the safety technology. This assumes vehicle prices will actually go down with eased requirements, which experts say might not be the case. Besides, high tech adds to a vehicle's cost.

“If Americans purchased more new vehicles equipped with the latest safety technologies, we would expect overall on-road safety to improve,” Edmunds' Caldwell said. “However, it’s unclear whether easing fuel-economy standards will meaningfully increase new-vehicle sales.”

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent automotive research nonprofit, also says electric or hybrid vehicles are as safe as or safer than gasoline-powered cars.

Another part of safety is public health. Efficiency requirements put into place to address the 1970s oil crisis were also a way to reduce pollution that is harmful to humans and the environment.

“This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans,” said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All campaign. “This dangerous proposal adds to the long list of ways the Trump administration is dismantling our clean air and public health protections.”

Meet our newest Net-Zero Hero, Colleen Dieter! With more than two decades of experience helping Austinites understand our region’s unique climate, Colleen has dedicated her career to making gardening accessible and joyful. As a landscape consultant, certified arborist, and founder of Central Texas Seed Savers, she’s taken her passion for local, seasonal, and sustainable gardening and turned it into a resource for gardeners of all levels through her consulting work and growing ATXGardens podcast. By sharing practical, Austin-specific guidance on everything from tree care to vegetable planting timelines, Colleen is empowering residents to grow healthier landscapes and support local ecosystems.

What inspired you to take action?

There’s not much information available to gardeners about when to plant or trim plants in Austin. Gardening is very confusing here, and most gardening information applies to other parts of the world. Our climate is unlike any other on Earth, and the proper timing of gardening tasks is puzzling. Throughout my career, I found gardeners were asking me the same questions repeatedly, and I saw folks making the same mistakes — like planting at the wrong time of year, and trimming at the wrong times. These mistakes were leading folks to give up on gardening and say, “I have a brown thumb,” or “I kill everything.” With just a few key bits of information, they could be awesome gardeners. I started wondering how I could reach a larger audience and have a bigger impact.

Top to bottom: Colleen stands, smiling, in her client’s front yard that she designed; Colleen points out the different types of plants in the yard.

How did you do it?

Lots of practice! I have over 20 years of experience helping Central Texans with their yards as a landscape consultant at ATXGardens. I am also a certified arborist, sustainable landscape designer, and founder of Central Texas Seed Savers. You may have seen me on PBS Austin’s Central Texas Gardener, KXAN’s Weekend Gardener, or Spectrum News’ Garden Journeys, or heard me on The Horticulturati podcast and KLBJ’s Horticulture Hangover. I am passionate about making gardening approachable. I needed a steady outlet for specific how-to information for local gardeners. Podcasts are low-cost and easy to DIY compared to other types of media, so I borrowed a microphone from a friend and got started recording on Zoom. I was connected to a podcast manager through a friend. She walked me through the steps to get started, and I hired her to edit my show.

Left to right: Colleen smiles, holding seeds she picked from the front yard; Colleen stops to smell the flowers.

What’s been most rewarding about getting involved in this way?

It’s rewarding to get the information about all kinds of plants — vegetables, fruit trees, native plants, and more — on one platform. Often, gardening information is too esoteric for an average gardener, with experts on one type of plant, drilling down into intense details that don’t really apply to hobby growers. I combined the gardening information with updates from the gardening community about upcoming events, like seed swaps. There’s a strong need for Austin-specific gardening information, and I am happy to be filling that gap. It feels sort of old-fashioned and quaint — like a farmer’s almanac combined with a community calendar — but on a high-tech platform.

Left to right: Colleen reaches up to pick a few seed pods from a catalpa tree; Seeds picked from the catalpa tree.

What’s been the toughest part?

Just getting started from scratch and figuring it out as I go along. I didn’t have any great examples to follow for creating a local, calendar-based gardening podcast, so I am making notes on what works and what doesn’t as I go, always wanting to grow and improve.

How do you see gardening and landscape design playing a role in Austin’s larger sustainability and climate resilience goals?

I believe that gardening is key to solving global, local, and personal problems. I want to empower more Austinites to start gardening and help them succeed. Trees and plants are crucial to fighting climate change because they pull carbon out of the atmosphere and use it to make their body parts. They breathe out oxygen that we need to survive. They also have relationships with soil microbes that store even more carbon in the soil.

Left to right: Colleen at a Central Texas Seed Savers tabling event; Colleen smiles with Austin Public Library’s seed collection that she started.

Native trees and plants are crucial for preventing mass extinction because they provide food and shelter for insects that are food for larger animals. These same plants also support pollinators that we need to produce our own food. Speaking of food, I also believe it’s important for Austin gardeners to produce more of our own food locally, rather than bring food in from out of state. Importing food into Texas requires more energy for shipping and refrigeration, which contributes to climate change. The key to growing fruits and vegetables in Austin is knowing the right time to plant, so I am sharing that information on my podcast.

On a personal level, gardening is great for your physical and mental health. It builds confidence, teaches you how to overcome adversity, and accept what you can’t control. Environmentalists often feel discouraged about humanity and can be weighed down by cynical ideas about humans only as destroyers, but I see humans as gardeners who plant seeds to nurture other forms of life.

What advice do you have for others?

Get out of your own way. For years, I talked myself out of this type of project. I made a lot of excuses for not putting myself out there. I was worried about indulging in something that didn’t directly make money, and I thought that I needed to focus only on my income. I was also worried about looking like an egomaniac just talking by myself to an audience without sharing the podcast with another host, which is something I think a lot of women or other marginalized folks feel is improper or immodest. If you find yourself trying to talk yourself out of a passion project that could truly help others or improve your community, try to be real with yourself instead.

The average transaction price of a new vehicle hit $49,105 in October, according to car shopping guide Edmunds.
Cutting the fuel economy standards is unlikely to provide any fast relief on sticker prices, said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights.
And while looser standards may eventually mean lower car prices, their lower efficiency means that those savings could be eaten up by higher fuel costs, she said.
This assumes vehicle prices will actually go down with eased requirements, which experts say might not be the case.","DETROIT (AP) — President Donald Trump this week announced plans to weaken rules for how far automakers' new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, set under former President Joe Biden.

The Trump administration said the rules, known formally as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards, are why new vehicles are too expensive, and that cutting them will drive down costs and make driving safer for Americans.

The new standards would drop the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles to roughly 34.5 mpg (55.5 kpg) in the 2031 model year, down from the goal of about 50.4 mpg (81.1 kpg) that year under the Biden-era rule.

Here are the facts.

Affordability

TRUMP: EV-friendly policies “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse.”

THE FACTS: It's true that gas mileage standards have played a role in rising vehicle prices in recent years, but experts say plenty of other factors have contributed, and some much more.

Pandemic-era inventory shortages, supply chain challenges, tariffs and other trade dynamics, and even automakers' growing investments in their businesses have also sent prices soaring. Average prices have also skewed higher as automakers have leaned into the costly big pickups and SUVs that many American consumers love.

The average transaction price of a new vehicle hit $49,105 in October, according to car shopping guide Edmunds.

A Consumer Reports analysis of vehicles for model years 2003 to 2021 — a period in which average fuel economy improved 30% — found no significant increase in inflation-adjusted vehicle prices caused by the requirements. At the same time, it found an average of $7,000 in lifetime fuel savings per vehicle for 2021 model year vehicles compared with 2003. That analysis, done primarily before the coronavirus pandemic, attributed much of the average sticker price increase to the shift toward bigger and more expensive vehicles.

Cutting the fuel economy standards is unlikely to provide any fast relief on sticker prices, said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights. And while looser standards may eventually mean lower car prices, their lower efficiency means that those savings could be eaten up by higher fuel costs, she said.

Ending the gas car?

TRUMP: Biden’s policies were “a quest to end the gasoline-powered car.”

THE FACTS: The Biden administration did enact several policies to increase electric vehicle adoption, including setting a target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act included tax incentives that gave car buyers up to $7,500 off the price of an EV and dedicated billions of dollars to nationwide charging — funding that Trump tried to stop. The Biden administration increased fuel economy requirements and set stricter tailpipe emissions limits.

While those moves sought to help build the EV market, there was no requirement that automakers sell EVs or consumers buy them. And gasoline cars still make up the vast majority of the U.S. market.

EV charging

TRUMP: “We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them.”

THE FACTS: While many potential EV buyers still worry about charging them, the availability of public charging has significantly improved in recent years.

Biden-era funding and private investment have increased charging across the nation. There are now more than 232,000 individual Level 2 and fast charging ports in the U.S. As of this year, enough fast charging ports have been installed to average one for every mile (1.6 kilometers) of National Highway System roads in the U.S., according to an AP analysis of data from the Department of Energy.

However, those fast charging stations aren’t evenly dispersed. Many are concentrated in the far West and the Northeast, where sales of EVs are highest.

Experts note that most EV charging can be done at home.

Safety

TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: The reduced requirements will make drivers “safer on the roads because of all the great new technology we have that save lives.”

THE FACTS: Newer vehicles — gas and electric — are full of advanced safety features, including automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping, collision warnings and more.

Duffy suggested that consumers will be more likely to buy new vehicles if they are more affordable — meaning fewer old cars on the streets without the safety technology. This assumes vehicle prices will actually go down with eased requirements, which experts say might not be the case. Besides, high tech adds to a vehicle's cost.

“If Americans purchased more new vehicles equipped with the latest safety technologies, we would expect overall on-road safety to improve,” Edmunds' Caldwell said. “However, it’s unclear whether easing fuel-economy standards will meaningfully increase new-vehicle sales.”

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent automotive research nonprofit, also says electric or hybrid vehicles are as safe as or safer than gasoline-powered cars.

Another part of safety is public health. Efficiency requirements put into place to address the 1970s oil crisis were also a way to reduce pollution that is harmful to humans and the environment.

“This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans,” said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All campaign. “This dangerous proposal adds to the long list of ways the Trump administration is dismantling our clean air and public health protections.”

U.S. states are getting about $4 billion in payments from the federal government this year from energy development revenue on federal land.

The federal government collects these dollars from energy companies for rent, royalties and lease fees. Then it disperses some of that back to individual states. States later use the funds to pay for day-to-day spending and savings.

New Mexico continues to receive the largest payments, accounting for nearly 70% of state disbursements. It received almost $3 billion in the 2025 fiscal year.

That’s because the state partially sits on top of the oil-rich Permian Basin, according to Kristin Smith, a researcher at the Montana-based nonprofit, Headwater Economics.

“If you took out New Mexico, there’d be a different story in these numbers,” Smith said.

For Wyoming, the next largest recipient of revenue payments, Smith said the story is all about declining coal revenues. The state received $544.87 million this fiscal year. That’s nearly $50,000 less than 2024 and almost $300,000 less than 2023, according to federal data.

Utah also saw drops, though it did gain more revenue from geothermal energy production ($5 million). Montana and Colorado saw upticks, largely due to oil and gas development.

Mountain West State Energy Revenue Disbursement (FY 2025) New Mexico $2.76 billion Wyoming $544.87 million Colorado $90.77 million Utah $81.72 million Montana $27.02 million Nevada $11.97 million Idaho $6.36 million Arizona $354.52

Overall, the state revenue total was down slightly from previous years, which the Trump administration blamed on a drop in commodity prices. A U.S. Department of Interior press release said the administration’s efforts to unleash American energy helped unlock those dollars.

However, Smith said the market often plays a bigger role in revenue totals than federal policy.

“When you think about where are the places that are benefiting the most or the least, or who’s experiencing changes, that is often dictated by market and commodity prices,” Smith said.

She added that this revenue source is volatile, and states should rely on it less for day-to-day spending and invest more in long-term savings.

“ There’s always a risk of economic dependance,” Smith said. “You don’t wanna be dependent on revenue that just goes poof and isn’t there next year.”

Louisiana, North Dakota, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, California and Alaska also received millions in energy revenue payments.

The federal government also disburses the money to tribal nations, the Reclamation Fund, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Historic Preservation Fund and other federal agencies.",https://891khol.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-28.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 16:03:38.041369

Community solar, which is available in 23 states has brought clean energy to renters, low-income households and those unable to access rooftop solar.
Traditional community solar helps households access clean energy and save through bill credits, but without energy storage, community solar is fundamentally an access-only tool — it gives people access to clean energy when the sun is shining.
Community solar + storage fits that need better than any other energy source on the market.
Community solar + storage is the next frontier of energy equity, reliability and affordability — and Illinois is leading the way.","In late October, the Illinois General Assembly passed the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act (CRGA), a major landmark legislation that will make Illinois’ grid more resilient, add new clean energy capacity and meaningfully reduce ratepayers’ energy bills. The bill is nearly 1,000 pages long, with dozens of provisions focused on affordability. But one of the most transformative pieces is the development of a new large-scale battery and community solar + storage program.

The timing could not be more timely. The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects to see 63 GW of new utility-scale electric-generating capacity to be added in the United States in 2025, which is nearly a 30% increase over 2024. Of the projected 63 GW for 2025, solar and battery storage together account for about 81% of the additions.

While existing projections are focused on utility-scale development, what those projections miss is the untapped potential on the distributed energy scale. Community solar, which is available in 23 states has brought clean energy to renters, low-income households and those unable to access rooftop solar. Energy storage is the missing piece community solar has been waiting for: It ensures that the sun keeps powering things even when the sun goes down. The CRGA is turning clean energy access into true resilience, and other states should take note and implement similar policies.

Lower ratepayers’ bills

After one of the most expensive summers on record for electricity bills, states urgently need solutions that can bring immediate and lasting relief to ratepayers. Solar + storage is one of the most effective solutions available. Traditional community solar helps households access clean energy and save through bill credits, but without energy storage, community solar is fundamentally an access-only tool — it gives people access to clean energy when the sun is shining. When low-cost daytime solar power is stored and used during the expensive evening peak hours, families see direct, measurable reductions on their monthly bills.

Build resiliency

Beyond savings, community solar + storage strengthens local grids and reduces the need for costly, grid upgrades and emergency utility measures that often get passed back to customers. Storage can relieve congestion, smooth demand spikes and help utilities avoid expensive capacity price spikes.

Storage also enables communities to maintain critical services when the grid does go down. Paired with community solar, batteries can keep critical infrastructure powered during emergencies.

Growing energy demand

With energy demand rising nationwide, states need to deploy resources quickly and cost-effectively. Community solar + storage fits that need better than any other energy source on the market. Solar projects can be permitted and built in a fraction of the time it takes to construct gas plants or transmission lines, and battery storage can be added modularly, scaled as needed.

Distributed projects also support local economic development and provide capacity close to load, reducing strain on high-voltage infrastructure. In a time of growing energy demand, states that prioritize community-based solar + storage will be best equipped to keep pace with growing demand.

A strategic response to OBBBA

With the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) now in effect, federal tax credits for most clean energy technologies are being phased out, creating uncertainty for states trying to meet their climate, reliability and affordability goals. But one critical exception remains: battery storage still qualifies for the federal investment tax credit (ITC). Under the current rules, storage projects that begin construction before January 1, 2033, remain fully eligible, and the credit does not fully phase out until December 31, 2035. This gives states a meaningful but limited runway to expand storage deployment while federal support is still available.

By rapidly scaling solar + storage programs, states can ensure that the clean energy they’ve already built continues to deliver value despite federal rollbacks.

Integrating storage into community solar is not only a climate strategy, it’s an affordability and reliability strategy. States that act now will protect ratepayers, stabilize their grids and preserve clean energy progress. States that move quickly to integrate storage into community solar and broader energy programs can provide clean energy reliability, affordability, and protection — exactly when customers need it most.

Illinois has shown the nation what forward-looking clean energy policy can achieve. With rising energy demand, escalating climate risks, and shifting federal policy, states cannot afford to wait. Community solar + storage is the next frontier of energy equity, reliability and affordability — and Illinois is leading the way. It’s time for other states to follow.",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/stock-solar-storage-forefront-california-easterly.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 14:02:16.071930

Batteries in 2025: A Recap

The Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was a shot of adrenaline for battery projects. It injected hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies into the space, helping sprout sprawling factories (or at least plans for them) nationwide. We all know what happened next.

After President Trump returned to the White House in January, there was immediate whiplash on the policy front. Several battery plants either paused or shut down, jobs evaporated and automakers scrambled to redirect investment into stationary storage systems to soften the blow from the EV slowdown.

Still, 2025 proved that the the ship had already sailed. Projects announced in the Biden era that had come far along marched toward completion. EV prototypes with solid-state batteries hit the road as automakers continued to make bolder promises about the “holy grail” tech.

Meanwhile, today’s lithium-ion batteries continued to improve. Automakers released new or refreshed EVs with more efficient batteries delivering longer range at more competitive prices. We also saw lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) technology return to America, along with novel approaches such as the lithium-manganese-rich (LMR) battery chemistry to address affordability concerns.

The torrent of battery news in 2025 felt like five years compressed into one. And because this industry impacts everything from how we drive to how we power our homes and how we deal with natural disasters, the InsideEVs team covered it all obsessively, with scoops, technical deep dives, factory visits and interviews with industry leaders.

General Motors and Ford are working on a breakthrough battery chemistry called lithium-manganese-rich (LMR), which aims to deliver driving range closer to current nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) packs at costs comparable to cheaper lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. I visited General Motors’ top-secret battery facilities in Warren, Michigan, this Spring to learn how these LMR batteries are made and what their implications are for the EV industry. I also spoke to engineers at Ford who described LMR tech as “LFP of the West” and the answer to “what’s next?”

O’Konek.","BISMARCK –United States Attorney Nicholas W. Chase announced today, pursuant to the terms of a plea agreement, U.S. District Judge Daniel M. Traynor sentenced Targa Badlands LLC, a company which does business in North Dakota, to: 1) three years of probation; 2) 500 hours of community services to the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation; 3) payment of a $500,000 fine on a National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”) Clean Air Act violation; and 4) $400.00 in special assessments. Targa Badlands LLC pleaded guilty to this offense on February 18, 2025.

As stated in the criminal information and plea agreement, Targa Badlands LLC operates six natural gas compressor stations on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. Between 2018 and 2022, Targa Badlands LLC operated the Johnson Compressor Station, located in Dunn County, North Dakota, but failed to timely install continuous parameter monitoring systems on two Johnson Compressor Station engines when required to do so under NESHAP. Continuous parameter monitoring systems monitor and collect data on temperature and pressure for engine operations to ensure the catalyst is being utilized properly, thus ensuring the engine not producing excess emissions. Failure to timely install a required continuous parameter monitoring system can lead to increased hazardous air pollutants being released into the environment.

Additionally, as described in the plea agreement, on two prior occasions, in 2019 and 2021, Targa Badlands LLC had previously agreed to pay civil penalties to the United States—and entered into Consent Agreement and Final Order’s with the EPA—for separate NESHAP violations pertaining to natural gas compressor stations it operates on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation.

Finally, as noted in the plea agreement, Targa Badlands LLC self-identified, self-reported, and corrected the failure to timely install continuous parameter monitoring systems at the Johnson Compressor Station and has since adopted an implemented policy and procedural best practices to improve its environmental permit review and implementation requirements.

“Today’s sentence underscores the importance of enforcing our environmental laws, which protect the land, water, and communities,” said US Attorney Chase. “At the same time, we recognize that Targa Badlands LLC took responsibility for its actions and self-reported the violation. Natural gas production is vital to our state’s economy, and it must be done responsibly. This case demonstrates that we can support strong energy production while holding companies accountable when they fall short of their legal obligations.”

This case was investigated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency – Criminal Investigation Division and prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Jonathan J. O’Konek.

Key findings: • 96% of renewable energy investments went to the power sector, continuing a long-term trend.

China accounts for 80% of global investment in manufacturing facilities for solar, wind, battery and hydrogen technologies between 2018 and 2024.","Global investments in the energy transition reached a new record of USD 2.4 trillion in 2024 – a 20% increase from the average annual levels of 2022/23. About one-third was directed towards renewable energy technologies, pushing renewable energy investment to USD 807 billion.

Despite this milestone, year-on-year growth of renewables slowed significantly, with annual investments increasing by 7.3% in 2024, compared to 32% the year before, a new report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) finds.

Global Landscape of Energy Transition Finance 2025 was released ahead of the UN Climate Conference COP30 in Belém, Brazil. It aims to inform the global finance dialogue and support delegations by tracking investments in renewable energy technologies and their supply chains, looking at regional trends as well as finance sources and instruments.

Key findings:

• 96% of renewable energy investments went to the power sector, continuing a long-term trend.

• Global investment in solar PV hit a record with USD 554 billion in 2024, up by 49%.

• Investment in renewable power, grids, and battery storage exceeded fossil fuels investment in 2024, though fossil spending is on the rise.

• Investment in energy transition technologies grew globally, but 90% remained concentrated in advanced economies and China, leaving emerging and developing countries behind.

Francesco La Camera, Director-General of IRENA said: “Investments in energy transition continue to grow but not at the pace needed to achieve the global goal of tripling renewable capacity by 2030. Funding for renewables is soaring but remains highly concentrated in the most advanced economies. As countries gather at COP30 to advance the ‘Baku to Belém Roadmap to 1.3 trillion’, scaling finance for emerging and developing countries is essential to make the transition truly inclusive and global.”

IRENA’s report shows advanced and major economies can draw on domestic financial resources to fund energy transitions. In contrast, lower-income countries depend on external support due to underdeveloped financial markets, limited fiscal capacity, high capital costs, and debt vulnerabilities amongst others.

Globally, nearly half of total investment in 2023 was provided as debt, most of it at market rates. The rest was invested through equity. Grants accounted for less than 1%. The urgent need to mobilise investments, combined with a scarcity of impact-driven capital such as low-cost debt and grants, risks exacerbating debt burdens.

Mr. Francesco La Camera added: “IRENA has long called for smarter use of public funds to unlock private investment through risk-mitigation tools. Yet the heavy reliance on profit-driven capital is leaving developing countries behind. Where private finance won’t flow, the public sector must lead, backed by stronger multilateral and bilateral cooperation and scaled-up climate finance.”

IRENA’s new report also highlights that investment in energy transition supply chains and manufacturing remains critical, but highly concentrated. China accounts for 80% of global investment in manufacturing facilities for solar, wind, battery and hydrogen technologies between 2018 and 2024. Positively, new factories are emerging outside advanced economies and China expanding energy security and socio-economic benefits of the transition to other developing economies.

Overall, global investment in factories producing solar, wind, battery and hydrogen fell by 21% to USD 102 billion in 2024, driven by a significant drop in investments for solar PV manufacturing. In contrast, battery factory investment nearly doubled to USD 74 billion, reflecting rising demand for storage in grids, electric vehicles (EVs) and data centres.

Foreign direct investment, through joint ventures, technology partnerships and knowledge sharing, will be vital to strengthen international cooperation and expand energy transition manufacturing in emerging and developing economies, including through South-South collaboration.

In addition, dedicated policies are needed to ensure these activities are undertaken in a socially and environmentally sustainable manner and that their benefits are shared equitably.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PPAs-are-transforming-the-renewable-energy-sector-in-Portugal.png,N,,2025-12-05 14:02:20.083198

In October, Judge Penelope Richard of Louisiana's 38th Judicial District Court struck down a key environmental permit that the Louisiana energy department had granted to Commonwealth.
Environmental groups applauded the October ruling as an unprecedented win — the first time that a court has invalidated an LNG permit based on climate change and environmental justice.
The state energy agency declined to comment.
It similarly states that the record ""already contains environmental justice analysis surrounding the proposed facility,"" and points to the state and federal agencies.","Louisiana regulators have reissued a permit for a multi-billion dollar liquefied natural gas terminal less than a month after a state judge ruled they had failed to consider the impacts of climate change and environmental justice, a judgment described as a first-of-its-kind.

The permit allows Commonwealth LNG, the Houston-based company planning the gas export facility in Cameron Parish, to move forward with its project. The Nov. 18 permit dismayed environmental groups and advocates, who saw the judge's previous order as a marginal win against the rapid industrial expansion in southwest Louisiana.

Commonwealth is one of more than a dozen LNG export terminals existing, approved or proposed in Louisiana, which has become the global epicenter of the industry. The technology at these massive facilities converts natural gas into liquid form by supercooling it, allowing the fuel to be loaded on tankers and exported worldwide.

Proponents of LNG tout job creation, revenue and the importance of supplying U.S. allies with fuel long seen as burning cleaner than coal. The state's basis for the decision for the permit also notes the ""national significance"" of LNG exports.

But making LNG is more energy-intensive than burning gas alone, leading to more emissions. Recent studies have also found that natural gas may be no better than coal when it comes to climate-warming emissions due to methane leaks throughout the supply chain.

In October, Judge Penelope Richard of Louisiana's 38th Judicial District Court struck down a key environmental permit that the Louisiana energy department had granted to Commonwealth. Richard said the department needed to consider the impacts the terminal will have on the coastal zone and nearby communities, specifically mentioning people living in poverty and recreational fishers.

Her judgment also noted that Commonwealth would be the third LNG facility in the Calcasieu Ship Channel, and that state regulators were obligated to consider the ""potential impacts on storm severity or sea level rise in the coastal zone together with two other LNG facilities,"" she stated.

The Louisiana Bucket Brigade and two national nonprofits, the Sierra Club and the Turtle Island Restoration Network, brought the case against the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy (formerly the Department of Energy and Natural Resources).

Environmental groups applauded the October ruling as an unprecedented win — the first time that a court has invalidated an LNG permit based on climate change and environmental justice.

Last month, the Louisiana regulators determined that the project was ""in the best interest of the state"" and reissued the permit.

Eric Huber, an attorney for the Sierra Club, said that the group's attorneys are reviewing the decision and will decide ""whether further legal action is in order."" Anne Rolfes, who runs the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, said the state failed to get to the bottom of the problems the environmental groups raised.

""In particular, the agency didn't go and talk to the fishermen and did not investigate the really serious claims that the fishing industry is being destroyed by the gas export tankers and pollution,"" Rolfes said.

Commonwealth did not respond to requests for comment. The state energy agency declined to comment.

Using federal, state analysis

Around 90 acres of wetlands will be impacted, which will be ""sufficiently mitigated"" and not significantly harm environmental justice communities, according to the state.

Louisiana officials relied on analysis from other agencies — the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the state's Department of Environmental Quality — in their determination of the climate change-related impacts from Commonwealth's project.

""The information being considered herein was already located within the administrative record of this permit application,"" the state's basis of decision states.

It similarly states that the record ""already contains environmental justice analysis surrounding the proposed facility,"" and points to the state and federal agencies. The state also says that re-creating the other agencies' environmental justice analyses is no longer possible due to a January executive order by President Donald Trump that eliminated a federal environmental justice tool that FERC and LDEQ used.

Environmental groups opposing the LNG buildout criticized the state for not conducting its own analysis beyond information already in the record. James Hiatt, who leads the southwest Louisiana nonprofit For a Better Bayou, said the agency is simply ""rubber-stamping"" the requests of the LNG corporations.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/ee/7eee3999-c815-5211-8033-90cd5ae1d17e/6317ca4081a99.image.jpg?crop=1920%2C1008%2C0%2C35&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-05 14:04:27.324446

The LCDA approval represents an important milestone in the project finance process, allowing the sponsors, working through LCDA as a conduit issuer, to seek an allocation of “volume cap” from the Louisiana State Bond Commission in the same US$402m amount. The volume‑cap request is scheduled for the week of December 15. The final step will be an executive order from the governor of Louisiana, expected in January.

The revenue bonds contemplated under the LCDA resolution are expected to be limited obligations of the issuer payable solely from project‑related revenues and other pledged security, and not from the general funds of the State of Louisiana. Final terms, including interest rates, maturities, security, and covenants, will be determined at the time of any bond issuance and remain subject to additional approvals, documentation and market conditions.

Groups frequently volunteered for cleanups and other park projects, McDonald said, but Thomas surprised him.
The teen’s father, Alex Thomas, credits the program for teaching his son organizational skills and discipline.
“That initiative of his, I think scouting just helped fuel it,” Alex Thomas said.
“He seems to be service driven,” Alex Thomas said.","A dirty creek at a North Texas park started a middle school student on the path to environmental advocacy.

“I noticed there was a lot of plastic in the creek,” said Daniel Thomas, now a 17-year-old senior at Colleyville Heritage High School.

Thomas, who was 11 at the time, went home and started to research why trash ends up in waterways. He learned most of it comes from the land. The teen told the Star-Telegram he realized what a difference it would make if litter could be properly disposed of before it ended up in the water.

Thomas began his environmental efforts by emailing Ray McDonald, at that time the director of parks and recreation in Euless. McDonald said the student’s proposal for a cleanup at 47-acre Bob Eden Park read like a master’s thesis.

“He had a well-thought-out plan of how he wanted to execute that,” McDonald said.

Groups frequently volunteered for cleanups and other park projects, McDonald said, but Thomas surprised him. For one thing, the student didn’t ask for any supplies or equipment from the city. And when McDonald went by Bob Eden Park later, he saw Thomas and his group of volunteers had bagged all the trash and hauled it away themselves instead of leaving it for the Parks Department to deal with.

Since that time, Thomas has conducted monthly litter cleanups in multiple North Texas parks. He’s removed 45,000 pounds of plastic and other trash from local waterways and cleaned over 730 miles of roads. The city of Euless named him Volunteer Youth of the Year in 2022.

“This guy’s special,” McDonald said. “He’s not just doing it to check a box.”

In September, Thomas received the Gloria Barron Prize for Young Heroes for his environmental work. The teen was one of 25 students chosen for the honor out of 700 applicants.

Thomas continues to look for creative ways to combat environmental problems. An app he designed for mobile phones — Litter Scout — allows users to report the location of trash and then check off when an area has been cleaned. His YouTube channel of the same name has nearly 9,000 subscribers. The teen has also published four children’s books on conservation.

“He never fails to amaze me with what he’s doing,” said Tegan Brennen, Thomas’ Scoutmaster.

Thomas joined Boy Scout Troop 1905 in Colleyville when he was 11. At age 12 he earned Eagle Scout, the highest rank available. Thomas said he was inspired by Ross Perot, who achieved that rank at 13.

The teen’s father, Alex Thomas, credits the program for teaching his son organizational skills and discipline.

“That initiative of his, I think scouting just helped fuel it,” Alex Thomas said.

Brennen said he jokingly calls Daniel Thomas a “friend to the bees.” In 2023, the teen, with help from some of his fellow Scouts, built and installed over 50 bee houses for Keep Grapevine Beautiful Pollinator Week.

“He was just very focused,” Brennen said. “I mean, he still has fun, but he was very, very focused.”

In 2022, Thomas was a finalist in the 3M Young Scientist Challenge. He got the idea for his entry — a dosing pump to prevent clogs and bacterial overgrowth in air conditioner condensate lines — from watching his father and HVAC technicians repair the clogged line at his house. The pump’s components only cost $33 in contrast to the hundreds of dollars condensate line repairs can cost.

Community service is another theme in Thomas’ life. In 2019, he started an annual pie drive to thank first responders. He served as Colleyville’s “Mayor for a Day” that year and got to see how much work police officers and firefighters do to keep the community safe. Every Thanksgiving, Thomas and a group of friends deliver 4-pound pies and thank you notes to more than 40 police and fire stations in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

“He seems to be service driven,” Alex Thomas said.

Alex Thomas said from an early age his son has seen family members volunteer their time in various community projects, and he’s just taken that to another level.

Daniel Thomas is already looking into university options for next year. He told the Star-Telegram that he’s still trying to decide where to attend, but he knows he wants to study environmental science.

“I’m really excited about that,” he said.

Thomas said he finds fulfillment in educating other young people about the importance of environmental stewardship. He gives presentations at local elementary school garden clubs and loves sharing what he’s learned with others.

On one cleanup, Thomas and an elementary student found a banana peel on the ground. Thomas asked the boy how long it would take the peel to decompose. The boy guessed it would only take a short time, but Thomas explained it could take several years. Later that day, Thomas saw the student excitedly sharing what he’d learned.

“When you educate youth, you really see the impact,” Thomas said.",https://www.star-telegram.com/public/latest-news/p03a5z/picture313325302/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Daniel%20Thomas%201.png,N,,2025-12-05 14:03:07.665725

What’s going on: “The TCJA reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21%,” Webb, of the Memphis-headquartered global paper company, told a House Ways and Means tax subcommittee hearing on competitiveness on Wednesday. “It established a competitive international tax system, one that made it easier to make things here in America and export them around the world.”

H.R. 1, passed in July, made the pro-growth tax provisions from the TCJA permanent and revived measures that had since expired, “solidifying the U.S. as a hub for manufacturing investment,” Webb continued.

A recipe for success: Sylvamo can employ 1,800 American workers across three locations and support 5,000 additional manufacturing jobs in rural U.S. mill communities in large part because of the benefits of the TCJA and H.R. 1, Webb told the subcommittee.

The tax code prior to TCJA “was an outdated tax code that locked companies’ profits overseas and made it more costly to manufacture here in the U.S.,” she went on.

“The TCJA helped Sylvamo tap into the location, the infrastructure and the skilled workforce here in America, creating jobs for thousands of hardworking Americans. . . . [It] worked, and this year Congress stepped up to make those provisions work for the long term.”

The details: H.R. 1 made industry-preserving changes to the global intangible low-taxed income, foreign-derived intangible income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax provisions that helped manufacturers avoid tax hikes, Webb said in response to a question from senior House Ways and Means Committee member Mike Kelly (R-PA).

In addition, modifications to expense allocation mean Sylvamo is no longer double-taxed due to some of its facilities being overseas, she told Kelly.

The final word: “When we incentivize investment in America, we are strengthening our hand on the world stage with a permanent tax code that provides a foundation for growth,” Webb concluded.",https://image.email.nam.org/lib/fe3311717164047c761c76/m/1/a7b6304b-919d-4d5e-ad03-7f4bccc08934.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 14:02:23.259811

4776, which on Nov. 20 passed the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee with a 25-18 vote, advancing to the full chamber for consideration.
“This bipartisan legislation takes critical steps to reforming a permitting system that too often chills investment, creates uncertainty, and increases costs and delays for essential energy infrastructure projects,” wrote the executives.

“This bipartisan legislation takes critical steps to reforming a permitting system that too often chills investment, creates uncertainty, and increases costs and delays for essential energy infrastructure projects,” wrote the executives.

The letter is signed by Edison Electric Institute (EEI) President and CEO Drew Maloney; Karen Harbert, president and CEO of the American Gas Association; Mike Sommers, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute; American Exploration & Production Council President and CEO Anne Bradbury; Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association; Amy Andryszak, president and CEO of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America; Edith Naegele, president and CEO of the Independent Petroleum Association of America; Natural Gas Supply Association President and CEO Dena Wiggins; and Andrew Black, president and CEO of the Liquid Energy Pipeline Association.

They argue that H.R. 4776 is essential to lowering energy costs, cutting red tape, and providing greater certainty for long-term investments, and said rising energy demand and higher power costs underscore the need for more efficient development of energy infrastructure.

The execs also warned that weaknesses in the current permitting system — including lengthy reviews, shifting political priorities and frequent litigation — stall major projects and increase costs for consumers.

“The SPEED Act directly addresses these challenges and represents meaningful bipartisan progress toward a more stable and dependable permitting framework,” wrote the groups’ leaders. “The legislation reduces delays and provides greater confidence for investments in energy infrastructure by establishing clear permitting milestones and reinforcing the certainty of fully permitted projects.”

Additionally, H.R. 4776 would improve environmental reviews by streamlining existing procedures under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and reducing unnecessary litigation — helping well-supported projects move forward without prolonged delays, according to their letter.

U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-AR) sponsored H.R. 4776 on July 25 alongside lead original cosponsor U.S. Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) specifically to amend NEPA, clarify ambiguous provisions, and facilitate a more efficient, effective, and timely environmental review process.

As the House works to refine the proposed bill, the executives added that lawmakers should include enforceability provisions to ensure accountability when deadlines are missed.

While praising the legislation as an important step, the organizations wrote that additional reforms may be needed as Congress continues working on a broader permitting package.

“As the SPEED Act progresses, we urge continued bipartisan support for its passage,” they wrote, adding that stronger permitting certainty is vital to maintaining reliable and affordable energy supplies across the country.",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2632704549.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 13:01:14.274569

The latest official numbers on generating capacity offer a reality check for those predicting a rise in fossil fuels and nuclear at the expense of renewables. Big infrastructure takes time to finance, approve and build, thus solar and wind dominate the projects coming online over the next several years.

In other news, the Trump administration has fired shots at “established monopolist” Duke Energy as officials test antitrust tools in power markets, and a fight over capacity auctions highlights the risk of phantom data centers.

Here are those and other fascinating figures for your week in numbers.

By the Numbers

88%

Solar and wind’s proportion of the 28 GW of generation capacity added to the U.S. grid in 2025, with solar accounting for the lion’s share. For all the talk about reinvesting in nuclear and gas, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s monthly infrastructure report is a reminder that rhetoric and reality can diverge when it comes to what is actually coming online every month and what makes up the bulk of the queue for the next three years, at least. Wind and solar account for about 84% of “high probability” additions through September 2028, FERC says. The report does not include storage or rooftop solar.

750 MW

The capacity American Electric Power utilities are accused of trying to offload in an upcoming PJM “incremental” capacity auction after anticipated data center load failed to materialize. That’s according to independent power producers and the PJM Interconnection’s market monitor, which are urging FERC to reject a waiver request for the AEP utilities to participate in the auction. The utilities — Appalachian Power, Indiana Michigan Power, Kentucky Power and Wheeling Power — are “fixed resource requirement” entities that don’t typically participate in PJM’s capacity market.

11 hours

The average total duration of blackout U.S. electricity customers experienced in 2024 — nearly double the average of the last 10 years, according to the Energy Information Administration. Hurricanes accounted for 80% of those lost hours. “Interruptions attributed to major events averaged nearly nine hours in 2024, compared with an average of nearly four hours per year in 2014 through 2023,” EIA said. “Service interruptions that aren’t triggered by major events routinely average about two hours per year.”

$325M

The value of incentives Duke Energy allegedly offered the city of Fayetteville, North Carolina, to undercut competition from independent power producer NTE Energy, according to a brief filed at the U.S. Supreme Court by U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer. Sauer urged the justices to deny “established monopolist” Duke’s appeal of a lower court decision allowing an antitrust lawsuit brought by NTE to move forward. “This suggests that the Trump Solicitor General’s Office thinks that antitrust should be a viable tool in electricity markets,” Joshua Macey, a Yale Law School associate professor, told Utility Dive.

The more recent 2015 Refugio oil spill and 2021 Huntington Beach oil spill reinforced our strong opposition to any offshore drilling expansion.","U.S. Representative Salud Carbajal (D-CA-24) joined U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-CA) and 27 members of the California Democratic congressional delegation in condemning the Trump Administration’s official draft 2027-2032 Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program that includes six lease proposals off the coast of Northern, Central, and Southern California. The plan proposes opening vast swaths of previously protected federal waters to new oil and gas drilling for the first time in over 40 years, disregarding bipartisan opposition.

The Trump Administration’s overwhelmingly unpopular proposal directly targets areas former President Joe Biden withdrew from future leasing in January 2025, when he protected 625 million acres. In their letter to President Trump and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, the lawmakers stressed that this plan would undermine state laws that prohibit new offshore drilling along its 1,110-mile coastline and ban new leases for oil and gas infrastructure in state waters.

“We stand united with the overwhelming majority of Californians who fundamentally oppose any proposal that would expand offshore drilling and risk our state’s invaluable, ecologically unique coast,” wrote the lawmakers. “This proposal, coupled with ongoing efforts to reduce federal staffing and funding for agencies that protect our environment, including for safety and oil spill response, is not only dangerous but outright reckless.”

“As we have repeatedly seen in California and other parts of the country, offshore drilling is a ticking time bomb,” continued the lawmakers. “Any expansion of offshore drilling in the waters off the coast of California and the spills that would inevitably accompany it would be devastating to the communities we represent.”

The lawmakers emphasized the devastating impacts new oil and gas leasing would have on California’s environment, military readiness, and diverse coastal economy, threatening the state’s tourism, recreation, fisheries, deepwater port commerce, and defense infrastructure industries. California’s marine economy accounted for $51.3 billion in GDP and $26.7 billion in wages, and pollution off its coast would significantly damage the state’s world-leading economy.

California began efforts to block offshore drilling in 1969 when an oil rig off the coast of Santa Barbara leaked 3 million gallons of crude oil into the ocean, blanketing beaches with a thick layer of oil and killing thousands of marine mammals and birds. It was the largest oil spill in U.S. history until the Exxon Valdez spill 20 years later. In the past decade, the 2015 Refugio State Beach oil spill and the 2021 Huntington Beach oil spill have further demonstrated the immense risks of offshore drilling expansion.

Last month, Carbajal hosted a press call with Central Coast public officials, environmental advocates, and business leaders to condemn the Trump Administration’s plan immediately after it was announced. In addition, Carbajal spoke at a national press conference hosted by Senator Padilla and House Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Jared Huffman (D-CA-02).

In April, Carbajal announced the reintroduction of the California Clean Coast Act. The California Clean Coast Act was the first bill Congressman Carbajal introduced as a Member of Congress, demonstrating his longstanding commitment to protecting California’s coast from offshore drilling and the devastating impact of oil spills.

Full text of the letter is available here and below:

Dear Mr. President and Secretary Burgum:

We write in strong opposition to the Draft Proposed Program (DPP) for the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program. We specifically want to express our strongest opposition to the inclusion of the Northern California OCS Planning Area, the Central California OCS Planning Area, and the Southern California OCS Planning Area in the DPP for oil and gas leasing disposition.

We stand united with the overwhelming majority of Californians who fundamentally oppose any proposal that would expand offshore drilling and risk our state’s invaluable, ecologically unique coast. This proposal, coupled with ongoing efforts to reduce federal staffing and funding for agencies that protect our environment, including for safety and oil spill response, is not only dangerous but outright reckless. As we have repeatedly seen in California and other parts of the country, offshore drilling is a ticking time bomb. Any expansion of offshore drilling in the waters off the coast of California and the spills that would inevitably accompany it would be devastating to the communities we represent.

In April 2025, California officially became the fourth-largest economy in the world, behind only the United States, China, and Germany in global rankings. Our economy is diverse and robust, including sectors such as tourism, recreation, fisheries, deepwater port commerce, and Department of Defense infrastructure. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), California’s marine economy alone accounted for $51.3 billion in GDP and $26.7 billion in wages in 2021. The economic well-being of these sectors is dependent upon a healthy and clean coastline. Further industrialization off our coast will inevitably pollute our beaches, spelling disaster for California’s economy and detrimentally impacting the rest of the country, which relies on California as an economic engine.

California is all too familiar with the devastating impacts of oil spills. The 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill remains the largest in our state’s history—and one of the landmark spills in U.S. history. Immediate damage to birds, intertidal organisms, beaches, and the economy was severe. That experience galvanized Californians and secured an unshakable commitment to protecting our coastline. The more recent 2015 Refugio oil spill and 2021 Huntington Beach oil spill reinforced our strong opposition to any offshore drilling expansion.

Our Congressional delegation, state leaders, and dozens of California municipalities and Tribes have expressed their opposition through resolutions or comment letters, along with state groups and citizens. The bipartisan consensus against expanded offshore drilling has been clear and consistent over five decades. This has resulted in current state laws that include a permanent ban on new offshore oil and gas drilling along California’s 1,110-mile coastline and a prohibition on new leases for oil and gas infrastructure in state waters that enable increased oil and gas production from federal waters. As stated in the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)’s Request for Information and reinforced by the comments BOEM received from our state, “As a result of Congressional moratoria, subsequent Presidential actions, and consistent opposition by the States of Washington, Oregon, and California to any activity off their coasts, the Pacific OCS has not been included in any National OCS Program since the 1987–1992 Program.”

In addition to the economic and environmental reasons for not expanding drilling off California’s coasts, our national defense would be better served by keeping additional oil rigs away from our shores. California’s waters and coastline are strategically vital, hosting a significant number of military installations, key logistics routes, and special-use airspace. Allowing oil and gas development, or the risk of spills, in areas where our servicemembers routinely operate would undermine military readiness and pose risks to national security.

For these reasons and more, we write in strong opposition to the Proposed Program (DPP) for the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program. We specifically want to express our strongest opposition to the inclusion of the Northern California OCS Planning Area, the Central California OCS Planning Area, and the Southern California OCS Planning Area in the DPP for oil and gas leasing disposition. We appreciate your attention to this matter.",https://[lastname].house.gov/images/facebook-meta.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 14:02:27.837815

“There’s a lot of pent up demand” for new data centers and energy to power them, Chief Executive Officer Daniel Bustos said in an interview in Mexico City.

While Mexico is among Latin America’s fastest-growing markets for new data centers, the nation is trailing Brazil, Argentina and Chile on a per-capita basis, according to Bustos. To gain ground, the country, which faces near-constant droughts and an energy grid that’s vulnerable to seasonal rolling blackouts, has to improve its energy capacity, he said.

Esentia plans to use proceeds from a recent share sale and private placement to boost its capacity for transporting natural gas. The company currently operates a private-gas network that runs from Waha, Texas, to the center of Mexico. Eventually, the company will have to look at doubling the size of its system, Bustos said, without providing a timeline.

“There’s a gap on energy security that needs to be closed, and we believe we’re going to be one of the leaders in doing so,” he said.

The data-center industry in Mexico will likely attract more than $9.2 billion of new investments between 2024 and 2029, according to Prodensa, which helps foreign companies establish operations in the country.

New data centers in Mexico will increasingly rely on imported gas, and that means demand for pipeline infrastructure will likely rise.

Currently, Mexico’s imports of US natural gas are at record highs, driven by the nation’s growing electric-power sector, according to the US Energy Information Administration. About 60% of Mexico’s energy grid runs on natural gas — and roughly 70% of that gas is imported from Texas.

In August 2024, the three states – California, Washington and Oregon – were selected for an award in round 1B of the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program.
Howell said the funding for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program is subject to a 20 percent minimum match requirement.

During a webinar on Wednesday, ODOT gave an overview of its plans for the public fleet EV charging stations on both highways.

The Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program is a discretionary grant program that was created by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Its main purpose is to fund alternative fuel infrastructure projects along major highways and interstates throughout the state and communities, with a special focus on medium and heavy-duty infrastructure, said Brett Howell, ODOT’s transportation electrification coordinator.

In 2023, ODOT, the California Department of Transportation and the Washington State Department of Transportation applied for the program. In August 2024, the three states – California, Washington and Oregon – were selected for an award in round 1B of the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program. The total award was roughly $102 million to support the development of medium and heavy-duty focused charging infrastructure, as well as a limited number of hydrogen refueling stations along Interstate 5 in all three states and a few additional corridors in California, Howell said.

Oregon received about $21.1 million to develop two medium and heavy-duty charging stations, and one hydrogen refueling station, all to be located along the I-5 corridor.

Howell said the funding for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program is subject to a 20 percent minimum match requirement. ODOT intends to issue a notice of funding opportunity application sometime next fall.

The Carbon Reduction Program provides money to reduce carbon emissions. Oregon received $4.5 million for installation of an EV charging station along I-84, likely between Portland and The Dalles, Howell said.

For the Carbon Reduction Program, there is a funding match of 10.27 percent. ODOT plans to issue a funding opportunity application for in the spring or summer.

The webinar also addressed a new provision for a program through the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. Oregon DEQ‘s Clean Fuels Program is providing financial incentives for public fleets and their contractors through advance crediting. The financial incentives allow fleets to get an up-front loan of Clean Fuels Program credits when they put a new medium- or heavy- duty electric vehicle into service.

Courtney Herbolsheimer, of Oregon DEQ, said the program, which began in 2016, is a market-based program that reduces the overall carbon intensity of transportation fuels used in Oregon.

“Each type of fuel is assigned a carbon intensity value or level of carbon emissions,” Herbolsheimer said. “Over time, each year, DEQ gradually lowers the amount of carbon intensity average that’s allowed in fuel to meet our annual reduction goals.”

Lower carbon fuels will generate credits, while higher carbon fuels will generate deficits. An entity reports on a quarterly basis the number of kilowatt hours of electricity that are dispensed from its chargers each quarter.

With this new provision – advance crediting – DEQ is able to grant up to six years of credits to an entity up front. Those credits would be received when the vehicle is put into service, Herbolsheimer said.

The program will have one application period per year and will launch in early to mid-2026. Advance credits will apply only to vehicles when they are first put into service. Applicants must remain the owner of the vehicle until they have paid back the advance credits. Oregon DEQ will determine if an application meets the requirements. After an agreement is made, DEQ will issue advance credits.

The entity would pay back those credits over a period spanning at least one year and no later than three years after receiving the credits. Once the credits are repaid, they can go back to the regular program.",https://djcoregon.com/files/2025/12/fleet-ev-charging-scaled.jpg?_t=1764954443,N,,2025-12-05 13:02:04.494556

A coalition of six business groups sent a letter last week to House Appropriations Committee Chair Rep. Ann Bollin, R-Brighton, asking for movement on legislation from both chambers that would codify the program.

In the letter, the groups cited the state’s source for education data, MI School Data, which shows 53.4% of high school seniors enrolled in postsecondary education within six months. This was the lowest in the Great Lakes region and is down significantly from 10 years ago, they said.

The letter requested the committee take up SB 382 and SB 383, along with HB 4955 and HB 4956, which were introduced in September.

“This legislation provides transparency metrics business organizations requested – income levels, persistence and graduation rates, and the types of credentials earned,” the groups wrote. “These measures will help policymakers assess the program’s impact on Michigan’s talent pipeline and economic mobility.”

Having the program in statute would ensure a reliable program with accountability standards in place, the groups said.

“Michigan’s prosperity depends on the skills of its workforce,” the groups wrote. “Codifying the Michigan Achievement Scholarship is a vital step toward building a nation-leading talent infrastructure.”

The Senate bills passed that chamber in September with some bipartisan support (See Gongwer Michigan Report, Sept. 25, 2025). A Senate Fiscal Agency analysis of the bills estimated the cost for the program and the Michigan Achievement Skills Scholarship program at about $270.7 million for the recently completed 2024-25 fiscal year, growing to $590 million by 2027-28.

The president of the Detroit Regional Chamber signed the letter as well as the presidents of Business Leaders for Michigan, the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, the Small Business Association of Michigan, TalentFirst, and the Grand Rapids Chamber of Commerce.

Mike Duggan would like to see his proposed Detroit land value tax brought back before the Legislature under his successor, Mayor-elect Mary Sheffield, and the state’s next governor – hopefully, he said at a Tuesday event, himself.

During a discussion with Rocket Mortgage billionaire Dan Gilbert at an event hosted in his honor by the Detroit Regional Chamber, Duggan recounted the swing-and-a-miss he experienced trying to get the tax reform through the Legislature last session, which he said motivated him to run for governor – and to not do it as a Democrat.

Under the land value tax, which Duggan initially shopped around to lawmakers at the 2023 Mackinac Policy Conference, land taxes in the city of Detroit would be tripled and building taxes would be cut by 30%. He said it would allow the city to cut its 86 mills collected from property taxes down to 60 mills, eliminating the Detroit operating tax (20 mills) and its state school levy (6 mills).

The tax went without a vote at the end of 2023 after being left on the board in the House for more than an hour (See Gongwer Michigan Report, Nov. 28, 2023) and was brought back in 2024, only to become one of the many casualties of the chaotic lame duck session and again fail to see a vote.

Duggan said Tuesday he’d like to see Sheffield renew the city’s efforts to reform its property tax system, ideally alongside himself as a newly elected independent governor in 2027, but regardless of who’s in office, it will require bipartisan cooperation that wasn’t present in 2023 and 2024.

“I do think you will see the new mayor, hopefully with the help of a new governor, take up the land value tax,” he said. “But we have to fundamentally cut property taxes (and) we don’t have the ability to do that without help from Lansing. And maybe we’ll get both parties to finally go along.”

Duggan recalled leadership from both parties in the Legislature telling him the policy would have their support in meetings. However, that was before Rep. Joe Tate, D-Detroit, then the House speaker, “did something I didn’t give any thought to at the time,” Duggan said.

Tate signed on to sponsor the land value tax bill – “Joe thought this was going to be easy, no big deal,” Duggan said – and suddenly, Republican support evaporated and Democrats were unable to reach a 56-vote consensus within Tate’s own caucus.

“As soon as he said, ‘when the Republicans aren’t with us, I need all 56 of you,’ the first one (said) you haven’t taken up my defund the police bill, Mr. Speaker, you haven’t taken up my rent control bill, and now the people on the left of the Democratic Party refuse to vote for it unless he took those up,” Duggan said. “I never got a vote because the two parties were so obsessed with fighting with each other. I literally walked out of that room.”

It was that experience, he said, which sealed the deal on his departure from the Democratic Party.

“I decided that day I was not going to run for governor as a Democrat,” Duggan said. “That decision was made, and that started me thinking, how is the state ever going to change if we keep going this way? And it ultimately led to where we are, and whether people want a third choice, we’re going to find out next year.”

State regulators heard passionate and divided comments Wednesday evening from residents, labor groups, and environmentalists over whether to allow DTE Energy Company to fast-track special contracts with a company pursuing a large data center project.

Supporters of the project to allow OpenAI and its partners to build a multibillion-dollar data center in Saline Township told Public Service Commission members that the project would provide a huge investment opportunity for the state as well as significant good-paying jobs during its construction and for the long term.

Countering were opponents listing a myriad of concerns, including that residential ratepayers would be left holding the bag if the project failed, that the electrical grid cannot handle such a massive influx of energy, and environmental concerns.

DTE is seeking to obtain ex parte approval of special contracts for electric service for the proposed data center, which moves more quickly than a contested hearing process and bypasses public hearings.

PSC Chair Dan Scripps said the public interest in the proposal has been enormous since DTE filed its request for fast-tracking the special contracts. He acknowledged that many of those submitting comments have expressed concerns over the cost to ratepayers and potential impacts on the electric grid.

“As we review the contracts before us for DTE to provide electricity to the proposed data center, we’re closely reviewing some of these same issues around power demand, stress to the grid, costs, and the impact on customer bills,” Scripps said.

He added that there are some concerns raised that fall outside of the purview of the PSC, including siting approvals, construction issues, and air and water permits.

In its filing with the PSC, DTE cited statute that says an amendment in rates or rate schedules applied for a public utility that will not lead to an increase in cost to its customers may be approved without notice or hearing. The utility has used this mechanism to make its case for bypassing public hearings.

The proposed special contracts would provide electricity through Feb. 28, 2045, according to DTE in its filing.

As of Wednesday evening, there were more than 4,850 public comments filed with the PSC in the case.

Among those who submitted written comments was Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who supports the project. She highlighted the estimated 2,500 construction jobs that would be created for the building of the center and about 450 permanent jobs on-site.

“The reality is that data centers are going to be a big part of America’s future. The question isn’t whether they will be built, but rather: can Michigan benefit from these jobs and build data centers in a smarter way while upholding our strong environmental laws to protect our precious natural resources?” Whitmer wrote. “We have an opportunity to do both. We can set an example for the rest of the nation on how to build these facilities the right way and grow our economy at the same time.”

Dozens provided comments to the PSC during a two-and-a-half hour virtual meeting, not all of them sharing Whitmer’s optimism.

Bryan Smigielski, campaign organizer for the Michigan Chapter of the Sierra Club, said ratepayers are being asked to subsidize “a gigawatt-scale gamble for a speculative AI project that has never turned a profit.”

“No one knows if DTE’s renewable build schedule will be able to keep up with this data center’s needs … and no one knows if AI will be ever be profitable enough to pay the billions of new construction and energy costs that could get pushed onto the rest of us,” Smigielski said. “With all these risks, it is reckless, genuinely dangerous, to fast-track this project or any future AI data center project.”

Saline Township resident Tim Bruneau was also opposed, saying the state is under siege by “corporate greed and political overreach from a billion-dollar company and a monopolizing utility company bullying a small rural township with limited resources.”

“We need guarantees that we will not be paying for the infrastructure to support this data center,” Bruneau said.

Randall Whitaker, Washtenaw County Skilled Building Trades Council president, was supportive of the proposal, citing job creation and that it would deliver millions of dollars in local tax revenue and benefits to Saline Township.

“This project also helps keep high-tech work anchored here in Michigan by investing in Michigan’s strong skilled workforce and bringing advanced infrastructure to our area,” Whitaker said. “This project helps keep high-tech work anchored locally rather than being outsourced. That means better opportunities for our workers, their families and the next generation entering skilled trades or tech fields.”

Josh Fraley, who lives adjacent to the project site in Saline Township, was also supportive. . He said learning more about the project has addressed many of his initial concerns.

“Of course, I wish it would stay as farmland, but the property was going to be sold and developed into some non-farm use, and I believe this project is actually the least objectionable path forward for that land,” Fraley said.

Fraley said regardless of whether the fast-tracking of the project is approved, his main concern is that the contract specifically guarantees that the costs are not borne by other customers, asking that the PSC work to ensure that is the case.

Chris Morgan, a Saline Township resident who is group vice president for Walbridge, the general contractor for the project, said it would boost the regional workforce.

“These workers will spend their hard-earned dollars locally, regionally and all in the state of Michigan,” Morgan said. “Too often, younger people shy away from a career in construction because of job security or the travel requirements. This project will provide an incredible opportunity to attract and grow this critical Michigan industry.”

Washtenaw County resident Rima Mohammad said the project would affect the water of the surrounding communities and raise costs for residents.

“Our rural township and county should not bear the environmental and infrastructural cost so that distant companies can profit,” Mohammad said.

Sen. Sue Shink, D-Northfield Township, said she is among nearly two dozen lawmakers who wish to see the PSC hold a contested proceeding in the case.

“The concern is that this is a historic precedent-setting request,” Shink said. “It’s important to set a good precedent. It’s also important that this not be done in secrecy.”

Shink said an ex parte proceeding does not protect the interests of area residents and DTE ratepayers, nor does it allow certain questions to be vetted, such as what happens if the company were to enter bankruptcy and if there is adequate electricity to power all customers in the area.

Attorney General Dana Nessel, in a statement following the meeting, repeated her call for the PSC to grant a contested case hearing regarding the special contracts.

“It is overwhelmingly clear from both the comments shared tonight and the majority of the nearly 5,000 public comments submitted online that Michigan’s residents share in our concerns and demand transparency,” Nessel said. “I again urge the MPSC to listen to the people of the state, to whom they should feel dutybound to represent and defend, to do the right thing and deny DTE’s request to approve these special contracts without a full, contested hearing.”

Nick Occhipinti, senior policy director for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, in a statement also urged that a contested case hearing be granted.

“Private developers and DTE Energy need to prove that everyday Michiganders won’t be forced to subsidize corporate investments in their energy bills, and projects like this won’t hinder or block our transition to the clean energy future that we’ve set together as a state,” Occhipinti said.

The PSC’s next scheduled regular meeting is on Friday, which would be the earliest time at which a decision could be issued on the contracts.

The ‘More Jobs for Michigan’ package looks to reinvigorate an old program as a new economic development tool the sponsor hopes could be the answer to the post-Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve question.

The Senate Regulatory Affairs Committee took testimony Tuesday on two bills sponsored by Sen. Sam Singh, D-East Lansing, SB 471 and SB 472, that would create a payroll tax capture Singh believes was an effective tool before the Legislature decided to let a similar program expire.

The package is similar to the Good Jobs for Michigan program, which was swapped out for SOAR. Singh said SOAR has “lived its life” and has not “found anybody in either party or either chamber that is very excited about (it).”

Although the bills were first introduced in June, they are now being considered amid pressure to put economic development legislation on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer‘s desk per budget negotiations with House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, and Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, D-Grand Rapids.

The House Republicans introduced the “Real Jobs for Michigan” package last month, which would create a payroll credit, not capture, equal to 50% of income tax withheld for each new job a company creates for up to 10 years. The program is capped at $50 million annually with some funds set aside for smaller companies.

The plan would also require the rolling of Michigan Economic Growth Authority into the Corporate Income Tax, necessitating a refinancing of the credits that have been in place since 2009.

Singh said he is having conversations with Hall and what will come out of those conversations is something similar but may be slightly different than what he presented on Tuesday, maybe using aspects of both plans.

In the tax capture, an applicant could receive all withholding tax capture revenues for new jobs up to 10 years with possible extension and up to 20 years for protected jobs.

The program was not simply a “2.0” version of Good Jobs for Michigan, Singh said, but added different provisions including claw backs, environmental protections, a timeline for performance, and local feedback on the front end of the project.

There is no upfront money leaving the state going to the company, Singh said, saying “if the company fails to create the minimum number of jobs, it will never collect any of the revenue.”

The Department of Treasury would certify the number of jobs.

For businesses building in the state, there would have to be a breaking ground within two years of the capture and then a first hire within three years. For businesses not needing to construct facilities, the first hire still must be within three years.

Singh said in conversations with Senate Republicans, he moved the business eligibility for the capture in job requirements down from 50 to 25 positions, with those new jobs needing to pay 175% the prosperity region median wage.

For larger companies able to create 250 new jobs, they would pay 150% of the median wage. In projects with 1,000 or more new jobs, it would require $1 billion investment by a company as well.

He said he could be open to getting the number down to 10 jobs in the program or creating a separate program for microbusinesses.

Another change from the Good Jobs for Michigan program is the addition of retaining jobs as a pathway to the capture, wanting to also protect jobs from leaving the state. The company would have to maintain 50 or more full-time jobs that may be at risk of elimination or moving.

The program would be administered by the Michigan Strategic Fund. House Republicans recently set forth a package to abolish the MEDC that would also fold MSF’s economic development responsibilities.

Chair Sen. Jeremy Moss, D-Bloomfield Township, championed the local control component of the program because he said there must be local buy-in from the community for a project to work.

Singh told reporters after committee that the local aspect partly stemmed from claims that local opposition killed large projects like Gotion and wanting to ensure locals want to see these facilities develop.

Daniel Witt, head of state and local policy at Lucid Motors, which is currently considering an expansion of its engineering and research center in Southfield, praised the program as something that could ensure Michigan is a “magnet” for business attraction.

However, he said Lucid is in a position to consider multiple options in the future due to a competitive landscape for growth in other states but knows that Lucid could meet the requirements in the bill to receive support in hiring and scaling operations.

“Refundable or tax capture-based incentives bridge that gap and make Michigan competitive today, not years down the road,” Witt said.

Maureen Krauss, president and chief executive officer of the Detroit Regional Partnership, said the state needs a modernized income tax capture tool like this for growth in the state, as Michigan continues to fall behind other neighboring states.

However, she suggested net new jobs be part of the commitment, to prevent the tax capture being used to move business from one part of the state to another.

Mike Johnston, executive vice president of government affairs and workforce development for the Michigan Manufacturers Association, opposed the median wage requirements, saying they were too high to attract businesses.

He said many times, the manufacturers set the median wage in the area with their payroll, and that setting the wage standards higher, “forces companies to compete against themselves for wages and benefits.”

James Hohman, director of fiscal policy for the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, also opposed the bills because he believes job creation incentives don’t work as well in comparison to incentivizing companies to not eliminate jobs like the MEGA credits.

Singh said likely what will be seen as the legislature moves closer to the end of the year is a melding of both the Real Jobs and More Jobs proposal.

He said the biggest differences between the plans include a retainment program for all businesses, larger investments and focusing on workforce development overall.

Hall has said before that he wants to see an official elimination of the SOAR statute, which still has $607 million in the pot, and MEGA tax credit continuation as development talks continue.

Singh said he would be open to looking at the elimination of SOAR but being at the heel end of the MEGA credits, sunsetting in 2029, the Legislature may run into legal issues if they don’t repurpose contracts that are already in existence. He said they would have to honor them.

When it comes to hitting the development plan deadline, Singh said he is an optimist and wants to give it a try even as the session days draw fewer.

Having a smoother budget process and maintaining funding for programs and education that will have a long-term positive effect on residents across Michigan are key goals for Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks as she approaches her final year in office.

In a year-end interview this week with Gongwer News Service, Brinks, D-Grand Rapids, stressed that momentum on programs for education, health care, and housing will strengthen the state for the long haul.

During her final year in office, she said a critical priority will be to see passage of a budget that builds on Democrats’ legislative wins of recent years, including expanding the Rx Kids program, expanded school meals, programs enabling more people to earn credentials to boost the state’s skilled workforce, and funding to build new housing.

Funding for various educational programs and science of reading legislation also needs to continue moving forward, she added.

“We hear a lot about education and how we need to improve third grade reading scores,” Brinks said. “We have to support that with our dollars and with our commitment to teachers and students. It will take a couple of years for us to see those results, so maintaining those commitments is going to be critical.”

Expanding the Freedom of Information Act to include the Legislature and governor’s office is another top priority, she said.

“There is no reason we should continue the embarrassment of having Michigan be dead-last in the nation when it comes to ethics and transparency,” Brinks said.

Brinks took aim at House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, over his refusal to take up the FOIA package that passed the Senate earlier this year. The speaker has said the FOIA package is not strong enough for him to support.

“For him to flip-flop on that is really nothing short of a travesty,” Brinks said.

To get FOIA expansion to the governor’s desk before she leaves office at the end of 2026 would be a great achievement, Brinks said.

To meet many of her goals, Brinks said next year’s budget process will need to be more collaborative and transparent than what transpired during 2025 between the Democratic-controlled Senate and Republican-controlled House.

The Legislature this year, for the first time since the late 2000s, went beyond midnight on Sept. 30 to complete work on a state budget.

A few hours after midnight on Sept. 30, lawmakers passed a seven-day short-term spending measure to keep the state government open while final negotiations were completed. The budget was passed early in the morning on Oct. 3. It included a long-term road funding proposal that was a key part of the holdup between the two chambers.

The Senate passed its budget proposal in May, but it took the House until late August to pass their proposal. Both chambers acknowledged they were far apart on many items in the competing proposals, with negotiations proceeding at a glacial pace until late in September.

Brinks placed the blame on Hall for this year’s budget delays, adding that she would like to see more transparency in the budget process in 2026 to see it completed by the end of June.

“Instead, the process was sort of hoarded into the speaker’s office, and staff had more to say about budget decisions over there than members did,” Brinks said. “Countless times, we heard from their members that they didn’t know what was going on or that those decisions were made above them. That’s not what legislators are elected to do, to just follow orders from the top.”

Passing changes to the legislative earmarks process was the only significant procedural improvement Brinks said she saw during the most recent budget cycle.

Hall has touted the legislative earmarks legislation, which passed last month and includes a 45-day wait from when an earmark is introduced to when the Legislature can take it up for a vote.(See Gongwer Michigan Report, Nov. 13, 2025).

After obtaining a Democratic Senate majority for the first time since the 1980s, Brinks said she is optimistic about the party’s chances to hold its majority after next year’s elections.

“We’ve got candidates that are unmatched in their work ethic and their ability to communicate with the people in their district, so we feel very positive about the prospect of who we will be able to make the case with to voters in the coming months,” Brinks said.

She said the political environment has favored Democrats in recent months as well, with the party’s special election candidates exhibiting strong showings across the country ahead of next year’s midterm elections and taking into consideration President Donald Trump’s declining approval ratings.

“And then you add to that our track record of really being able to get things done, to effectively work together to shepherd legislation, to be the chamber and the party that people could count on to do really good policy work … I think our returning members are really strongly situated to maintain that and to bring in new members to be able to continue that legacy,” Brinks said. “I think we have an excellent case to make to voters.”

Brinks said candidates will need to talki to voters about issues that matter, including cost-of-living issues, education, efforts to improve neighborhoods and communities, and housing affordability and infrastructure needs.

“We just have to keep telling our story, and they have to hear that there’s somebody who cares enough about what they think, that they’re willing to knock on their door and have a conversation with your average voter without the filters of all the political baloney, and make sure that they understand that we have solid candidates who really care about what they think, who are going to bring their voices into the Capitol every day when we go to work,” Brinks said.

As for the much-anticipated special election to fill the vacant 35th Senate District seat, Brinks said she believes Democrats are well-positioned to hold onto the seat formerly held by U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet of Bay City. Brinks said the party has a rich field of candidates and that the district, on paper, has a Democratic lean.

“I think you’ve seen prominent Republicans take a pass here because they know it’s going to be really, really tough for them, so we’re in a really good position,” Brinks said. “I’m very confident that we’ll be able to win that. We’ve tested it and proven it with Kristen McDonald Rivet and that district is really in its new form, solidly Democratic leaning.”",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wayne-State-University_Crains_featured.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 13:01:37.580530

The vast majority were controversially crushed with a few units being donated to museums and universities in a non-functional state.

Finding an old car isn’t really a Hackaday story in itself, but now it’s landed in [The Questionable Garage]. It’s being subjected to a teardown as a prelude to its restoration, offering a unique opportunity to look at the state of the art in 1990s electric automotive technology.

The special thing about this car is that by a murky chain of events it ended up as an abandoned vehicle. GM’s legal net covers the rest of the surviving cars, but buying this car as an abandoned vehicle gives the owner legal title over it and frees him from their restrictions. The video is long, but well worth a watch as we see pieces of automotive tech never before shown in public. As we understand it the intention is to bring it to life using parts from GM’s contemporary S10 electric pickup truck — itself a rare vehicle — so we learn quite a bit about those machines too.

Along the way they find an EV1 charger hiding among a stock of pickup chargers, take us through the vehicle electronics, and find some galvanic corrosion in the car’s structure due to water ingress. The windscreen has a huge hole, which they cover with a plastic wrap in order to 3D scan so they can create a replacement.

This car will undoubtedly become a star of the automotive show circuit due to its unique status, so there will be plenty of chances to look at it from the outside in future. Seeing it this close up in parts though is as unique an opportunity as the car itself. We’ve certainly seen far more crusty conventional cars restored to the road, but without the challenge of zero parts availability and no donor cars. Keep an eye out as they bring it closer to the road.",https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ev1_detail.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 13:01:42.431979

While projected 2030 methane emissions are lower than previous forecasts, the report warns that emissions continue to rise.

It states that only full-scale implementation of control measures will close the gap on the Global Methane Pledge's goals.

Produced by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC), the report assesses progress in cutting methane emissions to date.

Inger Andersen, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations and Executive Director of UNEP, says: “Reducing methane emissions is one of the most immediate and effective steps we can take to slow the climate crisis while protecting human health.

“Reducing methane also reduces crop losses, essential for both agriculture productivity and food security.

“UNEP is committed to helping countries turn ambition into action to ensure the solutions in this report deliver real benefits for people and the planet.”

The Global Methane Pledge

The Global Methane Pledge is a partnership launched by the United States (US) and European Union (EU) at COP26 to collectively reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 compared to 2020 levels.

More than 150 countries have joined the pledge, representing nearly half of global human-caused methane emissions.

The Pledge is working across six action areas:

Energy

Waste

Food and agriculture

Plans and policies

Data

Finance.

Meeting the Pledge's goals has the potential to reduce warming by at least 0.2°C by 2050, according to the report.

Economic benefits of methane reduction

Achieving the goals of the Global Methane Pledge will deliver benefits that exceed US$330bn in value annually, the report says.

When factoring in the broader social cost of methane, the benefit would be even greater.

The report estimates the total annual cost of achieving the full maximum technically feasible reductions (MTFR) at US$127bn.

More than 80% of the MTFR could be implemented for a low annual cost and tackle 109 Mt per year.

In the waste sector, methane capture and other methods could deliver US$9bn annually through energy savings.

In the energy sector, the report estimates the combined total annual cost for MFTR measures at US$98bn, equivalent to 2-4% of the sector’s income in 2023, without including environmental benefits.

Julie Dabrusin, Canada’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change and Co-Convener of the Global Methane Pledge, says: “This report is a crucial assessment of our progress and a key indicator of the work that’s required to meet the Global Methane Pledge goal.

“In just four years, we have made improvements, but we must continue to drive faster, deeper methane cuts.

“Every tonne reduced brings us closer to cleaner air, more resilient communities, and a thriving global economy.”

Regulatory landscape and compliance

Despite more than 150 countries participating in the Global Methane Pledge, just six have adopted quantified methane reduction targets: Canada, Japan, Norway, the US, the Republic of Moldova and Vietnam.

The EU Methane Regulation mandates measurement, reporting and verification alongside leak detection and repair for fossil fuel operations.

It also introduced the first methane import standard, requiring importers of oil, gas and coal to demonstrate equivalent monitoring standards from 2027.

Denmark agreed in June 2024 to implement the world's first carbon tax on agriculture, effective from 2030, that will tax livestock farmers on methane emissions.

South Korea requires public and private entities to convert organic waste into biogas, aiming for an 80% conversion rate by 2050.

The US Environmental Protection Agency finalised NSPS OOOOb and EG OOOOc in 2024 to cut methane from oil and gas operations.

However, there have been moves to delay US compliance deadlines and potentially reconsider these regulations.

New Zealand also officially scrapped its world-first plan to price agricultural emissions, the ""farm levy"", in October 2025.

Julie says: “It is important for all countries that have agreed to the Global Methane Pledge to continue to work closely together to drive momentum on methane mitigation, turning ambition into tangible benefits for the planet.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/8116b0e9e4a237080aa591ee9490d417:c5fd820c76b5659bc676d155235b9b32/gettyimages-1394039015.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 17:01:55.618221

Proponents try to beat back data centre scepticism

Region has lost population, income sources

BRISTOL, Virginia - The demise of the coal industry left the U.S. Appalachian region in tatters, with lost jobs, spoiled water and countless miles of abandoned underground mines.

Now entrepreneurs are eyeing the rural region with ambitious visions to rebuild its economy by converting old mines into solar power systems and data centres that could help fuel the increasing power demands of the artificial intelligence boom.

One such project is underway by a non-profit team calling itself Energy DELTA (Discovery, Education, Learning & Technology Accelerator) Lab, which is looking to develop energy sources on roughly 65,000 acres of old coal land in southwest Virginia.

Will Clear and Will Payne, who help manage Energy DELTA Lab, say they imagine building a massive 450-acre Data Center Ridge on top of old mining lands that could be powered and cooled using the billions of gallons of water that naturally replenish below.

Unlike in some neighbouring areas, there is no acid mine drainage, which deposits sulphuric acid and heavy metals from exposed mine rock faces, rendering water unusable, Payne said.

The difference has to do with geology, he said, as Wise County and other area coal fields lack the mineral pyrite, a key culprit in acid mine drainage.

""So the water quality is there. Obviously the cost to use, to circulate this water is low,"" Payne said.

In support, a handful of localities, including Wise County, have a special tax rate on data centre equipment and resolutions aimed at welcoming regional data centre investments.

Payne acknowledges that their plan could meet with resistance in an area hard-hit by coal's decline.

""Anyone looking at expanding in the region, there is scepticism because there have been so many stories of promises made but not kept,"" Payne said at Squabble State Hard Cider & Spirits, a cider-making business he and Clear run near the state border with Tennessee.

Appalachia was once the heart of the nation's coal industry, whose decline decimated local communities.

Amid issues of cost, worker health and the fossil fuel's contributions to global warming, coal has been dropping as a top source of U.S. fuel for decades.

""If you go through coal mining communities, they're ghost towns,"" said Erin Bates with the United Mine Workers of America, a trade union.

""The number of bankruptcies that have happened in the last three decades have destroyed these communities.""

Ambitious vision

Financially, the Data Center Ridge vision is ambitious. Constructing an average-sized data centre facility can cost between $500 million and $2 billion, according to Allianz, a financial services company.

The entrepreneurs hope to prove the feasibility of their idea to Texas-based Energy Transfer, which owns the land in question. The land is managed by Penn Virginia Operating Co.

""They're willing to think about the future, whereas others maybe just don't have the time or don't have the interest,"" Payne said.

Energy Transfer did not respond to interview requests.

Other coal mine repurposing projects are seeing success, at least on a local scale.

The Mineral Gap Data Center, also in Wise County, came online in 2023 and touts itself as the first abandoned mine land to be converted to solar in the state.

In Martin County, Kentucky, a utility-scale solar project on an old mine site that powers some 18,000 homes, came online in December.

The Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit group, is a partner in a 10 MW solar project in Wise County built on the former Indian Creek Surface Mine. Start of construction is planned for next year.

The nonprofit is working on a broader conservation effort spanning more than 250,000 acres in Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee that could include additional solar development, said Brad Kreps, the Conservancy's Clinch Valley Program director.

""Our projects are definitely among the first that are moving forward in central Appalachia,"" Kreps said.

Public interest test

Building new data centres will need on-site renewable energy to be viable, said Jean Su with the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit group.

However, she questioned building data centres generally.

""That should be up to every single jurisdiction to have that type of public interest test to figure out whether it is actually serving their constituency or not – understanding environmental harms, water issues and drainage,"" Su said.

Environmental groups criticize the expansion of data centres, which strain power grids and likely require significantly more energy than can be made available.

Some critics like Bates say data centres might not bring the jobs the area desperately needs, but Payne maintains there will be work for local residents.

A typical data centre can add up to 1,500 workers on-site during construction and employ some 50 full-time workers when up and running, according to a 2024 Virginia state report.

Based on average spending by the industry from 2021-2023, overall the data centre industry is estimated to contribute 74,000 jobs, $5.5 billion in labour income and $9.1 billion in GDP to Virginia's economy each year - mostly in the construction phase, the report said.

Those estimates were just over 1 percent of total statewide employment, income and Virginia GDP for those years, it found.

Nationwide, the number of people working in data centres grew from 306,000 to 501,000 between 2016 and 2023, according to the government's Bureau of Labor Statistics.",https://ddc514qh7t05d.cloudfront.net/dA/7095104532c1a262a8774426234b1063/1200w/Jpeg,N,,2025-12-05 12:02:33.009705

Authors Luke Metzger Executive Director, Environment Texas As the executive director of Environment Texas, Luke is a leading voice in the state for clean air and water, parks and wildlife, and a livable climate.
He has been named one of the ""Top Lobbyists for Causes"" by Capitol Inside, received the President's Award from the Texas Recreation and Parks Society for his work to protect Texas parks.","Texas is home to wide-open skies, desert canyons, pine forests and Gulf Coast beaches that harbor diverse wildlife, support communities and shape life across the state.

From the red rocks of Palo Duro Canyon to the flowing waters of the Rio Grande, these places are what make Texas special, offering us room to explore, connect with nature and enjoy the many landscapes that define the Lone Star State.

Environment Texas’ goal is simple: to protect that natural world.

We research problems, build public support, and advance solutions that keep our air and water clean, our parks accessible and our environment healthy.

In 2025, that meant defending parks and rivers, holding polluters accountable, cleaning up our waterways, protecting wildlife, advancing clean energy and more.

Supporting our state parks

Building on our 2023 success, in which our staff and supporters helped convince Texas voters’ to approve the $1 billion Centennial Parks Conservation Fund, Environment Texas has continued to urge investments in parks and wild places so more Texans can hike, camp and hunt close to home.

In 2025, those investments started to take shape, with new parks opening and preparing to open soon.

For instance, at the newly opened Devils River State Natural Area’s Dan A. Hughes Unit, visitors can paddle some of the clearest water in Texas, hike more than 25 miles of trails, and enjoy possibly the darkest skies in the state.

Farther north, the Palo Pinto Mountains State Park will be the first new state park opened in North Texas in decades. Located about 70 miles west of Fort Worth, the park houses dramatic canyons, steep slopes, long ridges and a 90-acre lake for swimming, boating and fishing. The park infrastructure is still under construction, with the area set to open to the public sometime in 2026.

Meanwhile, on the coast, Powderhorn State Park, opening in 2030, will protect one of the largest remaining undisturbed coastal prairies in the state, home to dolphins, sea turtles, fish and more than 200 bird species, including the highly endangered whooping crane.

These are just a few of the new parks and recreational areas that will be opened and maintained using this funding. But while the Centennial Parks Conservation Fund is helping create and preserve the state’s land, our lawmakers have also been hard at work protecting the wild places that make Texas special.

A bipartisan Big Bend National Park boundary adjustment bill would add 6,100 acres along Terlingua Creek, expanding habitat for hundreds of plant and bird species and protecting some of the darkest skies in the nation. Meanwhile, lawmakers in Austin worked to create the Land, Water and Wildlife Conservation Fund to help preserve Texas’ natural beauty even as development spreads and populations grow.

Between our state park work and the work of decision makers in Austin, this year, Texans got access to even more land to explore, cherish and use.

Keeping Texas waters and beaches clean

Texans should be able to enjoy our beaches, rivers and waterfronts without worrying about getting sick when they swim.

But the Texas “Safe for Swimming” report from our partners at Environment Texas Research & Policy Center found that, on at least one day in the past year, up to 94% of the state’s tested coastal beaches had fecal bacteria levels that were high enough to pose a risk to swimmers. Even worse, nearly half had potentially unsafe levels on at least a quarter of testing days.

That’s why Environment Texas is calling for stronger investments in wastewater and stormwater infrastructure in order to reduce the flow of sewage and bacteria into our waterways. In addition, we’re also working for better water testing and monitoring so families can count on jumping into clean, safe water at their favorite beaches.

Outside of bacterial pollution, Texas coastlines and waterways face another unseen threat. Nurdles, tiny pre-production plastic pellets, remain a persistent issue in Texas bays, streams, marshes and beaches.

These pellets are the raw material used to make many common plastic products, but due to their size and abundance they can often spill or leak during manufacturing and transport. Once they spill into the environment, these nurdles are nearly impossible to fully clean up.

In response, Environment Texas is working with a diverse coalition of recreational fishermen, oyster harvesters, tourism leaders and conservation groups to urge state leaders to adopt stronger limits on this often unseen, yet still impactful, plastic pellet pollution.

This broad coalition is calling on the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, as well as the governor, to help hold pellet polluters accountable and protect beaches, wildlife and coastal communities from this waste.

While we continue urging our lawmakers to act, we are also engaging in much-needed public education and local pellet cleanup events. For example, at Sylvan Beach in La Porte, we joined 55 Rice University students for a plastic pellet count and cleanup. The students collected nurdles and other trash, learned about environmental advocacy, and even called Gov. Abbott’s comment line to support the passage of stronger environmental standards for marine microplastic pollution.

Holding polluters accountable for air emissions

Communities and individuals living near ExxonMobil’s Baytown complex have lived with illegal air pollution for years.

But, after a 15-year legal battle waged by Environment Texas and Sierra Club, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Exxon’s final appeal, instead allowing a $14.25 million civil penalty for more than 16,000 Clean Air Act violations at the facility to stand.

That’s the largest penalty ever imposed in a citizen-initiated Clean Air Act case.

Our lawsuit documented more than 10 million pounds of illegal emissions, including toxic, carcinogenic and ozone-forming chemicals, and relied on heartfelt testimony from brave neighbors who discussed what it is like to live in the shadow of the large, polluting complex. After we sued, ExxonMobil installed pollution controls which cut illegal emissions 82%.

The case reaffirmed the idea that people harmed by illegal pollution can still go to the courts to enforce environmental laws when lawmakers and regulators fail to act. While it’s just one facility, this case shows how persistent citizen support can help hold even the largest of polluters accountable.

Outside of our Exxon case, Environment Texas also worked to cut atmospheric methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Through public outreach and discussion, Environment Texas coordinated discussions and mobilized public support for stronger state and federal standards against methane pollution

We helped to deliver comments to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the governor, engaged partners across the state, and collected more than 1,000 public comments in defense of EPA’s methane regulations.

Promoting clean, renewable solar power

Texas leads the nation in wind power and is second in solar, and recent policy changes will help keep that clean energy momentum going.

A new Environment Texas-backed law will streamline rooftop solar permitting by allowing certified third parties to review simple residential applications, reducing delays that have slowed installations and delayed implementation. By making the permitting process quicker, easier and more predictable, we can help more Texans put solar on their roofs quicker, cutting pollution and saving money on their energy bills.

Research suggests that this streamlining could reduce the cost of rooftop solar installation by over $2,000 by 2030, eventually saving Texas families up $3,500 a year in their utility bills.

Aside from winning bills, Environment Texas and our allies also worked to block a slate of anti-renewable energy legislation that would have made it harder and more expensive to build new wind and solar projects. By making a strong case against these discriminatory fees, fossil fuel mandates and unnecessary hurdles in the legislature, we helped protect Texas’ position as a national leader in clean energy, making it more likely that renewable power will continue growing unhindered for years to come.

Protecting birds, bees and other wildlife

Nearly 2 billion birds, or roughly one in four of all U.S. birds, migrate through Texas each year along the “Central Flyway,” but bright nighttime lighting and large, reflective glass in cities is making migrating around buildings a major threat.

All in all, about a billion bird collision deaths occur annually in the United States. While not the sole factor, these collisions are certainly contributing to an overall major decline in America’s bird populations.

That’s why Environment Texas is working to make cities safer for migrating birds by promoting “Lights Out” policies and bird-friendly building design.

For instance, in Dallas, we organized a petition and built public support calling on the Dallas City Council to adopt stronger and longer Lights Out policies, asking large buildings to limit nonessential night-time lighting during peak migration seasons. We also urged the council to better adopt bird-safe designs, such as bird-safe glass. This glass is covered with small translucent dots, which make it easier for incoming birds to notice and avoid, saving lives and reducing cleanup costs.

These efforts in Dallas, Austin and other cities can reduce collisions and make the Texas’ skyline safer for the millions of migrating birds that have to pass through our state, and cities, each spring and fall.

But it’s not just our birds that are under threat from human activity, many native pollinators are also under pressure.

We’ve been raising awareness of the steep declines in native bees, butterflies and other pollinators. In response the Texas House voted to create a pollinator health task force, charged with identifying ways to help prevent habitat loss, reduce pesticide use, and promote new pollinator habitat across the Lone Star State.

This year, Environment Texas has worked to defend public lands and rivers, hold polluters accountable, tackle pellet pollution and accelerate clean energy growth across the state.

But our work is far from finished. We will keep working to ensure Texas’ parks, rivers, coasts, forests, plains and other natural areas, as well as the wildlife they support, are protected and preserved for generations to come.

In 2026, Environment Texas remains committed to working for a cleaner, greener, healthier Lone Star State, but we can’t power campaigns, engage in research, and advocate for Texas’ natural world by ourselves.

That’s where supporters like you come in.

If you’d like to help keep Texas’ skies clear, our waters clean and our wild places thriving consider making a donation to Environment Texas today.

In its annual World Energy Employment report, the Paris-based watchdog said on Friday that the Current Policies Scenario (CPS), which it reintroduced under pressure from the Trump administration, has “more muted” employment growth than the Stated Policies Scenario.

The CPS sees oil and gas demand continuing to rise until at least 2050 – a scenario that the IEA described as “cautious” and “anchored in enacted laws and measures” and was widely criticised by clean energy experts.

A fast energy transition would spur investment in construction, creating more jobs across the sector. New roles for electricians, building insulators, solar panel and energy-efficient lightbulb installers, and transition mineral miners would more than offset job losses in coal mines, power plants and oil and gas fields, the report found.

Anabella Rosemberg, Just Transition lead at Climate Action Network International, lamented that the clean energy sector is “being undermined at a time when employment creation is of utmost priority”.

“Climate ambition and decent job creation must go hand in hand – but as the recent conversations at COP30 showed, there is a need for both the right targets and just transition strategies to make it happen,” she added.

A more ambitious Net Zero Emissions scenario, aligned with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C, would see roughly ten million more energy jobs created than under the CPS, report author Daniel Wetzel told Climate Home News at a press conference.

Bottleneck warnings

The IEA warned that governments must act to train workers for these roles or risk facing shortages of electricians, welders, and grid specialists – a gap that could slow the energy transition and drive up wages and energy costs.

IEA head Fatih Birol highlighted a particular shortage of qualified workers in the nuclear industry, warning that the problem could worsen as the sector’s workforce continues to age. “I hear nuclear is making a comeback, but the interest in the nuclear sector for the jobs is rather weak,” he said.

Laura Cozzi, IEA’s Director of Sustainability, Technology and Outlooks, warned of a shortage of skilled workers in electricity grids. “That is one of the key ingredients why we are not seeing grids ramp up as [they] should,” she said. Over 60 governments pledged at COP29 to improve and expand their grids to enable clean electricity to flow to where it is needed.

Bert De Wel, Global Coordinator for Climate Policy at the International Trade Union Confederation, celebrated that the energy transition is creating jobs but added that they should be good jobs with decent pay, conditions and union rights. Decent work would attract skilled workers, he added.

The report found that wages in the oil and gas industry have generally risen faster over the past year than in the solar – and especially the wind – sectors. It noted that the oil and gas industry has a “historical tendency to offer highly competitive wages to attract and retain top talent”.

At the COP30 climate summit, governments agreed to set up the Belém Action Mechanism to try and make the energy transition fairer to groups such as workers in the energy industry. It will give trade unions a formal role in shaping just transition policies, for what the ITUC says is the first time.

ITUC General Secretary Luc Triangle called it a “decisive win for the union movement and working people across the world, in all sectors but especially those in transition industries.”",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/04/Climate-Home-News-Solar-rooftop-in-Nakhon-Pathom-3-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 13:01:09.378850

Two new data centers in Silicon Valley have been built but can’t begin processing information: The equipment that would supply them with electricity isn’t available.

It’s just one example of a crisis facing the U.S. power grid that can’t be solved simply by building more power lines, approving new power generation or changing out grid software. The equipment needed to keep the grid running – transformers that regulate voltage, circuit breakers that protect against faults, high-voltage cables that carry power across regions, and steel poles that hold the network together – is hard to make, and materials are limited. Supply-chain bottlenecks are taking years to clear, delaying projects, inflating costs and threatening reliability.

Meanwhile, U.S. electricity demand is surging from several sources – electrification of home and business appliances and equipment, increased domestic manufacturing and growth in AI data centers. Without the right equipment, these efforts may take years longer and cost vast sums more than planners expect.

Not enough transformers to replace aging units

Transformers are key to the electricity grid: They regulate voltage as power travels across the wires, increasing voltage for more efficient long-distance transmission, and decreasing it for medium-distance travel and again for delivery to buildings.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that the U.S. has about 60 million to 80 million high-voltage distribution transformers in service. More than half of them are over 33 years old – approaching or exceeding their expected lifespans.

Replacing them has become costly and time-consuming, with utilities reporting that transformers cost four to six times what they cost before 2022, in addition to the multiyear wait times.

To meet rising electricity demand, the country will need many more of them – perhaps twice as many as already exist.

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation says the lead time, the wait between placing an order and the product being delivered, hit roughly 120 weeks – more than two years – in 2024, with large power transformers taking as long as 210 weeks – up to four years. Even smaller transformers used to reduce voltage for distribution to homes and businesses are back-ordered as much as two years. Those delays have slowed both maintenance and new construction across much of the grid.

Transformer production depends heavily on a handful of materials and suppliers. The cores of most U.S transformers use grain-oriented electrical steel, a special type of steel with particular magnetic properties, which is made domestically only by Cleveland-Cliffs at plants in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Imports have long filled the gap: Roughly 80% of large transformers have historically been imported from Mexico, China and Thailand. But global demand has also surged, tightening access to steel, as well as copper, a soft metal that conducts electricity well and is crucial in wiring.

In partial recognition of these shortages, in April 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy delayed the enforcement of new energy-efficiency rules for transformers, to avoid making the situation worse.

Further slowing progress, these items cannot be mass-produced. They must be designed, tested and certified individually.

Even when units are built, getting them to where they are needed can be a feat. Large power transformers often weigh between 100 tons and 400 tons and require specialized transport – sometimes needing one of only about 10 suitable super-heavy-load railcars in the country. Those logistics alone can add months to a replacement project, according to the Department of Energy.

Other key equipment

Transformers are not the only grid machinery facing delays. A Duke University Nicholas Institute study, citing data from research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, shows that high-voltage circuit-breaker lead times reached about 151 weeks – nearly three years – by late 2023, roughly double pre-pandemic norms.

Facing similar delays are a range of equipment types, such as transmission cables that can handle high voltages, switchgear – a technical category that includes switches, circuit breakers and fuses – and insulators to keep electricity from going where it would be dangerous.

For transmission projects, equipment delays can derail timelines. High-voltage direct-current cables now take more than 24 months to procure, and offshore wind projects are particularly strained: Orders for undersea cables can take more than a decade to fill. And fewer than 50 cable-laying vessels operate worldwide, limiting how quickly manufacturers can install them, even once they are manufactured.

Supply-chain strains are hitting even the workhorse of the power grid: natural gas turbines. Manufacturers including Siemens Energy and GE Vernova have multiyear backlogs as new data centers, industrial electrification and peaking-capacity projects flood the order books. Siemens recently reported a record $158 billion backlog, with some turbine frames sold out for as long as seven years.

Alternate approaches

As a result of these delays, utility companies are finding other ways to meet demand, such as battery storage, actively managing electricity demand, upgrading existing equipment to produce more power, or even reviving decommissioned generation sites.

Some utilities are stockpiling materials for their own use or to sell to other companies, which can shrink delays from years to weeks.

There have been various other efforts, too. In addition to delaying transformer efficiency requirements, the Biden administration awarded Cleveland-Cliffs $500 million to upgrade its electrical-steel plants – but key elements of that grant were canceled by the Trump administration.

Utilities and industry groups are exploring standardized designs and modular substations to cut lead times – but acknowledge that those are medium-term fixes, not quick solutions.

Large government incentives, including grants, loans and guaranteed-purchase agreements, could help expand domestic production of these materials and supplies. But for now, the numbers remain stark: roughly 120 weeks for transformers, up to four years for large units, nearly three years for breakers and more than two years for high-voltage cable manufacturing.

Until the underlying supply-chain choke points – steel, copper, insulation materials and heavy transport – expand meaningfully, utilities are managing reliability not through construction, but through choreography.

“Residents who live closest to these facilities face elevated health threats from both pollution and poverty, compared with the general population,” the report said.

Port Arthur is one of the most economically disadvantaged cities in Texas, with a poverty rate of 27.2% in 2021.”","TEXAS — Texas is expanding its petrochemical industry with new facilities, but that could affect the health of the lower-income communities where the new plants will be located.

A release published by Texas Southern University claims that the people living near the 89 new facilities in five different regions (Port Arthur/Beaumont, Greater Houston, the Coastal Bend, the Southern Coast and Inland Texas) will likely disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic neighborhoods.

“The findings show that nine out of ten petrochemical facilities are proposed in Texas counties with higher demographic vulnerability (in the form of higher numbers of people of color, or higher numbers of people in poverty, or both) than other areas of the state or the nation—in neighborhoods where residents are already living with significantly higher pollution and health risks than most communities in the country,” the report said.

The report then talked more about how the expansion historically affects the communities in negative ways.

“Earlier studies show Black and Latino Americans face increased risk of experiencing chemical disasters because there are disproportionately home to industrial facilities that release deadly toxins through fires, explosions, leaks, and spills. Overall, 93% of facilities in our study are located near other high-risk facilities covered by federal Risk Management Plans (RMP), compounding health and safety dangers for nearby residents,” the report said.

Among the most affected is Jefferson County, whose county seat is Beaumont, which has some of the worst exposure to toxic air in the United States, according to the report.

“In Jefferson County, 90% of the facilities are proposed in communities that rank among the most overburdened in the nation, enduring worse particulate matter, toxic air releases concentration of risk management facilities, and deeper social vulnerability than 75% of the United States,” the report said.

The petrochemical industry might represent up to 50% of crude oil production, and, according to the Texas Campaign for the Environment, plastic pollution is expected to rise to three times what it is in 2025.

“With communities of color along the Texas and Louisiana coast already heavily burdened with industrial pollution, a proliferation of new and expanded petrochemical and plastics infrastructure would only deepen the cruel pattern of environmental racism across the Gulf South,” the TCE said.

The long-term effects of these new plants have yet to be seen, but historical records do not represent a good outcome, even economically, according to the Bullard Center for Environmental & Climate Justice at TSU.

A Future Worth Choosing Humanity’s greatest advances have always come from overcoming fear—fear of sea voyaging, fear of flight, fear of the unknown.","Imagine a world where electricity is so abundant and inexpensive that energy scarcity ceases to exist. A world where every home, every town, every factory and data center has access to reliable, carbon-free power 24 hours a day. Where desalination plants turn seawater into fresh water for drought-stricken regions. Where synthetic fuels such as hydrogen are made cleanly, cheaply, and at scale. Where heavy industries—steel, cement, ammonia—emit almost no carbon. Where the price of energy no longer constrains economic opportunity anywhere on Earth.

This future is not speculative. It is not distant. It is technically available today.

The technologies required to deliver effectively limitless clean energy exist. We have known how to build safe, high-output nuclear reactors for well more than half a century. Moreover, the hundreds of reactors that have been running for the last 70 years have a better safety record than any other power source—that’s right, even better than solar and wind. Modern designs are even safer and simpler than what came before, and they can be built modularly, quickly, and at costs low enough to transform the global economy. We know how to build them; other countries are doing it.

What stands between us and abundant clean energy is not physics, engineering, or economics. It is a cultural fear—a deep, reflexive anxiety about the danger of radiation that has shaped public opinion, education, regulatory frameworks, and policy choices for three generations.

This fear has cost humanity more than almost any other scientific misunderstanding of the modern age.

The Promise We’ve Postponed

If nuclear energy had been allowed to scale naturally after the 1970s, analysts estimate that:

atmospheric carbon might be almost 100 gigatons lower,

millions of lives lost to air pollution would have been saved,

energy prices would be lower and far more stable,

and nations would be less dependent on volatile fuel markets.

Every credible study shows the same thing: Nuclear energy is the safest, cleanest, and most reliable high-density power source humanity has discovered. In the late 1970s, France nuclearized almost all of its fossil-fueled generation. Their experience—abundant clean electricity, minimal carbon emissions, low household power costs—is just a modest glimpse of what widespread nuclear adoption could have provided globally.

We could be living in an age of clean plenty. Instead, we argue about scarcity.

Why Didn’t This Happen?

It didn’t happen because in the late 1950s and ’60s, at the dawn of the nuclear age, the world became deeply—and understandably—frightened. Atmospheric nuclear weapons tests spread fear across continents. Scientists and policy leaders adopted an extremely cautious framework to predict the effect of radiation exposure: the Linear No-Threshold (LNT) model. The model assumes that any dose of radiation, no matter how small, carries health risks.

This was not based on low-dose human data. It was impossible to find low-dose harm in the data. So the model made a precautionary extrapolation from high-dose observations. This was a choice made because the world needed a simple, conservative way to discourage nuclear brinkmanship. In retrospect, it helped shape the visceral global fear of any nuclear radiation.

But the unintended result was that a fear designed to restrain warfare began to restrain peaceful technology and the path to a safer, cleaner world.

Fear Hardened Into Dogma

Over time, the LNT—and the anxieties that accompanied it—ossified into regulation. Agencies mandated that nuclear plants must prevent even radiation releases so small that they are drowned out by natural background variation. Evacuation standards assumed danger at levels far below those ever shown to produce harm. Licensing processes grew lengthier, more expensive, and more extremely risk averse.

Public belief followed. People began to fear even medical imaging. A radiation dose from a CT scan, a dental X-ray, or even an intercontinental flight felt ominous—even though these exposures are tiny compared with the daily exposure experienced by people living with high natural background radiation. In places like Ramsar, Iran, and Kerala, India, tens of thousands live with background radiation levels that the LNT predicts will be fatal. Yet their health and longevity are as good as or better than that of surrounding populations.

Decades of scientific study, including large-scale investigations by the United Nations Scientific Committee and others, have shown that negative health effects from chronic low-dose radiation, if they exist, are too small to detect. Yet though challenged, the LNT continues to direct policy, regulation, and fear.

The human body is not fragile. It is resilient. Our biology evolved in a sea of natural radiation and its repair mechanisms handle low-dose exposure easily. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be here.

The Real Consequences of Imaginary Danger

Treating minuscule potential risk as if it were to bring certain harm has had profound global consequences:

The United States abandoned a clean, safe energy technology just as it was maturing.

Developing nations grew dependent on coal because nuclear projects were deemed too “dangerous.”

The world poured trillions into fossil fuels—the energy source that is actually deadly, actually polluting, and actually destabilizing our climate.

Medical, industrial, and research uses of radiation were slowed, discouraged, or made prohibitively expensive.

In short, it is fear of radiation—not radiation itself—that has done measurable harm to human health and well-being.

A Better Approach for a Better Century

We should not ignore real hazards. High-dose radiation, delivered quickly, can be dangerous, even fatal, and must be regulated. But it is time to distinguish genuine risk from imagined peril.

That means:

updating regulatory frameworks so they reflect modern biological knowledge;

ending policies that treat micro-dose exposure as morally unacceptable;

accelerating licensing for new reactors and, especially, advanced reactor designs;

and allowing communities to weigh the real, enormous benefits of nuclear energy against its actual—if almost unmeasurable—risks.

If we do this, abundant clean energy becomes not a dream but a reality.

A Future Worth Choosing

Humanity’s greatest advances have always come from overcoming fear—fear of sea voyaging, fear of flight, fear of the unknown. Radiation belongs on that list.

For 70 years, fear blocked the path to an energy-rich future. The science now makes clear: The danger was never low-level radiation. The danger was the fear.

If we choose evidence over anxiety and possibility over fear, we can finally build the world we should already have—cleaner, safer, and more affordable and abundant than we ever allowed ourselves to imagine.",https://democracyjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/france-nuclear-resize.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 12:02:19.385408

Installing onsite natural gas turbines, solar panels or batteries means data centers can achieve a speedier connection to the grid because they will represent less of a demand stress when electricity is tight, according to a study Princeton University’s Zero Lab carried out in conjunction with energy software firms Camus Energy and Encoord.

In some cases, the wait time can be cut by as much as five years – a significant difference in an industry where grid hookups can stretch up to seven years.

“If you can connect your data center years earlier, that’s a lot of revenue and a lot of compute time,” said Jesse Jenkins, the Princeton associate professor who leads the ZERO Lab.

Flexible data centers also are cheaper because they require less new infrastructure, he added.

“It doesn’t make sense to build a whole new transmission line that sits there 365 days a year when you only need it for a few hours a year,” Jenkins said.

Lowering costs are a key issue because data-center projects have driven up power bills in some parts of the US, angering neighbors and drawing political pushback. After years of relatively stable US power consumption, demand is rising quickly thanks to the artificial-intelligence boom, new factories and electrification of the broader economy.

The new research builds on a Duke University study that said in February the grid could handle another 76 gigawatts – about 10% of current peak demand – if large users such as data centers would curtail their demand during the rare periods when the system is stressed. Bitcoin miners, which also have voracious appetites for electricity, have employed that strategy for years.

However, the idea that data centers can shut down when demand soars has drawn criticism. The independent market monitor for PJM Interconnection, the 13-state power grid stretching from the mid-Atlantic to the Midwest, called the idea that data centers will interrupt the operations and not require new generation “a regulatory fiction.”

The new analysis released on Thursday addresses that critique by modeling how data centers would replace grid power with their own sources, rather than by interrupting computing operations. “There’s a lot of other ways you can provide site flexibility that aren’t just reducing demand,” said Astrid Atkinson, chief executive officer of Camus Energy.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt8eb3cdfc1fce5194/blt1bf6eef12a48d218/6851a91723679e211eecd3a3/Solar-Power.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-05 12:02:43.881328

DOE Opens Its Checkbook for SMRs; Plans to Spend $800M

The Department of Energy has opened its checkbook and is now funding the middle ground between large 1000MW+ reactors and microreactors with power ratings of less than 25MW. The agency has selected two developers of small modular reactors (SMRs) awarding each of them $400 million in cost shared funding.

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is selected by DOE to deploy the GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 at the Clinch River Nuclear site in Tennessee. Also, the funds will be used to accelerate the deployment of additional units with Indiana Michigan Power and Elementl.

Additionally, TVA plans to work with the domestic nuclear supply chain partners Scot Forge, North American Forgemasters, BWX Technologies, and Aecon. Other partners supporting the project include Duke Energy, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, and the Electric Power Research Institute. As the lead applicant, TVA and DOE will now enter further discussion around project milestones and co-applicant awards.

Don Moul, TVA President and CEO said that TVA is the first utility in the U.S. to have a construction permit application for a BWRX-300 SMR accepted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The agency assessed that the application as complete and ready for review last July.

“The Clinch River project will serve as a national model for how to deploy SMRs safely, efficiently, and affordably – laying the groundwork for a new era of American nuclear energy leadership, Moul said.

A spokesman for TVA told Neutron Bytes that the design for the BWRX300 is not yet complete so it is premature to discuss the cost of building the first unit. He added that a key focus at this time for TVA and GE Vernova Hitachi is to develop the supply chain for the SMR.

In addition to its work to develop the BWRX300 at Clinch River, TN, TVA is also collaborating with Ontario Power Generation which is planning to build four of the SMRs at its Darlington, ON, site.

The agreement allows the companies to coordinate their explorations into the design, licensing, construction and operation of small modular reactors. While no exchange of funding is involved, the collaboration agreement will help OPG and TVA reduce the financial risk that comes from development of innovative technology, as well as future deployment costs.

Holtec Funded for SMRs at Palisades Plant in Michigan

Holtec is the second firm to received $400 million to support its plans for SMRs. The firm plans to deploy two SMR-300 PWR type reactors at the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station site in Covert, MI. The twin units will also fulfill a role as demonstrator units telling a story of the viability of SMRs which will promote additional orders both domestically and abroad.

Holtec is pursuing an innovative one-stop-shop approach to SMR deployment by fulfilling the roles of technology vendor, supply chain vendor, nuclear plant constructor in partnership with Hyundai Engineering & Construction, plant operator, and as an electricity merchant selling the power to near-by utilities and end-users.

Holtec said in a press statement the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) project, which will add 680 MW in a dual unit (340 MW per unit) configuration. The firm that that the twin SMRs are envisaged to be built by Holtec with construction financing from the DOE’s Loan Programs Office. Holtec added that with the financial pathway secured, the firm expects the SMRs to enter revenue service in the early 2030s.

As part of the program, DOE will provide milestone-based cost-share support to the company that is intended to support licensing, pre-construction, and supply-chain mobilization for the Palisades SMR-300 project. Holtec’s proposal includes a multi-site deployment pathway that establishes a repeatable, fleet-scale model — a core requirement of the DOE SMR Tier 1 program intended to drive down costs and shorten construction durations through standardization and manufacturing efficiency.

Holtec added in a press statement, “DOE’s support is an essential enabler of the Palisades SMR-300 project, moving it from development to deployment by building on the government’s prior support for Holtec’s SMR technology under the 2020 DOE Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) Risk Reduction for Future Demonstrations to support commercial readiness.”

Dr. Kris Singh, CEO and Executive Chairman of Holtec International, said in the same press statement, “We are energized by DOE’s confidence in our SMR-300 reactor, which we view as validation of our 14-year quest to develop a walk-away-safe and cost-competitive nuclear reactor. This grant positions Holtec to accelerate deployment of a standardized SMR-300 fleet that strengthens U.S. energy security and grid resilience.”

In March 2025, DOE issued a $900 million solicitation to de-risk the deployment of Gen III+ SMRs and the remaining $100 million will be awarded later this year to support additional deployments and address key barriers in design, licensing, supply chain, and site readiness.

NRC Completes Safety Review of TerraPower Construction Permit Application

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff has completed its final safety evaluation for the application submitted by TerraPower to build Kemmerer Power Station Unit 1 in Kemmerer, WY. The evaluation concludes there are no safety aspects that would preclude issuing the construction permit.

“We’ve finished our technical work on the Kemmerer review a month ahead of our already accelerated schedule, as we aim to make licensing decisions for new, advanced reactors in no more than 18 months,” said Jeremy Groom, acting director of the NRC’s Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.

“We thank TerraPower for promptly addressing the agency’s questions to ensure safety and enable the NRC to efficiently process the application.”

The staff will provide the safety evaluation and the final environmental impact statement to the Commission for the final phase of the licensing process in the coming weeks. The Commission will determine whether the staff’s review supports the findings necessary to issue the permit. Following its deliberations, the Commission will vote on whether to direct the staff to issue the permit.

The NRC’s Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards independently reviewed new and novel safety-related aspects of the Kemmerer Power Station Unit 1 application. The committee provided the results of its review to the Commission on 11/16/25.

TerraPower filed the application in March 2024, requesting a permit to build the sodium-cooled, advanced reactor design on a site near an existing coal-fired power plant. The NRC staff accepted the application and began its formal review in May 2024.

The 345 MWe plant includes an energy storage system to temporarily boost output up to 500 MWe, when needed. If the NRC ultimately issues the permit, the firm would need to submit a separate operating license application before it would be authorized to operate the facility.

TerraPower CEO Statement on NRC’s Findings

TerraPower President and CEO, Chris Levesque, issues a statement on the announcement of the. Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s completion of the Final Safety Evaluation for the first Natrium plant1, Kemmerer Unit 1, construction permit application:

“Today is a momentous occasion for TerraPower, our project partners and the Natrium design. This favorable safety evaluation from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reflects years of rigorous evaluation, thoughtful collaboration with the NRC, and an unwavering commitment to both safety and innovation.”

“I am deeply proud of our team’s efforts in pioneering the design and licensing of America’s first, commercial-scale, advanced nuclear power plant. TerraPower remains focused on delivering the next generation of reliable, flexible power to the grid and long-term jobs for the Kemmerer community.”

BWXT Delivers TRISO Nuclear Fuel to INL for Project Pele Microreactor

BWX Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: BWXT), the Idaho National Laboratory, the U.S. Army and the Department of War Strategic Capabilities Office announce the delivery at INL of TRISO nuclear fuel for the Project Pele microreactor. The full Pele prototype will be tested at INL.

Project Pele is the pathfinder design effort for advanced microreactors and is focused on designing, building and testing a 1.5 MW transportable power system. Pele is a Generation IV high-temperature gas- cooled reactor (HTGR). The entire system is designed to fit into four standard-sized shipping containers.

The fuel, called tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) particle fuel, is composed of uranium, carbon and oxygen, which are formed into a small kernel. This kernel is coated in multiple ceramic layers including silicon carbide that make it extremely durable under high heat, radiation, and corrosive conditions. Thousands of these poppy seed-sized particles are combined into compact fuel forms used in advanced reactors like the one being developed under Project Pele.

BWXT manufactured and shipped the fuel from its facilities in Lynchburg, VA. The company’s Specialty Fuels Fabrication Group has more than 20 years of experience in the design and manufacturing of TRISO fuel for government applications.

Jeff Waksman, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy and Environment, said, “This is real nuclear microreactor fuel delivered at its final destination, rather than some letter or memorandum promising to make fuel at a later date.”

“Project Pele is a transformational leap toward Gen-IV nuclear power, and the Army’s Janus Program will follow on to deliver affordable, reliable, commercial nuclear power to ensure that our critical infrastructure has the power they need, whenever they need it, even if the electric grid is disrupted.”

BWXT is constructing the Pele prototype at its Innovation Campus in Lynchburg, and it will ship the completed prototype to INL. The team plans to begin formal system testing as early as 2027.

BWXT is collaborating with Rolls-Royce LibertyWorks, Northrop Grumman and Torch Technologies on the full-system components, including thermal and power conversion modules and instrument and control systems.

INL Produces Fuel for Molten Salt Reactor

It is the first-ever fuel for fast molten salt reactor experiment, opening door to use for maritime applications

Scientists at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) have achieved a breakthrough in nuclear energy by launching full-scale production of enriched fuel salt for the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment (MCRE). It is the world’s first test of a molten chloride salt fast reactor.

Results from the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment will help inform the commercial deployment of TerraPower and Southern Company’s Molten Chloride Fast Reactor that could be deployed in the 2030s.

The fuel salt production process began in 2020. INL scientists set out to convert 90% of uranium metal into uranium chloride and produce 18 kilograms of fuel salt per batch—an ambitious target. Early attempts yielded less than the target amount with only an 80% conversion. But in 2024, the team achieved a breakthrough: 95% conversion and full-batch production. They’ve since demonstrated they can produce a batch in as little as one day.

The team delivered the first fuel salt production batch at the end of September and will produce four additional batches by March 2026.

“This is the first time in history that chloride-based molten salt fuel has been produced for a fast reactor,” said Bill Phillips, technical lead for salt synthesis.

“It’s a major milestone for American innovation and a clear signal of our national commitment to advanced nuclear energy.”

The MCRE project is a public-private collaboration between Southern Company, TerraPower, CORE POWER, and the U.S. Department of Energy to demonstrate advanced nuclear technologies. It is the first planned reactor experiment to be hosted at the Laboratory for Operation and Testing in the United States (LOTUS) test bed, which DOE’s National Reactor Innovation Center is building at INL. Operations are expected to begin as soon as 2030.

Unlike traditional reactors that use solid fuel rods and water as a coolant, most molten salt reactors rely on liquid fuel—a mixture of salts containing fissile material. This design allows for higher operating temperatures, better fuel efficiency, and enhanced safety. It also opens the door to new applications, including compact nuclear systems for ships and remote installations.

Jeff Latkowski, senior vice president of TerraPower and program director for the Molten Chloride Fast Reactor, said, “The Molten Chloride Fast Reactor represents a paradigm shift in the nuclear fuel cycle, and MCRE will directly inform the commercialization of that reactor.”

Microreactor Developer Antares Raises $96M in Series B Funding

Idaho Falls, ID, based nuclear startup Antares announced it has raised $96 million in Series B funding to fund further development of its microreactor.

Investors include Shine Capital with participation from Alt Capital, Caffeinated, FiftyThree Stations, Industrious, and others, consists of $71 million in equity and $25 million in debt.

Antares says it is targeting commercial, defense, and space-based applications with its R1 microreactor. The reactors is expected to produce between 100 KW and 1 MW electricity. The design uses TRISO fuel. Sodium heat pipes enable redundant, high-temperature, entirely passive heat transfer. Simple recuperated N2 closed Brayton cycle enables efficient power conversion at < 300 psi.

The firm reports on its website that in 2025 it hit critical design and safety milestones including Conceptual Design Review (CDR) and Nuclear Safety Design Agreement (NDSA). The firm is conducting hardware development at a new 145,000 sq-ft facility in Torrance, CA to accelerate in-house manufacturing. It initiated fabrication of TRISO fuel that will support multiple reactor demonstrations.

In August, Antares was named one of 11 participants in the Department of Energy’s reactor pilot program. The goal of the program, which has 10 other competing participants, is for three of them to demonstrate criticality of their respective reactors by July 2026.

In terms of future milestones, in 2026 the firm plans to complete the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Preliminary Documented Safety Analysis (PDSA), along with finishing qualification campaigns for a majority of the reactor’s subsystems including the core, heat exchanger, and power conversion system.

In 2027, the firm plans to manufacture, assemble, and turn on a full-power, electricity-producing advanced reactor. It will have completed all remaining design, operations, and safety reviews in partnership with Idaho National Laboratory, Department of Energy, and others. Key actions include evaluating reactor performance and validate system design ahead of producing additional demonstration and customer units in 2028.

TAE Technologies and UKAEA Partner to Commercialize Fusion Power

A joint venture with TAE Technologies and the UK Atomic Energy Agency (UKAEA) will develop neutral beams for fusion and non-fusion applications establishing a critical supply chain and a high paying jobs. The UK government plans to make an equity investment of GBP5.6 million ($7.4 million) in this new venture. TAE has raised $1.3 billion since its launch from private investors.

TAE Technologies, a U.S. private fusion energy firm announced a bilateral and reciprocal investment commitment with the United Kingdom’s national fusion laboratory, the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) to commercialize TAE’s proprietary particle accelerator technology for the global market.

At the center of the partnership is the new joint venture TAE Beam UK. It is a collaborative entity that will develop particle accelerator technology beginning with neutral beams for fusion. The venture aims to design, develop, and ultimately manufacture and service neutral beams for a wide range of fusion approaches, as well as adapt the accelerator technology for state-of-the-art cancer therapeutics, and other applications like food safety and homeland security.

TAE, with more than two decades of patented intellectual property and particle accelerator R&D, is an industry leader in neutral beams, which are critical for commercial fusion. For a fusion machine to produce electricity, it must keep plasma steadily confined at fusion-relevant conditions.

On TAE’s current fusion machine, eight powerful neutral beams are placed at precise angles to meet those requirements. Inside each neutral beam canister, protons are accelerated and then combined with electrons to create a stream of neutral, high-energy hydrogen atoms (a.k.a., the ‘neutral beam’).

Because the particles have no charge, they can bypass the fusion reactor’s magnetic field to provide heating, current drive and plasma stability. TAE is the first to use neutral beams for both FRC plasma formation and high-quality plasma sustainment – resulting in a streamlined design that is smaller, more efficient and more cost-effective.

The same accelerator technology that produced TAE’s sophisticated neutral beam system for fusion has also been adapted for TAE’s medtech subsidiary, TAE Life Sciences, to provide a non-invasive, targeted treatment for complex and often inoperable cancers.

TAE Beam UK will operate out of UKAEA’s Culham Campus, in Oxfordshire, U.K., establishing a global hub for fusion technology. TAE already has additional facilities in the UK; its power management subsidiary, TAE Power Solutions, is based in the West Midlands – and TAE Beam UK. Together these entities will anchor a fusion supply chain.

Google Continues as a Major Partner with TAE

Last June Google took part in a $150 million funding round of TAE Technologies. Google says it has been associated with TAE since 2015, when Google Research collaborated with the company, applying AI to drive improvements in plasma temperature and lifetime. The project plans to deliver the first short-pulse beams within 18-24 months of the start of work.

Google’s integration into TAE’s engineering teams has helped the company unlock a practical path to economic fusion and was instrumental in enabling the technical breakthrough that now paves the way for TAE’s next milestone: validating net energy capability in its Copernicus reactor. Google’s renewed commitment to TAE follows a thorough technical and commercial evaluation of TAE’s distinctive fusion approach.

IAEA Signs Agreement with Atomic Canyon for AI Software

The IAEA has signed an agreement with Atomic Canyon developing AI-powered solutions for the nuclear energy sector. Under this pact, the IAEA and Atomic Canyon will explore opportunities for collaboration and evaluate a proof of concept to lay the groundwork for AI solutions in nuclear information management.

IAEA Director General Mariano Grossi and Trey Lauderdale, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Atomic Canyon, signed an agreement to advance cooperation on AI models that help navigate IAEA publications and other open resources.

In a press statement, Atomic Canyon said, “This isn’t just a milestone for us, it’s a turning point for the industry. Together with the IAEA, we’re building the frameworks, benchmarks, and guidelines that will define how AI transforms nuclear operations worldwide, from design and licensing to maintenance and regulatory reviews.”

CEO Trey Lauderdale said in a post on Linkedin, “Every aspect of the nuclear power lifecycle is going to be transformed.” And now, American innovation will help lead that transformation on a global scale.”

The signing ceremony took place at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, Austria as global energy and technology leaders met at IAEA headquarters on 12/03/25 in Vienna for the first ever International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Nuclear Energy.

The two-day event included senior representatives from government ministries, international organizations, the nuclear industry and major tech firms — including Google and Oracle — to discuss how nuclear energy can help meet the surging electricity demand of AI data centers, and how AI can support nuclear technology development. IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said at the opening ceremony:

“Two forces are reshaping humanity’s horizon at an unprecedented pace: the rise of artificial intelligence and the global transition towards clean, reliable energy. The world’s energy map is being redrawn before our eyes. The essential point, our opportunity and our responsibility, is that these forces are not unfolding separately. They are converging and redefining the new global economy.”

With regard to the partnership with Atomic Canyon he added that nuclear energy is the only source capable of low-carbon generation, round-the-clock reliability, high power density, grid stability and scalability. He described the link between nuclear and AI as structural alliance of “Atoms for Algorithms.”

Studsvik To Provide Key Reactor Design and Verification System For Romania SMR

Software will verify core and operational safety of NuScale reactor

(NucNet) Studsvik has announced its first sale of design evaluation and verification software to a small modular reactor (SMR) utility customer. Sweden-based Studsvik, which offers technical services to the nuclear power industry, said RoPower Nuclear SA in Romania has selected Studsvik’s Core Management System 5 (CMS5) as its methodology to support the country’s first SMR project.

Romania is planning to build what could be the first European SMR power station using six, 77 MW reactor modules deigned by US-based NuScale.

RoPower Nuclear, the joint venture established for the SMR project, intends to use NuScale’s technology for the facility at a former coal site in Doicesti, about 90 km northwest of the capital Bucharest.

With CMS5, RoPower will be equipped to perform the design evaluation and verification of the SMR plant’s core and operational safety. Studsvik said.

“This new collaboration with RoPower extends the use of Studsvik’s proven technology from the reactor designer to the first utility deploying an SMR fleet,” a statement said.

Final Investment Decision for NuScale Romania Project Delayed

Delay is due to a change in ownership among the Romanian firms involved in the project

New customers for NuScale expected since NRC approved the firm’s 77 MW SMR design

(NucNet) The final investment decision for a 462 MW small modular reactor (SMR) at a former coal plant site in Romania could be delayed to early 2027, according to John Hopkins, chief executive officer of US-based reactor developer NuScale.

RoPower Nuclear, the joint venture established for the SMR project, intends to use NuScale’s technology for the facility in Doicesti, about 90 km northwest of the capital Bucharest.

NuScale expected RoPower to make the final investment decision early in the second quarter of 2026 at the latest. It is scheduled to be made after the completion of the front-end engineering design (Feed) process. US engineering and construction company Fluor was hired for the job in July, with its subsidiary NuScale as a subcontractor. Infrastructure from the former coal-fired power plant has now been removed. The company is working with Fluor regarding input for the final investment decision.

Hopkins clarified the project is alive and kicking.

“RoPower and the Romanian government continue to pay their bills, and we’re keeping our finger on the pulse and watching it very closely. We have almost weekly conversations on progress”, of the Feed study. The final investment decision looks to be probably between mid-to-late 2026 and early 2027.”

RoPower Nuclear intends to deploy six 77 MW NuScale reactor modules at the planned facility. Deployment had originally been scheduled for around 2029.

The RoPower joint venture is undergoing a change in ownership. Its current owners, each with 50%, are now state-controlled Nuclearelectrica, which operates Romania’s only nuclear plant, Cernavodă, and Nova Power and Gas, a subsidiary of E-Infra, a Romanian group of companies with operations in energy and telecom infrastructure, energy and civil construction.

Last year the US official export credit agency, the Export-Import Bank (Exim Bank), approved a financial commitment of up to $99 Million to support the development of the Doicesti SMR project.

NuScale CEO Bullish on Prospects for New Customers

NuScale Power aims to have “hard contracts” with “two or three major customers” by the end of 2025, chief executive officer John Hopkins told investors and analysts in a 3Q2025 briefing.

NuScale and its developer partner Entra1, a US-based energy production company which is developing, financing and owning plants, have yet to ink a binding contract, but Hopkins said, “we’re getting inundated now” with prospective customers following the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s (NRC) approval in May of NuScale’s 77-MW power module. Entra1 holds the global exclusive rights to the commercialization, distribution and deployment of NuScale’s SMRs.

According to Hopkins, NuScale’s 77-MW module supplanted an earlier 50-MW design the NRC approved in 2023. Some prospective customers had been waiting as the commission considered NuScale’s application for the uprated module.

INL Selects 1st Round of Firms for MARVEL Experiments

The Idaho National Laboratory announced initial selections for the Microreactor Application Research Validation and Evaluation (MARVEL) end user experiments. The five competitively selected teams will demonstrate several test cases, including desalination of remote operations and advanced sensors.

Marvel is a liquid metal thermal reactor. It uses UZrH TRIGA Fuel with enrichment 19.75 U235. MARVEL is to be installed at INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex in 2027. (MARVEL Fact Sheet PDF File)

The experiments will also be among the first to demonstrate the viability of powering data centers with advanced nuclear technologies, a cutting-edge use of nuclear energy that ensures America remains the leader in innovation to dominate the artificial intelligence race.

“Nowhere else in the world will you find this level of support for public sector innovation in nuclear energy,” said John Jackson, national technical director for the Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy’s Microreactor Program.

MARVEL is a sodium-potassium-cooled microreactor that is being developed by the Department of Energy. It will generate 85 KW of thermal energy and up to 20 KW of electricity. Slated to be at the Transient Reactor Test Facility at the Idaho National Laboratory, MARVEL will provide a platform where the private sector can gain access to an operational microreactor to demonstrate innovative new use cases for the technology.

The following companies were selected as the first potential end users for MARVEL. The next step will be for them to work with Department of Energy and national laboratory staff members to create implementation plans for their proposed projects:

Amazon Web Services Inc. proposes coupling the MARVEL reactor with a modular data center, a new service that makes it simple and cost-effective for defense and government agencies to build data centers anywhere in the world by enabling the creation of a self-sustaining, rapidly deployable system that can operate independently of traditional power infrastructure.

DCX USA and Arizona State University propose to use MARVEL to demonstrate the feasibility of a microreactor to power a data center for artificial intelligence to yield valuable data on how to provide a stable, continuous power supply capable of handling the unique demands of AI processing.

General Electric Vernova proposes to use MARVEL to demonstrate remote and autonomous reactor operations and establish controls standards for broader application of the technology with commercial reactors.

Radiation Detection Technologies Inc. proposes to use MARVEL to test advanced high-performance sensor technologies that could help monitor the performance of advanced reactors.

Shepherd Power, NOV and ConocoPhillips propose to leverage MARVEL for a pilot-scale desalination project using nuclear-generated process heat to demonstrate the viability of advanced nuclear energy for addressing produced water challenges in oil and gas operations.

Selected firms will coordinate with national laboratory experts to determine the feasibility of their proposed application using MARVEL. This may lead to the opportunity to use MARVEL for demonstration. Final agreements for proposed projects are anticipated to be announced in 2026.

INL Fuel Rods Mimic Nature

INL scientists are experimenting with a fuel concept that replaces traditional cylindrical rods with a continuous 3D lattice modelled on triply periodic minimal surfaces that mimic patterns found in nature.

Early tests show the Influx design can transfer heat roughly three times more efficiently than conventional fuel rods while improving neutron interactions in the core.

The team is now evaluating which reactor types stand to gain the most from the geometry and whether TPMS-based heat exchangers could provide a practical bridge to full fuel adoption.

The new fund will see the firm bring the industrial decarbonisation focus of its private equity and infrastructure funds to the conventional energy space, where it will look to buy operational, carbon-intensive assets and decarbonise them. A first close of about $500 million is expected in the first half of next year, it is understood, with gross returns of about 20 percent being sought.

Ara declined to comment on fundraising.

These investments will include gas-fired power generation, biofuels and fuel distribution, according to Ara’s website, with a focus on the US.

He called the Biden-era decision to lay a path for their removal “crazy.” “That’s an energy subtraction policy and the Trump administration, we’re about energy addition,” Wright said.
But not just any type of energy, federal policies show.
“Today we’ve got less than 10 minutes of storage from batteries across the country,” Wright said.
The federal government has been aggressively fighting wind and solar energy projects, even blocking permits for many projects, especially offshore wind.","ICE HARBOR DAM — U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright arrived in the Tri-Cities this week on a tour of some of Washington state’s energy infrastructure, including a dam on the Lower Snake River.

The visit comes on the heels of President Donald Trump exploding a hard-fought deal this summer over river operations that could have led to dam removal to help struggling salmon runs.

Wright underscored the administration’s position, and reinforced a series of contradictions rife within the administration’s energy policies.

This country needs more electricity, Wright said on a gray and rainy morning overlooking the Ice Harbor Dam outside of Burbank, Walla Walla County: affordable and dispatchable energy, and these dams represent both.

“Everything we can do to lower the price of electricity, lower the price of gasoline, lower the price of energy of all kinds,” Wright said. “That’s what makes people’s lives better. That’s what makes businesses and opportunities thrive in our country.”

Wright inflated the importance of the Lower Snake River dams to the electrical grid but sidestepped the environmental consequences, moves likely taken as salt in the wound by those who fought for the 2023 Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement, which provided a path to remove the four dams on the Lower Snake River.

The federal government, under the Biden administration, committed $1 billion to the work, which would have included boosting clean-energy production led by tribal nations and replacing other services of the dams, like transportation and irrigation infrastructure.

President Donald Trump in June clawed back the agreement.

The four dams offer 3,000 megawatts of electricity, Wright said. He called the Biden-era decision to lay a path for their removal “crazy.”

“That’s an energy subtraction policy and the Trump administration, we’re about energy addition,” Wright said.

In reality, the four dams generate perhaps a third that much electricity every year, even less during droughts, which are becoming more common in our region as the planet warms. And while the administration has backed some types of energy projects (largely fossil fuel and nuclear), it has repeatedly attacked renewable power sources like wind, solar and battery storage while rejecting the growing body of scientific evidence warning of climate change.

Advertising

Wright’s tour covered a series of facilities left reeling this year by federal budget cuts and layoffs. Now they’re hiring again, Wright said.

The administration wants American energy dominance, but is undercutting a wide range of once-booming electrical projects.

The country badly needs more energy and affordable energy. But not just any type of energy, federal policies show. Wind and solar don’t much qualify, and Wright downplayed the ability of battery storage, which can be paired with renewables to make power available when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing.

“Today we’ve got less than 10 minutes of storage from batteries across the country,” Wright said.

As of last year, the country’s grid had about 26 gigawatt hours of battery storage in use, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is expected to perhaps triple by the end of the decade, Canary Media reported this fall.

For context, energy demand for all of Seattle City Light’s customers peaked at around 2 gigawatt hours.

Should the country invest in these growing battery storage technologies? Not at the expense of government subsidies, Wright said.

The Trump administration slashed billions of dollars in renewable energy subsidies this summer. Washington alone stands to lose an estimated $8.7 billion in clean-energy investment funding.

Instead, the administration is now doubling down on subsidies for fossil fuels. Wright, himself a former fracking executive, downplayed the significance of that shift, however.

“There are no meaningful subsidies on fossil fuels,” he said.

For years the federal government has subsidized the fossil fuel industry, to the tune of an estimated $34 billion each year. And Trump’s so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” looks to add an additional $4 billion in subsidies annually over the next decade, for a total of $40 billion more from the federal government.

Energy projects should compete on a level playing field, Wright said Thursday morning.

The federal government has been aggressively fighting wind and solar energy projects, even blocking permits for many projects, especially offshore wind. At the same time the administration is pushing to keep fossil fuel plants open longer.

State law in Washington requires the closure of all coal plants by the end of the year, and requires the state to free its electrical grid of greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. The federal government’s repeated attacks on new renewable projects is making it increasingly difficult and time-consuming to build new sources of electricity.

Federal officials say they’re pursuing affordable energy and working to bring prices down. During the campaign, Trump promised to halve electricity rates within the year.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12042025_TZR_Chris_Wright-2_tzr_135816.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-12-05 11:05:29.505636

I've never been happier to be wrong. It turns out that the new iX3, which packs 400 miles of range, some next-level charging speeds, impressive performance and a leap ahead in technology from past electric BMWs, will start around $60,000 in the United States.

Granted, that's not exactly cheap. But it's also not mind-bogglingly expensive. In fact, it's pretty comparable to a nicely equipped gas-powered BMW X3, but with some of the best specs we've seen so far from any modern EV.

We're going to talk about why we're excited for the iX3 on this week's Plugged-In Podcast.

My co-host Tim Levin drove the iX3 in Spain recently, and you should check out his article and video review if you haven't already. But it's clear from his experience, and other glowing reviews we've seen, that BMW's first 800-volt EV is a cut way above even the good stuff the automaker has cranked out so far.

And it's nearly at cost parity with the gas X3. That's the important part, really. Isn't this what we've all been waiting for? An EV that's priced well, packed with great specs, and can stand on its own in the marketplace without needing tax credits and subsidies to make a case for itself? I think so, and I'm excited for more EVs like this in the years to come.

But the iX3 launches at a tough time in America. Just this week, President Donald Trump finished the work of gutting fuel economy regulations, which means gas-car drivers will pay more at the pump and automakers have less incentive to advance their electric fleets by the 2030s. We'll dig into the downstream effects of that policy change.

And then Tim scored a great interview with John Harris, cofounder and CEO of Harbinger Motors, about the future of commercial EVs—and what automakers are getting wrong about the whole electric market. Harris has a lot of hard truths for the whole field, so I suggest tuning into their full chat.

Nexus 7 Elements LLC formed to deploy CHIPS™ technology across ACRG’s nationwide critical minerals operations

RENO, Nev., Dec. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Clean Resources Group Inc. (OTC: ACRG), a critical minerals processing company, announced the formation of Nexus 7 Elements LLC, a joint venture with Energ4 Mining Company LLC to commercialize rare earth element and mineral recovery technology across ACRG’s processing hub network.

“By combining our feedstock access and infrastructure with Energ4's CHIPS™ technology, we're creating a scalable platform to help meet America’s demand for domestically sourced critical minerals,” said Tawana Bain, CEO and chairwoman of ACRG. “This joint venture supports our mission to recover valuable minerals responsibly and strengthen national security and clean energy goals.”

Beyond mining tailings, the joint venture positions ACRG to process coal ash, fly ash and legacy coal dumps, feedstocks abundant in the eastern United States, especially Appalachia. These materials contain concentrations of rare earth elements and critical minerals, and their processing supports domestic supply chains and remediation of legacy energy sites. This extends ACRG’s CMPH strategy from the western United States to a national footprint.

The joint venture combines ACRG’s feedstocks, infrastructure and public platform with Energ4's patented Clean Mineral Processing – CHIPS™ (Chemelectrosonication Ionization Precipitation System) technology for extracting rare earth elements from existing feedstocks of gold, silver, platinum-group metals and vanadium. The REEs from these feedstocks are critical to U.S. manufacturing independence for renewable energy technologies (wind turbines, EVs), military equipment, electronics, key automotive components and chemical manufacturing.

“This partnership with ACRG is about building plants, not science projects,” said Trever Leamon, CEO of Energ4 Mining Company LLC. “ACRG's critical minerals processing hub is the place to run CHIPS™ at full commercial speed on domestic feedstocks and prove how effectively we can recover rare earths and other critical minerals from material already here in the United States. It’s a step toward cutting dependence on imported minerals and proving this platform can scale.”

Work will begin at the 207-acre site in Winnie, Texas, which offers expansion capacity and outdoor processing areas with access to shipping channels, Interstate 10 and air transportation. The facility will test and validate CHIPS™ technology across domestic feedstocks and support scale-up and applications for federal funding for commercial deployment, with the site serving as a technology development and customer testing center before commercial deployment at ACRG’s critical minerals processing hub in Nevada. Commercial-scale deployment is expected within 12 to 18 months, a rapid timeline for bringing a new critical minerals recovery technology to market, with additional hubs planned across the western United States as the model is proven.

Critical Minerals Processing Hub Model

Nexus 7 Elements will serve as the technology backbone for ACRG's critical minerals processing hub strategy. Rather than developing traditional mining operations, the CMPH model establishes regional processing centers that:

process tailings and other feedstocks from multiple sources in a geographic region

prove technologies like CHIPS™ to recover minerals efficiently

minimize environmental impact through closed-loop processing systems

create centralized infrastructure that can serve multiple feedstock suppliers

support domestic supply chains for minerals essential to clean energy and national security

The first CMPH deployment will be at ACRG's facility in Nevada, with additional hubs planned across the western United States as the model is proven and scaled.

Transaction Structure

Under the terms of the agreement:

ACRG holds 51 percent ownership through its wholly owned subsidiary, providing governance oversight and strategic direction

Energ4’s newly formed entity holds 49 percent ownership and will manage day-to-day operations

Energ4’s team will serve in key operational roles, including CEO and president of the joint venture

Technology Overview

The CHIPS™ technology is a multi-stage electrochemical and sonochemical process that selectively recovers precious metals, platinum-group metals, rare earth elements and other critical minerals from tailings, clays and other complex feedstocks. The process emphasizes:

high recovery rates across multiple target elements

minimal environmental impact through closed-loop water and reagent recycling

scalability from pilot to commercial operations

compatibility with diverse feedstock types

recovery of rare earth elements from coal ash, fly ash and legacy coal materials, enabling CMPH expansion into eastern U.S. feedstock regions

Strategic Benefits

For ACRG:

access to proven REE and critical mineral processing technology

capability to process diverse feedstocks across the CMPH network

stronger positioning for Department of Energy grants

expanded revenue streams beyond precious metals recovery

alignment with federal priorities for domestic critical mineral production

For Energ4:

access to feedstocks and processing infrastructure

a public company platform for capital formation and partnerships

opportunity to demonstrate technology at commercial scale

partnership with a NYSE-bound entity with institutional relationships

For U.S. critical minerals strategy:

advancement of domestic rare earth element processing capacit

reduced dependence on foreign sources

support for clean energy and national security supply chains

demonstration of responsible extraction methods

Market Opportunity

The United States imports more than 80 percent of its rare earth elements, and China controls about 70 percent of global processing capacity. Rare earth elements and critical minerals are designated as essential to national security, energy infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. With bipartisan recognition of supply chain vulnerabilities, federal agencies including the Departments of Defense and Energy continue to allocate resources to domestic production. This policy consensus, combined with demand from defense, technology and clean energy sectors, creates a strong market for domestic processing.

ACRG and Energ4 believe Nexus 7 Elements is positioned to capitalize through:

domestic feedstocks that require no new mining

processing technology applicable to multiple feedstock types

a strategic location in Nevada, a tier-one mining jurisdiction

alignment with federal funding priorities

a scalable CMPH model that will expand across the United States

Their partnership has been essential in continuing the vision of the people’s movement assembly process and strengthening the push for climate reparations in multiple venues.
Why is it important to foster connections among climate justice leaders in the Gulf South, Appalachia region and Global South?
In 2024, we continued to strengthen these bonds by launching a Global Climate Reparations Fellowship connecting leaders from the Gulf South, Appalachia, and the global Black diaspora.
We also hosted a Black Climate Leadership Summit in October this year, which provided a dedicated space for connection, vision and strategy for Black leaders advancing climate justice across regions and sectors.","Taproot Earth is a frontline-rooted climate justice organization with roots in the Gulf South and Appalachia and partners across the Global Black diaspora. In this Q&A, Eliane Lakam, campaign manager of global climate reparations at Taproot Earth, shares how they are building power across borders to advance global climate reparations—from convening more than 200 Black and Indigenous leaders from 22 countries to craft a shared working statement on climate reparations, to bringing frontline voices into international climate negotiations at COP30 in Brazil.

Q: Can you share what the “People’s Movement Assembly Process” is and looks like in practice?

A: The People’s Movement Assembly organizing process centers the voices and experiences of grassroots leadership on the front lines. It has a long tradition in Global South movements and in the radical Black tradition of southern U.S. freedom movements. This process facilitates community self-governance, bringing together frontline leaders to build shared analysis, identify challenges, cultivate and name solutions, and make collective decisions that build the power and systems of democracy needed to advance self-determination and sovereignty.

In August 2024, Taproot Earth convened more than 200 frontline community leaders from 22 countries, representing Black and Indigenous leaders who bear the worth impacts of the climate crisis. Through a democratic decision-making process modeled after a People’s Movement Assembly, these leaders crafted the following working statement:

“[Global] Climate reparations is the restoration of healthy and balanced relationships with all that comprise a shared global ecosystem. Reparative action begins with those who benefit most from the historic and current systems of oppression. It requires the abolition of debt, restitution for injustice and the establishment of accountable systems rooted in Black and Indigenous liberation for all oppressed people and future generations.”

This statement guided Taproot Earth’s engagements at COP30 in Belém Brazil. It shaped our involvement in the People’s Summit, where we co-facilitated two sessions with cross-regional partners, including CIDSE, SINFRAJUPE, CLOC, the World Council of Churches, Development and Peace—Caritas Canada, and KAIROS Canada. Some have worked with us to advance Global Climate Reparations within the Church and have helped carry frontline solutions into global civil society spaces. Their partnership has been essential in continuing the vision of the people’s movement assembly process and strengthening the push for climate reparations in multiple venues.

At the summit, Taproot also supported the implementation of language justice infrastructure. This infrastructure will serve tens of thousands of grassroot movement participants and frontline communities from more than 60 nations. Advancing language justice has been a core commitment of ours. We share lessons learned from Kenya, Rome and other convenings to strengthen partners’ capacity to create accessible spaces. Taproot also co-facilitated a global mapping activity on false vs. real climate solutions. The statement also informed our interventions in press conferences and panel discussions in the Blue Zone and our convenings with faith communities, Brazilian leaders and other global frontline partners.

In these critical spaces, the decisions and statements developed through the Assembly in Kenya were carried forward and opened for deeper engagement and collective action.

Why is it important to foster connections among climate justice leaders in the Gulf South, Appalachia region and Global South? What opportunities come from those connections?

A: It’s often said that you cannot tie a knot with one hand, and the same is true for climate justice. Fostering connections among leaders from the Gulf South, Appalachia, and the Global South is essential because these regions share intertwined histories shaped by colonial legacies and extractive economies that have fueled the climate crisis.

They also share some of the richest traditions of resistance, care and frontline-led solutions. Even across different geographies, they are fighting the same systems: fossil fuel expansion, mining, land grabs, pollution, climate migration, and the ongoing impacts of colonialism.

When leaders come together across these regions, they are able to learn from one another, develop shared analysis, create more robust, frontline-grounded solutions, deepen solidarity, and heal together.

In 2023, we hosted convenings in Cabo Verde and New York centered on Black Joy, Liberation, and Climate Reparations. These spaces were instrumental in testing assumptions, exchanging knowledge, and grounding our work in lived experience. In 2024, we continued to strengthen these bonds by launching a Global Climate Reparations Fellowship connecting leaders from the Gulf South, Appalachia, and the global Black diaspora. This initiative helped deepen our collective understanding of the climate crisis and allows us to develop stronger solutions together.

We expanded these cross-regional ties at COP30 by hosting two joint strategy sessions on Global Climate Reparations at the People’s Summit, convening lawyers working on climate justice through our Just Transition Lawyering Network, hosting intentional dinners with faith-based, Indigenous, and Afro-Brazilian leaders, and providing resources that enabled more than 20 Black Global South leaders (who otherwise would have been excluded) to attend COP30. These exchanges have been crucial in strengthening the movement, expanding opportunities for solidarity and collective action, and deepening our shared capacity to develop and implement solutions that are both well-informed and grounded in frontline realities.

What are some of the ways that communities are practicing stewardship of reclaimed land, water and energy resources?

A: Communities across the Gulf South, Appalachia and the Global South are practicing stewardship of reclaimed land, water and energy resources in ways that repair historical harm, restore ecological balance and strengthen frontline governance. This includes regenerative land management through various practices, including agroecology. Stewardship also includes safeguarding sacred sites and cultural landscapes, renewing spiritual and cultural practices tied to the land and our relationship with the Earth, and building democratic governance and resource management structures such as land trusts, cooperatives and community-controlled funds.

A tangible example is The Gulf South for a Green New Deal Community Controlled Fund , which presents a transformational model in climate justice investment. In this model, communities most impacted by the climate crisis lead in directing resources and shaping solutions that safeguard their futures.

How should public finance and other funds move to communities?

A: Public finance and other funds must move to communities in ways that repair historic harm, remove barriers to access and support community control and autonomy. This requires placing frontline communities at the center of decision-making and ensuring that climate finance is non-extractive, meaning no debt, no austerity conditions, and no cost-sharing requirements that effectively exclude those most impacted by the climate crisis.

Instead, funding should be guided by principles of Global Climate Reparations, including debt cancellation, the return of stolen resources, and other investments that repair the conditions needed for frontline communities to thrive. We must move away from finance moved through extractive loans toward grant-based and direct pay programs as well.

Climate finance must also shift from being treated as charity to being understood as repair. Taproot Earth recently released the executive summary of Toward a Liberation Economy of Climate Finance, a climate finance report that offers some insights on how funds should move to communities.

How have you convened global community leaders and partners?

A: At Taproot Earth, convening global community leaders and partners is central to our work. Last year, we brought together more than 200 Black and Indigenous frontline leaders from 22 countries for the Global Climate Reparations Assembly in Nairobi, Kenya, where participants drafted a shared working statement on Global Climate Reparations (GCR).

Building on this foundation, we facilitated a Jubilee Convening on Global Climate Reparations in Rome in March this Jubilee year, bringing more than 100 frontline and Catholic leaders together in the spirit of synodality to advance the GCR statement within the Catholic Church and help repair our broken relationship with each other and the Earth.

One of our key convenings this year was Katrina 20 in the Gulf South, which brought movement elders and allies together to reflect on two decades of post-Katrina and chart a people-led path forward. At the heart of this convening was the Monarch Forum, a two-day gathering dedicated to sharing testimony, lessons and visions on climate migration and to advance the rights to remain, migrate and return.

We also hosted a Black Climate Leadership Summit in October this year, which provided a dedicated space for connection, vision and strategy for Black leaders advancing climate justice across regions and sectors. We expanded this global convening work at COP30 in Belém by creating intentional spaces and opportunities for frontline leaders to build relationships, learn from each other and move together. Leaders from our Gulf South to Appalachia (GS2A) Governance Assemblies and our GCR assembly in Kenya remain interwoven in all of our gatherings, and all these spaces are part of our ongoing strategy to continue to strengthen movement infrastructure and build power to advance the climate solutions our communities deserve.",https://kresge.org/wp-content/uploads/Taproot-Earth-Nov-2025.jpeg,N,,2025-12-05 11:06:10.056130

Fission startup First American Nuclear Co. is developing a power plant, first using natural gas and then shifting to a reactor expected to run on fuel produced from its own nuclear waste.

The Indiana-based company expects to start delivering electricity in 2028 using gas, and then deploy its liquid-metal fast reactor by 2032, according to Chief Executive Officer Mike Reinboth. The facility will include a system to reprocess and reuse spent fuel, minimizing the deadly waste produced by reactors, First American said in a statement Tuesday.

The company is looking to feed power to data centers, which have spawned massive demand for electricity to run artificial intelligence systems. Nuclear energy has gained popularity as a method to provide that electricity, though the industry is unlikely to deliver any new reactors for years.

First American says its gas-first model means it can start supplying electricity within the next few years while it pursues regulatory approval for its reactor. Other companies are pursuing a similar strategy, and Reinboth said he’s talking to potential data center customers.

The company is evaluating several sites in Indiana, where the goal is to eventually install six of the systems for about $4.2 billion. Together, the reactors would generate enough energy to power 1.5 million homes.

“Data centers are driving the demand for power,” he said.

First American is designing a 240-megawatt liquid metal reactor that uses lead bismuth as a coolant. It’s the only company using this technology in the US, though it’s been used in Russian submarines for years.

The reprocessing system will be able to convert spent uranium from the plant into new fuel, making the plants cheaper to operate and eliminating the challenge posed by the toxic waste created by conventional reactors.

“The waste actually gives you energy,” said Bill Stokes, the company’s founder and president.

Colorado lawmakers are spearheading several public lands bills this year, many of which have been introduced in Congress in previous years but have so far failed to pass. As 2025 nears its end, lawmakers appear optimistic that action will be taken on some of their proposals after a grueling year dominated by battles over health care, tax cuts, and the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.

A Senate Energy and Natural Resources subcommittee held a long-awaited hearing on Dec. 2 on more than two dozen public lands bills . According to reporting by Politico’s E&E News , the hearing had been delayed due to the 43-day-long government shutdown that lasted from October through mid-November.

Lawmakers on the subcommittee had spent most of the year processing President Donald Trump’s nominees for federal agencies and crafting portions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the sweeping tax and domestic policy law that carries much of Trump’s agenda. Now, they’re turning their attention to other legislation, and E&E News reports that many of the subcommittee’s members want to see a public lands package become law by next year.

The renewed action also comes following a high-profile fight over a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill that would’ve allowed the sale of millions of acres of public land across the West. The effort, which ultimately failed, vaulted the issue of public lands into the spotlight.

U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse’s office, in a press release, said the subcommittee hearing “signals a revived hope for public lands legislation to become law” during the current Republican-controlled Congress.

Here’s a look at where several bills stand:

CORE Act

One of the most well-known public lands bills to come out of Colorado in recent years is the Colorado Outdoor Recreation and Economy, or CORE Act .

The measure dates back to 2019 and has twice been reintroduced in Congress as a standalone bill since. The bill passed the House twice but never advanced in the Senate. The CORE Act was among the bills reviewed during the Senate subcommittee hearing.

The bill would protect 420,000 acres of public land in mountain regions across the Western Slope, designating 71,000 acres as new wilderness areas and nearly 80,000 acres as new recreation and conservation management areas to preserve existing outdoor uses, such as hiking and mountain biking.

New wilderness areas would be created in the ​​Tenmile, Hoosier Ridge and Williams Fork Mountains, ​​with expanded protections for the Eagles Nest, Ptarmigan Peak and Holy Cross wilderness areas.

Other new wilderness areas would be established near Telluride, Norwood, Ouray and Ridgway, with an expansion of the Lizard Head and Mount Sneffels wilderness areas. The bill would also permanently withdraw mineral mining permits in areas near the Thompson Divide and create a new recreation area near Gunnison.

During the Senate subcommittee hearing, Sen. Michael Bennet, a primary sponsor of the CORE Act, said a broad spectrum of Coloradans endorses the measure. He submitted over 50 letters of support for the legislation, including from Republican and Democratic county commissioners, 17 towns and cities, and the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute tribes.

“These Coloradans know how fundamental public lands are to our identity and economy, and they did the hard work to ensure the CORE Act reflects the diverse interests of our diverse state,” Bennet said.

While the measure received a hearing in the Senate, the subcommittee has not yet voted to advance the bill, which is needed for it to be considered by the full chamber. A version of the bill in the House is also awaiting action from the Natural Resources Committee.

The bill’s support has been mainly along party lines, and Colorado House Republicans have opposed the legislation in the past. Republicans hold a narrow 220-213 majority in the House, with two vacancies, and a 53-47 majority in the Senate.

Even if the bill manages to pass Congress, it’s unclear if Trump would sign it.

Trump opposed the CORE Act during his first term when it passed the House in 2019 with mostly Democratic support. The White House at the time said the bill amounted to “land restrictions,” according to reporting by Colorado Public Radio .

The CORE Act is sponsored by all of Colorado’s federal Democratic delegation, which includes Bennet and Neguse, Sen. John Hickenlooper, and Reps. Diana DeGette, Jason Crow and Brittany Petersen.

Wildfire mitigation

Colorado lawmakers are also seeking to pass several wildfire-related bills aimed at shoring up mitigation and response strategies.

That includes the Cross-Boundary Wildfire Solutions Act , which Neguse is leading in the House as part of a package of wildfire prevention measures. The Senate version of the bill was among those that received a hearing from the subcommittee.

The bill would mandate a study to identify gaps in federal programs and rules that inhibit wildfire mitigation across federal and non-federal jurisdictions and make recommendations to improve current practices.

Another wildfire bill supported by Neguse, the Western Wildfire Support Act , was also reviewed during the Senate hearing. The measure would provide more funds for firefighting equipment, create new training programs for federal and local firefighters, and support recovery efforts across wildfire-impacted landscapes and surrounding communities.

“I’m hopeful that common sense will prevail and that this bill will finally be given full consideration,” Neguse said in a statement following the Senate hearing. “It’s past time for us to work together to provide urgent support to the firefighters, businesses, and families impacted by wildfires.”

A different wildfire mitigation measure, support for which is split within Colorado’s federal delegation, is even further along and could be on the cusp of passing Congress.

The Fix Our Forests Act passed the House in January, with all four Colorado Republicans in favor and all four of the state’s Democrats opposed. Hickenlooper is a sponsor of the bill’s Senate version, while his colleague, Bennet, is opposed.

The Senate bill is headed to a full vote after the chamber’s Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee advanced the bill in October.

The bill streamlines wildfire information sharing and boosts restoration programs. It would also speed up the review process for management practices such as logging and could limit litigation against those projects, raising concerns among some Democrats and environmental groups.

During a hearing on the bill in March, Bennet said while he appreciates “the goals of the Fix Our Forests Act,” he is worried that the measure “places an unreasonable burden on communities and ties the hands of local governments, potentially undermining the collaborative approach needed to move forest management projects forward.”

Still, the bill has broad support from Republicans and Democrats in both the Senate and House, and has endorsements from a bipartisan coalition of Western governors, forestry and conservation groups.

“Wildfires won’t wait. After bipartisan committee passage, the next step is a full Senate vote,” Hickenlooper said in a statement in October. “The Fix Our Forests Act will make our communities and environment more resilient.”

Other legislation

Other public lands measures sit at different stages of the legislative process.

The Gunnison Outdoor Resource Protection, or GORP Act , which was reintroduced this year after being unveiled in 2024, was not among the bills that received a Senate hearing. It is awaiting action from committees in both the Senate and House.

The measure di get a bipartisan boost after Rep. Jeff Hurd, a Republican representing much of western and southern Colorado, became a sponsor this year. Neguse also sponsors the bill.

The GORP Act would safeguard 730,000 acres of land in and around Gunnison County, touching on areas in neighboring Saguache, Ouray, Hinsdale, Delta and Pitkin counties. The measure places different types of federal land designations throughout the region aimed at enhancing protections for undeveloped and wildlife areas, recreation use and research.

Other provisions of the bill include withdrawing more than 74,000 acres of key lands in Delta County’s North Fork Valley from oil and gas development and securing public access to a boat ramp at the Gunnison Forks Day Use Area. The bill would also convert over 18,000 acres of Ute Mountain Ute Tribe land from fee ownership to trust ownership. Doing so would unlock the potential for these lands to access more federal funding and support while protecting the Tribe’s sovereignty.

The Ski Hill Resources for Economic Development, or SHRED Act , is another bill that has been reintroduced multiple times by Colorado lawmakers and even advanced out of the House, only for it to languish in the Senate.

The measure could be heading for a full Senate vote, however, after the Energy and Natural Resources committee in September decided to advance the bill without amendments to a chamber-wide vote. Bennet and Hickenlooper are both Senate cosponsors.

A House version of the bill, led by Neguse, with Hurd and Pettersen as cosponsors, is still awaiting committee action.

The bill seeks to keep revenue generated from ski resorts’ operating permits in the hands of local communities by shifting that money to the National Forests. Currently, ski areas pay on average $40 million annually in permit fees to the Forest Service, which goes to the U.S. Treasury, according to Bennet.

The SHRED Act would redirect those funds to the National Forests where ski areas operate. Forests could then use that money to help cover the costs of processing proposals for ski area improvements, providing information for visitors, and wildfire preparedness, in addition to broader, year-round recreation and community needs.

The bill enjoys widespread bipartisan support in both the Senate and House. It is also endorsed by ski groups such as the National Ski Area Association, Vail Resorts and the Colorado Association of Ski Towns.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/5/2025/12/04171256/Lawmakers-1-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 12:03:03.527033

Instead, the ESS/EV separation will likely grow more pronounced in coming years.
Historically, shared scale between ESS and EV manufacturing was a large reason why lithium-ion battery costs fell rapidly.","While the long-term impacts of the elimination of the United States’ federal electric vehicle tax credit remain unknown, it’s clear that battery manufacturers in the country are starting to shift their approach toward grid-scale storage rather than EV batteries. LG Energy Solution, for instance, plans to expand its ESS facility in Michigan, and OEMs like SK and Samsung are entering the US market as EV demand softens.

Still, for Ravi Manghani, the senior director of strategic sourcing at Anza Renewables, it’s more of a step-on-the-acceleration moment than a sudden change in strategy.

“We’ve seen the early signs of divergence take shape over the past several years, largely due to the way the Inflation Reduction Act structured its incentives,” he told ESS News, pointing out that the $7,500 federal EV credit required both the battery and its upstream materials to come from the US or allied countries with the storage investment tax credit (ITC) being tied mainly to domestic content. That’s part of what drove EV-focused battery OEMs to localize their US manufacturing footprints first.

“The pace of change has accelerated,” he added. “The slowdown in EV growth, the rise of data-center power demand driven by AI and long lead times for new gas-based generation are pushing storage to the forefront much faster than anticipated.”

It’s one of the first real structural divergences between EV and ESS supply chains and the downstream impacts are already being felt. Safety and geopolitics are now the biggest differentiators between chemistries, with permitting considerations and complex Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rules also playing significant roles in a company’s procurement decision.

“For developers and procurement teams, that means more fragmented supplier relationships, less price transparency and shorter negotiating cycles,” Manghani said, at least in the near term. Now, the contracting process involves weighing reliability and compliance “as heavily” as price. “It’s becoming harder to compare bids on an apples-to-apples basis.”

Still, as new regional, purpose-built supply chains mature over time, Manghani expects that balance to stabilize, given that globally, “the EV market will continue to anchor most battery innovation…even if US EV growth moderates.”

Stabilization doesn’t mean reconvergence. Instead, the ESS/EV separation will likely grow more pronounced in coming years. Under FEOC rules, batteries produced or majority-owned by Chinese entities will not be able to qualify for the full ITC. This will likely push developers to make earlier, more strategic decisions about both chemistry and supplier ownership.

The decoupling also carries implications for innovation. Historically, shared scale between ESS and EV manufacturing was a large reason why lithium-ion battery costs fell rapidly. While Manghani doesn’t expect that dynamic to disappear entirely, it could slow down.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/16904384968_c14540e770_5k.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 09:59:51.243908

Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick have all committed to building wind projects over the coming years.
The tribunal found China had subsidized the utility-scale steel wind towers and then sold them in Canada at below-market prices.
While the inquiry highlighted the Canada's reliance on imported wind towers, some areas were found to be more heavily affected than others.
In the interim, he said the economic costs of tariffs are going to add up, starting with the wind projects.","A recent federal measure to place a 25 per cent tariff on steel-derivative products “such as wind towers” threatens to derail wind-generation projects and increase the price of electricity for ratepayers, say clean energy advocates.

Late last month, Prime Minister Mark Carney’s office released a sweeping list of measures meant to boost domestic demand for steel and lumber.

Among the measures, the government said it would impose a global 25 per cent tariff on “targeted imported steel-derivative products,” including wind towers, prefabricated buildings, fasteners and wires.

Patricia Lightburn, the Canadian Renewable Energy Association’s director of policy for British Columbia, told BIV the tariffs are expected to hit wind projects in western provinces the hardest.

“The problem is that Canada's domestic manufacturing of wind towers is not currently set up to meet the demand of Canada's growing wind industry,” she said.

The tariff announcement comes at a time many Canadian jurisdictions are turning to wind power to meet increasing demand.

B.C. is Canada's third-fastest growing wind market

The same day that tariffs were announced, the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) released a report indicating that wind power is expected to drive renewable energy growth through 2030, filling 70 per cent of demand.

By 2030, the CER estimates that renewables will make up 72.9 per cent of Canada’s electricity capacity, up from 70.5 per cent in 2025.

Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick have all committed to building wind projects over the coming years. In Nova Scotia, the province aims to combine onshore and offshore wind to meet its goal of 80 per cent clean electricity by 2030.

Quebec is expected to lead the country’s growth in renewable power capacity over the next five years as its utility seeks to boost wind capacity by 10,000 megawatts by 2035.

Alberta’s share of renewable power capacity is expected to rise to 53 per cent by 2030, from 46.6 per cent in 2025, making it the second-fastest growing market in the country.

And in B.C.—Canada's third-fastest renewable energy market—BC Hydro issued electricity purchasing agreements with nine wind projects last year. Those projects are expected to add nearly 5,000 megawatts to the grid and were matched in 2025 with another 5,000-megawatt call for power.

Single Canadian wind tower producer not enough to meet demand

An emerging problem, according to Vittoria Bellissimo, president and CEO of the Canadian Renewable Energy Association, is supplying the material to build all those wind farms.

Marmen Inc., a Canadian subsidiary of the German-owned Enercon Global GmbH, operates Canada’s only major wind turbine manufacturing facility in Matane, Que.

The facility produces turbine components such as concrete towers and blades, but comes nowhere close to meeting domestic demand, Bellissimo said in a statement.

“Imposing steep tariffs on turbine towers risks derailing projects and, in turn, jeopardizes Canada’s ability to power its future economy on time,” she said.

With many projects securing their supply chains ahead of time, the Canadian Renewable Energy Association said wind towers ordered several years ago will now be subject to the tariff. That will inevitably drive up costs “by tens of millions of dollars,” according to the organization.

“We only have one domestic manufacturer of towers, which is based on the East Coast, and so on top of just the fact that there's limited capacity, those towers can't be easily transported to the West Coast,” Lightburn said.

“In B.C., we do not have access to Canadian-made towers to build our new projects.”

Chinese wind products cheap but problematic

In 2023, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal held an inquiry into steel wind towers exported from China over concerns their production and sale price had been manipulated. The tribunal found China had subsidized the utility-scale steel wind towers and then sold them in Canada at below-market prices.

The practice was found to have caused material injury to Canada's domestic industry.

While the inquiry highlighted the Canada's reliance on imported wind towers, some areas were found to be more heavily affected than others.

Wind towers bound for energy projects west of the Ontario-Manitoba border were not included in the injury finding because Marmen could not practically or economically supply the Western provinces.

“Marmen claims that it has consistently sought sales in Canada, including Western Canada, but that it was unable to compete with subject imports,” the tribunal wrote in its final report.

Demand for wind energy projects declined in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick between 2018 and 2022, just as it “shifted dramatically” to the Western provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.

Increasingly, Western Canada was found to be nearly entirely reliant on foreign suppliers for wind towers, largely due to high transportation costs and the massive scale of upcoming projects, the inquiry found.

Julian Karaguesian, a McGill University visiting lecturer in economics and a former special advisor to Canada’s Minister of Finance, said the imposition of the tariffs will impose a “significant” cost on wind projects and raise the cost of clean energy in Canada.

At the same time, he suspects the measures were meant to send a signal to Washington that Canada is complying with U.S. demands that it curb its role as a trans-shipment point for Chinese steel.

Karaguesian pointed to U.S. pressure to curb Chinese imports of wind technology following a report in the Financial Times that Britain’s domestic spy agency, MI5, was investigating Chinese wind technology over concerns it had embedded spy equipment into strategic energy assets.

In May, Reuters cited unnamed U.S. energy officials who stated “unexplained communication equipment” had been found inside batteries, heat pumps, electric vehicle chargers and power inverters, the latter used to connect solar panels and wind turbines to electricity grids.

“We’re being pressured,” Karaguesian said of Ottawa's latest tariff measures. “It’s aligning our tariff policy with the United States.”​

​Karaguesian, who worked with Carney when he was deputy minister of finance and later when Karaguesian served at the Canadian embassy in Washington, said those interactions left him with a respect for Carney's capacity to work through complicated negotiations.

He said the latest tariff announcement shows Carney is “treading a fine line” as he attempts to negotiate trade relationships with India and China without upsetting Trump and efforts to renew the Canada-U.S.-Mexico free trade agreement, or CUSMA.

Karaguesian suspects the tariffs on wind towers is temporary as U.S. negotiations continue. In the interim, he said the economic costs of tariffs are going to add up, starting with the wind projects.

“We’re not competitive in building these things,” Karaguesian said. “If we keep doing this across the board, in the aggregate, this will hurt.”

BC Hydro says 2024 call to power projects will be subject to tariffs

Whether the tariff measures are motivated by boosting domestic manufacturing, as part of complex trade negotiations, or some combination of the two, one fact remains: Western Canada's reliance on imported wind towers has not abated.

BC Hydro spokesperson Kyle Donaldson stated that the 2025 call for power includes a tariff adjustment mechanism. He said the mechanism ensures energy prices can be adjusted if project costs are impacted by tariffs between the close of the request for proposals and the delivery of projects.

But that’s not the case for the wind projects in its 2024 call for power, confirmed Donaldson. Pending any federal policy changes, those projects will be subject to the tariffs once they begin construction in 2028 or 2029.

“We did not know this was coming. As you can appreciate—tariffs have been ongoing developments throughout the year,” added Donaldson.

With the 2024 project prices locked into contracts with BC Hydro, Lightburn said proponents don't have the ability to absorb a significant cost increase such as the one presented by tariffs.

“There's a lot of uncertainty and risk that these projects may not materialize if there's no way for them to update their bid prices and have those costs reflected,” she said.

Tariffs mean future wind projects will cost more, says critic

When it comes to the projects in the 2025 call to power, Lightburn said proponents will have to factor in additional tariff costs in their bid prices. That’s ultimately expected to increase costs to ratepayers, she added.

“BC Hydro is counting on the gigawatt hours that will be supplied by these two calls for power,” she said. “And if that supply is put at risk through these tariffs, then that's going to be a problem for BC Hydro in meeting future demand.”

Lightburn said her organization is broadly supportive of onshoring wind turbine manufacturing, but what’s needed is an orderly transition—not an abrupt imposition of tariffs on a nascent domestic industry that’s not ready to scale up.

“We have the time to create this transition. And when the steel industry is ready to supply those turbines, there will be demand for that across Canada, because there's such a growing need for renewables,” she said.

“It doesn't seem like the right time to be putting additional pressure on ratepayers and rising electricity costs.”

Lightburn said her group is in active conversations with the federal government to seek carve-outs for projects already contracted or under way.",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/biv/mooselakewind-aeolus.jpg;w=938;h=527;mode=crop,N,,2025-12-05 12:02:23.290634

Anya Fetcher is the federal policy advocate at the Natural Resources Council of Maine.

Energy affordability is a major issue for families and small businesses in Maine, and it’s not getting better. Starting Jan. 1, most Mainers will see their electricity bills jump by $11 to $16 per month. Why? Because New England’s power prices are still yoked to natural gas prices.

The single largest contributor to high energy costs in Maine is our state’s dependence on fossil fuels we have to buy from far away. To break this cycle, we need to build more clean energy in Maine. Homegrown clean energy is the best opportunity we have to bring more affordable, reliable energy to Maine people quickly.

Unfortunately, Washington, D.C., is slowing us down.

Since day one, the Trump administration and its allies in Congress have worked hard to keep us hooked on fossil fuels while stifling the growth of lower-cost clean energy sources. These actions taken together might be good for fossil fuel companies, but they don’t do anything to lower energy costs for Mainers, make us less dependent on out-of-state oil and gas supplies, or help us tackle climate change.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which repealed almost all the clean energy policies passed in the Inflation Reduction Act, will lead to higher energy costs for Maine households. Slashing these investments translates into electricity price increases by slowing clean energy adoption and keeping us dependent longer on natural gas power generation. One report earlier this year found that repealing the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits would raise rates in New England by 17%.

The federal government under the Trump administration has pushed to slow, stop or cancel clean energy projects that help stabilize electricity costs across New England — even ones already under construction. For example, the stop-work order issued to Revolution Wind, threatens $500 million in wholesale electricity market savings every year.

Arbitrary tariffs raise the cost of just about everything. That includes the installation of renewable energy systems, and equipment used to maintain and upgrade Maine’s electricity grid. Depending on their implementation, it also threatens to increase the costs of fuel for transportation, heating and power generation, many of which come to Maine from refineries in Canada or overseas. An analysis this summer found that a 10% tariff that included fuels would increase the energy costs in an average Maine household by $419 per year. A 25% tariff could raise household energy expenses by more than $1,000 per year.

Electricity supply costs in Maine are driven by the cost of natural gas power generation on the New England grid, and we will continue to be exposed to these fossil fuel price risks for as long as we are dependent on these sources of energy. The Trump administration’s policies to increase U.S. liquefied natural gas exports are contributing to higher natural gas prices and forecasts, part of the supply rate increases starting in January.

The best path to energy affordability is Maine-made clean energy. The good news is that Maine has a strong foundation of clean energy policies to build on, with healthy rooftop and community solar development, and initiatives to develop our strong wind resources in Aroostook County and offshore in the Gulf of Maine. And Mainers are already benefiting, through a clean energy industry that already employs more than 15,000 Mainers.

Unfortunately, the Trump administration and its allies in Congress aren’t doing anything to help us get to a cleaner, more affordable, more reliable energy system for Maine. In fact, their path is going to make energy more expensive for Mainers.",https://i0.wp.com/bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/12/Danby-Trump-Energy-Policies.jpg?fit=1200%2C1200&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-05 11:06:22.610809

Health Policy Legislative Action

Health Reform 3.0

If Obamacare was health reform 1.0 and the Republican effort to repeal and replace it was an attempted health reform 2.0, there could be a major discussion around health reform 3.0. With Affordable Care Act (ACA) enhanced premium subsidies set to expire and Medicaid work requirements and income-verification measures taking effect, millions could lose coverage or face higher out-of-pocket costs. Democrats will have their vote in the U.S. Senate on extending the ACA-enhanced subsidies. It is unclear whether Republicans will offer an alternative or simply let them expire. There does not appear to be sufficient Republican support for continuing the subsidies as currently constructed.

Healthcare has risen to be one of the top issues of voter concern, particularly lack of affordability and access to care. Rural and safety-net hospitals, already under financial pressure, are bracing for an uptick in uncompensated care and potential service-line reductions. There does appear to be recognition from some Republicans and President Donald Trump that healthcare affordability and access are now major issues that must be addressed. It is anticipated that the Republican policy approach will be to empower consumers and direct subsidies to low-income individuals through health savings accounts (HSAs) or flexible spending accounts (FSAs). Whether that will come in the form of a debate about health reform during the election year or actual movement of health legislation (such as through a second reconciliation bill) is unclear.

Appropriations

The Labor-U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) appropriations legislation has not been completed for federal fiscal year (FY) 2026. It may be included in other smaller minibus bills or be included in the final omnibus legislation expected before Jan. 30, 2026, when the current continuing resolution (CR) expires. There is no guarantee of a final omnibus package, but it appears as of this writing to be more probable than not that Congress will seek to avoid another shutdown. Labor-HHS is always a tricky bill to pass, with cultural issues that garner political division.

FDA User Fee Program Reauthorization

Key U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) user fee programs covering reviews for prescription drugs, biologics, medical devices, biosimilars and generic drugs are set to expire on Sept. 30, 2027, generally following a five-year reauthorization schedule. Congress must reauthorize the user fee programs, or FDA will lose its legal authority to collect user fees that are used to sustain key FDA employees and regulatory programs. That makes reauthorizing these key FDA user fee programs ""must pass"" legislation. The reauthorization process will start in 2026 to ensure that the legislation is completed in adequate time to meet the reauthorization's September 2027 deadline.

Typically, this process begins with direct negotiations between the FDA and regulated industries to establish and agree to user fee amounts and the agency's corresponding performance goals. That agreement governs the user fee amounts paid by product applicants and ""performance goals"" agreed to by FDA. FDA's budget relies on user fees to support product review. The agreement is published for comment in the Federal Register. In addition to providing transparency on key issues, this provides an opportunity for stakeholders to provide input. In addition, FDA often holds public meetings that coincide with the publication.

Over-the-Counter User Fee Act Implementation Oversight

Congress reauthorized the Over-the-Counter User Fee Act (OMUFA) in the legislation that reopened the government following the longest government shutdown in history. Congressional oversight activities are anticipated in 2027 to ensure that the FDA rapidly implements the reforms included in OMUFA. Congress is likely to schedule a hearing on OMUFA implementation and engage with FDA on congressional priorities from the legislation.

In particular, Congress passed legislation reforming the process for approval of sunscreen ingredients. As a result of the legislation, FDA is charged with promulgating new guidance within a year regarding how sunscreen active ingredients sponsors can use nonclinical testing alternatives to animal testing to meet safety and efficacy standards for topicals. The last time the FDA approved a new over-the-counter sunscreen active ingredient was 1999.

FDA and the Nation's Food Supply

As part of the FDA's initiative to Make America Healthy Again (MAHA), the agency announced a series of new measures to phase out all petroleum-based synthetic dyes from the nation's food supply, including:

establishing a national standard and timeline for the food industry to transition from petrochemical-based dyes to natural alternatives

initiating the process to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings – Citrus Red No. 2 and Orange B – within the coming months

working with industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic dyes – FD&C Green No. 3, FD&C Red No. 40, FD&C Yellow No. 5, FD&C Yellow No. 6, FD&C Blue No. 1 and FD&C Blue No. 2 – from the food supply by the end of 2026

authorizing four new natural color additives in the coming weeks and accelerating the review and approval of others

partnering with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to conduct comprehensive research on how food additives impact children's health and development

requesting food companies to remove FD&C Red No. 3 sooner than the 2027-2028 deadline previously required

Additional Congressional FDA Reforms

Congress generally uses the reauthorization bill to address FDA-related regulatory concerns. Thus, these bills are typically the primary legislative vehicle for Congress to enact broader changes to FDA rules governing review and evaluation, distribution and marketing of products.

Under the auspices of the reauthorization debate next year, Congress is expected to consider a range of policies governing:

regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical products and other digital health technologies, including the use of software as a medical device

changes to streamline the review process to ensure safe products reach patients sooner

changes to rules governing importation of active pharmaceutical ingredients and other materials, particularly from China

how to ensure the U.S. domestic manufacturing capability can keep pace with China

issues relating to FDA rules governing cell and gene therapy

FDA rules governing how to stimulate development of products for rare diseases

drug compounding issues

Health Policy Regulatory Action

FDA Actions

FDA regularly sets forth regulatory expectations through published guidance and reinforces compliance through enforcement actions. In 2025, FDA issued a number of these actions, and it is likely FDA will continue its current trend. These actions include:

warning letters, untitled letters and consent decrees to drug companies to remove ""misleading ads,"" including issuances to telehealth and compounding companies

defining ultra-processed foods and the continued MAHA initiative aimed at tackling diet-related chronic disease

heightened enforcement on contamination prevention, rapid recalls and supply chain transparency

the FDA Commissioner's National Priority Voucher pilot program

Vaccine Policy in Flux

Few issues reveal the current fault lines more clearly than vaccine policy. The Trump Administration's recent removal of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) leadership and a wave of high-level resignations have raised concerns about the nation's ability to coordinate consistent guidance. In response, several West Coast states formed the West Coast Health Alliance to preserve science-based immunization recommendations. These parallel frameworks – federal versus regional – signal a new era of decentralized public health, where providers and payors must navigate differing vaccine schedules, reporting requirements and reimbursement standards. For manufacturers, patchwork introduces operational complexity as global outbreaks demand cohesion.

MAHA Strategy and Chronic Disease Management

The Trump Administration's MAHA strategy represents an ambitious pivot toward chronic disease prevention. The plan emphasizes early detection and longitudinal management of heart disease, diabetes and mental health conditions, coupled with digital tools and data-driven quality metrics, yet its success will hinge on a workforce already stretched thin. Policies restricting reproductive and gender-affirming care have accelerated clinician migration from certain states, creating ""health professional deserts"" that undermine the very access gains MAHA seeks to achieve. In 2026, the policy conversation will increasingly center on how to deploy technology, AI capabilities, remote monitoring, telehealth supervision and digital therapeutics to fill those gaps without widening disparities.

Restructuring at HHS: Promise and Peril

A more integrated architecture may speed data sharing and crisis response, but frequent leadership turnover and blurred lines of authority also risk slowing implementation. Public health departments and provider systems will need to track not only policy changes but also who within the HHS holds the pen on guidance, grants and enforcement.

Pricing Reforms with Public Health Ripples

The Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) negotiation provisions are entering their second phase, and their effects are beginning to cascade across markets. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will soon publish negotiated prices for the next cohort of drugs – many targeting chronic diseases at the heart of prevention efforts. These changes, combined with the forthcoming 340B rebate model and a new wave of most-favored-nation pricing proposals, could reshape formularies and access for low-income and safety-net populations. The interplay between negotiated Medicare prices and commercial average sales price benchmarks will remain one of the most consequential – and least predictable – policy experiments of 2026.

Agriculture and Food

Farm Bill

Though the Farm Bill was extended through FY 2026, several titles have not been updated since 2018. The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Agriculture chair has reiterated his commitment to pass a Farm Bil 2.0 this year, but with midterms looming, the window is closing – the first quarter of 2026 is the last opportunity for any Farm Bill 2.0 legislation to advance. While tax legislation addressed crop insurance, reference prices and nutrition assistance, other titles – including those for the Conservation Reserve Program, specialty crops insurance and hemp production – are outdated. There is also bipartisan support for precision agriculture initiatives, although funding remains a concern. The Farm Bill is the acknowledged vehicle for a national standard for livestock production, in response to California Prop 12, so a Prop 12 fix is unlikely unless momentum builds quickly for a Farm Bill 2.0.

Cryptocurrency

The Senate Committee on Agriculture in November 2025 released a discussion draft of its cryptocurrency legislation, which builds on legislation passed in the House (the CLARITY Act, H.R.3633). A markup date is likely in early 2026, and the expectation is that the Agriculture Committee language will be conferenced with language advancing in the Senate Committee on Banking, which is set to be marked up in December 2025.

Nutrition

The coming year will be pivotal for U.S. nutrition standards, with 1) updates to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) expected late this year or in early 2026, 2) a definition of ultra-processed foods, 3) potential regulation of seed oils in the marketplace and 4) potential changes to country of origin labeling for meats. The DGA, which is informed by the MAHA Commission report and recommendations and influenced by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy's pronouncements on American nutrition, will determine eligibility for many foods in federal nutrition assistance and school lunch programs. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Brooke Rollins is expected to continue approving waiver requests submitted by states, allowing them to modify the nutrition assistance programs they administer.

Farm Labor Bill

House Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn ""GT"" Thompson (R-Pa.) expressed his intent to release draft legislation that essentially codifies a working group report with recommendations for changes to farm labor regulations, including updates to the H-2A visa – specifically, the creation of a year-round visa under the program. There is bipartisan support for such changes in the House. Action from the Senate will come after House passage. Clients and stakeholders should be ready to weigh in with concerns and express support for this legislation, as appropriate, to ensure meaningful farm labor reform is enacted in the coming months. The Trump 'Administration's changes to federal wage guidelines for seasonal agricultural workers under the H-2A program will also require attention from agriculture and food stakeholders. These guidelines already face legal challenges from groups representing farm laborers.

Tariffs

Agriculture and food stakeholders continue to face retaliation from trading partners in response to Trump Administration tariffs. Animal and plant agriculture producers are eagerly awaiting details of bilateral frameworks that should reduce tariffs for U.S. exports. The U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the president's authority to levy tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) is expected later this year or in early 2026. The Supreme Court is likely to limit the president's authority under IEEPA, but the Trump Administration is already preparing other tariff measures to replace any IEEPA tariffs that must be withdrawn. U.S. agriculture and food stakeholders will be watching this decision and other Trump Administration tariff measures closely.

Appropriations

With prospects dimming for a Farm Bill 2.0 this Congress, the FY 2027 appropriations process is the likely next best opportunity for many agriculture and food stakeholders to advance report language and/or funding for key priorities. Legislators' appropriations request windows will open in the first quarter of 2026 for the FY 2027 budget year. Stakeholders should prepare to submit their requests and meet with key legislative and committee officials to line up support for these priorities quickly in the New Year.

Federal Workforce

Cuts to the USDA workforce (20 percent) and the prolonged federal government shutdown severely impacted USDA's ability to provide services related to loans and disaster assistance, conservation programs, animal inspections and rural development. As 2026 approaches, agriculture and food stakeholders will need to ensure legislators prioritize USDA finding for critical programs and ensure, as much as possible, that there is no funding lapse during the remainder of FY 2026, which runs through Sept. 30, 2026.

Energy

Energy and Water (E&W) Appropriations

Bringing FY 2026 to a Close: Given House passage of the E&W bill in September 2025 and the recent posting of the Senate E&W bill, the final FY 2026 E&W bill is being closely watched, which could hopefully be part of a January 2026 package. The future of funding for several key U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) offices – such as the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) and Loan Programs Office (LPO) – is at stake under the FY 2026 E&W appropriations process.

Kicking Off FY 2027: House Committee on Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) has signaled that anything that does not make it into the January appropriations package for FY 2026 will likely need to be a full-year continuing resolution, because he is eager to begin looking to FY 2027 appropriations. The Trump Administration has a year under its belt, including announcing the reorganization of the DOE, and the Energy Dominance agenda is expected to be reflected in future appropriations.

Permitting Reform

The House is expected to pass three permitting bills before the end of 2025 to tee up action in the Senate next year:

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act (H.R.4776) streamlines National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews by clarifying the scope and timing of judicial challenges to federal agencies' environmental reviews.

The Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today (PERMIT) Act (H.R.3898) limits states' authority under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act to block infrastructure projects.

The Improving Interagency Coordination for Pipeline Reviews Act (H.R.3668) expands 'the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) role in permitting reviews for natural gas pipelines.

Congress has been close to passing permitting reform legislation in the past. Once the House passes these bills, all eyes will be on the Senate – and particularly on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources – to take action.

DOE in 2026

Grant Terminations: DOE's detailed review of all grant projects issued under the Biden Administration will continue in the coming year. For grantees, possible outcomes of the review process include 1) approval to move forward with the grant as planned, 2) approval to proceed with a revised project that aligns with Trump Administration energy priorities or 3) termination.

New Grant Funding: Building on numerous requests for information issued in the second half of 2025, DOE is expected to issue significant grant funding that remains from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) for critical minerals and materials and grid infrastructure to support data center development.

Office of Energy Dominance Financing (EDF): DOE LPO has been officially renamed and rebranded to support financing of American energy and manufacturing projects that ""meaningfully contribute to the U.S. energy security, grid reliability, and lowering costs for all Americans."" The program has more than $200 billion to provide low-cost financing to a broad array of energy projects, with a focus on nuclear energy and other baseload energy solutions that will help win the AI race and restore American energy dominance.

FERC

FERC will take up a rulemaking proposal from the Energy secretary aimed at accelerating the interconnection of large loads (e.g., data centers) to the electric grid. To date, FERC has received comments on an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (RM26-4) regarding the Energy secretary's proposal and likely will issue a formal notice of proposed rulemaking in the near future that should spark substantive and jurisdictional debates well into 2026.

FERC will examine whether – and if so, how – to revise its regulations to establish streamlined procedures for authorizing activities at liquefied natural gas plants without case-specific authorization orders under Section 3 or Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act. The commission has issued an initial notice of inquiry (RM26-2-000) that seeks information and stakeholder perspectives on these potential regulatory streamlining efforts.

FERC will establish the five-year oil pipeline price index for the period July 1, 2026, through June 30, 2031. FERC has initiated a rulemaking (RM26-6) that proposes using the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (PPI-FG) minus 1.42 percent (PPI-FG – 1.42 percent) as the new index level.

Nuclear Energy

The U.S. is placing renewed emphasis on nuclear power as a cornerstone of its energy security policy. Recent landmark legislation (2021-2024) and executive actions have unleashed billions in funding and incentives for nuclear energy. Federal policies now include production and investment tax credits for nuclear plants, research and development funding for advanced reactors, streamlined licensing processes and programs to sustain the existing reactor fleet.

In May 2025, Executive Order (EO) 14300 accelerated this push – from modernizing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to jumpstarting reactor construction and fuel supply infrastructure. The NRC is expected to release its rulemaking on these modernization reforms in the first quarter of 2026. Major items expected in the rulemaking include:

fixed deadlines for licensing decisions

streamlined licensing to avoid duplication of efforts for reactors previously approved by DOE

revisions to the NRC's NEPA regulations to comply with the 2023 amendments to NEPA

changes to radiation safety standards

Fuels

Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) blending mandates for 2026 and 2027 are expected from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in early 2026, with issues to watch being topline numbers, potential Renewable Identification Numbers (RIN) reduction for foreign renewable fuel or feedstocks, and removal of eligibility of renewable electricity ""(eRINs"") from the program.

Long-awaited guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury on implementation of the Section 45Z Clean Fuels Credit could be released before year's end; industry has lobbied hard on treatment of qualified fuel sales through third-party intermediaries and accompanying guidance from the USDA on treatment and scoring of climate-smart agriculture practices.

The drive for year-round E15 fuel is once again heating up, with proponents lobbying the White House to push EPA for a pathway while also attempting to tack legislative language onto year-end must-pass legislation, including the National Defense Authorization Act – or, potentially, an omnibus negotiated in January 2026.

Environment

Endangered Species Act (ESA)

A comprehensive overhaul of ESA regulations is expected, including a narrower definition of ""take"" (excluding habitat modification) and changes to the process for determining endangered species status. Many revisions would restore Trump-era rules previously rescinded by the Biden Administration.

The SPEED Act

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act (H.R.4776) – bipartisan legislation to reform NEPA – is expected to advance in 2026. Key provisions include streamlining environmental reviews, clarifying what constitutes a ""major federal action"" and imposing a 150-day limit on legal challenges. These changes aim to accelerate permitting for infrastructure and energy projects, reducing delays and litigation risk.

EPA Regulatory Actions

Several major EPA actions are anticipated in 2026, including:

Endangerment Finding. Reconsideration of the 2009 finding and related regulations

Vehicle Standards. Review of light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicle emissions rules

Power Plant Regulations. Potential revisions to rules under Clean Power Plan 2.0

Methane Standards. Reconsideration of oil and gas industry requirements (Subparts OOOO b/c)

Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. Possible changes to mandatory reporting requirements that impose significant costs on energy producers

Waters of the United States (WOTUS) Rule. Further review of the WOTUS definition.

Chemical Accident Protection. Reconsideration of the Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements related to cross-agency coordination in the chemical transportation industry

Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Fees Reauthorization

The Lautenberg Chemical Safety Act's fee authority expires after 10 years. Both chambers are working on legislation to extend this authority, with discussions on substantive improvements and clarifications to current law.

Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)

PFAS will remain a high-profile issue. Though comprehensive legislation is unlikely, provisions could appear in must-pass bills such as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) or appropriations measures. Following EPA's designation of two PFAS chemicals as hazardous under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), expect continued debate over liability and potential exemptions for ""passive receivers.""

Local Government

State Revolving Fund (SRF) and Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) Reauthorization

Both the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW) and House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure (T&I) held hearings in 2025 on ways to strengthen federal water infrastructure investments. Several estimates indicate that hundreds of billions of dollars are required to repair and replace clean water and wastewater infrastructure over the next several decades.

The Clean Water SRF and WIFIA programs provide financing for water and wastewater projects. The Clean Water SRF has provided $172 billion through almost 50,000 low-interest loans to communities, mainly for wastewater infrastructure facilities and upgrades. For 40 years, the CWSRF program has been a successful partnership between the federal government and states, where states manage the process and select projects to receive SRF financing. The newer EPA WIFIA program and U.S. Army Corps Water Infrastructure Financing Program (CWIFP) were authorized in 2014 and are instead administered on the federal level. Both programs are important tools needed to maintain affordable interest rates and provide principal forgiveness and funding to many communities that could not afford to pay for large projects, which directly impact household water affordability.

The Senate EPW and House T&I Committees are expected to begin drafting reauthorization bill for these programs early in 2026. The last rounds of SRF funding from the previous authorization in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will be next year. Communities should continue to participate in this reauthorization process and stay apprised of potential changes to both programs.

FEMA Reform

In 2026, congressional leaders will attempt to move the Fixing Emergency Management for Americans Act of 2025 (H.R.4669). This bipartisan legislation was introduced by House T&I Committee Chair Sam Graves (R-Mo.), Ranking Member Rick Larsen (D-Wash.), former Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials Chair Daniel Webster (R-Fla.) and Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management Ranking Member Greg Stanton (D-Ariz.). H.R.4669 represents a major overhaul to federal disaster management law. It would reorganize the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), modernize disaster assistance programs and change how aid is delivered to communities by in part directing states to take a more active role in disaster preparedness, recovery and insurance costs. On a parallel track, the Trump Administration is also attempting to reform FEMA in an effort led by the FEMA Review Council, under U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Department of War (DOW) Secretary Pete Hegseth. According to a Nov. 26, 2025, notice published in the Federal Register, the FEMA Review Council will present their draft final report on Dec. 11, 2025. In 2026, local governments will need to prepare for potential changes in disaster response that will affect how quickly funding arrives and how residents access support.

Tariffs

In 2025, President Trump instituted an aggressive new tariff regime on nearly every country in the world. From a local government perspective, this has the potential to create both indirect and direct fiscal impacts. Indirectly, local governments are heavily dependent on sales tax, income tax and property tax revenue. Historically, when the cost of consumer goods increases, it causes pressure on household incomes, which can decrease consumer and home improvement spending and, therefore, negatively impact sales and property tax revenue. Directly, tariffs increase operating expenses for governments. Construction and equipment will cost more, therefore driving up the cost of local capital projects, which can upend long-term capital improvement plans.

The impact of tariffs comes at the same time as additional restrictions on federal funding generally to local governments under the new administration. Congress is currently considering legislation that would curtail a president's ability to use national emergencies as a justification for impose tariffs. Additionally, the Supreme Court could issue tariff-related decisions in the current term on the validity of tariffs imposed using the IEEPA as a justification. During 2026, local governments should continue to monitor the evolving tariff landscape to forecast the short-term and long-term impacts to budgets.

Native American Law

A number of so-called ""prediction markets"" are offering online sports wagering – even in states where gambling is illegal – by rebranding ""sports betting"" as ""event contracts"" and claiming oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), thereby bypassing state, local and tribal laws. The CFTC allows companies to self-certify compliance and has not independently reviewed these contracts, despite clear prohibitions in the CEA and CFTC regulations against offering futures contracts that would make gaming contracts unlawful under federal or state law.

This regulatory gap has triggered at least 21 court cases and united a broad coalition of stakeholders – including 36 bipartisan attorneys general, Tribes, commercial gaming operators and responsible gambling organizations – calling for action.

There is likely to be a concerted effort among these stakeholders to urge Congress to amend the CEA to prohibit sporting events and casino-style games from being listed as event contracts and clarifying that such contracts are not ""excluded commodities,"" making self-certification no longer permissible.

Emerging Technology

AI Legislation/Regulation

Mounting industry pressure to avoid a fragmented 50-state patchwork (mirroring privacy and cybersecurity challenges) could drive Congress to consider AI legislation, as multiple state AI laws take effect in 2026, including Colorado's AI Act, Texas's Responsible AI Governance Act, California's AI Transparency Act, alongside the European Union (EU) AI Act. The Trump Administration could also lead efforts to preempt state AI laws, including by using executive authorities and working with congressional Republicans to create a legislative framework.

Cyber Reporting Regulation

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is expected to issue a final rule in May 2026 that will implement the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA). CIRCIA requires certain critical infrastructure owners and operators to report cyber incidents within 72 hours and ransomware payments within 24 hours. Businesses should prepare for this mandatory reporting requirement as part of their incident response planning.

CHIPS Act Implementation

As the U.S. Department of Commerce accelerates implementation of the CHIPS and Science Act, the CHIPS Program Office (CPO) and CHIPS Research and Development Office (CRDO) are moving forward with grant negotiations and awards at an increasing pace. In 2026, CPO will continue to focus on negotiating and finalizing awards – largely under the amended Facilities for Semiconductor Materials and Manufacturing Equipment funding opportunity – and deploying the remaining unallocated money to incentivize other critical supply chain segments, likely including critical minerals, underscoring the Trump Administration's push for rapid semiconductor onshoring. In 2026, companies can expect CPO and CRDO to maintain an aggressive pace, driving timely grant negotiations and pressing companies to deepen their U.S. investments across manufacturing and critical supply chain segments.

Export Control

The Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (ECRA) mandates regulation of ""emerging and foundational technologies,"" and the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has already issued multiple rounds of AI-chip, advanced-compute, semiconductor and quantum-related controls (most recently in late 2023 and 2024). BIS has publicly signaled additional rulemakings for 2025 and 2026 as the U.S. coordinates with allies through Wassenaar and related multilateral frameworks. Companies in advanced tech should expect continued tightening in AI, computing and quantum export controls in 2026.

Supply Chain Security

Congress is considering expansions of Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA), including bipartisan proposals such as the National Critical Capabilities Defense Act and the Outbound Investment Transparency Act, both aimed at tightening oversight of technology-supply-chain risks. The Treasury Department is simultaneously developing regulations to implement the 2023 Outbound Investment Executive Order (EO 14105), which targets U.S. investment in AI, quantum and advanced semiconductors. These combined congressional and executive actions indicate a meaningful shift toward broader inbound and outbound investment screening in 2026.

Defense Industrial Base Resilience

The FY 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) drafts under consideration in both the House and Senate include multiple provisions to strengthen the defense industrial base, with a particular emphasis on domestic production of critical materials, components and advanced technologies. The House draft (H.R.3838) includes updates to procurement requirements for rare earth elements, critical minerals and other strategic inputs, as well as new directives to recycle and recover key materials to reduce foreign reliance. The Senate draft (S.2296) similarly prioritizes industrial base resilience by directing the DOW to address supply chain vulnerabilities and expand domestic capacity in areas such as microelectronics, energetics and critical manufacturing. Together, these provisions signal that Congress intends to make supply chain security and onshoring a central focus of defense policy in 2026.

Space Legislation/Regulation

The NASA Reauthorization bill will likely include a comprehensive NASA policy update, including a revised scope and schedule for the Artemis lunar program. Both House and Senate drafts for the FY 2026 NDAA include new directions to the U.S. Space Force and provide funding for National Security Space Launch and Golden Dome initiatives. FY 2026 appropriations generally could impact resource levels and priorities for NASA, Space Force, Commerce Department, U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

On the regulatory side, several proposed and final rules will impact commercial space operators in 2026. In August 2025, the Trump Administration directed the Commerce Department to develop a new process for authorizing ""novel space activities"" by January 2026. As part of an FAA streamlining initiative, all commercial launch and reentry operators must transition from legacy licenses to Part 450 regulations by March 10, 2026. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will begin its review of comments on its proposed licensing overhaul of its Part 25 rules for earth/space station licensing. BIS expects to finalize rules passed in October 2024 to overhaul U.S. export controls for space-related items in early 2026 after public comment and review.

Quantum Legislation

Congress may update the National Quantum Initiative in 2026, given significant interest in both the House and Senate. A National Quantum Initiative Reauthorization Bill will include agencies like the DOE, National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The initiative may also include agencies such as DHS and NASA. The Trump Administration is expected to release one or more EOs, as well as a national quantum plan similar to ""America's AI Action Plan"" released in July 2025. Topics may include quantum trade promotion and export controls. The Trump Administration expressed interest in taking equity stakes in U.S. quantum companies.

Education

Rulemaking at U.S. Department of Education

The U.S. Department of Education (Department) is continuing to implement the education provisions included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which were aimed at reforming the student loan system and enhancing institutional accountability.

The Department is conducting two rulemaking committees to issue regulations under OBBB. The Reimagining and Improving Student Education (RISE) Committee concluded its work last month and reached consensus on the final day of negotiations. A proposed rule is anticipated in the coming weeks. Following what is likely to be a 30-day comment period, the Department will issue a final rule.

The Accountability in Higher Education and Access through Demand-driven Workforce Pell (AHEAD) Committee meets for the first time next week and again the week of Jan. 5, 2026.

The RISE Committee focused on the definition of graduate versus professional programs for new caps on student borrowing and streamlining repayment systems, while AHEAD negotiators will discuss expanding the Pell Grant program to include short-term workforce programs and revising the gainful employment and accountability regulations.

For 2026, the Department identified several topics for reimagining, updating and simplifying the student loan programs, accreditation reform, change in control and ownership regulation, student privacy rules and civil rights enforcement.

Dismantling of the Department

Education Secretary Linda McMahon reiterated her commitment to the president's campaign promise and DO to dismantle the Department she oversees. Acknowledging that Congress created the Department and only Congress can close its doors, Secretary McMahon has begun moving functions to other agencies via use of interagency agreements (IAA). Though the transfer of funding and personnel is temporary, expect the secretary to ask Congress to make the moves permanent.

In a recent op ed the secretary penned following the federal government shutdown, she suggested the Department won't be missed if shuttered and that funds allocated for its operations would be best managed at the state level.

She pointed to students who are not reading or doing math on grade level, test scores that are behind those of other nations in math and science, and students with student loan debt as reasons for her to continue moving forward with dismantling the Department.

Anticipate further efforts by the secretary and her team in the new year to identify new pathways/other agencies to fulfill statutory functions currently handled by the Department, including what to do about the massive student loan portfolio.

Scrutinizing Higher Education, Identifying Drivers of Cost, Increasing Affordability and Access, and China-Related Matters

Though it is not anticipated that Congress will pass a major reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA), a measure long overdue for an update, expect Republicans on Capitol Hill to keep the pressure on institutions of higher education (IHE) to lower tuition costs and remove programs of study that are not producing positive outcomes for students or leading to a promising career and saddling student loan borrowers with debt. In an effort to better understand what is driving high tuition costs, policymakers will continue to utilize hearings and other tools to push for greater transparency around cost and advance policy changes that would provide students and families better information to make informed decisions about post-secondary education pursuits. Also expect continued interest in China-related matters such as joint programs between American universities and Chinese institutions.

Congressional Investigations

With Republicans controlling both houses of Congress by slim margins, limited opportunities for major legislation and an eye on midterm elections, congressional committees are expected to increase not only the breadth of investigations, but also along expedited timelines. Knowing that the timeline between voluntary requests to subpoenas or hearings to contempt votes can be long, expect inquiries to advance at a much more rapid pace than usual. With both houses of Congress arguably up for grabs, congressional Democrats will also have the incentive to use investigations with increased power given the possibility of control in the 120th Congress. For a wide range of industries and sectors, this suggests a tumultuous 2026 with congressional oversight pressure from both houses of Congress and both sides of the aisle.

From Republican chairs, expect an intensified and ongoing focus on, among other areas:

large nonprofits, including private foundations and universities over matters such as ties with China, along with diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) matters, and investment and funding decisions

tech platforms and social media companies on data privacy issues, including heightened scrutiny around child online safety and other privacy issues

green energy and sectors that benefited from Biden-era programs

continued focus on the Biden Administration, including former administration officials and Biden family dealings

From Democratic ranking members and individual senators, expect efforts to set the stage on issues that committee chairs might exercise the full weight of congressional investigations power on, including, among others:

alleged conflicts of interest during service in the first year of the Trump Administration

investigations of U.S. companies and foreign entities that received beneficial treatment in the first year of the Trump Administration

numerous inquiries related to media consolidation, drug pricing, the effects of tariffs on small businesses and other matters

Tax

Follow Up to OBBB: Another reconciliation bill that tackles tax policy, among other areas, is an option that will continue to be on the table. This year or next a decision will need to be made on what to do – if anything – about the expired, enhanced Affordable Care Act tax subsidies.

OBBB Rulemaking: The Treasury Department and IRS will continue to issue rules that carry out the tax changes made by OBBB and other administration priorities, including the new Prohibited Foreign Entity Restrictions as they relate to renewable energy tax credits. Numerous notices are anticipated before the Treasury Department and IRS issue proposed regulations. In addition, guidance regarding withdrawing regulations issued during the Biden Administration is expected.

Possible Areas of Bipartisan Cooperation for Tax Writers: Extension of expired provisions, tax treatment of digital assets, retirement incentives and U.S.-Taiwan tax agreement are candidates for bipartisan support in 2026.

Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD):Publication of an outline of the ""side-by-side"" agreement that will recognize the U.S. as equivalent to Pillar Two. In addition, the OECD is working on other Pillar Two workstream aimed at simplification and the treatment of incentive tax credits.

National Security and Defense

FY 2026 NDAA: The annual must-pass legislation authorizing funding and programs for the U.S. Department of War (DOW) will likely include additional acquisition authorities and flexibility for the department to enable rapid acquisition of defense technology. In addition, continued emphasis on rebuilding the U.S. defense stockpile and encouraging leveraging AI, advanced manufacturing, and autonomous systems to enhance lethality is anticipated.

Potential Second Reconciliation Bill: A follow-up to the prior bill, which provided more than $150 billion for generational investments in defense technology and capabilities. Additional funding for DOW may be considered in 2026.

SBIR, STTR Program Reauthorization: A possible compromise to extend the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (SBTT) programs. This could be included in the FY 2026 NDAA or delayed until next year.

Defense Acquisition Reform: Implementation and potential adjustments to major acquisition reforms introduced in the FY 2026 NDAA will be a key focus area.

International Trade

Tariffs and Trade Policy

Renegotiation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)

The U.S., Canada and Mexico have already kicked off their domestic processes for the USMCA six-year review. The trilateral USMCA negotiations will intensify ahead of the July 1, 2026, deadline to conclude the review.

Key areas of focus will include automotive rules of origin, agricultural market access concerns and evolving digital trade provisions addressing cross-border data flows and platform governance.

Industry coalitions and government negotiators will increasingly engage in discussions to identify potential amendments, with particular attention on supply chain resilience provisions, regional content requirements and enforcement mechanisms.

Companies should consider USMCA-related engagement with the Office of U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), which is the agency leading these negotiations for the U.S., as well as with the White House and on Capitol Hill.

Sections 301 and 232 Investigations and Actions

Section 301 and Section 232 investigations initiated in 2024 and 2025 will reach critical decision points in 2026. The Trump Administration will likely announce outcomes of Section 232 investigations on topics such as robotics, semiconductors, polysilicon and pharmaceuticals, potentially imposing new tariffs or other import restrictions on national security grounds.

Trade actions taken pursuant to Sections 301 and 232 could be particularly significant if the Supreme Court limits the president's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs by 2026. If this occurs, Sections 301 and 232 could become the administration's primary bases for imposing tariffs. The business community should prepare for more aggressive use of these tools, with investigations potentially announced regarding new industrial sectors and new trading partners.

Customs Enforcement

U.S. customs-related enforcement is expected to ramp up significantly as U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Trade Fraud Task Force respond to rising concerns over tariff evasion, including transshipment through third countries. Companies importing goods subject to tariffs should anticipate and prepare for increased audits, enhanced use of data analytics for supply chain tracing, and potential civil or criminal liability for willful evasion. Proactive compliance measures (including origin verification, documentation controls and internal risk assessments) will be critical to mitigate exposure as agencies increasingly prioritize trade enforcement.

Export Controls

Regulatory Changes and Increased Export Enforcement

Companies will continue to confront an aggressive export enforcement environment and further regulatory changes in 2026, with increasing risk for the advanced computing and AI sectors, as well as significantly increased penalties for exports of even low-tech items to Entity List parties, Russia and embargoed regions.

Recent criminal indictments illustrate the focus on advanced computing, with DOJ charging U.S. citizens and Chinese nationals for illegally exporting advanced chips to China. Moreover, even as the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) rescinded a Biden-era rule regulating the export of AI technologies, it issued guidance emphasizing the need for enhanced due diligence to prevent diversion of advanced chips to China and other restricted destinations, as well as the risks of using certain advanced chips developed or produced in China. BIS continued to move aggressively against companies that exported low-tech items to restricted parties and destinations, imposing significant six-figure penalties with expensive external audit requirements.

BIS also announced an ""Affiliates Rule"" that dramatically expanded U.S. export control restrictions to cover certain non-U.S. entities owned by listed parties. Then, following trade negotiations with China, the Trump Administration suspended implementation of the Affiliates Rule through November 2026. Changes such as the Affiliates Rule, together with dozens of potential changes to U.S. export controls foreshadowed on the Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, highlight the uncertainty of the current regulatory environment and need for companies to prepare for rapid changes in the rules.

Companies should use the pause to conduct proactive compliance assessments to minimize future exposure. More broadly, companies should expect rigorous licensing reviews, expanded due diligence requirements and closer scrutiny of indirect supply chains as BIS prioritizes preventing advanced technology transfers.

ITAR Expansion

In 2026, expect a more aggressive International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) enforcement environment driven by increasing defense trade, recent amendments to the U.S. Munitions List (USML) and the Trump Administration's announced road map for further regulatory changes over the next 12 months.

In September 2025, the U.S. Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) implemented revisions that expand coverage of the USML, signaling a broader jurisdictional reach that will complicate compliance for a wide range of industries. Additional planned rulemaking is anticipated to further expand the USML. Companies should prepare for increased enforcement activity as regulators prioritize supply chain integrity and technology security, making proactive compliance assessments and robust export control programs essential for mitigating risk.

Sanctions

Pressure on Iran

Following the Trump Administration's 2025 directive to restore maximum pressure on Iran, U.S. sanctions enforcement is expected to broaden and deepen throughout 2026. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) will likely continue targeting maritime shipping networks involved in Iranian oil trade, including shadow fleet vessels, management companies and shipping facilitators. Companies engaged in global energy and shipping should anticipate further designations, expanded secondary sanctions risk and heightened compliance obligations as Washington continues to target Iran's oil sector.

Risk in Latin America

Building on the Trump Administration's early designations of cartels and gangs as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs), the U.S. will continue to expand counterterrorism-based sanctions across the Western Hemisphere. Since January 2025, the State Department has designated multiple entities – including six Mexican cartels, two transnational gangs, and criminal groups in Haiti and Ecuador – under counterterrorism authorities, expanding the risks of criminal enforcement and secondary sanctions in the region. Further, in October 2025, OFAC sanctioned Colombian President Gustavo Petro pursuant to its counternarcotics-related authorities. In 2026, expect OFAC to intensify enforcement by continuing to pair counterterrorism and counternarcotics sanctions, targeting leadership networks, front companies and financial facilitators. These actions may introduce material support liability for businesses in logistics, agriculture and trade, while secondary sanctions and aggressive interagency coordination aim to disrupt cartel revenue streams and penalize complicit state actors.

Expanded U.S. Sanctions on Russian Energy Sector

In October 2025, the U.S. imposed full blocking sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia's two largest oil companies, along with numerous Russian subsidiaries, marking a significant escalation in energy-related measures and initiating frantic attempts to sell off the firms' non-Russian assets prior to the end of a limited authorization period. Looking ahead, the trajectory of these sanctions remains uncertain and could shift based on changes in ongoing negotiations to end the Russia-Ukraine war, leaving companies to monitor policy signals and prepare for potential adjustments.

Transportation

Surface Transportation Reauthorization

With the current Surface Transportation Reauthorization bill expiring on Sept. 30, 2026, the long process to draft its replacement is underway, but the road is marred with potholes, and the delays have begun.

The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee (T&I) had long been eyeing December 2025 as a target for producing – and passing – the House's first draft of the legislation. However, in public remarks during the first week of November, House T&I Committee Chair Sam Graves (R-Mo.) pushed back the timeline, targeting early 2026 for a committee markup and spring for the legislation to pass the House. Holland & Knight's research suggests that even these goals are aspirational at best.

On the Senate side, all three committees of jurisdiction – Environment and Public Works (oversees highways), Commerce (oversees rail and freight) and Banking (oversees transit) – completed formal requests for member priorities. The Banking Committee held its traditional informal listening session for committee members. Environment and Public Works has been drafting its bill, but text will most likely not be final until next year, with Committee Chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) saying that she is hoping to mark up the bill before May.

The White House has not formally announced its priorities. In mid-November, it was reported that the administration was seeking to eliminate funding for mass transit from the Highway Trust Fund, a proposal that would catalyze significant opposition. Though this is not the administration's formal proposal, if it is indicative of its efforts, it will represent an additional complication to completion of a bill that can make it through the Senate. Notably, House T&I Committee Chair Graves and Ranking Member Rick Larsen (D-Wash.) ublicly rejected this proposal.

Given upcoming midterm elections, the enormous bipartisan need for infrastructure funding and the near-universal reliance on federal highway dollars (approximately $50 billion annually), there will be a strong push to try to get a comprehensive reauthorization bill completed in 2026 before the November elections. Additionally, as this is Rep. Graves' last term as chair, he has made it clear he is extremely motivated to get the legislation across the finish line.

Air Traffic Control Modernization

In the wake of the January 2025 mid-air collision near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, the Trump Administration has made air traffic control (ATC) modernization a top policy priority. At a Dec. 3, 2025, House Subcommittee on Aviation hearing, some panelists discussed modernization of air traffic systems and emphasized that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) should have the tools it needs to ensure safety and welcome innovation. House members also discussed integration of advanced air mobility (AAM) into existing and new air traffic systems and the use of Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast systems for aircraft.

The FAA has commenced its ATC modernization project using the $12.5 billion in OBBB funding. The OBBB establishes several specific categories for the spending, such as $4.75 billion for telecommunications infrastructure upgrades, $3 billion to replace radar systems, $1.9 billion to construct new air route traffic control centers (ARTCCs), such that ""at least 3 existing ARTCCs are divested and integrated into the newly constructed ARTCC."" Also called for is spending of $100 million to conduct further ARTCC realignment and consolidation, $1 billion to support recapitalization and consolidation of terminal radar approach control facilities, known as TRACONs, and several million dollars to address air traffic controller training, ATC tower upgrades, remote towers and research. The OBBB also requires the FAA to submit quarterly reports to Congress describing its expenditures, beginning Dec. 31, 2025.

The DOT has requested a total budget of $31.5 billion for ATC modernization, which Congress could appropriate through a second budget reconciliation bill or the appropriations process. Congress has expressed skepticism in appropriating any additional funds until the FAA proves it can effectively begin spending the funds it has already received.

To date, the FAA has not selected a main contractor or ""integrator"" to oversee the project, though there are two finalists. The integrator announcement is expected in the first week of December, and both applications were described as worthy of consideration. Holland & Knight is confident that one company will be chosen outright and that the contract will not be split.

Once the prime integrator is selected, the FAA plans to use an Internal Management Board to make all major decisions related to ATC modernization. The prime integrator will have a seat at the table of the Internal Management Board, but the integrator's role will be to fill gaps that exist at the FAA to assess, recommend and oversee key ATC modernization decisions. The Internal Management Board will have more than a dozen FAA officials, including Acting Chief Technology Officer Rebecca Guy, Program Management Organization Vice President Josh Pepper and Acting Chief Operating Officer Franklin McIntosh.

There will be no formal role for outside stakeholders in the ATC modernization decision-making process. Other stakeholders will have the opportunity to respond to requests for information (RFIs) and requests for proposals (RFPs), and the FAA may seek feedback in public vendor sessions, but all decisions will be made by the FAA Internal Management Board.

Though it is possible the $19 billion appears in the president's budget for FY 2027 (likely published in February 2026) as a mandatory spending or supplemental spending line, ultimately, Congress will decide whether and how much additional funding to provide to the ATC modernization project. Any additional funding for ATC modernization may ltimately be appropriated through the budget reconciliation process while Republicans still control the House, Senate and White House in the 119th Congress.

Autonomous Vehicle National Framework

In 2026, expect additional movement on the deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs), a priority for the Trump Administration. On April 24, 2025, DOT Secretary Duffy unveiled the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) new Automated Vehicle (AV) Framework as part of his transportation innovation agenda. This framework focused on ensuring the safety of AVs on public roads, fostering innovation and enabling commercial deployment.

On Sept. 4, 2025, NHTSA proposed several rulemakings to amend the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), which included FMVSS No. 102, ""Transmission shift position sequence, starter interlock and transmission braking effect,"" No. 103, ""Windshield defrosting and defogging systems"" and No. 104, ""Windshield wiping and washing systems,"" and No. 108, ""Lamps, reflective devices, and associated equipment."" Because this is a priority of Secretary Duffy and the Trump Administration, expect the DOT to continue to propose rulemakings to strengthen the national framework for AVs.

In addition, legislation has begun to move. House lawmakers are advocating for incorporating language that would include regulations for AVs in the Surface Transportation Reauthorization bill. These measures have bipartisan support, beginning with Reps. Bob Latta (R-Ohio) and Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), co-chairs of the Congressional Autonomous Vehicle Caucus and members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The committee is considering a motor vehicle safety title in the Surface Transportation Reauthorization, and Chair Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.) has stated that AV policy will be included in this title.

In 2026, Holland & Knight will pay attention to pending legislation in Congress, including:

AV Safety Data Act (R.4376). Rep. Kevin Mullin's (D-Calif.) AV Safety Data Actpromotes public transparency by requiring consistent reporting on miles traveled by AVs and incidents such as unexpected stops or interference with emergency vehicles. In addition to codifying NHTSA's existing collision data reporting requirements in law, the AV Safety Data Act would require that companies report to NHTSA the number of miles traveled on public roads, AV collisions that result in any injuries to other human drivers, pedestrians or bicyclists, and information on unplanned stoppages and any impacts to law enforcement, first responders or public transit agencies.

AV Accessibility Act (R.4419). Rep. Greg Stanton's (D-Ariz.) and Rep. Brian Mast's (R-Fla.) AV Accessibility Act(AVAA) is designed to help people with disabilities better access the mobility and independence benefits of ride-hail AVs. The AVAA will ensure passengers are legally protected if an AV is pulled over or other issues occur, even if they do not hold a driver's license due to their disability. It also requires the DOT, in collaboration with the National Academies of Science, to study best practices for public transportation infrastructure to be modified to improve the ability of Americans with disabilities to find, access and use ride-hail AVs, including during pickup and drop-off.

AMERICA DRIVES Act (R.4661). Representative Vince Fong's (R-Calif.) AMERICA DRIVES Actseeks to establish national framework for AV trucking by advancing the modernization of the nation's supply chain to accommodate safe and effective growth of commercial automated driving systems (ADS).

Autonomous Vehicle Acceleration Act of 2025 (S.1798). Sen. Cynthia Lummis' (R-Wyo.) Autonomous Vehicle Acceleration Act requires federal agencies to implement recommendations from a landmark 2026 federal report, ""Accelerating the Next Revolution in Roadway Safety,"" on AVs within one year, jumpstarting progress on long-dormant policy objectives. Additionally, the legislation establishes a comprehensive road map for achieving commercially viable Level 4 and Level 5 AVs – advanced self-driving systems that require minimal to no human intervention. The DOT secretary will be tasked with identifying essential needs and regulatory barriers that must be addressed to facilitate widespread deployment.

Emerging Aviation Technologies (EVTOL, Drones, Advanced Runway Safety)

In August, DOT Secretary Duffy unveiled the highly anticipated Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for commercial done operations, Normalizing Unmanned Aircraft Systems Beyond Visual Line of Sight Operations (BVLOS), to further the integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in the national airspace system (NAS). A joint publication of the FAA and U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the NPRM has faced criticism – particularly regarding TSA's proposed security provisions, which many view as overly burdensome and lacking clarity. The period for public comment closed on Oct. 6, 2025. The 3,000-plus comments posted to the docket reflected widespread engagement and concern among industry and the broader public. It is clear that both commercial and private interests believe that if finalized as written, the rule would imperil the industry. Some go as far as to call the rule an ""industry killer.""

The FAA has acknowledged that the proposed rule has numerous flaws that need to be addressed before final publication, though it is unclear how that will impact the timeline. FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford appears committed to publication in 2026, rather than allowing the process to slip into 2027. Holland & Knight will track these rulemakings closely next year.

Efforts to develop and integrate Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) concepts, which Congress has defined as a transportation system ""comprised of urban air mobility and regional air mobility using manned or unmanned aircraft,"" will also continue to move forward at an increased pace in 2026. In a June 6, 2025, EO titled ""Unleashing American Drone Dominance,"" the president required the DOT secretary, acting through the FAA administrator and in coordination with the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), to establish an electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) Integration Pilot Program as an extension of the FAA's existing BEYOND Program. As an extension of the FAA's BEYOND Program, which Congress developed from the FAA's UAS Integration Pilot Program in 2020, the EO anticipates the FAA administrator issuing waivers of certain statutory requirements and related regulations under a BEYOND program agreement.

The eVTOL Integration Pilot Program will consist of state, local, Tribal or territorial governments agreeing with the FAA to function as lead participants along with partners such as manufacturers, operators or developers of vertiports. The FAA will select at least five lead participants and track data from them to inform future FAA regulatory updates. The DOT secretary is expected to submit an initial implementation report to the president through the OSTP director of during the first half of 2026.

Discussions of counter UAS (cUAS) authority have drawn increased attention in the context of NDAA passage and the upcoming 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics. In late August 2025, Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.) introduced a bill to reauthorize and expand the federal government's counter-drone authorities. Referred to House T&I, the bill passed out of committee by a 60-0 vote in October. Holland & Knight is closely tracking possible floor action before the end of this Congress.

The NDAA includes several cUAS provisions, and manufacturing language could prove relevant for civil drone manufacturers. In addition, there is an ongoing fight between Congress and the White House on further expansion of cUAS authorities in the NDAA ahead of the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics. A final vote on the NDAA is expected before the end of this session.

Furthermore, the White House in November 2025 announced a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for the cUAS Grant Program, authorized under the OBBB. The program provides $500 million across FY 2026 and FY 2027 to enhance state and local capabilities to detect, identify, track or monitor UAS. Applications are due Dec. 5, 2025.

Maritime

The administration has made it a priority to increase focus on the maritime industry, outlined in EO 14269 issued April 9, 2025, titled ""Restoring America's Maritime Dominance."" This EO called for a comprehensive approach to increase and stabilize federal funding, improve the competitiveness of U.S.-flagged and U.S.-built vessels, improve the domestic workforce and rebuild the U.S. maritime industrial base.

The Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) is just ;one sphere where this reinvigorated focus on maritime is coming to fruition. In September 2025, the administration nominated two new commissioners, Robert Harvey and Laura DiBella, to the FMC to help execute these efforts. These nominations were sent to the Senate and await approval. If confirmed in 2026, DiBella and Harvey would fill the FMC's two remaining vacancies, bringing the FMC to its full capacity of five commissioners for the first time since Commissioner Carl Bentzel's December 2024 departure. These nominations come in the wake of the FMC's sweeping reforms following the enactment of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022 (OSRA 2022). Looking ahead, the FMC is poised to issue decisions on major investigations into Maritime Chokepoints and Flags of Convenience, as well as advance rulemakings pursuant to OSRA 2022 directives.

SHIPS Act

In April 2025, Sens. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.), as well as Reps. John Garamendi (D-Calif.) and Trent Kelly (R-Miss.), led a bipartisan and bicameral group of lawmakers in introducing the Shipbuilding and Harbor Infrastructure for Prosperity and Security for America (SHIPS) Act of 2025. The bill includes provisions to modernize cargo preference requirements, enhance sealift capability and address foreign shipping practices while introducing tax credits for vessel and shipyard investments and streamlining regulatory processes. The sponsors describe the legislation as a comprehensive approach to revitalizing the U.S. Merchant Marine and maritime industrial base.

The bill is a reintroduction of the SHIPS Act of 2024, a similarly bipartisan and bicameral effort. The 2025 version incorporates language from EO 14269. In addition to garnering support from the Administration, in September, five U.S. unions sent a letter to Congress urging members to pass the bill. Though steps to move this legislation may be complicated by the current animosity between Sen. Kelly and the administration, the strong bipartisan support and emphasis of the White House on maritime efforts mean that progress may be made. Holland & Knight will track this legislation closely throughout the second half of the 119th Congress.

FMC Enforcement

The FMC is expected to increase enforcement actions under OSRA 2022, focusing on detention and demurrage billing practices and carrier compliance with transparency requirements. Anticipated rulemaking will expand reporting obligations for vessel-operating common carriers and non-vessel operators, including stricter timelines for dispute resolution and enhanced data-sharing mandates. FMC investigations are likely to target systemic violations tied to cargo delays and discriminatory service practices, with civil penalties increasing to deter noncompliance. Shippers and carriers should prepare for audit activity, new compliance benchmarks for billing accuracy and potential legislative proposals aimed at strengthening FMC authority over supply chain resilience and port infrastructure modernization.

Port Fee Pause

In November 2025, USTR announced a one-year suspension of certain port services fees tied to a Section 301 action against China-linked vessels and foreign-built vehicle carriers calling at U.S. ports. The suspension covers fees that would otherwise have been applicable during the exclusion period and reflects USTR's effort to ease compliance burdens amid ongoing trade negotiations. Though the measure offers immediate relief, companies should monitor USTR announcements for any updates on duration or reinstatement as future adjustments could impact operational costs and customs planning. Importers should review documentation processes to ensure accurate application of the suspension and prepare contingency plans for potential regulatory or policy changes.

FOCI Mitigation Expansion

In May 2024, the DOW issued Instruction 5205.87, ""Mitigating Risks Related to Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI) for Covered DoD Contractors and Subcontractors,"" reflecting a new mandate to extend FOCI assessments and potential mitigation measures to companies performing certain unclassified defense contracts. Expected in 2026, further regulations implementing this policy will significantly broaden obligations for contractors by requiring disclosure of FOCI in connection with covered defense contracts. The rule aims to enhance national security by mandating more detailed reporting on beneficial ownership structures and foreign affiliations, with potential implications for eligibility determinations and contract awards. Companies should anticipate stricter compliance reviews and prepare to implement robust due diligence processes to identify and mitigate FOCI risks early in the procurement cycle.

CFIUS and Outbound Investment

U.S. foreign investment controls will likely tighten further as the administration leverages the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and outbound screening to address national security risks tied to China-affiliated investors. Expect expanded restrictions on inbound investments in technology, critical infrastructure, healthcare and energy alongside continued development of the promised ""fast-track"" process for trusted investors, which remains pending as of late 2025. Recent high-profile cases – such as TikTok's mandated divestiture and the Nippon Steel/U.S. Steel transaction – signal a trend toward creative mitigation measures, including golden shares and mandatory U.S.-based joint ventures. Outbound investment rules, implemented in early 2025, may broaden to cover additional sectors such as hypersonics and directed energy, as well as additional types of investment vehicles, requiring rigorous diligence and compliance planning for U.S. firms engaged in global investment transactions.

Federal Communications Commission (FCC)

Ongoing Deregulatory Agenda: The FCC is expected to continue its broad deregulatory approach across communications sectors.

Media Ownership Rules: Significant relaxation of existing broadcast radio and television ownership restrictions is anticipated, likely spurring renewed transactions and industry consolidation.

Letter to BlackRock | Letter to Blackstone

Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ranking Member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, Bernie Sanders (D-VT), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) sent letters to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman raising concerns about the effects their acquisitions of publicly traded utility companies could have on electricity costs for American families.

The Senators wrote: “According to the International Energy Agency, data center electricity demand worldwide will increase by 130% by 2030. Bloomberg recently found that electricity now costs up to 267% more each month than it did in 2020 in areas located near large data centers. Since President Trump took office ten months ago, household electricity costs are already up 11%.”

“Investors have typically viewed utility companies as reliable investments with a guaranteed rate of return,” wrote the lawmakers. “But now, amidst rapidly rising energy use from AI data centers and other strains on the grid, Wall Street investors and private equity firms appear to be taking advantage of utilities’ regulated-monopoly status to rake in excess profits.”

The Senators highlighted concerns by communities regarding Blackstone’s announcement to acquire publicly traded TXNM Energy, which provides electricity to about 800,000 households in New Mexico and Texas: “As community organizers have already noted, ‘private equity’s control of the state’s power grid threatens affordability, accountability, and the state’s transition to a clean energy future.’ Additionally, the Center for Biological Diversity, a national conservation organization, noted in their opposition to the acquisition that Blackstone’s FERC application fails to discuss the anti-competitive effects on customers as a result of the company owning both data centers and electric utility companies.”

The lawmakers also cited the former Republican Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), Mark Christie, who warned that “a public utility has public service obligations; it is not just another company seeking to maximize returns to its shareholders. Many have been granted monopoly franchises by state governments in return for serving the public within their territories. One threat is that asset managers, like BlackRock, will use their ownership of competing assets to exert market power in wholesale energy, capacity, and ancillary services markets.”

The Senators concluded by requesting answers to their questions on the companies’ acquisition of publicly traded utilities no later than December 18, 2025.

The price of natural gas futures has topped $5 per million British thermal units (Btu) for the first time since 2022. But Expand and the industry are in a much different place than they were three years ago. That boom was followed by a periodic bust and gas prices stuck near $2 for an extended time.

Three years ago, Expand Energy had yet to be formed out of the 2024 merger of Chesapeake Energy and Southwestern Energy. The merger created the largest natural gas producer in the U.S.

Consolidation and the scars from multiple busts, including Chesapeake's 2020 bankruptcy, have produced a more mature and conservative industry that's much less likely to get carried away during good times. That suggests the good times could run for a while.

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports and increasing power consumption led by artificial intelligence data centers are fueling demand.

Expand did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.

Expand Energy Stock: 'Real Discipline'

""The industry has shown real discipline,"" KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Tim Rezvan told Investor's Business Daily. ""If all the producers are in growth mode, you're going to flood the physical market and hurt prices.""

The markets were oversupplied in 2024 following an unusually mild winter. In response, Chesapeake, Southwestern and some other large producers cut production outright. Previously, the industry maintained existing levels and merely suspended output expansions amid downturns, Rezvan said.

Expand Chief Operating Officer Josh Viets told a Stephens investment conference on Nov. 20 that the company would take a similar approach in 2026 if winter turns balmy and natural gas prices fall below $3.

Back in 2024, he said, ""we continued to drill wells,"" but left the wells uncompleted. Coming into a more constructive 2025, Expand had roughly 70 wells and around 1 billion cubic feet per day of productive capacity waiting to be turned on.

Inflection Point

Expand is ""creating the capacity to grow if the commodity price environment is amenable,"" Rezvan said. ""Everyone's been waiting, and it feels like 2026 is the start of this sort of golden age of natural gas where you have just really strong demand trends.""

Major support will come from the launch of new liquefied natural gas terminals. These will convert natural gas into its liquefied form for export.

""Obviously, winter weather — how that plays out — will be important to create an initial view on how tight the market gets next year,"" Viets, the COO, told investors. ""But the fact that you can't ignore is that year-over-year, 2025 to 2026, we expect 4 billion cubic feet a day of incremental demand from LNG.""

Rezvan says that the buildout of AI data centers and other industrial reshoring are exciting longer-term opportunities.

""But what is happening right now is we are at an inflection in LNG exports, and that should benefit the large, high-quality, strong balance-sheet producers,"" he said.

Growing LNG Capacity

Expand's third-quarter earnings presentation indicates that LNG capacity of 6.2 billion cubic feet per day will come online over the course of 2026. That will raise the total to just over 21 billion cubic feet per day. The company expects an additional 10.5 billion cubic feet of capacity to come online from 2027 to 2029.

By comparison, domestic consumption of natural gas stood at 80.9 billion cubic feet per day in September, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy for banking outfit ING, wrote in a Nov. 17 report that U.S. natural gas demand could rise by as much as 20 billion cubic feet per day by 2030. However, Patterson expects the global LNG market to face a large surplus toward the end of the decade. So, U.S. LNG facilities may not operate at full capacity.

Rezvan notes that President Donald Trump's trade negotiations have given major foreign trade partners a big reason to import their LNG from the U.S.

Expand Energy Profile

Expand has provided an outlook for an average of 7.5 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas production in 2026, up from an estimated 7.15 billion cubic feet in 2025. Of this year's output, 42% is expected to come from the Haynesville basin in Louisiana. The balances includes 36% from Northwest Appalachia (Pennsylvania) and 22% from Southwest Appalachia (Ohio and West Virginia).

The breadth of Expand's Haynesville operations resulting from the 2024 merger make it well positioned to serve LNG demand. William Blair analyst Neal Dingmann noted that more than 12 billion cubic feet per day of LNG capacity is under construction within 300 miles.

The merger ""resulted in a geographically diverse core gas portfolio with access to upcoming data centers and LNG trains and continued cost reductions and operational efficiencies,"" Dingmann wrote in a report.

Expand said in its Oct. 28 third-quarter report that it had lowered its break-even cost for Haynesville production to less than $2.75 per million Btu. This reflects its ""best-in-basin"" productivity and capital expenditures.

The company expects the merger to deliver $600 million in cost savings in 2026. That's up from an initial outlook of $400 million. The savings helped Expand pay down $1.2 billion in debt while returning $850 million to shareholders this year.

Expand Energy Stock

Expand also announced a 15-year supply deal for a new facility built by Lake Charles Methanol in Louisiana. The agreement provides Expand with a pricing premium above New York Mercantile Exchange pricing.

""We expect the Lake Charles Methanol contract to be one of many long-term transactions that will leverage the company's scale, extensive inventory and increased capabilities post-merger,"" Dingmann wrote.

Expand stock was flat on Thursday a day after rising 4.4% to 122.89. On Wednesday, shares reclaimed a 120.30 buy point from a cup-with-handle base, according to MarketSurge pattern recognition.

Women whose hepatitis B status is negative or unknown should talk with their doctors about vaccination, the recommendation says.","The Trump administration has started the process of dramatically easing fuel economy requirements for new vehicles, part of the administration's broader pivot away from cleaner cars.

At the White House on Wednesday, surrounded by the executives from several major car companies, President Donald Trump said the move would save consumers money by making cars cheaper.

""We're officially terminating Joe Biden's ridiculously burdensome — horrible, actually — CAFE standards that impose expensive restrictions,"" Trump said, referring to the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules, often called CAFE standards. ""And all sorts of problems, all sorts of problems for automakers.""

Previous research from Consumer Reports has challenged the argument that regulations make cars more expensive. Stringent fuel economy standards also carry an economic benefit in the form of lower fuel costs over time.

CAFE standards require that the entire fleet of vehicles sold by a given automaker, on average, get more fuel-efficient over time. Automakers who fall short have previously needed to either pay hefty fines, or buy credits from a company that over-performs on efficiency, like Tesla and other all-electric automakers.

The Trump administration has already defanged the existing CAFE standards by eliminating the fines associated with them, as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Under Former President Joe Biden, the rules called for vehicles to get 2% more efficient every year; the Trump administration is now proposing to revert to the 2022 baseline and increase by .5% annually.

The proposed change now enters a period of public comment; the Department of Transportation will collect input from companies and citizens before finalizing the rule.

The administration has already been working to roll back tailpipe standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency, which are designed to cut pollution from vehicles. The two sets of rules have overlapping effects, with both of them pushing automakers toward cleaner vehicles.

Meanwhile, during the second Trump presidency Congress has also eliminated the consumer tax credit for purchasing electric vehicles, decided to end a tax credit for installing an EV charger in June 2026, earlier than planned, and voted to strike down federal waivers that let California require automakers to build zero-emission vehicles. The Trump administration also temporarily delayed a program to use federal money to build a high-speed EV charger network.

The policy shift was no surprise. Trump campaigned against what he called the ""electric vehicle mandate,"" and promised to rescind policies — including fuel economy standards — that encouraged or incentivized EVs.

Trump has framed the policy rollback as a gift to the auto industry. And that's partially true: Large trucks and SUVs may be inefficient, but they're popular and profitable, and selling more of them without any penalty is a financial boon to automakers. In earnings calls this fall, multiple executives noted that the regulatory rollback will boost earnings and help offset the cost of tariffs.

Electric vehicle adoption in the U.S. has moved slower than automakers had expected. Some automakers have said made some of the Biden-era policies not just challenging but unworkable.

In a statement provided by the White House, Ford CEO Jim Farley praised ""President Trump's leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities.""

But automakers are also navigating a changing global market, with many countries continuing to prioritize climate action. The popularity of high-quality, affordable Chinese EVs has raised questions about whether legacy automakers can compete. So Farley's statement also promised that ""We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability.""

For companies, which need to plan their future vehicle lineups years in advance, it's challenging when rules whipsaw back and forth with each change in administration. That's been the reality for years now: The Obama administration set ambitious fuel economy rules, which Trump 1.0 reversed, Biden reinstated, and now Trump 2.0 is seeking to ""reset.""

Farley obliquely noted that risk in a conversation with investors in October. He explained why Ford was continuing to move ahead with plans for an affordable electric pickup, despite regulations shifting to no longer support EVs. ""We expect adoption will increase over time and the market continue to evolve,"" Farley said. ""And maybe the regulations evolve.""

In a historic vote, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisers recommended narrowing the agency's hepatitis B immunization guidance for newborns.

The result, if approved by the CDC's acting director, will be a rollback of a universal recommendation to start hepatitis B immunization at birth, a standard practice in the U.S. for more than 30 years that has been credited with dramatically lowering liver diseases caused by the virus.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, voted 8-3 to recommend hepatitis B at birth only for infants born to women who test positive for the virus that attacks the liver. Women whose hepatitis B status is negative or unknown should talk with their doctors about vaccination, the recommendation says.

The changes were made over the strong objections of liaisons from the medical community, who say the decades-long universal birth dose policy has dramatically reduced cases of hepatitis B in U.S. children.

""Our question is why? Why is there pressure today to change something that has been working, due to safety concerns that may be more theoretical than real?"" asked Dr. Grant Paulsen during Thursday's meeting. He was representing the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society.

There was a second vote regarding the number of shots babies get. Full immunization of infants involves three shots: usually one given at birth, a second shot one to three months later and a third at six to 15 months of age.

The panel voted 6-4, with one member abstaining, to recommend testing children's antibody levels after each hepatitis B shot to determine whether additional shots are needed. The result may be that some children get one or two shots instead of the standard three shots.

Dr. Adam Langer, a CDC official in charge of the agency's center that includes hepatitis prevention, said during the panel's discussion that clinical studies of approved hepatitis B vaccines tested a three-shot regimen. Stopping at one or two shots based on antibody testing would be making an assumption about efficacy that isn't supported by existing data, he said.

The split vote on removing the recommendation for the universal vaccine reflects disagreement among the members. Several members who served on a subgroup that has been reviewing the topic led the votes in favor of the change.

The committee voting this week was hand selected by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long questioned many vaccines. Several of the voting members themselves have a history of questioning the safety of long-used vaccines.

Retsef Levi, a voting member and professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, heralded the move as ""a fundamental change in the approach to this vaccine,"" which would encourage parents to ""carefully think about whether they want to take the risk of giving another vaccine to their child."" Levi said parents may want to delay the vaccine for years. ""That's going to be up to them and their physicians,"" he said.

A handful of members raised concerns over the lack of evidence supporting the change and concerns it will put children at risk.

""We know vaccines are safe,"" said Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine and the only current member who has served on the committee in previous years. ""The hepatitis B vaccine recommendation is very well established. We know it is safe, and we know it is very effective, and to make the changes that are being proposed, we will see more children and adolescents and adults infected with hepatitis B.""

Meissner added that he saw clear evidence of the benefits of the universal hepatitis B birth dose, but not the harms. When he registered his ""no"" vote, he stated, ""Do no harm is a moral imperative. We are doing harm by changing this wording.""

The previous recommendation to vaccinate all healthy newborns against hepatitis B was designed to make sure no at-risk infant falls through the cracks. Hepatitis B can be transmitted from mothers to infants during childbirth, but can also be spread through contact with an infected person's body fluids including saliva and blood.

Immunization in infancy confers lifelong protection against the hepatitis B virus, which can cause serious, potentially fatal health problems including liver cancer and cirrhosis. It is the cornerstone of a decades-long strategy to eliminate hepatitis B in the U.S.

A few weeks ago, Taelyr Vecchione vented her growing frustration with traffic in San Diego.

""Do you remember when traffic started at, like, 5?"" she said in this video posted on TikTok. Vecchione filmed herself sitting in her car, lamenting how things in her Southern California hometown have changed.

""Now,"" she says, ""there is always traffic. Always!""

In fact, there is data to back her up on this. San Diego has seen a significant jump in traffic delays, researchers say, as congestion across the U.S. climbed to record levels in 2024.

If it seems like traffic is getting worse where you live, that's because it probably is. After dropping during the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers say, congestion has equaled — and, in many places, surpassed — pre-pandemic levels. And those delays are spreading to more times of day and more days of the week.

""We are back. But the delay kind of has a different feel to it than it did before,"" said David Schrank, a senior research scientist at the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, which has tracked congestion since the 1980s in its annual Urban Mobility Report.

For decades, Schrank says, those patterns barely budged. Then came 2020, when congestion plunged during the pandemic lockdown. Now it's back at record levels, he says, with the average American spending 63 hours per year stuck in traffic.

There are some other notable differences from past years too. The rush-hour peaks are still the worst times to drive, Schrank says, but there's more congestion at other times of day as well.

""It's spread out over more of the day, and thus it's not just a commuter issue,"" Schrank said in an NPR interview. ""Everyone is experiencing more of that delay.""

Those aren't the only changes researchers are seeing in the data. Schrank says there's more delay on weekends. Traffic on Mondays tends to be noticeably lighter than on the other weekdays, he said, while Thursday has nearly caught up with Friday as the heaviest traffic day of the week.

""There's more variability day to day than there was pre-pandemic. The day of the week matters, and the time of the day matters,"" Schrank said.

Trucks are causing more congestion as well, according to the Texas A&M report. While some truck traffic shifted toward off-peak hours during 2020 and 2021, the most recent data shows that truck-related delays during rush hour are climbing back toward their pre-pandemic level.

Schrank and his colleagues ranked every metropolitan area in the U.S. by hours of traffic delay. San Diego saw the largest percentage jump in hours of delay per commuter since 2019, at more than 37%. Miami, Phoenix and the San Francisco Bay Area saw significant jumps too.

But no city caught up to Greater Los Angeles, where the average commuter lost 137 hours to delays last year, according to the Texas A&M report.

That came as no great surprise to Michael Manville, a professor of urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles. He warns against reading too much into the individual city rankings but says the overall findings make sense.

""Congestion moves largely in sync with broader patterns in regional economies. And so if you have the economy doing well, congestion tends to be worse. If you have a recession, it tends to be a little bit better,"" Manville said.

Researchers at Texas A&M also identified a few regions where congestion is down compared with before the pandemic — most notably, Washington, D.C. That could be linked to the persistence of remote work in the federal government in 2024. And it might also have something to do with regional efforts to fight congestion, including a tolling strategy known as dynamic pricing.

""If you're going to contribute to the excessive congestion during the peak and the evening rush hours perhaps, you're going to be paying more for the tolls,"" said Robert Puentes, a vice president and transportation expert at the Brookings Institution.

Puentes lives in Northern Virginia, which has adopted an extensive system of tolls on major highways that charge different prices at different times. And he says that this seems to help reduce congestion.

""It's something that really could be applicable in other metropolitan areas. We see places in Texas and California, in other places, that are using it. I think it has a real future in this country,"" Puentes said.

Another ambitious effort to fight congestion is happening in New York City, where car drivers now pay as much as $9 to enter Lower Manhattan.

That congestion pricing plan has already cut traffic in the toll zone since its launch in January. But it's still too early to say how much it's changing commuting patterns across the region.

It's one of the most anticipated events ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

On Friday, FIFA will conduct the draw for the top men's soccer tournament, taking place across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The draw — at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. — will determine which opponents all 48 teams participating in the World Cup will eventually face in the initial group stage.

The draw will be attended by the three leaders of the countries hosting the event, including President Trump, in an event that has become quite the spectacle over the years.

Here's what to know about the draw for the World Cup, with the ceremony set to kick off at 9 a.m. PT.

What is the draw for?

Next year's tournament is the biggest ever, with 48 teams set to be split among 12 groups of four.

These groups make up the first stage of the tournament, which determines which teams advance to the knockout rounds. The top two sides of each group automatically qualify, along with the eight best third-place teams.

Not all teams that will take part in the 2026 World Cup are known, though. So far, 42 countries have qualified, with the remaining six — including Italy — set to compete in playoffs next March to determine the final list of participants.

How will the teams be drawn?

Ahead of the draw, all teams have been placed in four pots, primarily based on their most recent FIFA rankings.

Pot 1 will include top-ranked teams such as Spain and Brazil, along with the three hosts. Pot 4 will include the lowest-ranked teams, including World Cup debutants Cape Verde, Curaçao and Jordan, as well as placeholders for the six teams that have yet to qualify.

Teams will be drawn randomly from each pot — but there are a few rules.

There can be only up to two European teams per group and only one team per group from each of the remaining five continental confederations under FIFA. That means, for example, that an African team such as Tunisia cannot be drawn into the same group as Ghana, even if they are in two separate pots.

In addition, in a quirk for this year's tournament, FIFA has determined that the top two-ranked teams — Spain and Argentina — will be placed in groups that would end up on opposite sides of the tournament bracket should they each win their respective groups. That ensures these two early favorites would not meet until the final.

The same rule will apply to France and England, the third- and fourth-best ranked teams according to FIFA.

When will we know where teams will play?

In another quirk, teams will not know at Friday's draw where or when they will play. The locations and kickoff times for each team across all 16 host cities will be determined on Saturday, at a separate event.

FIFA has said it wants to try to take travel times for teams in mind, while also ensuring that teams are drawn into kickoff times that are more favorable for spectators in their respective countries. For example, evening start times would likely be better for Asian sides, ensuring games are taking place when it's roughly the following day for spectators back home.

Does this all matter?

The draw helps determine how easy — or difficult — the path to the knockout rounds will be for most teams.

Just like in any tournament, all teams would prefer to face the ones they view as weaker and avoid being placed in the ""Group of Death,"" the moniker given to the group perceived to be the most difficult in a tournament.

""You don't want to be one of these heroes — like, 'give me the best,'"" says Herculez Gomez, who played for the U.S. in the 2010 World Cup and now hosts the Men in Blazers podcast Vamos. ""That's not how it works. Even the best don't want the best at the World Cup.""

But World Cups are unpredictable. Strong soccer powerhouses have failed to advance past the World Cup's group stage before, including Germany in 2018 and 2022, and Spain in 2014.

That said, this year's tournament is bigger. Even finishing third in a four-team group can ensure qualification, although where each team ends up within its group will determine its path through the knockout rounds.

Which are the early favorites and the teams to watch?

Predictably, among the early favorites are recent global soccer powerhouses such as Spain, England and France, along with South American teams, such as Argentina and Brazil.

But there will be interesting storylines to watch outside the favorites, including Curaçao, which became the smallest country to qualify for the World Cup, with a population of just over 150,000 people.

And, of course, there will be enormous interest in which teams the three hosts will end up facing in their respective groups.

The U.S. men's national team, for example, is approaching the World Cup draw with some momentum after staying undefeated in the past five games. Its most recent record marks a big improvement after a rocky period under coach Mauricio Pochettino and previous coach Gregg Berhalter, which included an early exit from last year's Copa America regional tournament.

Despite watching one after another of his state’s tech titans head to the White House to seek President Donald Trump’s favor, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday he doesn’t begrudge the industry’s rightward swing — mostly.

“It’s very situational with a lot of these guys,” he said when asked about tech businessmen going to “the other side.” “They are and they aren’t. … I don’t see it as as big a shift as perhaps others do.”

His comments at a New York Times finance summit underscored the governor’s balancing act with the tech industry, even as his relationship with its major businesses has been strained by Trump this year. Though he has excoriated law firms and universities for “selling out” to Trump administration demands this year — even threatening to pull state funding from California universities that sign certain agreements with the president — Newsom has walked a finer line when it comes to tech.

“I think it’s a little bit more, I don’t want to say the word transactional, but it’s fiduciary,” he said of tech leaders’ decisions to curry favor with Trump.

Newsom, who was San Francisco mayor in the 2000s, has long been close with tech leaders. As governor, he counts on the industry’s outsized gains to keep a massive state budget balanced. As a possible 2028 presidential contender, he could find Silicon Valley’s deep-pocketed donors helpful.

The relationship has made Newsom a reliable politician in the industry’s corner as lawmakers in his own party increasingly push for regulations on social media and its effects on children, data centers’ use of environmental resources and artificial intelligence’s proliferation into workplaces, adolescent relationships and daily life.

While Newsom has signed some of those bills, particularly ones in which advocates negotiated with tech companies, he’s also vetoed several out of concern that overregulating a nascent industry would drive it out of state. And he’s vehemently opposing a proposed wealth tax that would undoubtedly touch tech executives.

Tech titans cozy up to Trump

That’s been the case this year despite Silicon Valley’s increasing coziness with Trump, whom Newsom has criticized for threatening industries with tariffs to extract concessions and demanding loyalty from private business executives. The relationship has affected California in a number of ways, from Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s aggressive pursuit of federal firings and cost-cuttings earlier this year to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff’s suggestion that Trump send the National Guard to San Francisco, precipitating a nervous few days in October as the president moved to start immigration raids there. Benioff later walked back his statements and Trump said he relented after talking with him and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.

Peter Leroe-Muñoz, a senior vice president at the industry group Bay Area Council, praised Newsom for nevertheless understanding “the value of the innovation our member companies produce.”

“While the governor may not always agree with innovation companies and how they choose to operate or conduct themselves, at the end of the day the governor recognizes that we all have a stake in the success of California and so not cutting off ties or undermining those industry players is in the long term success of the Golden State,” Leroe-Muñoz said last month.

There needs to be levels of ethics that are demanded of these leaders.

— Gov. Gavin Newsom, referring to tech leaders who make deals with Trump

Still, Newsom offered some criticism of the industry’s relationship with Trump on Wednesday, calling it “self-dealing” that the president’s AI and crypto czar David Sacks, along with many other investors and chipmakers, have reportedly been in line to profit from Trump’s AI directives.

“There needs to be levels of ethics that are demanded of these leaders,” he said. “That entire ecosystem has benefited from it. California has benefited from it. But I do not think it’s healthy for capitalism.”

And he called Apple CEO Tim Cook’s ability to strike a deal with Trump to get tariff exemptions for critical parts of the iPhone supply chain “by definition, crony capitalism.”

“How about the farmers and ranchers in California, how about all the small businesses that can’t pick up the phone and get an exemption on their tariffs?” Newsom said. “It breaks my heart.”

But he acknowledged Cook was serving his shareholders: “Do I begrudge that? Yes. Do I begrudge him? Not as much.”

You cannot buy experience.” Tarasova is hopeful that NOAA climate research will continue, to enable the international carbon monitoring program to make a more orderly transition to a future less reliant on NOAA.","This fall, when the World Meteorological Organization confirmed the grim news—a record 3.5 parts per million annual increase in the global concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere—there was a somber, unspoken backstory.

As the WMO compiled the numbers, it was preparing for the possibility that the central player in that monitoring effort—the United States—could withdraw at any time.

Just weeks after President Donald Trump returned to office in January, the White House budget office circulated a memo outlining its plan for an unprecedented cut to funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with climate research taking one of the biggest hits. The president’s budget proposal, released in May, gave details: a 30 percent slash in agency funding, including the elimination of its research office and Global Monitoring Laboratory. Under that plan, the historic observatory on Mauna Loa Volcano in Hawaii, which in 1958 launched the measurements that charted the definitive record of the Earth’s build-up of carbon dioxide, would be gone.

“That was a shock for us,” said Oksana Tarasova, senior scientific officer for the WMO in Geneva. “Given the leading role of NOAA and given that they are the backbone of what we [have been doing], nobody can imagine that this may happen.”

The funding deal Congress passed and the president signed in November to end the nation’s longest government shutdown gave NOAA’s climate program at least a temporary reprieve. NOAA’s funding, like that of the majority of federal agencies, is supposed to continue for the time being at the level Congress approved for the prior fiscal year. But a cloud of uncertainty hangs over the program, both because of questions over how the Trump administration intends to carry out that directive and over what will happen in future budgets.

That puts the global scientific community in a difficult position. Although observations from 179 stations go into calculating the global average CO2 concentration, NOAA provides 40 percent of the observations—not just from Mauna Loa, but from stations across the continental United States, as far north as Utqiaġvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska, and at the U.S. observatory at the South Pole in Antarctica. NOAA also has been in charge of quality control, running calibration tests at its Global Monitoring Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, to ensure that equipment used around the world provides measurements that are accurate, comparable and repeatable.

It is largely thanks to NOAA’s scientific work that the WMO was able to say with confidence that the atmosphere’s global average CO2 concentration in 2024—423.9 parts per million (ppm)—was 3.5 ppm higher than in 2023, the largest annual increase since modern measurements started in 1958. (NOAA’s own results showing the same trend, which came out in April, were included in the WMO average announced Oct. 15.) The readings pointed to the likely reason for the jump—the world’s forests had lost some capability to sponge up CO2 from the atmosphere, due to severe drought and fires in the Amazon and southern Africa in 2024, the WMO said in its report.

Only future measurements will tell whether that loss was a blip or a shift into a new trajectory. But to ensure those measurements will be recorded, the global scientific community is planning for a future of long-term carbon measurement with less reliance on NOAA. That means a reduced role for the United States in the science that it pioneered.

“The Young Man With the Machine”

The Mauna Loa Observatory was established in the 1950s by two U.S. giants in meteorology. Robert Simpson, the first director of what was then called the National Hurricane Research Project, saw the remote location two miles above the Pacific Ocean as “an ideal natural laboratory for geophysical and atmospheric research,” he would later write. Simpson, who went on to co-develop the well-known 1-to-5 Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity, teamed up on the Mauna Loa idea with Harry Wexler, then chief researcher for the U.S. Weather Bureau, the predecessor to NOAA’s National Weather Service. Wexler, the first scientist to deliberately fly into a hurricane to study it in 1944, is remembered for his later pioneering work on weather satellites.

Early research at Mauna Loa included studies of atmospheric ozone and solar radiation, aided by the high elevation and Hawaii’s clear skies. But a young scientist, Charles David Keeling, brought Wexler the idea that would seal Mauna Loa’s place in scientific history. As a postdoctoral fellow in geochemistry at the California Institute of Technology, Keeling had developed a system for measuring the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere with precision. And Keeling’s work indicated—contrary to most scientific thinking at the time—that continuous monitoring of the atmosphere with the right instruments and at the right location would yield crucial data needed to test the then-nascent science of climate change.

Wexler saw it as an ideal contribution to an international scientific event that the United States was spearheading—the International Geophysical Year. In 1957 and 1958, timed to coincide with the projected peak of the regular cycle of solar flares and sunspots, scientists from 67 nations planned to conduct investigations into an array of Earth and atmospheric phenomena, from glaciers to cosmic rays, from plate tectonics to solar activity. (The event is perhaps best remembered for the launch of the first manmade satellites, with the Soviet Union’s Sputnik beating the United States’ Explorer 1 by four months.) As part of the International Geophysical Year, scientists hoped to measure atmospheric carbon dioxide.

“There was a recognition that the atmosphere had more than just winds and temperatures and humidity, it also had chemistry,” said Ralph Keeling, son of Charles, who followed his father’s footsteps into science and a professorship at a NOAA partner organization, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego.

Before Charles Keeling, no one had ever proposed long-term, continuous monitoring of CO2. Scientists believed the concentration would vary greatly depending on location, with no clear time trend. And a significant equipment upgrade would be needed, an infrared spectrometer, to streamline the laborious process Keeling had been using. Keeling recalled the dubious reaction to his idea from Carl-Gustaf Rossby, then director of the International Meteorological Institute in Stockholm, at an International Geophysical Year planning meeting. “Ah, the young man with the machine,” said Rossby, renowned for his discovery of the planetary waves in the atmosphere now known as Rossby waves.

“He seemed upset at this abrupt new American plan to buy expensive gadgetry to measure CO2,” Keeling wrote in NOAA’s 20th anniversary remembrance of Mauna Loa in 1978.

The first month of CO2 readings at Mauna Loa, in March 1958, showed an average atmospheric CO2 concentration of 315.71 ppm. A little over a decade later, at a symposium on the long-term implications of atmospheric pollution, Keeling was able to show the steady transformation in Earth’s atmosphere. The monthly mean CO2 at Mauna Loa in 1969 was 325.63 ppm, more than 3 percent above the first reading, with a steady up and down wave pattern each year—“a remarkably regular annual pulse,” Keeling wrote—due to plant life in the Northern Hemisphere absorbing CO2 as it greened in spring and summer, then releasing it in fall and winter.

Ralph Keeling, who has called his father’s Keeling Curve “an icon of the human imprint on the planet,” said that the senior Keeling bucked the expectations of his colleagues by continuing to work on monitoring CO2 even after the pattern of increasing concentration was clear. “After several funding cycles, his peers would say, ‘Hey, look, you’ve already shown the CO2 going up,’” Ralph Keeling recalled. “‘You’ve checked that box. Time to move on, right?’”

But Charles Keeling rebuffed that idea, and instead sought to show the value of sustained monitoring. “His work was a role model for the importance of long-term observations: how important they are, and how hard they are to keep going,” Ralph Keeling said. “Now we find ourselves in the midst of this crisis where long-term observations, among other things, are on the chopping block. But their loss is especially damaging because their value derives from their continuity and their brilliant ability to track how things are changing over time.

“If there’s an interruption, you can’t just get back to where you were, you’ve lost it forever,” Ralph Keeling said. “A measurement not made is a measurement never made.”

Charles Keeling fought to keep Mauna Loa’s measurements alive through federal budget cuts in the 1960s, and over the years, the work would receive bipartisan support and international acclaim. The project was adopted by NOAA when President Richard Nixon established the agency in 1970. Mauna Loa contributed the longest available record to the worldwide network of CO2 monitoring, established by the WMO in 1989. Keeling would receive the nation’s highest scientific honor, the National Medal of Science, from President George W. Bush in 2002, three years before his death at age 77.

Mauna Loa measurements did experience a brief pause in 2022, when lava flows buried one mile of the access road and cut electricity to the station. (Mauna Loa happens to be the world’s largest active volcano.) But a far greater upheaval came at the start of Trump’s second term in office.

“38 Mauna Loas in Europe”

Trump’s budget director, Russell Vought, revealed the plan to eliminate NOAA’s Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) and all climate laboratories in a budget preview circulated on Capitol Hill in the spring. He outlined ideas for “a leaner NOAA that focuses on core operational needs, eliminates unnecessary layers of bureaucracy, terminates nonessential grant programs, and ends activities that do not warrant a Federal role.” The memo envisioned a NOAA focused on weather data without collecting climate data. Vought had been an architect of the conservative policy plan Project 2025, and the NOAA proposal echoed it.

“OAR is … the source of much of NOAA’s climate alarmism,” Project 2025 said. “The preponderance of its climate-change research should be disbanded.”

The wide array of businesses, states and academic institutions that have been lobbying to maintain NOAA funding reject Project 2025’s characterization of the agency’s climate work. “It’s factual information, based on observing systems and consistent over time, so trends become obvious,” said Franklin Nutter, who served as president of the Reinsurance Association of America for 34 years before his retirement in November. “The insurance sector views the data and the research related to the data not as alarmist, but as important for our industry as companies look at pricing models, risk assessment models and where they’re writing coverage,” Nutter said in an interview earlier this year.

Nevertheless, Trump’s formal budget proposal, unveiled in May, said that $102.3 million could be saved and 216 positions eliminated by terminating NOAA’s climate laboratories and cooperative institutes, including the Global Monitoring Laboratory, based in Boulder, Colorado, and its observatories at Mauna Loa and two other sites in Hawaii; in Utqiaġvik, Alaska; on American Samoa; and at the South Pole in Antarctica.

The cuts would shave a small fraction of 1 percent from the federal government’s $1.7 trillion discretionary budget. But they would have huge implications for global climate science.

“There are some people who think if we switch off the observations, the problem is gone,” said Werner Kutsch, director general of the WMO’s Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS). “This is, of course, complete rubbish.

“You can switch off the observations in the U.S., but there’s still, I sometimes say, 38 Mauna Loas in Europe,” Kutsch said, referring to the monitoring stations across the continent. “We will continue this record. And we will continue to show that the CO2 increase in the atmosphere is even accelerating. That’s the problem that we see at the moment.”

Now, as Keeling predicted they would, scientists are looking at the long-term CO2 trend to understand what the record increase in 2024 says about where the planet is heading. One reason for the bump was clearly a strong El Niño year—the warm phase of a tropical Pacific Ocean cycle marked by drier vegetation and forest fires. Still, last year’s increase in atmospheric carbon concentration was greater than that in previous El Niño years. Could we be seeing signs of a negative feedback loop in which climate change will be more difficult to manage because of the changes that have already happened?

“That might be the big unknown for the future,” Kutsch said. “Even if we might be able to reduce emissions, we might have already caused so much damage to the natural ecosystems that they are not able to take up as much from the atmosphere as they did in the past.”

In the WMO press release on the data, Tarasova made a plea that was an unmistakable reference to the situation in the United States, by then in the midst of a government shutdown. “Sustained and strengthened greenhouse gas monitoring is critical to understanding these loops,” she said.

Status Quo: Uncertainty

Bipartisan opposition has emerged in Congress to the Trump plan to slash NOAA. Lawmakers balked at the potential economic hits to agency partners, including in Republican strongholds like Oklahoma, Alabama and Florida, from the deep proposed research cuts. The Senate Appropriations Committee voted to maintain NOAA funding, and while the House Appropriations Committee approved a small cut to the agency budget, it included a provision directing NOAA to keep its laboratories and cooperative institutes open, “given their essential role in advancing weather forecasting, climate science, and oceanographic research.”

But Congress never approved those fiscal year 2026 bills. The White House pushed instead for a continuing resolution that would maintain the status quo—fiscal year 2025 funding levels—through fiscal year 2026. After a record 43-day shutdown due to a partisan rift over expiring health care insurance subsidies, Congress agreed to fund much of the government, including most science agencies, on a continuing resolution through Jan. 30, while negotiations on fiscal year 2026 budget bills continue.

However, the status quo means uncertainty for NOAA, especially for climate research. In August, the Office of Management and Budget released a spending plan for NOAA showing that the Trump administration was spending 25 percent less than Congress had appropriated in the fiscal year 2025 budget for climate research. Vought has long sought to challenge the law limiting the president from cancelling, or impounding, funds appropriated by Congress. And advocates for outside groups that rely on NOAA funding say the Trump administration’s view is that a continuing resolution gives it greater leeway on spending.

“I’ve heard this with my own ears from administration folks, I’ve seen it in reporting and I’ve heard it from the Hill,” said Emily Patrolia, founder and chief executive of ESP Advisors, which represents ocean and coastal organizations engaging with the federal government. “The way the administration is interpreting a continuing resolution is that they pretty much have the authority to spend the way they want. And in the absence of Congress passing [fiscal year 2026] regular order appropriations bills, they are going to spend assuming the [fiscal year 2026] president’s budget request is the way they should be spending their money.”

For now, Mauna Loa is operating on a limited basis, as it has been since the 2022 volcanic eruption reduced access, a NOAA spokesman said in an email. Sources familiar with its operations say the station has electricity thanks to solar panels, and NOAA began posting its monthly average Mauna Loa CO2 readings on its website again, after a hiatus during the government shutdown. The NOAA spokesman said all of the other Global Monitoring Laboratory facilities are currently operational. He declined to comment on whether there may be cuts while the continuing resolution is in place.

“It’s NOAA’s longstanding practice not to discuss personnel or internal management matters,” he wrote.

Patrolia said there continues to be “a black hole of information” around the impact of budget-tightening on NOAA, with federal employees unable to talk, Congress lacking information from the executive branch and outside entities, like the institutions that rely on NOAA research grants, being careful not to make waves. “They’re aware of the political environment,” she said. “They’re more likely to get their grants unstuck if they go through an informal, quiet advocacy route.”

In the meantime, there’s no question that NOAA has been diminished. Members of Congress estimate that the agency has lost 2,200 personnel since the start of the year through buyouts, resignations and the elimination of provisional employees

“You Cannot Buy Experience”

For the international climate science community, the uncertainty around NOAA’s future is deeply jarring. Mauna Loa may be the most recognizable symbol of the United States’ leading role in CO2 monitoring, but even more vital to the effort is the less visible work that NOAA does to ensure that all labs worldwide that monitor CO2 use calibrated instruments and produce reliable results.

“NOAA produces the reference standard,” Tarasova said. “If they stop doing that, we don’t have an anchor.”

In addition to high-quality instruments and a well-equipped lab, experienced personnel are needed, with training to ensure continuity, and a continuous effort to improve processes, she said.

“You can’t organize it overnight,” Tarasova said. “You may have some billionaire who wanted to donate this stuff, and then you could build the lab, but you cannot build a lab with 30 years of experience in keeping the standard. You cannot buy experience.”

Tarasova is hopeful that NOAA climate research will continue, to enable the international carbon monitoring program to make a more orderly transition to a future less reliant on NOAA. Discussions with scientists in other countries, including in China, Australia, New Zealand and throughout the European Union, are underway, she said.

“It is really very sad that we come to this through such a frightening experience, when the community is really threatened by losing the value of what has been supported by NOAA,” Tarasova said. “We should have built this redundancy much earlier, just to make sure that the global system does not rely on just one country.”

Some involved in the rethinking of global CO2 monitoring find it unfathomable that the United States would voluntarily step back from its historic role. “If a country is leading scientifically in a specific area, and then you cut the budget out of it, you’re not making America great again. You’re making America weak again,” said Kutsch, of the Integrated Carbon Observation System. “You may like science or not, but of course, there’s a kind of competition in science … And when America drops from the first place to whatever, fifth place? … For me, logically, this is completely not understandable. Why would you give up a leading position?”

The automaker reported sales of 60,244 vehicles for the month, with half of these being electrified models.

Fully electric vehicles (EVs) represented 24% of all Volvo cars sold in November, while plug-in hybrids accounted for 26%. Sales of fully electric models saw a year-over-year increase of 4%, reaching 14,594 units.

“This performance underscores the brand’s momentum in the electrified segment,” said Erik Severinson, CCO. “We are encouraged by the growth in sales of our fully electric cars and accelerated deliveries of the new XC70 long-range plug-in hybrid in China. This continues to expand our position in the rapidly growing electrified segment.”

Severinson also noted that U.S. sales remain soft following the phase-out of EV tax credits.

November’s results indicate that while sales of traditional mild-hybrid and internal combustion models fell 14% year-over-year, electrified models experienced a smaller decline of 5%, buoyed by increasing demand for EVs. Plug-in hybrid sales declined by 12% for the month, but Volvo pointed to strong momentum in China, driven by the XC70 long-range PHEV.

Through the first 11 months of 2025, electrified vehicles accounted for 287,151 of Volvo’s global sales, it said. Fully electric models reached 133,681 units year-to-date, while plug-in hybrids totaled 153,470.

The United States cannot lead the world in energy innovation while allowing Louisiana to wage war on its energy producers.","Coastal erosion legal wars over the consequences of past federal government policy are ultimately pointless and ineffective.

Amid rising geopolitical instability and intensifying competition over energy resources, one of the greatest threats to US energy security is not coming from abroad—but from within. A growing number of states are waging legal wars against the very energy producers that built America’s economic foundation and global strength. From the unexpected energy-producing state of Louisiana, the recent $745 million verdict against Chevron in Plaquemines Parish, among more than forty other similar lawsuits, is a case in point.

One of the lead plaintiffs, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, has portrayed the case as a simple matter of “accountability.” In her telling, Texaco — acquired by Chevron in 2001 —dumped “four billion gallons of toxic wastewater” into marshland for decades. She even chose the unusually progressive language of “profits over people” to describe the activity.

The rhetoric is potent. But it is also profoundly misleading. As someone who has devoted my career to prioritizing a reliance on credible and accurate data for informing sensible energy-related policymaking, I am especially concerned about Attorney General Murrill’s inaccurate statements about the nature of energy production.

The Louisiana Attorney General is Distorting the Facts

First, the so-called “toxic wastewater” was not toxic waste at all. As economist Dr. Benjamin Zycher of the American Enterprise Institute has pointed out, produced water —the briny water extracted alongside oil — is a natural byproduct of hydrocarbon production, and it has been regulated by state and federal permits for decades. It is not legally or scientifically defined as “toxic waste” under Louisiana law, other than by the regulatory agencies in the United States or anywhere else. Nor did the state present quantifiable evidence of harm to health, wildlife, or water quality. Yet, in a recent column, Attorney General Murrill went so far as to suggest that Texaco’s “toxic” discharge was comparable to BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill — one of the most destructive environmental disasters in history.

In fact, Louisiana regulators permitted and required Chevron’s actions. In 1989, a state regulatory official named Kerry St. Pé, a Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality Water Pollution Control Division Regional Coordinator, stated at a legislative hearing, “We currently allow the discharge of produced water to saline and brackish areas.” Per Chevron’s permits, Louisiana’s Office of Coastal Management explicitly mandated that it send the produced water through designated discharge points.

However, this regulatory context was excluded from the trial. At the parish’s request, the judge barred evidence showing Chevron’s compliance. Even the state’s chief enforcement officer couldn’t confirm violations during his testimony. Still, Attorney General Murrill’s narrative paints Chevron as lawbreakers and distorts the reality of state-sanctioned operations.

Moreover, some of the activity in question dates largely to a period when producers were operating under direct federal instruction. During World War II, the United States government ordered energy companies to maximize crude oil output from Louisiana’s fields to supply high-octane aviation fuel for the war effort. The federal government managed pipeline construction, distribution, and storage, and explicitly directed increased production from the Gulf region. To retroactively penalize those federally guided activities under modern state laws is both legally unsound and historically unjustified.

Louisiana’s own State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978 even acknowledged this by grandfathering pre-1980 operations, reflecting the understanding that preexisting federal contracts and permits could not be second-guessed decades later. The Supreme Court’s forthcoming review of the case will hinge on precisely that question of federal jurisdiction.

The Lawsuits Are a Political Project, Not an Environmental One

Despite the plaintiffs’ claims to the contrary, the Louisiana coastal erosion cases are not a model of thoughtful environmental enforcement. They are the product of a sketchy political alliance between state officials and mass-tort trial lawyers who stand to profit from contingency fees on over forty copycat lawsuits now queued across several coastal parishes. These cases have been further motivated by a 2016 civil prosecution agreement in which the Louisiana Attorney General’s office, under current Governor Jeff Landry, promised not to challenge plaintiffs’ theories nor to acknowledge the energy producers’ defenses — this agreement, still in effect today, is an extraordinary abdication of prosecutorial independence.

The result is a litigation-driven political game that scapegoats highly regulated energy producers while allowing underlying factors, like government levee mismanagement, to persist. The US Geological Survey has long identified those factors, not oil production, as the primary drivers of coastal erosion.

The Legal Wars Are Undermining Energy Security

These lawsuits represent a new form of state-level overreach that directly contradicts the federal government’s responsibility to maintain a coherent national energy policy. Although Attorney General Murrill attempts to distance herself from her blue-state counterparts, her approach closely mirrors California’s strategy of suing fossil fuel producers for wildfires whose cause is rooted in decades of forest mismanagement. President Trump’s April 2025 Executive Order on “Protecting American Energy from State Overreach” warned precisely of this danger: “When States subject energy producers to arbitrary or excessive fines through retroactive penalties… American energy suffers.”

This fragmentation undermines the very goal of energy dominance—a policy that unites economic growth, national security, and technological innovation. The same companies now targeted by Louisiana’s governor and state attorney general are the ones driving investment in liquefied natural gas, advanced refining, and carbon capture technologies. Undermining their ability to operate predictably will not make America greener; it will make America and its allies weaker.

Strategic Consequences of a Weak Energy Policy

In an era of intensifying great power competition, that weakness carries global consequences. American energy dominance depends on having experienced companies that have both the reach and the technical capacity to deliver under pressure.

By contrast, politicized lawsuits signal instability. They deter capital investment, delay infrastructure projects, and encourage dependence on foreign suppliers who are often hostile to US interests. Vladimir Putin famously campaigned against hydraulic fracturing; Beijing has leveraged state and local relationships across the United States to steer policy outcomes favorable to China. When subnational lawfare weakens US producers, those adversaries win twice: economically and strategically.

Moving Toward a Coherent National Energy Policy

None of this is to suggest that environmental stewardship is unimportant. Responsible production is essential to maintaining the public trust that underpins the energy sector. But environmental protection must operate within a framework of regulatory clarity, not political opportunism. Litigation that retroactively redefines lawful, federally directed conduct as illegal undermines that framework and endangers both economic stability and national security.

The United States cannot lead the world in energy innovation while allowing Louisiana to wage war on its energy producers. It cannot secure critical minerals, expand LNG exports, and invest in carbon capture while its own domestic firms are dragged through the courts for actions taken generations ago under federal direction.

If America is serious about energy leadership in the 21st century, it must defend the companies that make that leadership possible. These cases are not merely about one parish in Louisiana — they are about whether the United States can still act as one nation in pursuit of energy security.

TRANSCRIPTION:

David Fair: This is 89.1 WEMU, and welcome to another edition of our monthly conversation series, First Friday Focus on the Environment. I'm David Fair, and over this past summer, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy named a new Chief Climate Officer. What an interesting political environment to work in when your job is to work towards greater adaptation and resiliency. It's a world in which my co-host is all too familiar with. Lisa Wozniak is executive director of the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, and do you feel adapted?

Lisa Wozniak: Oh, David, I actually don't! I don't believe it's very natural to settle into a narrative that is dismantling decades of smart, compassionate and critically important public health and environmental protections. But we're not here to talk about me. We're here to talk about what the state is doing in terms of adaptation. And as you mentioned, EGLE has a brand-new leader in the Office of Climate and Energy, and Alessandra Carreon was named to the position over the summer after serving at the Michigan Public Service Commission and is now on the other end of the phone line. So, thank you so much for taking time, Alessandra!

Alessandra Carreon: My pleasure! Happy to be here!

Lisa Wozniak: You've had a few months to settle into this job. And to start on an optimistic note, what is the most promising climate work already underway in Michigan right now?

Alessandra Carreon: I'm glad we're starting on a promising note! Frankly, despite the changes at the federal level, I think one of the most exciting and truly admirable foundations of the Office of Climate and Energy are the relationships and the community that has been built around implementing the MI Healthy Climate Plan. So, it's truly been incredible to see, speaking of resilience, the commitments, the persistence, and the joy and excitement that our communities and our partners still have at addressing, mitigating climate change, adapting to climate change. The resolve isn't gone. And the state's commitment to implementing the MI Healthy Climate Plan isn't gone. In fact, it's thinking about creative ways to do the same thing. It was kind of a blip in time to have the influx of funding and resources and support that we did. And so now, we know. We double down in different ways, but we're going to get the work done, nevertheless.

David Fair: Well, if you have to double down in your early assessment, what climate policies and/or protections do you think deserve more attention right away?

Alessandra Carreon: Our primary goals are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, 52% by 2030 in terms of near-term goals. We're looking to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. And then, we have to address environmental injustices related to climate along the way. So, when I think about what's making a difference, I really see it as buckets around what are the sectors that we need to address the most, so cleaning the electric grid. The change that our 2023 clean energy laws enabled were momentous. And so, we're able to lean on our 2023 clean energy laws and go full steam ahead in achieving our clean energy goals. When it comes to the next three sectors that emit the most emissions in our state, we're looking at transportation, buildings and industry.

David Fair: WEMU's First Friday Focus on the Environment Conversation with Alessandra Carreon continues. She is Chief Climate Officer in the State Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.

Lisa Wozniak: Clean energy is not a top of the list priority for the federal administration. And in fact, President Trump told the United Nations that green energy is a scam, and that countries making significant investments in this sector, and I quote, ""are going to Hell."" We have a divided state Legislature in Michigan. What limitations are politics at both the federal and the state levels putting on the job that you're tasked with doing?

Alessandra Carreon: One thing I always like to remind myself or remind folks is that this is happening in the U.S., but clean power, at this point, has surpassed 40% of global electricity generation as of last year, and that's from a World Economic Forum source. So, to your point, we can have that narrative in the U.S., but the U.S. is part of a much bigger system. Ultimately, we, at the state, our commitment to climate is unchanged. Our MI Healthy Climate Plan and the programs that the Office of Climate and Energy, our collaborators across state government, uplift and enable ongoing investments in clean energy. So, for example, we have had and continue to support a Renewable Ready Communities Award, and that incentivizes communities to host large-scale renewable energy projects like wind, solar, and battery storage by providing awards that supplement existing tax revenue and community benefits as communities really address their most urgent needs.

David Fair: The federal government's withdrawal of Solar for All funds was a major blow. There've been many other grants and services also canceled, and remaining money for future programs was rescinded by Congress. Can Michigan achieve its climate and energy goals given those circumstances?

Alessandra Carreon: Those circumstances make things go slower and at a higher cost, for sure. What could have been done cheaper and faster is no longer the case. But ultimately, this isn't a, quote, ""industry"" that is flowing down by any means. This is where, again, the plan around considering economic opportunities, considering how we address environmental injustices really means we expand the lens in how we talk about climate impacts. And mitigating against climate, adapting to climate, isn't going to rely on any single solution. We need to look at things like how we design our infrastructure. We have to look across state departments for how we ensure affordability of, again, not just our energy bills, but virtually everything--our transportation, our housing, this is all interconnected when it comes to climate. My vision, my really goal, is to think about how we embed these strategies across state governments. Something I might frame in a climate or energy context really is about making things more affordable for Michiganders and making sure that the very things we enjoy today are available for our children and future generations. But again, we have a plan that is in place to make sure we know what our long-term goals are and that we don't waver from them.

David Fair: Once again, we're talking with the head of EGLE's Office of Climate and Energy, Alessandra Carreon, on WEMU's First Friday Focus on the Environment, and the other voice you hear is that of my co-host, Lisa Wozniak.

Lisa Wozniak: A major issue facing this listening area, the state and, frankly, the nation as a whole, is the issue of data centers. Several communities in Washtenaw County are considering zoning that would allow for these major operations, and there are huge energy concerns with these types of centers, as I am sure you know well. On the other side of the coin, these centers tend to generate dollars into the local communities. So, I'm wondering how your office is looking at this issue.

Alessandra Carreon: Our office is certainly not the only part of state government looking at this issue. We really need to look at a variety of measures, again, kind of an all-of-the-above approach for data centers. We know, when managed, load growth could increase peak demand, could force greater reliance on fossil-fueled power, so we have to think about how any data centers within our state are committing to clean power procurement and, ultimately, how we can use flexible data center operations in order to support reliability while reducing emissions intensity. And again, this is just from the energy side. We haven't even talked about any other water or other natural resources to look at. So, again, the perfect example of an issue that requires cross-departmental focus, collaboration, and data--the facts.

David Fair: We're in the midterm election cycle, and it can be difficult to get things done when major elections loom ahead. What do you hope Michigan will have accomplished through the end of Governor Whitmer's administration?

Alessandra Carreon: There's so many things, but I think, ultimately, what I would really want to make sure the Office of Climate and Energy, through its original executive directive, ultimately, is able to ensure that the trajectory we are on with our emissions reduction is maintained and that we are also simultaneously looking at planning for adaptation, because resilience means we're mitigating against those impacts and adapting at the same time. I really want to make sure that the course we've set for buildings, for transportation, for industry is so embedded that it would be challenging to unravel the momentum. And I think we're on track for that. And again, this is something that's happening across state departments. It's not reliant just on the Office of Climate and Energy. And ultimately that we're setting up a framework, and again, this is in place too, because every department is thinking about this out of necessity. How do we ensure we're adapting to change? How do ensure we are designing and maintaining our infrastructure for these extreme weather events? And bottom line for me too, and this might be a vestige of my time at the Michigan Public Service Commission, but all of this work has to happen in a way that's affordable for Michiganders. So, let's think critically about the cost associated with it, the innovative business models that could accompany this and make sure, again, that the very partners that we aim to support are centered in the decision-making process and that everyone benefits from these changes equitably. And I think that is embedded. It's not just lip service. We talk about environmental justice and equity. And, ultimately, what that means is fairness for all Michiganders in the same breath that we talk about how we update our infrastructure.

This opinion piece was distributed by The Invading Sea website (www.theinvadingsea.com), which publishes news and commentary on climate change and other environmental issues affecting Florida.","When Donald Trump released his plan last month to try to expand offshore oil drilling to much of our nation’s coasts, it was refreshing to see Florida’s elected officials stand up and fight back. Even Republicans staunchly loyal to the president spoke out against possible drilling in the eastern Gulf, or at least expressed a need for caution.

“It affects tourism and more importantly, it’s just bad for the environment,” said Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.). And Sen. Ashley Moody (R-Fla.) called the plan “HIGHLY concerning.” While the Gulf is dotted with thousands of oil rigs, the section closest to Florida has never had producing wells.

It’s important that Florida lawmakers hold strong against expanding drilling in the eastern Gulf. Healthy coastlines are our ecological and economic engines. The risk of oil spills darkening our beaches and estuaries is an existential threat to our very way of life.

But if our elected officials are serious about really protecting Florida, they need to think bigger.

Our state’s tourism economy, wildlife and coastal environment depend on our leaders speaking up about drilling everywhere — not just when it creeps closer to home. It’s naïve to think that just drawing a boundary around our state will keep us safe.

Even though the oil rig that exploded in the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon disaster was more than a hundred miles from Florida, enough oil from that catastrophe washed up on Pensacola’s shores to shut down beaches and send tourists packing. Florida suffered more than $3 billion in damages and much of that was damage to our economy.

It’s not just about the next drilling disaster. Burning oil and gas is fueling climate change hazards. And Florida is already shouldering more harm from climate change than most states.

Extreme heatwaves are now a regular occurrence for us, and marine heatwaves are killing our ocean life. In October, two species of corals that were critical to building Florida’s reefs — elkhorn and staghorn — were declared “functionally extinct” in the Florida Keys.

The loss is heartbreaking for the sake of the marine ecosystem, but weaker reefs also mean our coasts are at much higher risk of flooding and storm damage. Reefs are also the nurseries for our fisheries and a major draw for snorkelers and divers who spend money in our communities.

We got lucky with a mild hurricane season in 2025, but of course we remember how destructive Helene and Milton were last year. We know we have to be prepared for more bad seasons to come, with storms of increasing intensity fueled by warmer waters. Even without storms, sunny-day flooding in Miami continues to worsen, demanding expensive repairs and adaptations.

All these challenges are a result of unchecked fossil fuel production and use. And the only way to turn things around is to stop drilling and start investing in more renewable energy.

Our senators and representatives are right to be indignant about drilling off Florida’s coast — but it shouldn’t stop there. They need to stick up for our Gulf Coast neighbors, as well as fellow Americans in Alaska and California, by saying no to expanded offshore drilling entirely. And they should speak out against Trump’s out-of-control plan to auction off our oceans for decades more fossil fuel extraction.

We can’t afford to fight all our fights alone, or to let short-term politics get in the way of a bright future.

“The Committee has found that market forces alone cannot overcome the skills gap. We need policy certainty for the long-term, locally directed investment in training, and policies that make clean energy careers attractive and accessible.”

The report calls for conditions favouring local skilled labour to be built into Contracts for Difference, alongside expanded skills passports and strengthened roles for local authorities in retrofit delivery.

The same checks are not required for non-renewable energy sources.

In October, Democrat Senator Catherine Cortez Masto and four other Congress members wrote to Burgum, saying they were “Concerned this memo is meant to intentionally hinder the deployment of renewable energy projects on our public lands.”

Outgoing SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said: “Without action to address this unequal treatment of solar energy, the industry will continue to face significant barriers to deployment and investment at a time of skyrocketing energy demand.”

SEIA recently warned that up to 500 US solar projects, with up to 116GW of combined capacity, are at risk of political disruption, as the lack of local, state and federal permit grants leave them in “limbo”.

Growing policy anxiety

After the president’s budget reconciliation bill reduced tax credit availability for renewable energy projects and imposed greater restrictions on supply chains, Donald Trump passed an executive order that added more anxiety and uncertainty in the industry, going beyond the measures agreed by Congress to tighten the new rules around starting construction at solar projects.

Energy analyst Wood Mackenzie has also warned that the US could see around 100GW less solar by 2030 than forecast under previous policies.

The open letter from the industry reiterates the argument that solar represents the cheapest and fastest way to add new US energy capacity to meet the forecast growth in demand from AI and data centres.

By Nicholas Crane Moore

Throughout the 2024 campaign, Donald Trump and his conservative colleagues told audiences that, if elected, they would fight with all their power to free voters from the tyranny of environmental regulations. In other words, they promised to make their constituents’ water less safe and their air less clean. In the wake of the election, they’re proceeding to make good on those promises.

A lot has changed since a largely bipartisan effort spearheaded passage of modern environmental regulations in the 1960s and 1970s. Laws like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act were once widely applauded as necessary solutions to a problem affecting all Americans. Now they’re derided as pet projects of special interests.

Even some progressives seem scared of the word “regulation.”

How did we get here?

As an attorney having represented both private industry and government, it’s my view that genuine public misunderstanding, leveraged by industry and partisan political interests, is primarily responsible for the growing anti-regulatory stance. As the Trump administration moves quickly to dismantle the regulatory state, abetted by a Supreme Court whose members are personally hostile to regulation, now is a crucial moment to acknowledge that the average American benefits significantly from environmental regulations — and stands to lose a great deal if the contrary view prevails.

How environmental regulations work — and how critics attack them

Though most environmental regulations appear complex, their basic function — implementing broadly worded laws through detailed rules and requirements — is actually quite simple: They restrict the ability of businesses and individuals to take actions that harm the environment, such as disposing chemicals into a stream or emitting pollutants into the air.

Removed from fiery political rhetoric, it’s fairly easy to see why such restrictions would result in fewer pollutants being present in the environment — a conclusion many analyses support.

For example, a recent report concluded that air quality has tangibly improved during the half century since passage of the Clean Air Act — an impact evident in the sky above many cities. Studies consistently identify the health impacts of the law and estimate that it saves more than 200,000 lives each year. The Clean Water Act has substantially reduced water pollution (which didn’t stop the Supreme Court from significantly undermining it two years ago).

Given Americans’ constant exposure to the air and water in their communities, most environmental regulations are primarily public health measures — a fundamental point often deliberately obscured by critics.

While costs are unavoidable, regulations provide the private sector with more than just increased overhead and headaches. A fair, consistent regulatory scheme benefits businesses by leveling the playing field and sparing companies from having to choose between being environmentally responsible and staying competitive — a classic race to the bottom scenario.

Most companies are looking primarily for consistency and certainty, particularly once compliance mechanisms have been adopted. Repealing or weakening longstanding regulations, a new political orthodoxy in some corners, harms the companies that have invested resources in compliance procedures (an effort that actually creates jobs) to do things the right way. Which is why a growing portion of these companies, most notably the auto industry, had in recent years actually begun challenging the loosening of environmental regulations (granted, many are now reversing themselves in an effort to avoid the current administration’s heavy hand).

Regardless of industry’s wavering, the past few months make clear that the utter chaos of the Trump administration’s deregulatory push has few beneficiaries.

The ultimate outcome of these regulations becomes clear when we look back at the state of the environment before them. In rivers across the country, the disposal of industrial waste transformed pristine waterways into open sewers that were unsafe for swimming, let alone drinking, and so inhospitable to fish and other life they were declared biologically dead. Major cities — and even some small towns — were cloaked in air pollution comparable to what residents of many Chinese or Indian cities experience today.

How quickly we forget

While environmental laws and regulations have managed to make scenes like this a distant memory, a significant factor in the creeping anti-regulatory view is that most people who experienced these conditions have either passed away or forgotten how bad things were. This is an example of the extinction of experience: As time passes there are fewer people to remind us that, in many ways, we enjoy a level of environmental health that prior generations could only imagine — a problematic development, given the human tendency to learn lessons the hard way.

As a result, many people don’t fully recognize that in an industrialized nation, clean air and water are not the default state. Surveying the improved condition of their air and water, one may be tempted to conclude that times simply changed — industry became enlightened and progress took its natural course.

But it is critical to acknowledge that this shift was not inevitable. Nor was it always voluntary. Rather, progress was driven primarily by changes to laws and institutions, which in turn spurred technological advancements that have made the country dramatically cleaner.

How to move forward

But for all that environmental regulations have accomplished, now is not the time to let up. America’s air and water remain far less clean than they should be, particularly in lower-income communities of color. New threats to public health are routinely uncovered, often in the form of existing contaminants — like the so-called “forever chemicals” whose pervasiveness and severity was not widely known till recently.

These challenges demand an array of solutions, but history makes clear that sensible regulations must be part of the mix. Not only are they effective, but the process through which they are implemented is, contrary to conventional wisdom, highly democratic. Certainly much more so than recent anti-regulatory decisions of the Supreme Court.

At the federal level, as in many states and localities, government agencies are required by law to invite and address public input on proposed regulations. These opportunities for comment amount to the only chance most Americans have to meaningfully influence the behavior of the corporations that increasingly dictate their daily lives.

This system is far from perfect — it does impose costs, and it’s certainly messy. But America has already lived through the alternative, and it is much worse.

The aim is to advance EU’s 2030 climate and energy targets and achieve climate neutrality by 2050 while boosting industrial competitiveness and resilience.

This year’s net-zero technologies call allocates €2.9bn to bridge investment gaps, draw in public and private financing, and support Europe’s leadership in clean technology manufacturing and deployment.

It supports decarbonisation projects that use innovative technologies with significant greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potential, spanning various scales, and manufacturing of components for renewables, energy storage, heat pumps, hydrogen, and electric vehicle batteries.

Clean hydrogen is identified as a substitute for fossil fuels in both heavy industry and transport.

The third auction under the European Hydrogen Bank will allocate €1.3bn to support production of renewable fuels of nonbiological-origin hydrogen or low-carbon electrolytic hydrogen across three topics.

Selected projects will receive a fixed premium for up to ten years, paid upon certified hydrogen production.

Meanwhile, the first EU-wide auction to decarbonise industrial process heat (IF25 Heat Auction) launches the Industrial Decarbonisation Bank pilot, targeting a major source of EU GHG emissions.

With up to €1bn, it focuses on electrified and direct-renewable heat production, which represents 75% of industrial emissions.

Support will go to projects that deliver the most cost-effective carbon dioxide abatement, bridging the cost gap with fossil-based solutions.

Open to projects of various sizes across all industrial sectors, the IF25 Heat Auction backs the deployment of heat pumps, electric boilers, resistance and induction heating, solar thermal, geothermal, and hybrid technologies.

It offers an output-based fixed premium tied to verified decarbonised heat production for up to five years.

EC clean, just and competitive transition executive vice-president Teresa Ribera said: “By channelling €5.2bn of EU ETS revenues into net-zero technologies, hydrogen and industrial heat decarbonisation, Europe is not just setting the stage for a greener future and technological leadership but investing in its own future.

“The first-ever pilot auction of the Decarbonisation Bank, is delivering on one of the key pillars of the Clean Industrial Deal, opening the way for the €100bn that is foreseen to be channelled into the decarbonisation of our industry.

Overview

The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), in partnership with the Global Energy Interconnection Development and Cooperation Organisation (GEIDCO) and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), is convening a high-level dialogue on accelerating clean energy electrification as a pathway to climate resilience and sustainable development.

This side event brings together government leaders, international organisations, state-owned enterprises, and technical experts to share innovations and best practices in electric vehicle development, charging infrastructure deployment, and grid integration—essential components of the global transition to zero-emission transport.

UNEP's Industry and Economy Division will be represented by Sheila Aggarwal-Khan, Director, who will deliver a keynote address on sustainable mobility pathways, and Rob De Jong, Head of the Sustainable Mobility Unit, who will moderate the panel discussion and deliver closing remarks.

Through UNEP's Global Electric Mobility Programme, the organisation currently supports close to 60 countries in the Global South with technical assistance, policy guidance, and capacity-building to advance zero-emission transport transitions.

______________________________________________________________

Background

Electric mobility is accelerating worldwide, particularly in China, Europe, Southeast Asia, and emerging markets across Africa and Latin America. This transformation delivers measurable benefits: reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality in cities where people live and work, and new employment opportunities across manufacturing, service, and infrastructure sectors.

Yet significant barriers persist. Battery technology continues to evolve, costs remain a constraint for widespread adoption, charging and battery-swapping infrastructure struggles to keep pace with vehicle deployment, large-scale EV integration poses operational challenges for power grids, and questions around battery lifecycle management and critical mineral sourcing require coordinated solutions.

Addressing these challenges demands collaborative action across policy frameworks, financing mechanisms, and technology deployment—precisely the expertise that GEIDCO, UNEP, WWF, and participating countries bring to this dialogue.

This is a tool used to show existing conditions on an electricity grid, which Stanfield describes as “really foundational” to providing the kind of information renewable energy developers need to make informed decisions regarding connecting to the grid.
In 2024, distributed solar accounted for just over one-third of Colorado’s total operating solar capacity, and Stanfield notes that HCA information could be vital to this sector.
While Colorado has ample renewable energy projects—in 2024 renewables accounted for 43% of the state’s electricity generation—around two-thirds of renewable electricity generation comes from the wind sector.
“We don’t deploy DERs [where there’s capacity] if we don’t have information about the grid, and that’s what this comes back to.","“I … find that the company has not complied with the statutory requirement, and in other areas, it seems like the company has similarly decided not to follow prior settlement agreements and commission orders,” said Blank. “It just seems like they ignored the statute.”

“Xcel takes pretty much the most extreme position of any utility that’s been required to or has voluntarily published a hosting capacity map,” added Sky C Stanfield, partner at San Francisco-based law firm Shute, Mihaly & Weinberger LLP, who spoke to our colleagues at Energy-Storage.news on the CPUC ruling last month.

Stanfield also represented the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC), an independent non-profit organisation working to improve energy security and access to clean energy in the US, in the Xcel hearings. This week, she tells PV Tech Premium that some of Xcel’s arguments have pertained to grid security, that making their information more widely available would compromise its ability to provide power to its customers, but that this argument is flawed.

“IREC takes the grid security thing very seriously,” Stanfield says. “It’s not that the idea that grid security is an issue that needs to be thought through carefully is one we disagree with.

“But what [Xcel] has done is instead of say ‘we’re going to take an approach to manage that grid security well, while still enabling distributed energy resources (DERs) to have the information they need to benefit the grid’, they took an approach that wasn’t constructive around what the needs were, and what the benefits are.”

Providing essential information

This misalignment between the information Xcel is providing, and the information needed by DER developers, such as those in the solar and battery storage sectors, is best epitomised by Xcel’s reluctance to disclose hosting capacity analysis (HCA). This is a tool used to show existing conditions on an electricity grid, which Stanfield describes as “really foundational” to providing the kind of information renewable energy developers need to make informed decisions regarding connecting to the grid.

“IREC believes that publishing detailed grid data, through a high-quality HCA—that’s a big caveat, meaning that it has to be good to be useful—is really foundational to advancing the better utilisation of the grid, and the ability for DERs, and solar in particular, to be able to interact in a more sophisticated manner with the grid,” Stanfield explains.

She goes on to explain that Xcel has access to a significant breadth of data, that developers seeking to connect to its transmission infrastructure do not.

“What we got in this decision was not only that they would publish HCA results, but that they publish all of the technical criteria,” Stanfield explains. “We always say that hosting capacity is not actually analysis producing one value, it’s actually many values.

“There are two layers to that: one is the more time-sensitive part [and] the other is that there are lots of different types of constraints. There are voltage constraints, thermal constraints, protection constraints and the HCA that Xcel does models lots of different constraints, and each one of those has a different value.”

This kind of information would be of particular benefit to the small-scale solar PV sectors, where profit margins can be smaller and eliminating unnecessary spending can often be the difference between a project succeeding or failing. In 2024, distributed solar accounted for just over one-third of Colorado’s total operating solar capacity, and Stanfield notes that HCA information could be vital to this sector.

“If I have a 1MW project on my roof, it may be that there’s a thermal constraint but not a voltage constraint, or vice versa, and that information is really valuable or a developer, because a thermal constraint is going to be very expensive to remedy, because you’re gong to have to upgrade a transformer or the line itself and reconductoring a whole line can be cost-prohibitive for the project,” Stanfield says.

“Whereas mitigating a protection constraint or a voltage constraint—depending on what it is—might be a much lower-cost upgrade.”

Facilitating solar project commissioning

In addition to providing the HCA information, the CPUC has called on Xcel to introduce flexible tariffs for developers looking to connect renewable energy projects to the grid, introducing an element of administrative and financial flexibility that mirrors the flexibility of variable electricity generation technologies. Stanfield says that both would help overcome the “basic day-to-day challenges” faced by solar developers.

“There’s the basic day-to-day challenges that PV systems face, regardless of whether we’re talking about more sophisticated use cases, which is the basic interconnection process, and the information we’re asking for at this point should help on that level,” says Stanfield. “It’s going to help people better identify sites where there is existing capacity; that’s the simple and most basic use-case for HCA.”

“By requiring the HCA to contain, for example, the actual nodal information, rather than general feeder information that is basically useless, developers should be able to better predict whether there’s capacity or not.”

Making these changes would be significant, as they would help overcome what Stanfield calls a “hostile” opinion of DERs held by Xcel. While Colorado has ample renewable energy projects—in 2024 renewables accounted for 43% of the state’s electricity generation—around two-thirds of renewable electricity generation comes from the wind sector. With Colorado also ranking in the top ten for oil and natural gas production among US states, there is a concern that solar power could simply be left behind by a grid connection process that does not favour the connection of new solar projects.

“Xcel, for whatever reason, has positioned itself in a way where they view DERs as hostile players to themselves, as opposed to viewing them as a necessary part of the system that they may need to manage, from a grid security standpoint,” explains Stanfield.

During the verbal hearing, CPUC commissioner Tom Plant said that the most optimistic interpretation of Xcel’s work is that the utility is looking to integrate renewables through distributed energy resources management systems (DERMS), and that integrating these technologies onto the grid in a manner with which the utility is comfortable is simply a time-intensive process.

“If I’m going to be charitable about it, I think that, looking at [the] big picture, Xcel has, in their minds their plan to do their aggregator DERMS, then slowly integrate testing the grid DERMS, then they’re going to do the grid DERMS, then at that point we’re going to be able to integrate flexible connection,” said Plant.

However, she noted that this line of thinking “fails to acknowledge the urgency” in the need to connect renewable power projects, either from a broader energy transition angle or the fact that for many projects, securing a grid connection is an integral part of securing finance to build the project in the first place.

“Flexible interconnection is really an urgent thing to get done, and you don’t wait until you’ve gone through all these various different multi-year components of your plan before you implement it,” she added.

Stanfield tells PV Tech Premium that ultimately, distributed energy resources should not be interpreted as a technology that pose an existential threat to the traditional grid system, but one that, if properly integrated, can be a powerful addition to a grid.

“We don’t deploy DERs [where there’s capacity] if we don’t have information about the grid, and that’s what this comes back to. DERs can be even better on the grid, if we enable them to, and the first step of that is providing sufficient information to enable them to understand where there are constraints and where there are not, and ideally when those constraints occur.”

Sticks and carrots

Both Stanfield and the Colorado commissioners expressed doubts about Xcel’s willingness to change its conduct, with Stanfield highlighting the “direct” way in which the commissioners talked about the utility’s work during the verbal hearing.

“I’m really struggling with the company’s inability or unwillingness to comply with, in certain instances, the statute, our orders and prior settlements, particularly as I don’t really see a regulatory stick or consequence that can meaningfully deal with situations like this,” explained Blank in October.

A lack of available carrots and sticks to encourage Xcel to follow the commission’s recommendations was a key talking point during the hearing. One suggestion floated was the idea of offering financial incentives for Xcel to release the HCA data, and integrate flexible connections into its work, one that drew criticism from Plant.

“Giving a financial incentive for following the law seems like we’re hitting the bottom of the barrel at that point,” said the commissioner. “Rather than having a performance incentive, I think there could be a penalty to not achieving certain timeframes.

Fines have some precedent in the sector; earlier this year, the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) called for US$10 million in fines to be levied on local utilities Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) and Southern California Edison (SCE) for failing to approve residential solar and storage deployments within a designated timeframe.

At least, Stanfield says, there is a clear line drawn between what Xcel is doing, and what the CPUC considers acceptable in terms of managing its grid.

“The commission—at least orally and through some of what they approved and didn’t approve—made it clear to Xcel that they expect really different behaviour going forward,” says Syanfield.

“But the commissioners themselves, during the oral deliberations, expressed some doubt as to whether Xcel would even comply with their orders, which is really remarkable and problematic,” she continues. “It’s going to be very interesting to see how Xcel responds to that, and this is where I’m looking forward to seeing the written order and all of the decisions put together.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/xcel-energy.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 11:05:38.019966

Currently, the Northeast produces 91 percent of Brazil’s wind energy and 42 percent of its solar power, positioning it as a key player in the country’s energy transition and offering new opportunities in emerging industries like green hydrogen. The report highlights strategies to leverage these strengths, boost productivity in urban sectors such as manufacturing and services, and reduce long-standing gaps with Brazil’s wealthier regions.

“By helping businesses improve, investing in people, and upgrading infrastructure, we can raise productivity and create more and better jobs,” said Cécile Fruman, World Bank Country Director for Brazil. “This will diversify the economy and expand opportunities for upward mobility.”

The report outlines three key fronts to unlock the region’s potential. First, job creation is essential to reducing poverty, but unemployment and informality rates in the Northeast between 2012 and 2022 stood at 12 percent and 52 percent, respectively—higher than in other regions. Expanding skills training, improving job-matching systems, and promoting growth in manufacturing and services can provide higher-quality employment. Targeted measures to support women and marginalized groups are also critical, as female labor force participation in the Northeast is only 41 percent, compared to 52 percent nationwide.

Second, strengthening the business environment is vital. Streamlining administrative procedures, fostering competition, expanding access to finance, and reducing reliance on productivity-limiting tax subsidies can encourage entrepreneurship and investment, helping local firms thrive and innovate.

Third, enabling infrastructure is key to connecting communities and boosting productivity. Investments in roads, railways, and digital networks, along with improved water and sanitation, will generate jobs and link people to services. The report also emphasizes well-planned public-private partnerships to finance and deliver impactful projects efficiently.

“Electra’s AI-powered brain is redefining how batteries create value,” said Giovanni Rossi, Head of Marketing and Communications at Electra Vehicles.","AI. E-mobility. Energy Infrastructures. Intelligence at scale.

BOSTON, MA, UNITED STATES, December 4, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Electra Vehicles, the leader in AI-powered battery monitoring and optimization solutions, is returning to CES 2026 (LVCC, West Hall, Booth #7324) to demonstrate how artificial intelligence (AI) is redefining the way batteries are monitored, optimized, and managed across industries.

Electra is setting the standard for AI-powered battery intelligence, enabling the management of e-mobility and energy infrastructure through a unified, AI-driven, and scalable platform.

Following a breakthrough period that took Electra from European roadshows to coast-to-coast demonstrations in the U.S. – from showcasing its AI-powered technology on the road with a Fiat 500e to driving a Cybertruck from Boston to Las Vegas for CES 2025 – Electra has industrialized its AI platform, transforming it into a scalable system that powers batteries across electric vehicles, power grids, renewable energy sources, and data centers.

“We’ve moved from proving intelligence on the road to deploying it across industries,” said Fabrizio Martini, CEO and Co-Founder of Electra Vehicles. “Our AI platform has transformed batteries into software- and AI-defined products that adapt, learn, and optimize in real time — powering mobility and energy infrastructure, including grids, renewables, and data centers, and making energy management smarter, safer, and more sustainable.”

Scaling Intelligence Across Platforms and Geographies

Building on its presence at CES 2025, where Electra demonstrated the power of AI-driven battery analytics and management systems (AI-driven BMS) in e-mobility, the company has scaled its technology across the energy infrastructure — extending the same intelligence that once optimized electric vehicles to the broader energy ecosystem, from grid and renewable assets to data centers and automated systems.

Built for horizontal and vertical scalability, Electra’s Brain for Batteries extends from individual cells to global fleets of assets, adapting seamlessly across chemistries, platforms, and geographies.

Electra’s deployments span North America, Europe, India, Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South America, accelerating global adoption of AI-powered battery intelligence and AI-driven BMS.

Why It Matters

Across the battery value chain — from vehicle OEMs and fleet managers to energy storage operators — the same challenges persist: inefficiency, cost, and risks.

The common denominator: a lack of predictive, connected intelligence across platforms. As electrification accelerates — from vehicles to data centers and renewable grids — the need for real-time battery intelligence becomes critical to unlocking efficiency, longevity, and ROI.

The Solution: Electra’s EVE-Ai™ Platform

Electra’s EVE-Ai™ platform addresses these industry-wide pain points.

It is the most advanced AI-powered brain for batteries — built on:

Billions of data points from cells, packs, and environmental sensors

A chemistry- and hardware-agnostic architecture adaptable across use cases

Multiple patented technologies protecting Electra’s algorithms and system design

Trained on over 1.5 billion data points, the EVE-Ai™ platform achieves predictive accuracy within 1% of real-world performance — setting a new industry benchmark for battery intelligence and AI-driven BMS technology.

EVE-Ai™ transforms batteries into software-defined assets — intelligent systems capable of monitoring, learning, and optimizing themselves in real time.

The platform integrates two synergistic layers of intelligence:

EVE-Ai™ Battery Fleet Analytics (BFA) – a cloud-based platform for large-scale monitoring, management, and optimization of EV and stationary battery fleets. It delivers predictive analytics, proactive maintenance, and asset-level visibility to maximize uptime and ROI.

EVE-Ai™ Adaptive Controls – an embedded intelligence layer that transforms traditional BMS into AI-driven BMS – enabling precise, real-time optimization of charging, health, and safety directly at the edge.

“Electra’s AI-powered brain is redefining how batteries create value,” said Giovanni Rossi, Head of Marketing and Communications at Electra Vehicles. “At CES 2026, we’re demonstrating how our AI-driven intelligence platform scales from EV fleets to energy infrastructure — unlocking efficiency, reliability, and global scalability.”

Impact Delivered

Across the energy landscape, Electra’s technology transforms how operators manage battery assets — from electric vehicles to stationary storage systems, renewable assets, and data centers.

Already commercially deployed across fleets and energy assets worldwide, EVE-Ai™ demonstrates proven reliability, scalability, and measurable ROI in live operations.

EVE-Ai™ delivers quantifiable business impact:

Battery asset ROI increase of up to 12% per year for BESS and 15% per mile for EV fleets

3+ years of additional life extension

40% higher uptime, ensuring predictable energy dispatch and reduced downtime

These results are achieved through AI-driven battery management, early risk detection, and real-time optimization — turning energy storage into a profit-generating, data-intelligent system.

This approach enables utilities, renewable operators, and data center managers to:

Maximize asset value through predictive control and optimized charge/discharge cycles

Reduce operational risks with up to three months of early fault detection, mitigating safety events

Support grid stability and flexibility markets, ensuring stored energy contributes efficiently to decarbonization goals

Experience the Future of Energy Intelligence at CES 2026

Visitors to CES 2026 can experience live demonstrations of EVE-Ai™’s capabilities — including predictive analytics, real-time optimization, and fleet-level scalability — proving that the future of energy intelligence is already here.

“We expect first customers to have certified their module with D15T and place orders in 1Q2026,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.
Like Endurans' earlier D15 backsheet for monofacial PV modules, the D15T is based on a coextruded high-performance polyolefin (HPO) backsheet technology, but the D15T is a transparent backsheet and made for bifacial PV modules.
It features new optical characteristics that eliminate the usual grid pattern or “mesh” often used for bifacial glass/glass or glass/backsheet PV modules.
Endurans Solar is a wholly owned subsidiary of Worthen Industries, with production facilities across Asia, Europe, in addition to the United States.","U.S.-based solar materials manufacturer Endurans Solar has announced its new HP D15T transparent backsheet for utility-scale bifacial projects.

“Our unique US-manufactured backsheets provide domestic module manufacturers with enhanced supply chain stability and give developers the ability to increase their domestic content ratio, allowing for vital strategic advantage for projects targeting Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credit adders and US government procurement requirements,” said Endurans Solar CEO, Nate Coleman, in a statement.

The adhesive-free, fluorine-free backsheet, dubbed HP D15T, has completed IEC 62788-2-1:2023 certification as part of the full D15-series safety standard validation with independent testing laboratory TÜV Rheinland.

Potential customers are currently in the validation phase. “We expect first customers to have certified their module with D15T and place orders in 1Q2026,” a company spokesperson told pv magazine.

Suitable for systems up to 1500 V, the backsheet total thickness is 350 μm with a water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) at 38 C and 90% relative humidity of less than 1.3 g/m²/d. The moisture and hydrolysis resistance is reportedly at a glass-level of protection. The direct and diffuse transmission range at 300-2500 nm is less than 76% and less than 46%, respectively. It is also recyclable, according to the company.

Like Endurans' earlier D15 backsheet for monofacial PV modules, the D15T is based on a coextruded high-performance polyolefin (HPO) backsheet technology, but the D15T is a transparent backsheet and made for bifacial PV modules.

It features new optical characteristics that eliminate the usual grid pattern or “mesh” often used for bifacial glass/glass or glass/backsheet PV modules. Translucent optics and a mesh-free design increase the yield of bifacial modules and offer module manufacturers easier lamination, as they no longer have to align the glass or backsheet with a grid with the cell strings, according to the company.

The HP D15T was designed as an alternative to standard rear glass. It gives manufacturers the option of using thicker front glass without the “weight penalty” incurred with a dual-glass module, according to the company.

Thanks (as always) for your ongoing support and for tuning into CBT News for this week’s Future of Automotive segment.","Welcome back to the latest episode of “The Future of Automotive” on CBT News, where we put recent automotive and mobility news into the context of the broader themes impacting the industry.

I’m Steve Greenfield from Automotive Ventures, and I’m glad that you could join us.

This week, a look at a quiet but profound shift happening in our driveways and garages.

There was a time—not that long ago—when cars were, at their core, mechanical machines. If you had the patience, the elbow grease, and the right tools, you could bring just about any old vehicle back to life. And once you did, that car could be maintained indefinitely. But in terms of upgrades, you were stuck. Whatever features the next model year introduced, well… you simply didn’t get them.

But that world is changing. Fast.

Take a Tesla. There are almost no buttons, no dials—just a giant touchscreen running nearly everything. And Tesla isn’t alone. Increasingly, modern cars, especially electric ones, are less like machines and more like software platforms, constantly updating themselves over the air to fix bugs, tweak performance, even add the occasional easter egg inside the cabin.

In other words, your car is starting to behave a lot like your phone. And that comparison—“a smartphone on wheels”—has already become a cliché inside the auto industry. There are real perks to that: continuous improvement. Better navigation. The introduction of new convenience features that didn’t exist before.

But there’s also a catch. Software ages. Hardware gets left behind. And a car—something we expect to last a decade or more—can suddenly feel outdated because an app crashes, not because a gasket fails.

How well these software-dependent cars will age is still an open question. Automakers now promise vehicles that evolve, that get better over time. But technology doesn’t work on the same timeline as automobiles. Americans replace their phones every couple of years. The average car on the road today is nearly 13 years old. And automakers are legally required to support safety recalls for 15 years—long after your smartphone would’ve been tossed in a drawer.

Future updates may simply be too demanding for older in-car computers. As companies race to roll out AI-driven features and more sophisticated autonomy, some models may fall behind—slowed by outdated chips or incompatible systems. Imagine trying to run the latest Microsoft Windows suite on a 2010 laptop. It wouldn’t be pretty.

And we’ve seen what obsolescence looks like already. In the 2010s, many cars relied on 3G networks to power remote locking, emergency assistance, and crash detection. When 3G was shut down in 2022, millions of still-drivable cars suddenly lost those features. A few manufacturers offered upgrades; others simply shrugged and said, “Connectivity’s gone.” And that was that.

Some automakers are trying to get ahead of the problem. Rivian, for example, says it’s building extra computing “headroom” into its vehicles—enough, it hopes, to keep them updated for seven to ten years. But what happens after that?

In the collector car world, many Ferrari enthusiasts already view electric vehicles with suspicion—not just because EVs lack the roar and rumble of a combustion engine, but because long-term value depends on longevity. A rare Ferrari V12 can still turn heads—and commands seven figures—half a century later. But if an electric Ferrari stops receiving software support after 10 years, what happens to its collectability and value?

There’s also the cautionary tale of Fisker, which went bankrupt in 2024. With the company gone, so were the software patches. Some of its 11,000 SUVs risked becoming expensive paperweights without fixes for critical glitches. Larger, established companies are far more stable, but even they’re not immune to financial pressure. Keep in mind that Rivian lost roughly $100,000 per vehicle last quarter; Lucid wasn’t far behind. Will these automakers even be around in 10 or 20 years to continue to provide software updates? Longevity, in the software era, can no longer be taken for granted.

And here’s the irony: electric cars, mechanically speaking, are built to last. Fewer moving parts. Less wear and tear. Replace a battery or a motor and an EV could, in theory, outlive many gas-powered cars. But if the software supporting it stops evolving—or stops working—your car may become nothing more than an oversized paperweight.

The Environmental Protection Agency cited Houston-based Enterprise Products last month, nearly a year after a gasoline pipeline was found leaking Dec. 5, 2024. The resulting spill contaminated the groundwater near the Animas River, prompted local evacuations and forced some La Plata County residents to move. It is Colorado’s largest refined gasoline pipeline spill since the state health department began tracking such releases in 2016.

“Although significant corrective action progress has been made, cleanup efforts will continue for some time,” the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said in a written statement.

Last December, community members reported the ground was soaked in gasoline, prompting a hazmat crew to respond and residents to evacuate homes. Houses in a small subdivision within the boundaries of both La Plata County and the Southern Ute Reservation near the spill received water filters and cisterns.

Some residents had to stay temporarily in hotels or leave the area entirely. Between June and October, 38 Niente LLC purchased five properties near the spill site for a total of about $2.5 million, according to county assessor records.

The company is a subsidiary of Houston-based Enterprise Products, according to the company’s Feb. 1 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The cause of the spill was “material failure of the pipeline or welding,” according to the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. The pipeline is part of Enterprise’s Mid-America Pipeline System, which extends through Texas, New Mexico, Wyoming and other states.

The spill is located about half a mile from the Animas River south of Durango, raising concerns that the contaminants could reach the river.

The underground mass of contaminants, called a plume, is mainly moving south on top of a mesa, not southwest toward the river, officials say.

The state, tribal and federal officials are closely monitoring the plume, which was roughly 2,400 feet long and, at its widest, is about 1,000 feet wide, CDPHE said Thursday.

Violations prompt inspection

In September, Enterprise’s contractor, GHD, self-reported problems with how 5,200 gallons of hazardous, gasoline-contaminated wastewater was handled.

The Southern Ute Indian Tribe shared concerns in early November about how Enterprise was managing hazardous waste from the spill, the tribe said in a Nov. 21 news release.

The EPA sent a notice of noncompliance to Enterprise on Nov. 21 saying the company needed to address several violations. State, tribal and federal officials inspected the cleanup site Tuesday to make sure the Enterprise was in compliance.

In one instance, the company shipped 5,200 gallons of hazardous, gasoline-contaminated wastewater to an oilfield waste disposal site in New Mexico run by Gandy Marley.

Enterprise didn’t properly label the waste, which violated federal requirements, according to an EPA noncompliance notice.

A sample of the wastewater had a benzene concentration of 4.8 milligrams per liter. That’s over nine times the benzene toxicity limit of 0.5 milligrams per liter.

Benzene is a component of crude oil products. Short-term exposure can cause headaches and nausea, and longer-term exposure poses a threat of leukemia and other conditions, according to CDPHE.

Enterprise also used the wrong transport documentation, marking it as nonhazardous oilfield waste disposal, rather than hazardous waste. That broke another federal rule. The New Mexico facility was also not permitted to dispose of hazardous waste, which violated a third federal rule, the notice said.

“Enterprise has since communicated to EPA that they have corrected their process to prevent this from happening again,” the EPA said in a written statement.

The EPA is working with the CDPHE to make sure that the cleanup meets federal requirements. There is still a lot of work to do, and the cleanup is mainly happening on-site, the state agency said.

Workers are injecting oxygen underground to nurture aerobic bacteria that can break down dissolved gasoline, a process called biosparging. They’re using wells and vacuums to cut down on the amount of gasoline absorbed into the soil.

The state health department required Enterprise to revise on-site work plans to make sure they comply with regulations. They also required the company to do more hazardous and nonhazardous waste training for on-site workers.

“We take instances of non-compliance very seriously,” CDPHE said in a written statement.",https://i0.wp.com/newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Remediation-Site-JWS-May-2025-0110-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&quality=85&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-05 06:00:14.712366

Key Takeaways:

What is DOE Loan Programs Office (LPO) and how it is a major contributor in America's clean energy funding.

Key loan programs available through LPO, what are their eligibility requirements, and how they benefit growing industries.

The application process for LPO clean energy funding and potential challenges that companies might face.

The United States seems to be entering a new phase of clean energy expansion. Many industries are now preparing for large-scale deployment of clean energy technologies. These technologies are reshaping the country's electric grid, transportation systems, buildings, and industrial facilities. However, for growth and development in such industries, major investment is required.

Companies that wish to progress in these fields needs financing options that help them manage technical and commercial risks, while supporting their innovative ideas. A big source of help here is the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office (LPO). It offers billions of dollars in clean energy funding to businesses that are building or expanding clean energy projects.

This may be because the United States wants to lower emissions and increase energy efficiency. This will also help them strengthen their domestic supply chains. Clean energy funding is something that may support this shift and make it scalable.

This article explores how the DOE loan programs operate, who can apply, and what opportunities are available for U.S. manufacturing. It also discusses how clean energy funding from federal agencies is shaping the future of American energy infrastructure.

What is the DOE Loan Programs Office (LPO)?

The LPO comes under the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). It was created with the aim of developing advanced clean energy technologies that are unable to secure traditional private-sector financing. It is important to know The Loan Programs Office (LPO) operates as the Office of Energy Dominance Financing (EDF) and performs the duties assigned to LPO through the Energy Policy Act of 2005, as amended. EDF possesses all authorities, receives all appropriations, and performs all requirements assigned to LPO.

Many companies struggle to get commercial loans because innovative business ideas generally involve technical risks. LPO helps such businesses by offering either direct loans or loan guarantees.

When businesses have such a large financial support, they invest in renewable energy, energy storage, advanced nuclear, and many other clean energy technologies. These loan programs intend to promote the country's economic growth while helping the federal government reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The LPO generally supports projects that directly address climate change, support decarbonization, and help local governments and rural areas upgrade their energy systems. The loans aim to bring new technologies to the market, and hence, support national goals around emissions reduction, energy efficiency, and environmental protection.

Why LPO Matters for Clean Energy Funding?

Many industries in the United States are transitioning away from fossil fuels. This shift requires heavy investments in manufacturing, research, and infrastructure upgrades. Clean energy funding from the federal government provides financial certainty to companies that want to scale clean technologies.

Here are some reasons why the LPO matters:

Provides access to capital for first-of-a-kind projects.

Helps reduce risks for the private sector.

Encourages long-term investment in clean energy financing.

Supports green energy financing that traditional lenders may not offer.

Aligns with national climate goals and energy security needs.

Promotes the domestic manufacturing revival supported by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

For manufacturers, the LPO is now one of the largest sources of federal clean energy financing. This is because it actively supports projects that involve batteries, solar panels, advanced reactors, critical minerals, and electric grid upgrades.

Key Loan Programs Available Through LPO

One of them was Christopher Shelton, an executive at AES, which owns utilities and power plants across the world.","Lithium-ion batteries, which power everything from cellphones to cars, are increasingly saving electric grids around the world.

Batteries as large as shipping containers are being connected to power lines and installed beside solar panels and wind turbines. They soak up power when it’s plentiful and cheap and release it when electricity use soars, helping reduce the need for expensive power plants and lines.

American researchers invented the lithium-ion battery in the 1970s and later showed that the devices could help the electric grid. But for a long time batteries made little headway because grid managers and utility executives dismissed them as expensive and risky.

One of the first breakthroughs came about 15 years ago when engineers at a U.S. energy company installed one of the first lithium-ion batteries tied to a grid in a desert nearly 9,000 feet above sea level in Chile. Challenging conventional notions of how the electricity system should be run, that team helped prove that batteries could help make electric grids more stable and reliable.

The concept of storing energy was not new. Thomas Edison developed alkaline nickel-iron batteries largely for industry and early electric vehicles. Various companies tried other technologies like sodium sulfur, which have not gained much traction. And some utilities have long pumped water uphill so that later it could be sent back down to generate electricity.

But those systems were relatively limited. The kinds of lithium batteries installed in the Atacama Desert in 2009, by comparison, are now being used around the world.

Consider California. In recent years, state officials have often asked residents to use less electricity on hot summer days to prevent power outages. But there have been no such alerts since 2022, largely because batteries have allowed California to use its abundant solar power well into the evening. Over the last seven years, the state added 30 times as much battery storage capacity as it had in 2018.

The rest of the world has also seen impressive growth, according to the International Energy Agency, a multilateral organization in Paris. The boom was made possible by a stunning 90 percent drop in the cost of batteries over the last 15 years as new factories have come on line. China is by far the world’s largest battery manufacturer, but Europe, India and the United States have recently been increasing production, too.

“Batteries are changing the game before our eyes,” Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said recently.

A Bumpy Start

“There wasn’t the experience with battery storage,” said Carla Peterman, a former member of the California Energy Commission and now a vice president at Pacific Gas & Electric, the state’s largest utility. “It was a bit of a chicken or the egg, where there wasn’t enough on there to really say that this could be a big part of the energy system.”

But some Americans clearly saw the benefits of batteries. One of them was Christopher Shelton, an executive at AES, which owns utilities and power plants across the world.

He began to look into lithium-ion batteries when his bosses asked employees to pitch proposals for a “billion-dollar idea.” Mr. Shelton said he thought batteries could reduce the need for power plants that utilities used only when electricity demand climbed to peak levels.

“Why would you build an asset that you weren’t going to use more than 5 percent of the time?” Mr. Shelton said. “We were saying batteries should be an alternative to peaker plants.”

He first installed battery cells at a nondescript electricity substation outside Indianapolis, a city known for its 500-mile car race. His company later connected one in Norristown, Pa., at an operations center of the nation’s largest grid manager, PJM Interconnection. The Los Angeles area was connected next, followed by a larger battery for the Indianapolis grid.

“Utilities have long been skeptical of new technologies,” said Leah Stokes, an associate professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies energy politics and policy. “They know how to make a widget, which is a giant fossil fuel power plant, so they keep doing that.”

Drew Maloney, president and chief executive of the Edison Electric Institute, a utility trade organization, disagrees with that assessment. “The U.S. energy grid is the world’s most important machine, and America’s electric companies are quick to pilot and deploy new technologies once they become commercially viable and affordable for customers,” he said.

But even now, U.S. utilities in many states are reluctant to add batteries. A lot fewer large batteries are being added in the Southeast, for example, than in California and Texas.

Utility executives are not the only ones who are skeptical. So are policymakers and many ordinary Americans.

Some local governments have banned big batteries because of safety concerns. In May and June, a large battery complex in Monterey County, Calif., was destroyed in a fire that spewed smoke and harmful chemicals.

Despite that disaster, energy experts say many risks have been addressed. The California fire happened in a type of battery that most companies no longer use. And those batteries were installed in a power plant building where the fire easily spread from device to device. Most batteries are installed outdoors to reduce the chances that fires spread.

‘Testing It on the Moon’

After landing, visitors have to drive at least four hours to the salt flats of the Atacama Desert, where workers collect lithium — a key battery ingredient.

The AES camp is another hour away. It sits on a rocky unpaved path, lined with busted tires. Though temperatures during a late spring and early summer day can reach the 80s, the nights can be near freezing.

Margaret Hazard, who resides in Carson, Washington, has similarly experienced a doubling in her homeowners’ insurance premiums over the last eight years.
Climate change, which is supercharging damaging extreme weather such as hurricanes, flooding and wildfires, is a key factor driving rising home insurance rates.
The report found that average home insurance premiums increased nearly 9 percent faster than the rate of inflation from 2018 to 2022.
Oil companies are currently petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in a climate deception case brought by Boulder, Colorado.","Two homeowners in Washington state who have seen sharp increases in their home insurance premiums in recent years have brought a new lawsuit against major oil and gas companies—the first of its kind aiming to hold Big Oil responsible for climate-related spikes in insurance costs.

The case, filed last week in U.S. District Court in the state’s Western District, alleges that deception and fraud on the part of oil industry defendants around the impacts of fossil fuels on climate has substantially contributed to the climate crisis, which in turn has resulted in a homeowners’ insurance crisis as rates soar and access in especially high-risk areas starts to decline.

In Washington state, for example, homeowners’ insurance rates have risen by 51 percent over the last six years.

For Richard Kennedy, a resident of the Seattle suburb of Normandy Park, premiums have more than doubled since 2017, rising from $1,012 to $2,149. Margaret Hazard, who resides in Carson, Washington, has similarly experienced a doubling in her homeowners’ insurance premiums over the last eight years. They are now turning to the courts, filing a class action on behalf of all homeowners who have or will purchase insurance after the year 2017 in both that state and nationwide.

Climate change, which is supercharging damaging extreme weather such as hurricanes, flooding and wildfires, is a key factor driving rising home insurance rates. As climate-related disasters and their associated costs mount, homeowners’ insurance is becoming costlier and harder to obtain, according to a January report from the Department of the Treasury’s Federal Insurance Office. The report found that average home insurance premiums increased nearly 9 percent faster than the rate of inflation from 2018 to 2022.

The lawsuit, Kennedy v. Exxon et al., is the first to target fossil fuel companies over these skyrocketing insurance costs. “This case is about holding the fossil fuel defendants accountable for the increased homeowners’ insurance premiums that their coordinated and deliberate scheme to hide the truth about climate change and the effects of burning fossil fuels has brought about and for their conduct contributing to climate change,” the complaint asserts.

The suit brings both federal and state law claims. The federal claims include violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. State law claims include fraudulent misrepresentation, civil conspiracy, unjust enrichment, nuisance and violation of the Washington Consumer Protection Act. Like other climate cases brought against big oil companies, it argues that defendants engaged in a decades-long campaign of deception to deny the links between fossil fuels and climate change, and more recently to misleadingly portray the oil industry as providing climate solutions, all for the purpose of delaying the transition to clean energy and protecting industry profits.

The suit names ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Shell and its subsidiary Equilon Enterprises and the U.S. oil and gas industry’s chief trade association, the American Petroleum Institute (API), as defendants, noting that the companies have collectively generated $2.4 trillion in profits since 1990.

In an emailed statement, API senior vice president and general counsel Ryan Meyers called the lawsuit “baseless” and part of a “coordinated campaign against an industry that powers everyday life, drives America’s economy, and is actively reducing emissions.”

“We continue to believe that climate policy belongs in Congress, not a patchwork of courtrooms,” Meyers added.

API has long been one of the most powerful forces lobbying against climate policies and legislation in Congress.

Inside Climate News reached out to BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell for comment but did not get a response.

The lead law firm representing the plaintiffs, Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP, has previously worked on litigation against the tobacco industry, with co-founder and managing partner Steve Berman serving as special assistant attorney general for 13 states in the tobacco litigation.

Berman said the oil industry has followed the same pattern of deception that tobacco companies used. “Big Oil took its playbook directly from the minds of Big Tobacco and think they can get away with the same deliberate disinformation campaign, coercing the public to pay for the very harms they suffer,” Berman said in a statement.

U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) has also highlighted the striking similarities between the two industries in terms of deceptive conduct, and has been a leading voice in Congress speaking out about both the climate-fueled crisis in the home insurance market and the role of the fossil fuel industry in bringing about these costly consequences.

“Higher insurance premiums are the result of the fossil fuel industry’s decades-long campaign of disinformation to obstruct climate action,” Whitehouse told Inside Climate News in an emailed statement. “We are already seeing signs of the Great Climate Insurance Collapse, which will cascade into a collapse in property values that will trash our entire economy. Just like Big Tobacco, Big Oil has lied for decades to the American people about the full extent of the harms of its products and must be held accountable.”

In a 118-page complaint, the new lawsuit lays out examples of how the industry’s conduct has undermined public understanding of climate science, obstructed climate policies and ultimately delayed the transition to clean energy, thereby directly contributing to what scientists say has now become a climate emergency. And with extreme weather disasters on the rise as climate change accelerates, insurance companies are having to cover significantly more losses and account for much greater risk, leading to sharp rate increases.

“We see a direct correlation between Big Oil’s lies and the alarming increase of homeowners insurance due to the rising threat of natural disasters,” Berman said in his statement.

Michael Gerrard, faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, told Inside Climate News that it will be “challenging to quantify the effect that climate deception is having on the physical impacts of climate change.” But he said it is clear that climate change is “leading to higher insurance premiums, and that’s costing homeowners real money.”

“Insurance really is the bleeding edge right now of the climate crisis,” said Aaron Regunberg, director of Public Citizen’s climate accountability project. “Having litigation strategies that are taking that on is extremely important.”

Pat Parenteau, emeritus professor of law at Vermont Law and Graduate School, told Inside Climate News that the new case “opens yet another front on the battle to hold the oil companies accountable for the damage they continue to cause to consumers and communities across the country.”

“Climate breakdown is causing a cascade of disasters, including an insurance crisis that threatens another financial meltdown as occurred with the subprime mortgage collapse in 2007-08. When people can’t get insurance, they can’t get a mortgage, property values fall and defaults escalate until the bubble bursts,” Parenteau explained. “So, the damages are real and provable.”

The new lawsuit comes as major oil and gas companies are facing a rising tide of climate accountability lawsuits brought by cities, counties, states, tribal governments and individuals. In May, a woman in Washington state whose mother died in the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome brought a first-of-its-kind wrongful death suit against Big Oil.

In September the U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico dismissed a similar class-action lawsuit filed by Puerto Rican municipalities that had also brought federal racketeering charges against fossil fuel companies, seeking to hold them liable for damages associated with the 2017 hurricanes that decimated the island territory. The dismissal was based on a procedural statute of limitations issue, and the municipalities are appealing the decision.

Berman told Inside Climate News that he thinks his case will be able to avoid that procedural hurdle. “Since this is a newly caused harm, we believe the statute of limitations does not apply in this case,” he said.

Still, the industry and its political allies are going all out to try to stop these cases in their tracks. Oil companies are currently petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in a climate deception case brought by Boulder, Colorado. If the justices take up the petition, it could have sweeping repercussions for the more than two dozen other climate cases pending against the industry. The court is scheduled to address the petition during its Dec. 12 conference.

“It’s a hold-your-breath moment for all of these cases,” Parenteau said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1231144625-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 11:05:55.764841
,Clean Energy ,2025-12-05 09:59:33+00:00,Canary Media,Georgia hashes out plan to let data centers build their own clean energy,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/georgia-data-centers-build-clean-energy,"That’s a real concern for Georgia Power, which plans to spend more than $15 billion to build 10 gigawatts of new gas plants and batteries by 2031.
The tech giants behind most of those data centers could also benefit from being able to track down their own clean energy.
And the plan put forth by Georgia Power this summer lacks some key features that data center companies want.
The Southeast lacks these markets, leaving large, vertically integrated utilities like Georgia Power in control of what gets built.
​“Georgia Power is certainly on record that they don’t prefer it to be accredited, which makes sense for them.","Big companies have spent years pushing Georgia to let them find and pay for new clean energy to add to the grid, in the hopes that they could then get data centers and other power-hungry facilities online faster.

Now, that concept is tantalizingly close to becoming a reality, with regulators, utility Georgia Power, and others hammering out the details of a program that could be finalized sometime next year. If approved, the framework could not only benefit companies but also reduce the need for a massive buildout of gas-fired plants that Georgia Power is planning to satiate the artificial intelligence boom.

Today, utilities are responsible for bringing the vast majority of new power projects online in the state. But over the past two years, the Clean Energy Buyers Association has negotiated to secure a commitment from Georgia Power that ​“will, for the first time, allow commercial and industrial customers to bring clean energy projects to the utility’s system,” said Katie Southworth, the deputy director for market and policy innovation in the South and Southeast at the trade group, which includes major hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.

The terms of the commitment were first sketched out in a letter agreement between Georgia Power and CEBA last year and then codified in a July settlement agreement between the utility, staff at the Georgia Public Service Commission, and other stakeholders that cemented the utility’s long-term integrated resource plan.

The ​“customer-identified resource” (CIR) option will allow hyperscalers and other big commercial and industrial customers to secure gigawatts of solar, batteries, and other energy resources on their own, not just through the utility.

Letting data centers procure their own energy resources could solve a lot of problems for utilities — like the risk of sticking their customers with the cost of building power plants that may be unneeded if the AI boom goes bust. That’s a real concern for Georgia Power, which plans to spend more than $15 billion to build 10 gigawatts of new gas plants and batteries by 2031. This move could dramatically increase customers’ bills and is almost entirely motivated by gigantic — yet highly uncertain — projections of how much energy that data centers will need.

The tech giants behind most of those data centers could also benefit from being able to track down their own clean energy. The carbon-free resources would not only help in meeting hyperscalers’ aggressive climate targets; they are also likely to be cheaper and faster to build than gas plants, which face yearslong backlogs and rising costs.

The CIR option isn’t a done deal yet. Once Georgia Power, the Public Service Commission, and others work out how the program will function, the utility will file a final version in a separate docket next year.

And the plan put forth by Georgia Power this summer lacks some key features that data center companies want. A big point of contention is that it doesn’t credit the solar and batteries that customers procure as a way to meet future peaks in power demand — the same peaks Georgia Power uses to justify its gas-plant buildout.

But as it stands, CEBA sees ​“the approved CIR framework as a meaningful step toward the ​‘bring-your-own clean energy’ model,” Southworth said — a model that goes by the catchy acronym BYONCE in clean-energy social media circles.

Opening up the playing field for clean energy

The CIR option is technically an addition to Georgia Power’s existing Clean and Renewable Energy Subscription (CARES) program, which requires the utility to secure up to 4 gigawatts of new renewable resources by 2035. CARES is a more standard ​“green tariff” program that leaves the utility in control of contracting for resources and making them available to customers under set terms, Southworth explained.

Under the CIR option, by contrast, large customers will be able to seek out their own projects directly with a developer and the utility. Georgia Power will analyze the projects and subject them to tests to establish whether they are cost-effective. Once projects are approved by Georgia Power, built, and online, customers can take credit for the power generated, both on their energy bills and in the form of renewable energy certificates. Georgia Power’s current plan allows the procurement of up to 3 gigawatts of customer-identified resources through 2035.

Letting big companies contract their own clean power is far from a new idea. Since 2014, corporate clean-energy procurements have surpassed 100 gigawatts in the United States, equal to 41% of all clean energy added to the nation’s grid over that time, according to CEBA. Tech giants have made up the lion’s share of that growth and have continued to add more capacity in 2025, despite the headwinds created by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress.

But most of that investment has happened in parts of the country that operate under competitive energy markets, in which independent developers can build power plants and solar, wind, and battery farms. The Southeast lacks these markets, leaving large, vertically integrated utilities like Georgia Power in control of what gets built. Perhaps not coincidentally, Southeast utilities also have some of the country’s biggest gas-plant expansion plans.

A lot of clean energy projects could use a boost from power-hungry companies. According to the latest data from the Southern Energy Renewable Association trade group, more than 20 gigawatts of solar, battery, and hybrid solar-battery projects are now seeking grid interconnection in Georgia.

“The idea that a large customer can buy down the cost of a clean energy resource to make sure it’s brought onto the grid to benefit them and everybody else, because that’s of value to them — that’s theoretically a great concept,” said Jennifer Whitfield, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit that’s pushing Georgia regulators to find cleaner, lower-cost alternatives to Georgia Power’s proposed gas-plant expansion. ​“We’re very supportive of the process because it has the potential to be a great asset to everyone else on the grid.”

Isabella Ariza, staff attorney at the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign, said CEBA deserves credit for working to secure this option for big customers in Georgia. In fact, she identified it as one of the rare bright spots offsetting a series of decisions from Georgia Power and the Public Service Commission that environmental and consumer advocates fear will raise energy costs and climate pollution.

“They’re proposing something that makes total sense and would help some companies be able to say ​‘We’re powering our stuff with 100% clean energy,’” Ariza said of the CIR option. That’s particularly important at a time when many hyperscalers are backing away from their clean energy targets in their hunt for power for AI data centers, she noted.

The missing piece: capacity value

Despite those benefits, the CIR framework’s omissions are substantial enough that CEBA did not join stakeholders like Walmart, the Georgia Association of Manufacturers, and the Southern Renewable Energy Association trade groups in signing on to it.

CEBA wanted companies to be able to procure a full range of carbon-free generation resources — such as geothermal and small modular nuclear reactors — rather than just renewable energy and renewables paired with batteries. The trade group also sought a pathway for customers to bring projects forward on a rolling basis more quickly than the current settlement agreement would allow.

But one of the biggest issues CEBA has with the current CIR plan is that it ​“does not recognize the full capacity value of customer-funded clean, firm resources to the grid,” Southworth said. Capacity value is a measure of how power plants, batteries, and other resources meet peak power demands during the handful of hours per year that determine how much generation and grid infrastructure utilities need to build.

That’s a significant gap. If the resources that big customers secure under the CIR aren’t considered part of the solution to this challenge — if their capacity value isn’t factored in — they may not be able to reduce Georgia Power’s need for gigawatts of gas-fired power plants, which are the traditional utility backstop for ensuring adequate energy supplies.

This would be bad for Georgia Power customers at large, who would end up paying for more gas plants than are actually needed after the data centers driving up power demand secure their own resources instead. It could also saddle data centers and other big customers with growing capacity-related costs that their self-secured projects could otherwise help reduce.

“A well-designed CIR program that recognizes the capacity value of customer-funded clean resources is a win-win-win for large customers, Georgia Power, and all ratepayers,” Southworth said. ​“Participating customers pay the incremental cost of new clean, firm projects; the utility gets capacity it can count on; and nonparticipating customers benefit from a more diverse, less gas-dependent resource mix without taking on the full cost or fuel price risk of those projects.”

CEBA has ideas for how Georgia Power could financially compensate customers for the capacity value of the resources that they procure. The utility already calculates ​“avoided capacity values” for the renewable energy, battery, and fossil-fueled resources it brings to the table in its requests for proposals. Georgia Power could provide a capacity credit of similar value to subscribing customers for the projects they procure.

CEBA will ​“continue to work with the company and commission staff,” Southworth said. Her group sees Georgia Power’s long-term plan approved this summer ​“as establishing the floor, not the ceiling, for what CIR can become.”

A big shift at the Public Service Commission could lay the groundwork for a reassessment of the program. Last month, Georgia voters elected two Democratic challengers — health care consultant Alicia Johnson and clean-energy advocate Peter Hubbard — to replace Republican incumbents Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson.

The two new commissioners have both pledged to tackle high and rising electricity costs for Georgia Power residential customers. Across the country, utilities and regulators are striving to force data center developers to take on the costs they’re imposing on power grids, rather than foisting them on everyday utility customers.

“Capacity is still an open question” that the Public Service Commission can take up as it decides on the CIR option, said Whitfield of the Southern Environmental Law Center. ​“Georgia Power is certainly on record that they don’t prefer it to be accredited, which makes sense for them. They want to build more and profit more,” as a regulated utility that earns guaranteed profits on its capital investments. ​“But that is going to be very much a live issue.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Georgia-solar-panels-aerial.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=4f10c693538ad091ac07ef82867b1bc1,N,,2025-12-05 06:59:44.989189

It’ll all depend on drilling for America’s vast oil and natural gas reserves.

Today just about everyone is plugged in to a digital device, with 9 in 10 Americans owning a smartphone. That phone, not to mention your tablet, television, and game console, wouldn’t exist without oil and natural gas. Fossil fuels are the only major sources of hydrocarbons, the complex molecules needed to make the plastic in your devices. And natural gas is the key player in powering those devices. It’s the largest energy source used by power plants and generates 43 percent of America’s electricity.

That makes natural gas a vital energy source in the advance of artificial intelligence, from immersive gaming worlds to robots that do your chores. A.I. uses lots of power. By 2030, the electricity A.I. uses will have skyrocketed from 4 gigawatts-- per year—about what four large power plants produce—to 123 gigawatts. That’s because tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are building massive computer farms to power A.I. These data centers will use as much electricity in a month as New York City now uses in 20 months. Lawmakers who are thinking about our future energy needs see continued drilling for oil and natural gas as vital.

Renewable sources like wind and solar won’t supply nearly enough electricity. These intermittent sources—supplying power only on windy or sunny days—can’t provide the continuous energy that natural gas plants do, nor do we have batteries big enough to store all the power they generate. The good news is that with drilling innovations such as fracking, the U.S. has been able to tap its vast fossil fuel reserves to meet the demands of our evolving technologies.

So whether you’re scrolling through Instagram or using a chatbot, remember that oil and natural gas are making that possible and will for years to come.

—MELISSA SIMPSON

President, Western Energy Alliance

The U.S. is facing both a greater need for more energy and an urgent need to address climate change. Energy policy focused only on oil and natural gas drilling isn’t sustainable. The future demands that we diversify energy sources by developing renewables such as wind and solar instead of expanding fossil fuel extraction.

The Trump administration has prioritized more of our public lands and waters for oil and natural gas drilling. New drilling projects, in addition to hindering the fight against climate change, would expose places such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or national monuments to destruction. Under new leasing rules, these places would be prioritized for drilling instead of for things like camping, wildlife preservation, and renewable energy production.

The intention of increased drilling is to boost domestic energy production while lowering costs at the pump. But it’s not likely to have either effect.

Both global and U.S. energy production is already at an all-time high. For that reason, oil companies are reluctant to increase drilling operations because of the law of supply and demand: A greater oil supply usually means lower prices for everyday Americans, but it also means lower profits for the oil companies. They’re now producing oil on less than half the 35 million acres of public lands for which they own leases.

Meanwhile, the rest of the world is discovering that clean energy is the future. Renewables are now more affordable than fossil fuel, according to a recent United Nations report. Solar energy is 41 percent cheaper to produce; offshore wind is 53 percent cheaper. And these costs will continue to fall.

The U.S. can’t drill its way to energy independence or lower prices. We need to get back to building the clean energy economy, and this will require the leadership of young people, many of whom have been fighting for climate action for most of their lives.

“Say no to gas tax hikes” and “Stop the gas tax” are taglines the No Tax Oregon campaign is using. They are collecting signatures in hopes of letting voters decide about the transportation bill (House Bill 3991) the Oregon Legislature passed and Gov. Tina Kotek in early November signed.

No one likes additional taxes/fees; however, infrastructure, services and personnel cost money.

I reviewed my fuel purchase records for the past four years (mid-November to mid-November) to determine how the increased gas tax would affect me. Based on an additional 6 cents per gallon, it averaged out to $1.06 per month more at the pump. I could easily find that in the center console and floor of my Jeep.

Along with the gas tax increase, other provisions of HB 3991 that will impact my pocketbook include an additional $42 for vehicle registration fees (paid every two years, which averages out to $1.75 per month) and doubling the 0.1% payroll tax to support public transport for two years (an average of $2.25 more per month).

Based on my records, the tax/fees associated with the transportation bill will increase my monthly expenditures by $5.06, which would be reduced to $2.81 after the increased public transit tax sunsets on Jan. 1, 2028 (or sooner if I retire).

What about enhanced premium tax credits?

Although it’s a federal issue, I can’t understand why supporters of No Tax Oregon aren’t all up in arms about the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits, which are set to expire on Dec. 31. According to Oregon.gov, “enhanced premium tax credits were created in 2021 through the American Rescue Plan Act and extended through 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Act.”

While I became eligible for Medicare earlier this year, my husband still gets his coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace. I purposely waited to shop for John’s 2026 plan in hopes that the tax credit issue would be resolved.

When I logged onto healthcare.gov on Dec. 1, I learned that without the enhanced tax credits, the monthly premium for the same plan John had this year would have cost 65% more in 2026. We selected a different plan with less coverage to keep the premium cost about the same for the coming year.

Is it political?

A Facebook friend who is active in soliciting signatures for No Tax Oregon claims the effort doesn’t involve partisan politics.

“This is not about Democrat or Republican people, this is about our financial future! Please, don’t confuse the two,” Carol Greene wrote on Nov. 19 when sharing a post by Rick Dancer, who lost a bid in November 2008 as the Republican candidate for Oregon secretary of state.

A Hillsboro native and longtime journalist/TV news anchor, Dancer’s post was titled, “The Oregon Deep State is Shaking.” Although he has resided in Montana for several years, Dancer obviously still follows Oregon politics and freely shares his opinion, saying the objective of this referendum effort is “to stop the Democrats and their leader, Tina Kotek, from implementing the 4.3 billion dollar tax increase.”

Sounds pretty political to me. Dancer slams Democrats and party leaders in his more than 500-word diatribe, including providing advice to those signing/collecting signatures for the petition.

“The state is against this and wants to find reasons to invalidate your signature,” he wrote.

Doing the math was eye-opening. The amount I would pay over two years toward the transportation bill — including an additional $139 should I purchase a new vehicle — comes to $260.44. While the extra amount to cover just one month without the enhanced premium tax credits for my husband’s health insurance had we kept his same plan would have been $253.

To reiterate, the amounts reflect the cost for two full years compared to one single month. And that is why it baffles me that supporters of No Tax Oregon haven’t made so much as a squawk about the end of enhanced premium tax credits for the Affordable Care Act.

There’s a push from the Wisconsin Capitol to end emissions testing in the state.

A number of Republican lawmakers this week wrote to the state’s congressional delegation, asking that they end the portion of the Clean Air Act that requires drivers in southeast Wisconsin get their cars and trucks tested each year.

“The vehicle inspection and maintenance program is no longer useful due to the economic burdens on citizens and technological advancements reducing the need for testing. If successful, this would allow Wisconsin to end this regulatory burden that has been enacted since 1984 on seven southeastern counties,” lawmakers wrote in their letter.

State Rep. Bob Donovan, R-Greenfield, said he wants clean air as much as the next person. But he said the emissions testing law simply doesn't work.

""But if a program can't even prove after 40 years that it's made a difference, that concerns me. And we all breathe the same air, yet if you live across the street from a county in this program, well, you don't have to partake in it. So, to me, it's negligible what we gain from this. That's why I think it's important the federal government reevaluate it,"" Donovan said.

Currently only people who live in Kenosha, Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Racine, Sheboygan, Washington and Waukesha counties, and drive cars and trucks made after 1996 have to get an emissions test.

And very few of them fail.

""In 2021 and 2022, only 3.1% and 3% of all vehicles tested failed inspection. When broken down by categories, we see the technological advancements more clearly.

“It makes an excellent, leak-proof storage place for hydrogen.” It’s the single largest green hydrogen project “in the world, and it's operational now,” he said.
L.A.’s power experiment comes at a time when the outlook for carbon-free green hydrogen, at least in the U.S., has dimmed.
But LADWP is convinced that conventional pollution-filtering systems already used at natural gas power plants can handle it.
“In 2003, L.A.'s energy supply was 3% renewable energy and over 50% coal,” she said.","Los Angeles has officially stopped using electricity generated from coal and is about to fire up the first large-scale plant making power from both green hydrogen and natural gas as the second-largest U.S. city works to get all of its energy from carbon-free sources by 2035.

“I can officially say that Los Angeles is no longer powered by coal-fueled energy,” Mayor Karen Bass said at a briefing on Thursday, joined by the head of LADWP, the country’s biggest municipal utility, and other officials. “Last week, the Intermountain Power Project in Utah delivered the last coal-fueled energy to our city.”

Starting in January, that same facility in Delta, Utah, will instead send electricity to Los Angeles generated from turbines powered by combusting a blend of natural gas and hydrogen. Initially, the goal is to run a mix of 70% gas and 30% hydrogen. But over time, the city-owned utility plans to transition to 100% hydrogen, made from water and renewable power on site and stored in a vast underground salt cavern adjacent to the plant, said David Hanson, who manages power projects for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.

“We’ve used the Intermountain Power Project since the 1980s. It's built on top of a salt cavern. They knew it all along, but no one really cared,” Hanson told Forbes. The utility’s partners in the project are already making hydrogen and storing it in the cavern, which Hanson said is about the size of the Empire State Building. “It makes an excellent, leak-proof storage place for hydrogen.”

It’s the single largest green hydrogen project “in the world, and it's operational now,” he said.

L.A.’s power experiment comes at a time when the outlook for carbon-free green hydrogen, at least in the U.S., has dimmed. It’s more expensive to produce compared to making industrial hydrogen by splitting natural gas, which is cheap but produces large amounts of byproduct carbon pollution. The Trump administration also hasn’t been supportive, cancelling federal funding for so-called hydrogen hubs in California and the Pacific Northwest that were intended to improve large-scale production and use of clean hydrogen.

L.A.’s project has been in the works since 2022, when it won a $504 million loan guarantee from Biden’s Energy Department for the Utah facility, with its equipment already installed and running. Its electrolyzers which split water, a process that releases only oxygen as a byproduct, were supplied by the U.S. arm of Mitsubishi Power and sourced from China, said Kevin Peng, an LADWP project director.

“At the scale we were building – 220 megawatts – there was no facility anywhere in the United States that could supply them,” he said. When the first phase is fully operational, the system will produce 21 million kilograms of hydrogen a year. In addition to the Utah project, next year LADWP will begin converting power stations at its Scattergood Generating Station in West Los Angeles to burn hydrogen instead of natural gas.

When hydrogen is used in a fuel cell to make carbon-free electricity, such as in spacecraft or cars like Toyota’s Mirai sedan, water is the only byproduct. When burned, however, it produces water as well as nitrogen oxides (NOx), an air pollutant. But LADWP is convinced that conventional pollution-filtering systems already used at natural gas power plants can handle it.

“There's a misconception around how much emissions actually come out of hydrogen,” Peng said. The Utah plant will use the latest selective catalytic reduction systems to keep NOx and all the other emissions “way below permitting limits. Plus, we get the added benefit of zero CO2,” he said.

And that’s the city’s ultimate goal, Bass said. “In 2003, L.A.'s energy supply was 3% renewable energy and over 50% coal,” she said. “Today, just over 20 years later, our city is powered by 60% carbon-free energy and again, 0% coal.”

The move, Farley says, gives automakers the breathing room to produce more affordable vehicles in the United States without walking away from electric innovation or efficiency goals.
“And we will invest more in affordable vehicles.
This allows us to invest in affordable vehicles made in the U.S., which we will take the lead on and will allow us to make vehicles more affordable.” Trump, sitting beside him, said, “People were brainwashed.
Now, the market waits to see if automakers really do deliver on their promises of rolling out more affordable models.","Ford CEO Jim Farley has joined several of his American counterparts in supporting the Trump administration’s decision to reset federal fuel-economy standards.

The move, Farley says, gives automakers the breathing room to produce more affordable vehicles in the United States without walking away from electric innovation or efficiency goals.

Farley’s core argument seems to be that regulations were so strict that they effectively squeezed automakers out of the low-cost segments so many buyers still rely on.

Speaking at a press conference with President Donald J. Trump on Thursday, Farley called the update “a victory for affordability and common sense,” adding that Ford will now be able to offer cheaper versions of its most popular models and launch new price-focused products.

“We believe that people should be able to make a choice, as you said, Mr. President,” Farley said. “And we will invest more in affordable vehicles. This allows us to invest in affordable vehicles made in the U.S., which we will take the lead on and will allow us to make vehicles more affordable.”

Trump, sitting beside him, said, “People were brainwashed. This is a ‘green new scam.’ And people were paying too much for a car that didn’t work as well. And now they’re gonna have a great car that’s gonna be environmentally friendly, but it’s gonna cost you a lot less and it’s gonna work great. All of the nonsense is being taken out of the cars.”

Political Theater or Market Reality?

Farley stopped short of framing the move as an ideological shift, instead focusing on the economics. He argued that the tightened CAFE standards under the previous administration imposed costs that made entry-level vehicles much harder to justify.

That pressure, he said, pushed automakers toward higher-margin EVs and hybrids simply to meet fleet targets.

“What you should know is that this is a victory for affordability and common sense. As the president said, we will be able to offer more affordability on our popular models, and we’ll be able to launch new vehicles built in America that are more affordable because of this rule change,” Farley said later in an interview on “Fox & Friends” Thursday.

Farley added that the earlier fuel-economy system “was totally out of touch with market reality.” Automakers, he said, were forced to sell EVs and other vehicles to stay compliant, even when customer demand wasn’t there.

“We were forced to sell EVs and other vehicles. We’re not going back to gas-guzzlers,” he continued. “We have a lot of EVs and a lot of hybrids at Ford, but now customers get a chance to choose what they want, not by what we force on them.”

Balancing Choice and Compliance

Ford’s CEO also clarified that the company isn’t returning to inefficient gas models, noting it already sells a wide range of EVs and hybrids. GM’s CEO Mary Barra recently made similar comments.

Also: GM’s Mary Barra Promises Cleaner Engines, But Looser Rules Fuel More Gas Guzzlers

The reset rolls back the steep increases introduced under the Biden administration, which raised fuel-economy requirements by 8% for 2024 and 2025 and 10% for 2026. Federal officials previously estimated those rules would add nearly $1,000 to the average new-car price.

By contrast, the new standard lowers compliance costs and, according to the White House, will save American families a combined $109 billion. Now, the market waits to see if automakers really do deliver on their promises of rolling out more affordable models.

The hearing, titled “Unleashing American Energy Dominance and Exploring New Frontiers,” addressed the urgent need for the development of domestic capabilities for processing critical minerals and rare earth elements essential for defense applications, artificial intelligence (AI), energy technologies including power, and advanced manufacturing.

Konduru’s testimony emphasized that Momentum’s proprietary Membrane Solvent Extraction (MSX®) technology offers a domestic processing solution that can help eliminate America’s dangerous dependence on China for critical minerals processing. Konduru detailed how these materials are essential to America’s most advanced defense systems, including F-35 fighter jets, precision-guided munitions, hypersonic actuators, drones, and next-generation autonomous systems.

At its Carrollton, TX facility, Momentum has demonstrated the ability to process critical minerals and rare earth elements such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper from mines, batteries, magnets, byproducts of coal mining, and other sources, as well as the ability to separate both light and heavy rare earths, including terbium and dysprosium – capabilities very few companies outside China have demonstrated. To sustain growth, Momentum is partnering with Texas universities to build a domestic workforce pipeline of engineers, chemists, operators, and AI-driven process specialists, training the next generation of American mineral-processing talent.

Konduru told the Subcommittee,

The biggest threat to the ‘mine-to-magnet’ and ‘mine-to-battery’ supply chain is the processing bottleneck,

“90% of critical minerals and rare earths are separated and processed in China. This means even if the metal is mined in the U.S., it is going to China for processing, and then shipped back to the U.S. for final product generation.”

In his testimony, Konduru highlighted that modular MSX plants can be permitted and built in approximately one year, versus 3-5 years for conventional processing facilities, and can be co-located directly at mines, battery plants, magnet producers, or remote defense sites. Konduru noted that this bottom-up, scalable model mirrors how China built its dominance and represents how America can catch up and surpass that approach with speed.

Konduru, said:

We want to take China out of the equation,

“Our focus is to deliver safe, scalable, sustainable, and commercially attractive processing technology that strengthens domestic supply resilience for critical minerals and rare earths.”

Konduru urged Congress to provide catalytic government capital for the development of a network of flexible, modular processing sites rather than waiting for only mega-projects, emphasizing that targeted bipartisan support can move the U.S. from dependence on foreign adversaries to leadership in critical-minerals processing, strengthening energy security, national defense, and American innovation.

A recent TIME article warns that governments must act now to prevent damaging disruptions to industries ranging from power grids to jet engines, advocating for the same international coordination forged after the 1973 oil crisis to be applied to critical minerals today. This context underscores the strategic importance of companies working to secure domestic supply chains for these essential materials.

Ucore Rare Metals Inc. is positioning itself as a key player in addressing this challenge by advancing U.S.-based rare earth separation capacity. The company is developing its Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex utilizing proprietary RapidSX™ technology, designed specifically to reduce dependence on overseas refining bottlenecks that currently dominate the market. This initiative comes at a critical time as nations recognize the strategic vulnerability of relying on concentrated foreign sources for materials essential to defense, technology, and green energy applications.

The company’s approach focuses on disrupting the People’s Republic of China’s control of the North American rare earth element supply chain through near-term development of processing facilities in strategic locations. Beyond the Louisiana facility, Ucore plans subsequent strategic metals complexes in Canada and Alaska, along with longer-term development of its 100% controlled Bokan-Dotson Ridge Rare Heavy REE Project on Prince of Wales Island in Southeast Alaska. These facilities aim to provide best-in-class metal separation products and services to the mining and mineral extraction industry while creating domestic processing capacity.

For decades, corn has reigned over American agriculture. It sprawls across 90 million acres — about the size of Montana — and goes into everything from livestock feed and processed foods to the ethanol blended into most of the nation’s gasoline.

But a growing body of research reveals that America’s obsession with corn has a steep price: The fertilizer used to grow it is warming the planet and contaminating water.

Corn is essential to the rural economy and to the world’s food supply, and researchers say the problem isn’t the corn itself. It’s how we grow it.

Corn farmers rely on heavy fertilizer use to sustain today’s high yields. And when that nitrogen breaks down in the soil, it releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Producing nitrogen fertilizer also emits large amounts of carbon dioxide, adding to its climate footprint.

Agriculture accounts for more than 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and corn uses more than two-thirds of all nitrogen fertilizer nationwide — making it the leading driver of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions, studies show.

The corn and ethanol industries insist that rapid growth in ethanol — which now consumes more than 40% of the U.S. corn crop — is a net environmental benefit, and they strongly dispute research suggesting otherwise.

Since 2000, U.S. corn production has surged almost 50%, further adding to the crop’s climate impact.

Yet the environmental costs of corn rarely make headlines or factor into political debates. Much of the dynamic traces back to federal policy — and to the powerful corn and ethanol lobby that helped shape it.

The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed in the mid 2000s, required that gasoline be blended with ethanol, a biofuel that in the United States comes almost entirely from corn. That mandate drove up demand and prices for corn, spurring farmers to plant more of it.

Many plant corn year after year on the same land. The practice, called “continuous corn,” demands massive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer and drives especially high nitrous oxide emissions.

At the same time, federal subsidies make it more lucrative to grow corn than to diversify. Taxpayers have covered more than $50 billion in corn insurance premiums over the past 30 years, according to federal data compiled by the Environmental Working Group.

Researchers say proven conservation steps — such as planting rows of trees, shrubs and grasses in corn fields — could sharply reduce these emissions. But the Trump administration has eliminated many of the incentives that helped farmers try such practices.

Experts say it all raises a larger question: If America’s most widely planted crop is worsening climate change, shouldn’t we begin growing it a different way?

How corn took over America

Corn has been a staple of U.S. agriculture for centuries, first domesticated by Native Americans and later used by European immigrants as a versatile crop for food and animal feed. Its production really took off in the 2000s after federal mandates and incentives helped turn much of America’s corn crop into ethanol.

Corn’s dominance — and the emissions that come with it — didn’t happen by accident. It was built through a high-dollar lobbying campaign that continues today.

In the late 1990s, America’s corn farmers were in trouble. Prices had cratered amid a global grain glut and the Asian financial crisis. A 1999 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said crop prices had hit “rock bottom.”

In 2001 and 2002, the federal government gave corn farmers and ethanol producers a boost — first through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Bioenergy Program, which paid ethanol producers to increase their use of farm commodities for fuel. Then the 2002 Farm Bill created programs that continue to support ethanol and other renewable energy.

Corn growers soon after mounted an all-out campaign in Washington. Their goal: persuade Congress to require gasoline to be blended with ethanol. State and national grower groups lobbied relentlessly, pitching ethanol as a way to cut greenhouse gasses, reduce oil dependence and revive rural economies.

“We got down to a couple of votes in Congress, and the corn growers were united like never before,” recalled Jon Doggett, then the industry’s chief lobbyist, in an article published by the National Corn Growers Association. “I started receiving calls from Capitol Hill saying, ‘Would you have your growers stop calling us? We are with you.’ I had not seen anything like it before and haven’t seen anything like it since.”

Their persistence paid off. In 2005, Congress created the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires that a certain amount of ethanol be blended into U.S. gasoline each year. Two years later, lawmakers expanded it further. The policy transformed the market: The amount of corn used for ethanol domestically has more than tripled in the past 20 years.

When demand for corn spiked as a result of the RFS, it pushed up prices worldwide, said Tim Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. The result, Searchinger said, is that more land around the world got cleared to grow corn. That, in turn, resulted in more emissions.

That lobbying brought clout. “King Corn” became a political force, courted by presidential hopefuls and protected by both parties. Since 2010, national corn and ethanol trade groups have spent more than $55 million on lobbying and millions more on political donations, according to campaign finance records analyzed by Floodlight.

In 2024 alone, those trade groups spent twice as much on lobbying as the National Rifle Association. Major industry players — Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and ethanol giant POET among them — have poured even more into Washington, ensuring the sector’s voice remains one of the loudest in U.S. agriculture.

Now those same groups are pushing for the next big prize: expanding higher-ethanol gasoline blends and positioning ethanol-based jet fuel as aviation’s “low-carbon” future.

Research undercuts ethanol’s clean-fuel claims

Corn and ethanol trade groups didn’t make their officials available for interviews.

But on their websites and in their literature, they have promoted corn ethanol as a climate-friendly fuel.

The Renewable Fuels Association cites government and university research that finds burning ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40-50% compared with gasoline. The ethanol industry says the climate critics have it wrong — and that most of the corn used for fuel comes from better yields and smarter farming, not from plowing up new land. The amount of fertilizer required to produce a bushel of corn has dropped sharply in recent decades, they say.

“Ethanol reduces carbon emissions, removing the carbon equivalent of 12 million cars from the road each year,” according to the Renewable Fuels Association.

Growth Energy, a major ethanol trade group, said in a written statement that U.S. farmers and biofuel producers are “constantly finding new ways to make their operations more efficient and more environmentally beneficial,” using things like cover crops to reduce their carbon footprint.

The group also criticized studies questioning ethanol’s climate impact as relying on “cherry-picked data and disproven premises.”

But independent research tells a different story.

A recent Environmental Working Group report finds that the way corn is grown in much of the Midwest — with the same fields planted in corn year after year — carries a heavy climate cost.

Research in 2022 by agricultural land use expert Tyler Lark and colleagues links the Renewable Fuel Standard to expanded corn cultivation, heavier fertilizer use, worsening water pollution and increased emissions. Scientists typically convert greenhouse gasses like nitrous oxide and methane into their carbon-dioxide equivalents — or carbon intensity — so their warming impacts can be compared on the same scale.

“The carbon intensity of corn ethanol produced under the RFS is no less than gasoline and likely at least 24% higher,” the authors concluded.

A 2017 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the RFS was unlikely to meet its greenhouse gas goals because the U.S. relies predominantly on corn ethanol and produces relatively little of the cleaner, advanced biofuels made from waste.

The problem isn’t just emissions, researchers say. Corn ethanol requires millions of acres that could instead be used for food crops or more efficient energy sources. One recent study found that solar panels can generate as much energy as corn ethanol on roughly 3% of the land.

“It’s just a terrible use of land,” Searchinger, the Princeton researcher, said of ethanol. “And you can’t solve climate change if you’re going to make such terrible use of land.”

Most of the country’s top crop isn’t feeding people. More than 40% of U.S. corn goes to ethanol. A similar amount is used to feed livestock, and just 12% ends up as food or in other uses.

As corn production rises, so have emissions

Globally, corn production doubled from 2000 to 2021.

That growth has been fueled by fertilizer, which emits nitrous oxide that can linger in the atmosphere for more than a century. That eats away at the ozone layer, which blocks most of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation.

Global emissions have soared alongside corn production. Between 1980 and 2020, nitrous oxide emissions from human activity climbed 40%, the Global Carbon project found.

In the United States, nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture in 2022 were equal to roughly 262 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the EPA’s inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. That’s equivalent to putting almost 56 million passenger cars on the road.

The biggest increases are coming straight from the Corn Belt.

Ethanol’s climate footprint isn’t the only concern. The nitrogen used to grow corn and other crops is also a key source of drinking water pollution.

According to a new report by the Alliance for the Great Lakes and Clean Wisconsin, more than 90% of nitrate contamination in Wisconsin’s groundwater is linked to agricultural sources — mostly synthetic fertilizer and manure.

The same analysis estimates that in 2022, farmers applied more than 16 million pounds of nitrogen beyond what crops needed, sending runoff into wells, streams and other water systems.

For families like Tyler Frye’s, that hits close to home. In 2022, Frye and his wife moved into a new home in the rural village of Casco, Wisconsin, about 20 miles east of Green Bay. A free test soon afterward found their well water had nitrate levels more than twice the EPA’s safe limit. “We were pretty shocked,” he said.

Frye installed a reverse-osmosis system in the basement and still buys bottled water for his wife, who is breastfeeding their daughter, born in July.

One likely culprit, he suspects, are the cornfields less than 200 yards from his home.

“Crops like corn require a lot of nitrogen,” he said. “A lot of that stuff, I assume, is getting into the well water and surface water.”

When he watches manure or fertilizer being spread on nearby fields, he said, one question nags him: “Where does that go?”

What cleaner corn could look like

Reducing corn’s climate footprint is possible — but the farmers trying to do it are swimming against the policy tide.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, backed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, strips out the provisions of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that had rewarded farmers for climate-friendly practices.

And in April, Trump’s USDA canceled the $3 billion Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities initiative, a grant program designed to promote farming and forestry practices to improve soil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agency said that the program’s administrative costs meant too little money was reaching farmers, while Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins dismissed it as part of the “green new scam.”

University of Iowa professor Silvia Secchi said the rollback of the Climate-Smart program has already given farmers “cold feet” about adopting conservation practices. “The impact of this has been devastating,” said Secchi, a natural resources economist who teaches at the university’s School of Earth, Environment and Sustainability.

Research shows what’s possible if farmers had support. In its recent report, the Environmental Working Group found that four proven conservation practices — including planting trees, shrubs and hedgerows in corn fields — could make a measurable difference.

Implementing those practices on just 4% of continuous corn acres across Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin would cut total greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of taking more than 850,000 gasoline cars off the road, EWG found.

Despite setbacks at the federal level, some farmers are already showing what a more climate-friendly Corn Belt could look like.

In northern Iowa, Wendy Johnson farms 1,200 acres of corn and soybeans with her father. On 130 of those acres, she’s trying something different: She’s planting fruit and nut trees, organic grains, shrubs and other plants that need little or no nitrogen fertilizer.

“The more perennials we can have on the ground, the better it is for the climate,” she said.

Across the rest of the farm, they enrich the soil by rotating crops and planting cover crops. They’ve also converted less productive parts of the fields into “prairie strips” — bands of prairie grass that store carbon and require no fertilizer.

Under the now-cancelled Climate-Smart grant program, they were supposed to receive technical assistance and about $20,000 a year to expand those practices. The grant program was terminated before they got any of the money.

“It’s hard to take risks on your own,” Johnson said. “That’s where federal support really helps. Because agriculture is a high-risk occupation.”

The economics still favor business as usual. Johnson knows that many Midwestern corn growers feel pressure to maximize yields, keeping them hooked on corn — and nitrogen fertilizer.

“I think a lot of farmers around here are very allergic to trees,” she joked.

In southeast Iowa, sixth-generation farmer Levi Lyle, who mixes organic and conventional methods across 290 acres, uses a three-year rotation, extensive cover crops and a technique called roller-crimping — flattening rye each spring to create a mulch that suppresses weeds, feeds the soil and reduces fertilizer needs.

“The roller crimping of cover crops is a huge, huge opportunity to sequester more carbon, improve soil health, save money on chemicals and still get a similar yield,” he said.

But farmers get few government incentives to take such climate-friendly steps, Lyle said. “There is a lack of seriousness about supporting farmers to implement these new practices,” he said.

And without federal programs to offset the risk, the innovations that Lyle and Johnson are trying remain exceptions — not the norm.

Many farmers still see prairie strips or patches of trees as a waste, said Luke Gran, whose company helps Iowa farmers establish perennials.

“My eyes do not lie,” Gran said. “I have not seen extensive change to cover cropping or tillage across the broad acreage of this state that I love.”

The next corn boom?

Despite mounting research about corn’s climate costs, industry groups are pushing for policies to boost ethanol demand.

One big priority: Pushing a bill to require that new cars are able to run on gas with more ethanol than what’s commonly sold today.

Corn and biofuel trade groups have also been pressing Democrats and Republicans in Congress for legislation to pave the way for ethanol-based jet fuel. While use of such “sustainable” aviation fuel is still in its early stages domestically, corn and biofuel associations have made developing a market for it a top policy priority.

Secchi, the Iowa professor, says it’s easy to see why ethanol producers are trying to expand their market: The growth in electric vehicles threatens long-term gasoline sales.

Researchers warn that producing enough ethanol-based jet fuel could trigger major land-use shifts. A 2024 World Resources Institute analysis found that meeting the federal goal of 35 billion gallons of ethanol jet fuel would require about 114 million acres of corn — roughly 20% more corn acreage than the U.S. already plants for all purposes. That surge in demand, the authors concluded, would push up food prices and worsen hunger.

Secchi calls that scenario a climate and land-use “disaster.” Large-scale use of ethanol-based aviation fuel, she said, would mean clearing even more land and pouring on even more nitrogen fertilizer, driving up greenhouse gas emissions.

“The result,” she said, “would be essentially to enshrine this dysfunctional system that we created.”

Connecticut has long occupied a distinctive position in the U.S. economy — small in geography, but large in talent, innovation, and economic diversity. From its highly educated workforce and concentration of advanced industries to its strategic access to major markets, the state offers a unique environment for companies seeking long-term, sustainable growth. Yet too often, businesses selecting new sites or expanding operations begin their search with a narrow question: Where is the cheapest place to operate? Although cost is undeniably a factor in any business decision, it should not be the primary driver, especially now, when technology and automation drive business success. In fact, choosing a location based solely on cost can undermine a company’s ability to grow, attract talent, innovate, and remain competitive over time.

A more strategic approach, and one that Connecticut exemplifies, begins with a deeper question: Which location’s assets best align with the function we need this business unit to perform? This shift in thinking encourages companies to match their operational needs with local strengths: workforce capabilities, industry clusters, transportation infrastructure, academic research, supply-chain connectivity, and overall quality of life. When businesses approach location strategy this way, they not only reduce long-term risk but also position themselves for higher productivity and stronger returns.

Connecticut’s Asset-Driven Advantages

Connecticut’s economic potential stems from several interlocking assets that support the full spectrum of modern industry. First, the state has one of the most educated workforces in the country. With major universities, research institutions, and a steady pipeline of STEM graduates, Connecticut consistently ranks at the top for workforce quality. Companies in aerospace, bioscience, insurance and financial services, advanced manufacturing, and technology rely heavily on specialized talent, and Connecticut delivers.

Connecticut’s location is strategically unmatched, situated directly between New York City and Boston, giving companies access to two of the world’s most dynamic economic centers while avoiding many of their operational challenges and, yes, high costs. For companies that depend on proximity to clients, partners, investors, or distribution networks, the state’s highways, commuter and freight rail access, ports, and airports make it easy to compete regionally, nationally, and globally.

Lastly, Connecticut has cultivated strong industry clusters, groups of interconnected companies, suppliers, academic partners, and research organizations. Aerospace and defense firms benefit from decades of engineering expertise centered around companies like Pratt & Whitney, Sikorsky, and Electric Boat. Bioscience companies — especially in the fields of gene therapy, medical research, and pharmaceutical development — leverage the resources of Yale, UConn, and a growing network of labs, incubators, and startups. Insurance and fintech firms tap into the highest concentrations of actuarial and financial talent in the country. The next generation of AI-enabling quantum computing research and development is centered around Yale, one of the first and few quantum institutes in the world. These clusters are not incidental; they generate innovation, reduce barriers to collaboration, and accelerate the development of new products and technologies.

Due to Connecticut’s size, we are often referred to as the “One Phone Call State,” which is also a strategic advantage for our businesses. Our strong business networks and uniquely accessible governmental structures allow any company to be quite literally one call away from the right person to address their needs.

Why Cost-Based Decisions Fall Short

Companies often believe that choosing a low-cost location will increase profitability and reduce expenses, but in practice, businesses that prioritize cost above all else often face hidden long-term challenges. Labor shortages, low workforce skill levels, limited infrastructure, and weak industry connections can increase training costs, slow R&D, disrupt operations, and make hiring more difficult. Over time, these issues erode the very savings that motivated the move. Companies who located operations overseas have come to understand that costs balance out eventually, and markets that were once low cost inevitably, and quickly, experience cost increases.

In contrast, when a company aligns its location with the capabilities it needs to innovate and compete — be it engineering expertise, logistics connectivity, proximity to research labs, or a dense network of industry peers — it reduces operational friction and enhances performance. Productivity rises, innovation accelerates, recruiting becomes easier, turnover decreases. In many cases, the right environment creates opportunities that far outweigh cost considerations.

Connecticut as a Case Study in Asset Matching

Connecticut’s economic development strategy emphasizes this idea: helping companies find the right home based on the assets it needs to be successful and thrive long term. When a biotech firm chooses Connecticut, it is choosing the state because it offers access to world-class researchers, clinical trial networks, wet-lab space, and highly specialized talent. When an aerospace manufacturer expands here, it benefits from decades of precision engineering expertise, established supplier networks, and deep institutional knowledge that cannot be replicated in lower-cost regions. When an insurance company locates here, they find a welcoming regulatory structure that was purpose-built for the industry. And when technology firms set up operations in the state, they do so to access a skilled workforce, proximity to major markets, and a supportive innovation ecosystem.

A Smart, Asset-Driven Future

As the economy evolves, companies that make location decisions based on long-term strategic fit, not short-term savings, will lead their industries. Connecticut’s assets support this kind of thinking. The state’s educated workforce, depth of research capacity, industry clusters, and strong quality of life position it as an ideal location for companies that want to grow intelligently, innovate continuously, and build resilience.

Choosing a location intentionally, based on what a region offers rather than what it costs, is the strategic way to make a location decision. It is a foundation for lasting competitive advantage.

When fire broke out at the world’s largest battery energy storage facility in January 2025, its thick smoke blanketed surrounding wetlands, farms and nearby communities on the central California coast.

Highways closed, residents evacuated and firefighters could do little but watch as debris and ash rained down. People living in the area reported headaches and respiratory problems, and some pets and livestock fell ill.

Two days later, officials announced that the air quality met federal safety standards. But the initial all-clear decision missed something important – heavy metal fallout on the ground.

When battery energy storage facilities burn, the makeup of the chemical fallout can be a mystery for surrounding communities. Yet, these batteries often contain metals that are toxic to humans and wildlife.

The smoke plume from the fire in Vistra’s battery energy storage facility at Moss Landing released not just hazardous gases such as hydrogen fluoride but also soot and charred fragments of burned batteries that landed for miles around.

I am a marine geologist who has been tracking soil changes in marshes adjacent to the Vistra facility for over a decade as part of a wetland-restoration project. In a new study published in the journal Scientific Reports, my colleagues and I were able to show through detailed before-and-after samples from the marshes what was in the battery fire’s debris and what happened to the heavy metals.

The batteries’ metal fragments, often too tiny to see with the naked eye, didn’t disappear. They continue to be remobilized in the environment today.

What’s inside the batteries

Moss Landing, at the edge of Monterey Bay, has long been shaped by industry – a mix of power generation and intensive agriculture on the edge of a delicate coastal ecosystem.

The Vistra battery storage facility rose on the site of an old Duke Energy and PG&E gas power plant, which was once filled with turbines and oil tanks. When Vistra announced it was converting the site into the world’s largest lithium-ion battery facility, the plan was hailed as a clean energy milestone. Phase 1 alone housed batteries with 300 megawatts of capacity, enough to power about 225,000 homes for four hours.

The energy in rechargeable batteries comes from the flow of electrons released by lithium atoms in the anode moving toward the cathode.

In the type of batteries at the Moss Landing facility, the cathode was rich in three metals: nickel, manganese and cobalt. These batteries are prized for their high energy density and relatively low cost, but they are also prone to thermal runaway.

Lab experiments have shown that burning batteries can eject metal particles like confetti.

Metals found in wetlands matched batteries

When my team and I returned to the marsh three days after the fire, ash and burned debris covered the ground. Weeks afterward, charred fragments still clung to the vegetation.

Our measurements with portable X-ray fluorescence showed sharp increases in nickel, manganese and cobalt compared with data from before the fire. As soon as we saw the numbers, we alerted officials in four counties about the risk.

We estimate that about 25 metric tons (55,000 pounds) of heavy metals were deposited across roughly half a square mile (1.2 square kilometers) of wetland around Elkorn Slough, and that was only part of the area that saw fallout.

To put this in perspective, the part of the Vistra battery facility that burned was hosting 300 megawatts of batteries, which equates to roughly 1,900 metric tons of cathode material. Estimates of the amount of batteries that burned range from 55% to 80%. Based on those estimates, roughly 1,000 to 1,400 metric tons of cathode material could have been carried into the smoke plume. What we found in the marsh represents about 2% of what may have been released.

We took samples at hundreds of locations and examined millimeter-thin soil slices with a scanning electron microscope. Those slices revealed metallic particles smaller than one-tenth the width of a human hair – small enough to travel long distances and lodge deep in the lungs.

The ratio of nickel to cobalt in these particles matched that of nickel, manganese and cobalt battery cathodes, clearly linking the contamination to the fire.

Over the following months, we found that surface concentrations of the metals dropped sharply after major rain and tidal events, but the metals did not disappear. They were remobilized. Some migrated to the main channel of the estuary and may have been flushed out into the ocean. Some of the metals that settled in the estuary could enter the food chain in this wildlife hot spot, often populated with sea otters, harbor seals, pelicans and herons.

Making battery storage safer as it expands

The fire at Moss Landing and its fallout hold lessons for other communities, first responders and the design of future lithium-ion battery systems, which are proliferating as utilities seek to balance renewable power and demand peaks.

When fires break out, emergency responders need to know what they’re dealing with. A California law passed after the fire helps address this by requiring strengthening containment and monitoring at large battery installations and meetings with local fire officials before new facilities open.

Newer lithium-ion batteries that use iron phosphate cathodes are also considered safer from fire risk. These are becoming more common for utility-scale energy storage than batteries with nickel, manganese and cobalt, though they store less energy.

How soil is tested is also important. At Moss Landing, some of the government’s sampling turned up low concentrations of the metals, likely because the samples came from broad, mixed layers that diluted the concentration of metals rather than the thin surface deposits where contaminants settled.

Continuing risks to marine life

Metals from the Moss Landing battery fire still linger in the region’s sediments and food webs.

These metals bioaccumulate, building up through the food chain: The metals in marsh soils can be taken up by worms and small invertebrates, which are eaten by fish, crabs or shorebirds, and eventually by top predators such as sea otters or harbor seals.

Our research group is now tracking the bioaccumulation in Elkhorn Slough’s shellfish, crabs and fish. Because uptake varies among species and seasons, the effect of the metals on ecosystems will take months or years to emerge.

The project teams will receive up to $800 million in federal cost-shared funding to advance initial projects in Tennessee and Michigan, while also facilitating additional follow-on projects and associated supply chains.

“President Trump has made clear that America is going to build more energy, not less, and nuclear is central to that mission,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “Advanced light-water SMRs will give our nation the reliable, round-the-clock power we need to fuel the President’s manufacturing boom, support data centers and AI growth, and reinforce a stronger, more secure electric grid. These awards ensure we can deploy these reactors as soon as possible.”

In March 2025, DOE issued a $900 million solicitation to de-risk the deployment of Gen III+ SMRs and the remaining $100 million will be awarded later this year to support additional deployments and address key barriers in design, licensing, supply chain, and site readiness.

Holtec plans to deploy two SMR-300 reactors at the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station site in Covert, Michigan, in an effort to demonstrate viability for additional orders both domestically and abroad. Holtec fulfills the roles of technology vendor, supply chain vendor, nuclear plant constructor in partnership with Hyundai Engineering & Construction, plant operator, and electricity merchant selling the power to near-by utilities and end-users.

What else has Holtec been up to?

Factor This Power Engineering recently reported that Holtec International is eyeing the restart of the Indian Point Energy Center in New Jersey, a 2,000 MW nuclear plant that ceased operations in 2021 and is currently being decommissioned. Holtec, which is also already in the final phase in the restart of its Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan, floated an estimated cost of $10 billion and a timeline of at least four years to restart the plant, POLITICO reports.

Holtec has previously shied away from advocating for a restart of Indian Point, arguing as recently as last October that the decommissioning and process had progressed too far to reverse course. Trice noted that Indian Point’s internal components and the top of the reactor vessel have already been removed and would have to be replaced.

In July, Holtec’s Palisades Power Plant became the first previously shut-down nuclear plant to receive regulatory approval to return to operations. There are still several licensing actions under NRC review and additional requirements that need to be met before the plant can start up under the original operating license, which would expire March 24, 2031. Testing, inspections and maintenance continue as the 800-megawatt (MW) plant continues to progress towards a restart.

Holtec acquired the plant in June 2022 just after it was shut down. In early 2023, the company applied for federal funding to repower Palisades, which it received in the form of a $1.5 billion loan. The company has already signed long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for the full power output with rural electric co-ops Wolverine Power Cooperative and Hoosier Energy which serve rural communities in Michigan, Illinois and Indiana.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/holtec-smr-1024x576.webp,N,,2025-12-05 04:58:55.826046

The chance that prices are going to level out soon is slim, even as energy affordability becomes a hot-button political issue.
An aging power grid “Our poles and wires are aging.

“It's not going to solve every single challenge on the grid, but it's going to provide some relief.” What can you do about electricity costs?","Electricity prices have been on a roller coaster in the last few years, and at the moment they’re climbing — just in time for the start of winter.

Nationally, residential electricity prices rose 10.5% between January and August of this year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). That’s more than three times the annual rate of overall inflation.

But the national average hides a lot of regional variation. While three states actually saw electricity prices drop in that nine-month period, nine states saw an increase of more than 20% — topped by Missouri at 37.4% and North Dakota at 30.3%. Another 19 states saw increases between 10% and 20%.

The chance that prices are going to level out soon is slim, even as energy affordability becomes a hot-button political issue.

U.S. electricity providers are for-profit companies that are tightly regulated by state public utility commissions. In the first nine months of this year, utilities proposed and received authorization for $34 billion in rate increases — more than double the $16 billion during the same period last year, according to Powerlines, a nonprofit that focuses on regulatory and other issues affecting the U.S. power grid.

What’s causing the rise in electricity prices?

In an interview with NerdWallet, Charles Hua, founder and executive director of Powerlines, listed some of the primary causes of electricity inflation.

1. An aging power grid

“Our poles and wires are aging. It costs a lot of money to just replace that infrastructure,” Hua says. “And some of that is just because the poles and wires in your backyard are just reaching the end of their useful life.”

At the same time, energy demand is rising thanks to the AI boom and other factors. Hua notes that there are proven ways to make our current energy grid more efficient without going on a building spree — but that’s not how utilities are incentivized.

“The thing to know about utilities is that they earn a profit only on capital expenditures and not on operational expenditures,” Hua says. “So they have a structural incentive to build a bunch of new power plants and to build a bunch of new infrastructure.”

2. More extreme weather events

“The second big factor is extreme weather events — storms, wildfires, winter cold stretches, hurricanes — that have battered our energy and grid infrastructure in many ways,” Hua says.

And it’s not just a like-for-like replacement of damaged infrastructure, he adds, but upgrading it to make it more resilient as such events grow more common. Extreme weather events have also driven up insurance and other costs for utility companies.

3. Rising fuel costs

Natural gas is the biggest single source of electricity in the U.S., accounting for about 43% of power generated in 2023. Gas prices skyrocketed after Russia invaded Ukraine, and while they fell back after that spike, they have been rising again in recent months. Hua notes that in many states, utilities can pass those increases directly onto consumers.

What does it mean for consumers?

Electricity costs are a relatively small portion of average household income — around 2% — although that percentage has been growing since 2019.

What that means in dollar terms: From 2021 to 2025, the average monthly residential electric bill rose from $121 to an estimated $156, according to the NEADA. That’s enough to throw households that are already struggling financially into further turmoil.

The Washington Post did an analysis of 2025 power disconnections in 11 states, and found a year-over-year increase in eight of them. In Pennsylvania alone, power shutoffs have risen 21% this year, with 270,000 homes losing power.

Even for consumers who can absorb the increases, sticker shock on monthly power bills is turning energy affordability into a political issue — much the way egg prices were in the 2024 presidential election.

For example, both candidates in November’s gubernatorial election in New Jersey made energy affordability a central issue in their campaigns, with Democrat Mikie Sherrill declaring “a state of emergency on energy costs” in her winning campaign.

Hua thinks that issue will grow in visibility as winter sets in, especially as an increasing percentage of Americans heat their homes with electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

“I do think that in the next three months this will be just a big issue, because it's not only substantively a big issue, but now politically it's an issue, and so the marriage of the two will create a really unpredictable storm around utility bill costs and affordability,” Hua says.

Getting more out of the grid we have

Hua declares himself “optimistic” that increased attention on energy affordability will help push regulators to get more out of the infrastructure that’s already in place.

The grid we have is only about 40% to 50% efficient, Hua says. There are available “grid-enhancing” technologies, including increased battery storage — that Hua describes collectively as “ibuprofen for the grid” — that would boost that to 60% to 70% at a much lower cost than building equivalent new capacity.

Such measures would “make the grid more efficient and can lower prices and provide some immediate relief to the system,” Hua says. “It's not going to solve every single challenge on the grid, but it's going to provide some relief.”

What can you do about electricity costs?

Utilities are monopolies, so while it’s not possible to shop around for electricity providers, homeowners can take measures to make their own homes more energy-efficient.

For those struggling financially, there are programs to help low-income consumers pay their utility bills. The national program, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), has been under political pressure, but long-delayed federal funds were recently released. Search Google for “energy assistance” in your state.

The federal government collects these dollars from energy companies for rent, royalties and lease fees. Then it disperses some of that back to individual states. States later use the funds to pay for day-to-day spending and savings.

New Mexico continues to receive the largest payments, accounting for nearly 70% of state disbursements. It received almost $3 billion in the 2025 fiscal year.

That’s because the state partially sits on top of the oil-rich Permian Basin, according to Kristin Smith, a researcher at the Montana-based nonprofit, Headwater Economics.

“If you took out New Mexico, there'd be a different story in these numbers,” Smith said.

For Wyoming, the next largest recipient of revenue payments, Smith said the story is all about declining coal revenues. The state received $544.87 million this fiscal year. That’s nearly $50,000 less than 2024 and almost $300,000 less than 2023, according to federal data.

Utah also saw drops, though it did gain more revenue from geothermal energy production ($5 million). Montana and Colorado saw upticks, largely due to oil and gas development.

Overall, the state revenue total was down slightly from previous years, which the Trump administration blamed on a drop in commodity prices. A U.S. Department of Interior press release said the administration’s efforts to unleash American energy helped unlock those dollars.

However, Smith said the market often plays a bigger role in revenue totals than federal policy.

“When you think about where are the places that are benefiting the most or the least, or who's experiencing changes, that is often dictated by market and commodity prices,” Smith said.

She added that this revenue source is volatile, and states should rely on it less for day-to-day spending and invest more in long-term savings.

“ There’s always a risk of economic dependance,” Smith said. “You don't wanna be dependent on revenue that just goes poof and isn't there next year.”

Louisiana, North Dakota, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, California and Alaska also received millions in energy revenue payments.

Mission Drive, San Gabriel.","Today marks the final deadline for California counties to certify the results of the special election on Proposition 50, the ballot measure to redraw California’s congressional maps through 2030.

Statewide, turnout was 50%, with “yes” votes winning with 64.4%.

The Associated Press called the vote within minutes of polls closing Nov. 4, but the official vote count takes several weeks. The California Secretary of State now has until Dec. 12 to certify the full results.

Here’s what we know about turnout and the vote margin across Southern California.

Did the vote margin change?

Not really.

In many races, the vote margin narrows or widens as the count goes on, but Prop. 50 stayed remarkably consistent. The margin we saw on election night is pretty much what still stands. As of this morning, 64.4% of ballots counted voted “yes,” while 35.6% were “no.”

What was turnout like?

Voters notoriously do not show up for off-year elections in the same numbers as, say, a presidential election.

But given how consequential Prop. 50 was, there was a lot of curiosity about how many voters would actually participate. About 11.6 million people showed up for the special election — a turnout of 50% statewide.

It’s not as high as California’s last special election in 2021 on whether to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom — turnout then was 58.4%. But it’s a solid showing for California, especially for an off-year special election. In fact, it’s on par with California’s 2022 midterm elections, which saw 50.8% turnout.

Here’s the voter turnout breakdown among Southern California’s six counties — this is pending final certification from the state:

Imperial County: 35.8%

L.A. County: 44.9%

Orange County: 52.3%

Riverside County: 45.9%

San Bernardino County: 44.2%

Ventura County: 55.3%

Where did ‘yes’ and ‘no’ votes come from across SoCal?

“Yes” won the majority of the vote in all six Southern California counties — Imperial, L.A., Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura. The margin was the widest in L.A. County, where “yes” had 74.3% of the vote. The smallest was in Orange County, with “yes” votes at 55.5%.

If you’re curious to dig further into the details, here’s a breakdown of the vote by city in Orange County and a preliminary map of what the vote looked like across L.A. County neighborhoods.

A group of employees at the Los Angeles region’s homelessness authority says hundreds of frontline workers will face layoffs as L.A. County transitions funding away from the agency.

Staffers from the L.A. Homeless Services Authority, or LAHSA, wrote an open letter to the county Board of Supervisors this week, demanding that no county-funded workers be displaced.

Its members say the transition would hit workers and unhoused clients harder than county officials have acknowledged.

“ A lot of the workers are in this because we care and we want to help our fellow neighbors and don't want to see see all kinds of people homeless on the street,” Jacqueline Beltran, a LAHSA employee who signed the letter, told LAist.

County officials said they are committed to “clearing pathways to employment” for county-funded LAHSA workers within the new Department of Homeless Services and Housing.

“We are continuing to explore all available options,” new department director Sarah Mahin said in a statement.

Mahin said funding and staffing will be finalized in the FY 2026-2027 Measure A spending plan for the fiscal year that ends in 2027. The county released a draft of that plan last month.

County authorities have said they would fully integrate the services performed by LAHSA into the new Department of Homeless Services and Housing by next July.

The transition

In April, the county Board of Supervisors voted to pull more than $300 million from LAHSA and create a new county homelessness department to administer the funds.

That motion also directed county agencies to consult with Service Employees International Union 721, which represents county-funded LAHSA employees, to try to keep them employed — or prioritize them for transition into the new department’s workforce.

But the LAHSA Workers Coalition said that’s not happening.

The group demands in its letter that the county halt all staffing reductions at LAHSA and argues the county has a legal obligation to protect the workers. The group is made up of employees represented by SEIU 721, but the union’s leaders did not cosign the letter.

The union did not immediately respond to LAist’s questions about it Thursday.

In February, an L.A. County report said the agency had 900 staff positions and nearly 200 vacancies. More than half of the positions were funded by L.A. County, according to the report.

LAHSA reported last month that it employed 686 people.

Demands

Last year, county voters approved the Measure A sales tax to fund homeless services and affordable housing. The ordinance says that contracts funded with Measure A revenue ""must not result in displacement of public employees.”

In the letter, the coalition argues the county is out of compliance with that requirement and is urging the board to discuss the matter at its next meeting.

Mahin said Measure A does not prevent the county from restructuring programs but instead “protects public employees from being displaced by outside service providers funded through Measure A.”

The county is facing a deficit of more than $300 million in funding for homeless services, Mahin said, adding that it must make “difficult but necessary decisions about how we invest our limited resources.”

The workers coalition is demanding that existing LAHSA employees be transferred directly to the new department, instead of having to reapply.

They’re also asking the board for a full public disclosure of staffing cuts related to the transition.

In addition to the Board of Supervisors, the coalition sent the letter to several other county and state oversight entities, including the county office of the inspector general, the civil grand jury, the state auditor and the attorney general.

When Terri Huerta called local winemakers about a problem with a meandering vine at Mission San Gabriel in the city of San Gabriel, she thought she'd get gardening help. Instead, she sparked a revival of L.A.'s oldest wine.

The vine in question isn't your typical grapevine. It's a 250-year-old beast with a trunk so massive two people can't wrap their arms around it. Because it served as the source for cuttings that spread throughout California's early vineyards, it’s now known as the Mother Vine.

For centuries, it just sprawled across the mission courtyard like some ancient, living pergola that refuses to quit, with no one taking any notice of the grapes flourishing each season.

But now, thanks to a group of determined local winemakers, that fruit is being transformed into Angelica, a sweet wine fortified with brandy that Franciscan missionaries made there in the 1700s — making it the city’s oldest wine.

A limited edition batch was launched Nov. 28 by the Angeleno Wine Company. There are fewer than 200 bottles for sale, and at $75, it's not cheap. But break that down by the vine's age, and you're paying 30 cents per year of history.

How it started

The collaboration began in 2020 when Huerta, director of mission development at Mission San Gabriel, reached out to the Los Angeles Vintners Association looking for help to manage the grapevine.

The association — a partnership among three L.A. wineries: Angeleno Wine Company, Byron Blatty Wines and Cavalletti Vineyards — sent winemakers Mark Blatty, Patrick Kelly, Jasper Dickson and Amy Luftig to assess the situation. They found something bigger than a courtyard cleanup project. They found grapes. A lot of them.

""The vine was full of fruit, and I told them it was just a nuisance every year,"" Huerta recalls. ""They asked, 'What are you going to do with all this fruit?' and I said, 'I really don't know.'”

That's when the group offered to help take it off Huerta’s hands.

Wine history

Although the Napa Valley now reigns supreme as the region’s wine industry, L.A. once was the center for the entire state. Mission San Gabriel’s vine was planted by Franciscan friars after the establishment of the mission in 1775 to make sacramental wine to be used during mass. DNA analysis has since revealed its forebears: It's a hybrid of Spanish Listán Prieto grapes and native California Vitis girdiana.

This vine’s cuttings helped launch the many vineyards that began to crop up around the newly founded grape fields, which became numerous. By 1850, L.A. boasted over 100 vineyards. If you look carefully, even today, the city of L.A.’s seal has a bunch of grapes hanging at the top.

The wines were popular with fortune seekers headed north to the Gold Rush. The industry flourished until 1883, when an outbreak of Pierce's Disease destroyed thousands of acres of vines across SoCal. Urban sprawl replaced vineyards with housing through the mid-20th century.

Today, almost nothing remains of L.A. 's once-dominant wine industry — with the exception of the Mother Vine and a handful of its descendants scattered across the city.

Across from Union Station a direct descendant is still growing over tourist and vendor heads. It’s a 200-year-old vine at Olvera Street's Avila Adobe, the oldest standing residence in the city of L.A.

Storing up the grapes

The winemakers started picking the fruit at the Mission in 2020. But it wasn’t enough to make a substantial batch of wine, so the grapes were stored. For the past five years, the winemakers, joined with volunteers, have harvested the fruit each season, carefully packing it away.

In the meantime, they began to dig into mission records for mentions of grapes and winemaking. One day they came across a document from the 1800s, which outlined a recipe for Angelica, a fortified wine made from grape juice and brandy.

""Angelica is said to be made by mixing one gallon of grape brandy with three of grape juice, fresh from the press,"" it said. ""It is a thick, sweet and strong drink, yet of very delicate flavor.""

The fortification wasn't just about taste — it was a necessity. In an era before refrigeration, adding brandy preserved the wine, allowing it to survive California's heat and long journeys between missions.

Two of the winemakers, Dickson and Luftig, were especially interested. They’d been making wine from grapes grown locally in the SoCal region since 2018 at their winery Angeleno Wine Company, which produces everything on-site near Chinatown.

They became intrigued by the idea of recreating Angelica. Following the historical recipe, they pressed fresh Mission grapes and fortified the juice with brandy before fermentation. Then they used the solera system — a traditional Spanish method that blends wines across multiple vintages — aging the wine in oak barrels for years.

Initially, they made limited batches solely for the company’s wine club members, which quickly sold out.

This year’s Angelica is the group’s third batch but the first to go on sale to the public. It includes grapes that have been harvested from 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024.

The wine pours a pale cherry color and has a syrup-like consistency. The brandy comes through right away, caramel and warm spices with refreshing acidity cutting through the sweetness. It's thick, decadent and undeniably strong — a small glass (or two) is all that’s needed after a warm holiday meal.

The harvest

Harvesting the grapes doesn't look like the romantic wine country fantasy you see in magazines.

Instead of long rows of vines with grapes easily accessed, harvesters have to pick the fruit from below the canopy.

""Everyone has to bring ladders because we're picking like this,"" Dickson says, gesturing upward in the Mission’s courtyard. ""We're literally placing ladders on ancient monks' tombstones to reach the fruit above the graves.""

This year the harvest happened in October.

John Pryor, a volunteer, has done multiple harvests. He describes it plainly: ""You're not in a vineyard. You're in a garden at a Catholic church. The vines are trellised 12 feet high and go on for a hundred yards.""

For his daughter, 27 year-old Meg Pryor, seeing the massive trunk drove home what ""old"" actually means.

""Whenever we're there, I'm thinking, 'People were doing this a century ago, two centuries ago,'"" she said.

Understanding who most of those workers were centuries ago means confronting some difficult issues. Huerta of Mission San Gabriel acknowledges the mission system relied on Indigenous labor, and the vine's hybrid nature suggests native plant knowledge may have contributed to its development.

But she doesn't shy away from the complexity.

""You can't tell Mission history without including all the parts,"" she says. ""You can't tell one story without telling another story. Winemaking has always been a part of L.A. history. The grapes were brought by the Franciscans. They didn't just start here in California. They started in Mexico, so its complexity makes it interesting, but it also makes it controversial.""

Going forward, Angeleno Wine Company plans to release a limited batch of Angelica as a seasonal offering each year, as long as the Mother Vine continues to produce fruit.

The Supreme Court has cleared the way for Texas to use a new congressional map that could help Republicans win five more U.S. House seats in the 2026 midterm election.

The decision released Thursday boosts the GOP's chances of preserving its slim majority in the House of Representatives amid an unprecedented gerrymandering fight launched by President Donald Trump, who has been pushing Texas and other GOP-led states to redraw their congressional districts to benefit Republicans.

The high court's unsigned order follows Texas' emergency request for the justices to pause a three-judge panel's ruling blocking the state's recently redrawn map.

After holding a nine-day hearing in October, that panel found challengers of the new map are likely to prove in a trial that the map violates the Constitution by discriminating against voters based on race.

In its majority opinion, authored by a Trump nominee, the panel cited a letter from the Department of Justice and multiple public statements by key Republican state lawmakers that suggested their map drawer manipulated the racial demographics of voting districts to eliminate existing districts where Black and Latino voters together make up the majority. For the next year's midterms, the panel ordered Texas to keep using the congressional districts the state's GOP-controlled legislature drew in 2021.

But in Texas' filing to the Supreme Court, the state claimed the lawmakers were not motivated by race and were focused instead on drawing new districts that are more likely to elect Republicans.

In November, after the panel blocked the new map, Justice Samuel Alito allowed Texas to temporarily reinstate it while the Supreme Court reviewed the state's emergency request.

The mid-decade redistricting plan Texas Republicans passed in August sparked a counter response by Democratic leaders in California, where voters in a special election in November approved a new congressional map that could help Democrats gain five additional House seats. A court hearing for a legal challenge to that map is set for Dec. 15.

The rest of the redistricting landscape remains unsettled as well. Lawsuits are challenging new gerrymanders in places like Missouri, where there is also a contested referendum effort. And other states, including Florida, Indiana and Virginia, may also pursue new districts prior to the midterms.

Last week, a federal court ruled to allow North Carolina's midterm election to be held under a recently redrawn map that could give Republicans an additional seat.

Another wave of congressional redistricting may be coming soon depending on what — and when — the Supreme Court decides in a voting rights case about Louisiana's congressional map. After the court held a rare rehearing for that case in October, some states are watching for a potential earlier-than-usual ruling that may allow Republican-led states to draw more GOP-friendly districts in time for the 2026 midterms.

Growing up in Whittier, tamales have always been part of who I am — whether from local bakeries like La Moderna, where my mother always orders the day after Thanksgiving, or our annual tamalada with family friends, where we churn out hundreds in slightly drunken assembly-line fashion.

Over the years, I've explored beyond the traditional Mexican versions: El Salvadoran styles from What's That You're Cooking in Orange County to the Chinese lo mai gai found at dim sum spots across the city. My pursuit of new tamal variations is relentless, especially this time of year.

So when I heard about a $27 lamb neck tamal in Venice, I had to know: could an elevated, chef-driven approach ever justify that price? Since a few other restaurants are also recreating the humble dish with a high-end approach, I decided to go and try them.

What I discovered was that these aren't replacements for traditional tamales — they're explorations of what happens when fine dining ambition meets this centuries-old form.

Si! Mon (Venice)

Si! Mon opened in 2023 in the former James Beach space, a collaboration between chef José Olmedo Carles Rojas and restaurateurs Louie and Netty Ryan, known for Venice-adjacent mainstays Hatchet Hall and Menotti's Coffee Stop. Si! Mon offers Carles Rojas' take on Panamanian fine dining, drawing on Panama's melting pot of Chinese, French, Spanish, African and Caribbean influences.

For the holidays, Carles Rojas is offering a $27 lamb neck tamal — a clear departure from the Mexican versions most Angelenos know. And while the price might cause some sticker shock, it’s worth considering what goes into it and how much food there is.

Wrapped in a banana leaf, the tamal uses a lighter, softer masa enriched with the lamb neck’s braising liquid. Rojas pulls the meat, tosses it with sofrito until it takes on a sauce-like consistency, then adds Indian-style quick-pickled dates for sweetness and olives for brine. Finally, the tamal is finished in Si! mon's wood-fired oven, adding subtle smokiness.

My verdict? After taking that first bite, I can tell you… it’s worth the splurge. One tamal is meant to be shared between two people, which partly explains the price point (though I had no problem finishing mine solo). I’ve had plenty of Central American tamales over the years — Salvadoran versions with their silky masa, Nicaraguan nacatamales loaded with vegetables and pork — but Carles’ take pulls out all the stops. This is a deluxe, bells-and-whistles vision: sweet, salty, and deeply savory all at once, comforting yet unlike anything I’ve tasted before.

Yes, it is a high price, but I’d say it reflects the time, technique and premium ingredients behind it.

KOMAL (South L.A.)

KOMAL is L.A.'s first craft molino (mill), founded by Fátima Júarez and Conrado Rivera, former employees of Michelin-rated Holbox, who opened this masa-centric counter inside South L.A.'s Mercado La Paloma. The name is Nahuatl for ""comal,"" the traditional flat griddle used to cook tortillas.

I wanted to try the chuchito ($11), a regular menu staple at KOMAL. Júarez refers to the dish as a gift — both for the unwrapping it requires and the labor of love behind it. Each one takes more than 22 hours to make, starting with nixtamalizing heirloom corn to create the masa. (Nixtamalization, an ancient Mesoamerican process, involves soaking and cooking corn in an alkaline solution to improve its flavor, texture, and nutrition).

The result is a fluffy steamed tamal filled with tender pork and crowned with roasted pepper and tomato sauce, pickled cabbage and vegetables, and crema. The dish honors her kitchen team, most of whom are from Guatemala, and it's KOMAL's way of putting their heritage front and center on the menu.

Beyond the chuchito, Júarez is offering three special tamales as holiday pick-ups for Christmas and New Year's: a deep, complex tamal rojo filled with sweet corn and squash calabacita, a vibrant tomatillo-based tamal verde filled with chicken, and a tamal de leche made with oranges and strawberry jam, a sweet version that hints at the pre-Hispanic tasting menu they're developing.

After the holidays, these tamales will transition to appearing exclusively at Komal's planned ancestral and ceremonial dinners in 2026 — making this a rare chance to try them before they become part of a more formal dining experience.

Available by the half-dozen ($45) or the dozen ($90), they can be ordered for pick-up at KOMAL on Tuesday, Dec. 23, or Tuesday, Dec. 30.

Campesino Café at The Ecology Center (San Juan Capistrano)

Aaron Zimmer, head chef of Campesino Café at The Ecology Center, works within a unique constraint: everything on his menu comes from the 28-acre regenerative organic farm surrounding the restaurant. That includes the corn he grows, dries, harvests and processes into masa for his tamales.

For the winter season, Zimmer is offering two versions that reflect what's abundant on the farm right now. The shelling bean and cheese tamal ($21) features beans from one of four varieties they grow on-site — shelling beans are harvested before they're thoroughly dried, prized for their creamy texture and delicate, earthy flavor. The cooked-down beans are incorporated into the fresh masa with cheese, then topped with chili con queso made with pickled giardiniera from their summer harvest.

The winter squash tamal ($21) features squash finished with a walnut mole sauce. The sweet, nutty texture, combined with the squash's sweet, earthy flavors and soft, fresh-tasting masa, creates a highly multidimensional bite.

Both are wrapped in masa and steamed in corn husks, then topped with whatever's available in the larder at any given moment, such as freshly grown cilantro or pickled onion.

It's a hyperlocal, intensely seasonal approach that makes each tamal a snapshot of what the farm is producing — versatile, sustainable, and entirely tied to the land it comes from.

The organizations will receive up to $800 million in federal cost-shared funding to advance initial projects in Tennessee and Michigan.

The goal for these projects is to develop and construct the first Gen III+ small modular reactor (Gen III+ SMR) plants in the United States.

“President Trump has made clear that America is going to build more energy, not less, and nuclear is central to that mission,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said. “Advanced light-water SMRs will give our nation the reliable, round-the-clock power we need to fuel the President’s manufacturing boom, support data centers and AI growth, and reinforce a stronger, more secure electric grid. These awards ensure we can deploy these reactors as soon as possible.”

Specifically, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) will receive $400 million to advance deployment of a GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 at the Clinch River Nuclear site in Tennessee. It will also work to accelerate the deployment of additional units with Indiana Michigan Power and Elementl. Further, TVA plans to work with the domestic nuclear supply chain partners Scot Forge, North American Forgemasters, BWX Technologies, and Aecon. Other partners supporting the project include Duke Energy, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, and the Electric Power Research Institute.

In addition, Holtec Government Services will receive $400 million. It plans to deploy two SMR-300 reactors at the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station site in Covert, Michigan. Holtec is pursuing a one-stop-shop approach to SMR deployment by fulfilling the roles of technology vendor, supply chain vendor, nuclear plant constructor in partnership with Hyundai Engineering & Construction, plant operator, and electricity merchant selling the power to near-by utilities and end-users.

In March 2025, DOE issued a $900 million solicitation to de-risk the deployment of Gen III+ SMRs. The remaining $100 million will be awarded later this year to support additional deployments and address barriers in design, licensing, supply chain, and site readiness.",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/shutterstock_2572809875.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 23:58:22.744339

President Donald Trump announced this week plans to rollback Biden-era fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks, citing affordability.

The Biden administration set fuel efficiency standards for automakers to manufacture vehicles that would run an average 50.4 miles per gallon for the 2031 model year as a way to reduce harmful air pollutants and climate warming greenhouse gas emissions. The newly proposed standards weaken those rules to 34.5 mpg, making it much easier to reach with gas-powered vehicles.

“This is the final nail in the coffin of the Trump administration’s plans to completely obliterate the federal climate program writ large,” said Jeff Alson, a retired engineer who worked for 40 years at the Environmental Protection Agency, where he helped to establish clean car standards under the Obama administration.

In announcing the new rule, Trump said the previous standards are “ridiculously burdensome,” and would have raised the cost of new vehicles by $1,000, or about 2% of the current average cost of a new vehicle, which is $50,000, according to Kelley Blue Book. The move follows reversals of other Biden-era policies that encouraged the manufacture of electric vehicles, and more cleaner cars and trucks.

“Today we’re taking one more step to kill the green new scam,” Trump said while announcing the rules at the White House on Wednesday. “The greatest scam in American history, the green new scam, it’s a quest to end the gasoline-powered car, this is what they wanted to do even though we have more gasoline than any other country by far and people want the gasoline car.”

What are CAFE standards?

Congress enacted the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency standards, or CAFE, in 1975, directing the Department of Transportation to establish the rules in response to high gasoline prices and dependence on foreign oil. Opponents say the rules are effectively an “EV mandate” because the country is no longer dependent on oil imports and the Biden administration instead raised the bar so high it would mean more electric vehicle production at the expense of gas-powered cars and trucks.

“Today’s a victory of common sense and affordability,” said Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley who joined Trump in the Oval Office, along with Stellantis NV CEO Antonio Filosa and General Motors plant manager John Urbanic.

Earlier this year, Congress defanged the CAFE standards by eliminating the penalties as part of the budget bill.

Affordability

The Trump administration said the move would save Americans money, reducing the average cost of new vehicles by about 2% or $1,000. But environmentalists say the opposite — that increased fuel standards reduce the amount of gasoline needed to go the average mile.

“Consumers will be paying more at the pump,” said Jason Schwartz, legal director of the Institute for Policy Integrity, a think tank based at New York University School of Law.

Schwartz said the Department of Transportation created a “new category of supposed costs” to offset the increased usage of gasoline for less-efficient vehicles. For example, without the focus on creating more efficiency, the car makers could increase horsepower that could lead to savings.

“And so, what the Department of Transportation has done is assign some value to those supposed losses, and is using that to try to offset a mythical cost to try to erase from their tally sheet all the fuel savings that consumers are going to lose out on,” Schwartz said.

In addition to pumping more gas, an annual report from the government’s Energy Information Administration released in April shows that without the Biden-era climate rules that encouraged the manufacturing of cleaner cars, the price of gasoline will rise by 76 cents per gallon, Alson said.

“I would say it’s very deceptive what the Trump administration is saying that this will save consumers a lot of money,” he said. Alson added that while he agrees rolling back the fuel efficiency standards would save consumers about $1,000, the costs to consumers of higher gas prices would far outweigh the savings in the costs of new vehicles.

Health impacts on the Philly region

Public health advocates and environmentalists also say that while the fuel efficiency standards had the original goal of reducing reliance on foreign oil, the impact on air quality was significant.

“And that has been an incredible boon for public health and millions of lives saved and early deaths averted, because of those improvements in air quality,” said Jane Clougherty, professor of environmental and occupational health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health.

Clougherty said reducing fuel use would have lessened the tailpipe emissions, including volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides, which are associated with poor health impacts including asthma and cardiovascular disease.

“In Philadelphia, we have a number of really important air pollution sources, including refineries and legacy industries around our region,” Clougherty said. “But no question, nitrogen dioxide is still one of the most important contributors to air pollution in our region.”

NYU’s Schwartz called it a “triple whammy,” starting with passing on more costs to consumers.

“It’s bad enough to increase greenhouse gas emissions. It’s especially bad since we’re already in a climate crisis,” Schwartz said. “It’s especially bad in combination with all of the other environmental rollbacks that we’re seeing. All those effects are just going to compound on each other.”",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/traffic-italian-market-philly-2025-04-29.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 21:00:21.158133

The Government will only meet its clean energy 2030 or 2050 decarbonised building targets if there is significant new intervention in the UK workforce, says the Commons Energy Security and Net Zero Committee in a report today. It says targeting consumer demand is necessary but not sufficient, and public funding to address the supply of skills directly is needed now.

The Committee calls for ‘local skilled labour’ conditions in Contracts for Difference, an expanded skills passport scheme, a leading role for local authorities, and greater clarity for industry on levies, EPC ratings and the Warm Homes Plan.

The UK needs an estimated 250,000 additional workers just to meet new housing targets, and many more for retrofit. After shocking failures in previous Government-backed retrofit and insulation schemes, the Committee calls for a new, nationally recognised, industry-backed construction and retrofit skills programme.

The energy transition offers substantial opportunity. The Climate Change Committee estimates net employment gains from the energy transition of between 135,000 and 725,000 jobs in the next four years . But the vast majority of these workers will have to train or reskill. The UK may need to import some specific skilled workers from overseas, at least in the short term, to meet its targets.

With up to 70% of those embarking on construction-related FE qualifications not completing or not entering the sector, the Committee says Government should expand and formalise 'try-before-you-buy' training opportunities. SMEs, the backbone of the construction and retrofit supply chain, will need support in taking on inexperienced trainees.

Chair comment

Bill Esterson MP, Chair of the Committee, said:

“It is essential that we build the workforce for the energy transition so that the Government can hit its clean energy targets and, importantly, ensure that the UK makes the most of the growth opportunity of the century.

“The Committee has found that market forces alone cannot overcome the skills gap. We need policy certainty for the long-term, locally directed investment in training, and policies that make clean energy careers attractive and accessible.

“For British workers this isn’t about hitting deadlines; it’s about securing good jobs, driving innovation, and ensuring Britain leads in the global race for clean energy.”

The Committee calls on Government to:

Put commitments to transition the existing local skilled labour supply into Contracts for Difference, leveraging UK manufacturing content requirements where possible.

By the end of 2026, set out the options for conditionality that can leverage more skilled immigration in the short-term and crucially boost support for home-grown talent longer-term.

Empower devolved government across the UK to lead on approaches tailored to local and regional strengths or weaknesses – and facilitate a greater role for local authorities to accelerate the roll-out of retrofit.

Give the Office for Clean Energy Jobs and Skills England the authority and resources to ensure the necessary consistency that will make skills portable across the country, in both the clean energy and the retrofit workforces.

Accelerate the adoption of clean energy and retrofit skills policies in the Spending Review, with a ten-year horizon for initiatives and funding which is revised and extended every five years. -Identify how new technologies can bring increases in productivity to help meet the scale of labour demand identified in this inquiry.

Launch new initiatives to promote clean energy and retrofit careers among under-represented groups and those outside the existing workforce.

Clarify its stance on how environmental levies will be paid for in future and what role they will play in electricity and gas bills, after welcome moves on the costs in electricity bills in the Budget.

Clarify its position on revisions to the EPC regime and the role of hydrogen in heating.

Promptly bring forward the Warm Homes Plan, setting out its estimate of workforce needs and how those needs will be met.

Louisiana Economic Development officials often sign nondisclosure agreements with local government leaders and corporate executives to keep negotiations secret.
“I’m tired of hearing ‘jobs, jobs, jobs,’” Joseph told LED officials at Wednesday’s hearing.
“Economic development has not happened for us,” LeBoeuf said.
“This is destruction masquerading as economic development,” Rolfes said.","Louisiana leaders have recently touted a string of major industrial projects with the promise of creating thousands of jobs, but critics say these business negotiations lack transparency and pose great risk to the health and prosperity of the communities where this investment is taking shape.

They also believe state officials have shut them out of trade deals with businesses that stand to benefit far more than them.

The critics included residents and community activists from across Louisiana who spoke out Wednesday at a state agency hearing, where they asked officials to stop secretly brokering trade deals that give taxpayer money to large industrial companies.

Numbering around a dozen, the group aired their concerns at a Louisiana Economic Development rules hearing, which are normally sparsely-attended and mundane bureaucratic processes with just two staff members there to record public comments.

Louisiana Economic Development had published a notice on Oct. 20 stating that it planned to “hold a public hearing for the purpose of receiving comments on any rule of the agency.” The notice contained no further details about the reason for the hearing and didn’t specify which rules the agency is reviewing. Staff members did not discuss any particular rules at the hearing.

The residents and activists — which included members of community and environmental groups such as the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, Rural Roots Louisiana, the Descendants Project, Inclusive Louisiana and Fishermen Involved in Sustaining Our Heritage — used the hearing as an opportunity to air a variety of complaints about the impacts industrial expansion has had on their neighborhoods. They all signed a letter that summarized their complaints and then took turns speaking at the hearing.

In their letter submitted to Louisiana Economic Development, the group criticized the hearing notice as “vague” and wrote that it provided “no meaningful notice of what the agency is considering.”

They wrote and testified that the notice appeared to be part of a pattern of secrecy at the agency to fast-track industrial expansion in the state. They pointed to Gov. Jeff Landry’s Sept. 16 executive order, which he dubbed the “Louisiana Lightning Speed Initiative.” It directs Louisiana to push state agencies to fast-track permitting and regulatory processes to attract new businesses and spur industrial expansion, mentioning recent deals with Meta, Hyundai, Woodside Energy and CF Industries as examples.

In December 2024, the state announced that Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, was coming to Louisiana to build the world’s largest data center in Richland Parish. Construction of the facility began almost immediately.

Richland Parish residents Joe and Robin Williams also signed the letter submitted to LED. They live across the street from the Meta site and have reported rust-colored tap water and power outages at their home since construction activity began.

While the rapidly approved Meta project came as a surprise to Williams and the public, a small circle of Louisiana politicians had known about it and kept it under wraps for nearly a year. Several top leaders — including the governor, House Speaker Phillip DeVillier, LED Secretary Susan Bourgeois and Revenue Secretary Richard Nelson — quietly collaborated with corporate executives and local officials on the project, holding closed-door talks and rewriting state laws for reasons they withheld from the public and most of the Louisiana Legislature.

During the 2024 legislative session, Landry and DeVillier carried out plans to “hijack” another lawmaker’s bill, rewriting it in a way that would give a massive tax break to Meta without other legislators realizing it, as detailed in a Times-Picayune report. Bourgeois told the newspaper everyone involved in the negotiations signed “blank NDAs” (nondisclosure agreements) before the talks began.

Louisiana Economic Development officials often sign nondisclosure agreements with local government leaders and corporate executives to keep negotiations secret. In a phone interview Thursday, Bourgeois said it’s a common practice at the agency whenever a company requests it.

“It’s really just an industry standard,” Bourgeois said. “I understand there’s some people who don’t agree with it or like it, but go to any state and this is how it’s done.”

Companies often ask for the agreements so competitors don’t undercut or foil their plans, she said. For example, if a company knows about its rival’s plans to build at a certain location, they could rush to purchase the land out from under them, Bourgeois explained.

The Rev. Harry Joseph Sr., an Ascension Parish resident and church pastor, took part in Wednesday’s LED hearing. Speaking with the Illuminator before the meeting, he questioned the agency’s use of nondisclosure agreements and said his local elected officials routinely cite them as a reason they can’t answer questions about projects in his area.

“We elected them. We should be able to talk to them about anything,” Joseph said. “The secrecy has gotten out of hand. Enough is enough.”

Another example of secret negotiations, Joseph said, is the industrial RiverPlex MegaPark being built in the Modeste community of Ascension Parish. The area targeted for development had previously been zoned as a “conservation district” because it is “environmentally fragile” and lacked roads that can handle large traffic increases, according to the parish zoning code. Despite this, the state offered the MegaPark as a site for Hyundai’s new steel mill and two ammonia facilities.

Louisiana Economic Development signed nondisclosure agreements with Hyundai executives and Ascension Parish officials, preventing them from speaking about the projects, according to William Most, an attorney representing Rural Roots and the Louisiana Bucket Brigade.

In an email, LED spokesperson Emma Wagner pushed back against the other criticisms lodged at Wednesday’s hearing, calling them part of an “ambush not based in the actual work of economic development” and job creation in Louisiana.

“This state has long suffered from a failure to diversify our economy,” Wagner wrote. “What we have done over the past 23 months is unprecedented and transformational economic growth that has finally turned the tide of losing our people.”

State and local leaders have touted industrial expansion as a way to bring new jobs to economically depressed areas. In exchange for the jobs, the state and the parishes typically offer the companies lucrative tax breaks and grants.

Joy Banner, co-founder of the Descendants Project, called on the state to require objective data on job creation and wage claims before incentivizing companies with Louisiana tax dollars.

Hyundai has said its steel mill will bring an estimated 1,300 jobs to Louisiana. In exchange, the state promised the company a $100 million grant and other incentives estimated to cost taxpayers $600 million, according to a Times-Picayune report.

CF Industries estimates it will bring 103 new jobs to its proposed ammonia facility in Ascension Parish. In exchange, the state offered the company a $6 million grant for the proposed ammonia plant in Ascension Parish. The company is also expected to be exempt from paying most parish property taxes through the Industrial Tax Exemption Program and receive a payroll tax rebate from the state via the Quality Jobs program.

In his Sept. 16 executive order, the governor pointed to low jobs numbers as the reason for his fast-tracking initiative while deflecting blame for Louisiana’s sluggish economy. He claimed the state lost 12,000 jobs from 2016-23. Although the figure is technically accurate, by framing the data between those years without context, Landry’s executive order implied his predecessor, Gov. John Bel Edwards, was responsible for the job losses.

Louisiana actually gained about 7,000 jobs during Edwards’ first term and, like other states, suffered a sudden employment drop in March 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The state’s employment numbers rebounded during Edwards’ second term, though the job market didn’t fully recover to its pre-pandemic mark until this January.

Federal data shows Louisiana’s employment numbers under Landry have so far hovered around and slightly above peak figures during Edwards’ tenure at around 2 million jobs. The state has slowly but steadily added jobs from January 2024, when Landry took office, through at least August 2025. The jobs market has become murkier in recent months because the Bureau of Labor Statistics did not collect monthly employment data during the six week government shutdown that began Oct. 1.

“I’m tired of hearing ‘jobs, jobs, jobs,’” Joseph told LED officials at Wednesday’s hearing. “We don’t get these jobs. They’re not for us.”

Modeste resident Twila Collins, who works with Rural Roots, told the agency the jobs claims often don’t benefit long-time local residents. Instead, she said, they see the ill effects of heavy pollution that often comes with industrial facilities.

Ascension Parish lies in an industrial corridor along the Mississippi River referred to as “Cancer Alley” for its high concentration of industrial pollution containing carcinogens. Scientific studies have linked cancer rates in its communities to the toxic pollution, though the state Department of Environmental Quality rejects such findings.

“I had to watch my child die in the same area,” Collins said at the hearing. In a later interview, she explained that her 9-year-old son, Denzel, died of an asthma attack more than two decades ago.

Gramercy resident Gail LeBoeuf, who was diagnosed with liver cancer in 2022 and founded the activist group Inclusive Louisiana, told agency staff industrial expansion isn’t worth the risk it poses to the people.

“Economic development has not happened for us,” LeBoeuf said. “These deals don’t do anything but give money back to the people that promised to bring economic development.”

Anne Rolfes, executive director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, said the Louisiana Economic Development agency is “pretending” that Hyundai and CF Industries are the solutions to poverty.

“This is destruction masquerading as economic development,” Rolfes said.

Wagner, the spokesperson for Louisiana Economic Development, said the Landry administration will “never apologize” for attracting jobs, wages and new opportunities to the state.

“The Governor and Secretary both firmly believe the absolute best way to lift people out of poverty is by giving them access to ever-growing wages,” Wagner said via email. “Anyone who would reject those opportunities clearly does not have the best interest of Louisiana citizens at heart.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/LED-hearing-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 21:00:41.019317

Tennessee lawmakers added $50 million to the state budget during the 2025 session to support the small module reactor project.
The governor spearheaded the creation of the $70 million Nuclear Energy Fund in 2023.
“They talk a good game but they’re not deploying it as fast as what’s happening in Florida, Georgia or North Carolina.” Discussion about the Clinch River small module reactor project is just beginning.
TVA said in a news release that the small modular reactor would not be online until the early 2030s.","(The Center Square) – Tennessee is poised to become the first state to construct a small modular nuclear reactor, in part using a $400 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy.

Some are questioning whether it could alleviate a growing need for energy while costing taxpayers.

The Tennessee Valley Authority will construct the reactor on the Clinch River near Oak Ridge, which is a hub of nuclear energy activity in East Tennessee.

“As AI, data centers, and digital infrastructure drive unprecedented energy demand, we’re building our nation’s nuclear energy foundation right here in the Tennessee Valley,” said Don Moul, TVA president and CEO. “This is about more than innovation, it’s about creating lasting opportunity, lowering energy costs, and securing a better tomorrow for American families today.”

TVA officials said in a release that the utility is positioning itself to shield consumers from footing the bill for the development costs.

Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said his organization is open to new technologies that don’t emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. But he is skeptical that the project will be cost-effective for Tennessee Valley consumers.

“There’s a whole question that we just had a big election where energy affordability is a big part of it,” Smith said. “Throwing money after a reactor design that isn’t cost effective isn’t a good investment both by the taxpayers of the United States because that $400 million didn’t just appear, it’s coming from the taxpayers of the United States and ultimately the rate payers, the customers who pay their bill to TVA may have to pay higher electric bills.”

Nuclear power’s popularity fizzled after several high-profile nuclear accidents in the late 20th century but interest sparked again in the 2000s.

Tennessee’s southern neighbor, Georgia, began construction on Plant Vogtle, a large-scale nuclear project in the late 2000s, which actually led to an increase in costs for consumers in that state, according to The American Legislative Exchange Council’s Energy Affordability 2025 report. The project was marked by delays and cost overruns, which ultimately increased the project’s total to $35 billion. Georgia ratepayers were left with $7.5 billion in construction costs, according to previous reports.

“While prices could have been lower if Georgia’s Vogtle nuclear generators had come online on schedule, the project slowed, and costs rose,” the report said.

Gov. Bill Lee is a strong supporter of nuclear energy. Tennessee lawmakers added $50 million to the state budget during the 2025 session to support the small module reactor project.

“Today’s announcement marks a significant milestone for America’s energy dominance and underscores Tennessee’s position as a leader in clean, reliable nuclear energy to power the future,” Lee said in a statement after the award was announced.

The governor spearheaded the creation of the $70 million Nuclear Energy Fund in 2023. The money has attracted projects from Orano, Type One, BWXT Enrichment, Oklo and Radiant Industries. The projects are a $7.3 billion investment and created 2,000 new jobs, according to Lee’s office.

Smith said his organization does not recommend a “do nothing” approach to the increasing energy needs. But other clean energy options like solar and wind have been “kneecapped” by the Trump administration, he said.

“TVA is way behind on developing solar energy compared to its peers in the Southeast,” Smith said. “They talk a good game but they’re not deploying it as fast as what’s happening in Florida, Georgia or North Carolina.”

“The climate is having a very significant effect on this bloom, but there are many underlying drivers of climate change,” Dr. Lapointe said.
” Dr. Hu and his colleagues used satellite imagery of the ocean surface as well as shipboard observations to document 25 years of sargassum movement.
However, rising ocean temperatures and a series of marine heat waves have begun making the gulf too warm for Sargassum, Dr. Hu said.
“In the summer, the water is already warm, adding another 0.7 degrees is very bad,” Dr. Hu said.","A 5,500-mile blob of seaweed in the Atlantic Ocean that has menaced beaches across the Caribbean and Florida in recent years is exploding in size, while a second patch farther north is declining rapidly, driven by rapid changes in the region’s climate.

A study published Thursday in the journal Nature Geoscience finds a big shift in the growth patterns of sargassum, a type of floating macroalgae that provides food and shelter for fish, turtles, seabirds and other marine life.

The southern patch, known as the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt, has now reached 38 million metric tons, a 40 percent increase from its record year of 2022.

“Usually we have a 10 percent to 20 percent fluctuation year to year,” said Chuanmin Hu, a professor of physical oceanography at the University of South Florida and an author of the paper. “But this year was crazy, and we do not have an answer of why.”

Scientists hadn’t detected sargassum in this equatorial region before 2011.

Since then, winds and ocean currents have pushed blobs of sargassum west toward coastal waters in the springtime. Beaches along Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula have suffered from smelly piles of seaweed, while the president of the Dominican Republic said in June that his nation faced a “regional emergency” from sargassum and called for action by the United Nations.

In 2023, about 13 million metric tons of sargassum covered some Florida beaches and decomposed into smelly piles before disappearing in the summer. A study that year in The Journal of Global Health by doctors on the island of Martinique reported respiratory ailments from decomposing seaweed that produces hydrogen sulfide gas.

While experts have not pinpointed the cause of the massive sargassum bloom, Saharan dust storms and smoke from African wildfires blowing west across the Atlantic are playing a role, scientists say. These tiny particles drift into the ocean and act as a kind of fertilizer for the sargassum, according to Brian Lapointe, principal investigator at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute at Florida Atlantic University and an author of the new paper.

“The climate is having a very significant effect on this bloom, but there are many underlying drivers of climate change,” Dr. Lapointe said. “Everything from high temperature, extreme rainfall, droughts and rainfall events, and winds. ”

Dr. Hu and his colleagues used satellite imagery of the ocean surface as well as shipboard observations to document 25 years of sargassum movement. The rapid decline of the northern patch, known as the Northern Sargasso Sea, started in 2015. The Gulf Stream current system has carried seaweed from its nursery in the western Gulf of Mexico into the Northern Sargasso Sea for centuries. However, rising ocean temperatures and a series of marine heat waves have begun making the gulf too warm for Sargassum, Dr. Hu said.

In the past 20 years, the gulf on average has warmed 0.4 degrees Celsius, or 0.72 degrees Fahrenheit, he added.

“In the summer, the water is already warm, adding another 0.7 degrees is very bad,” Dr. Hu said. “Plus we have more frequent marine heat waves in the past 10 years, so that will add to more stress to native sargassum.”

Dani Cox, an independent marine microbiologist based in Miami, said rising ocean temperatures was just one of many causes for the decline of one patch and the explosion of the other, noting that some lab experiments found that sargassum thrive in warm water while others have found the opposite.

“There’s so much going on which is why everyone is not sold on one answer,” Dr. Cox said. “All of us can only look at one or two things at a time. I absolutely think the inundations will stay the same or get worse.”

As for next year’s seaweed invasion, Dr. Lapointe said beach-lovers should stay vigilant before booking a spring break vacation, noting that the Bahamas might be a safer bet than the Yucatán.

“I would be very careful in choosing a destination,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/04/multimedia/04CLI-seaweed-qgtk/04CLI-seaweed-qgtk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 19:03:06.555871

Why: WOTUS is used as a guide to determine which water bodies the federal government can regulate under the Clean Water Act (CWA). The revised WOTUS definition, which was issued on November 20, 2025, aims to bring both the EPA and Corps regulations in line with the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA and provide clarity on the CWA’s regulatory scope.

Key elements of the proposed rule include:

Defining terms such as “relatively permanent,” “continuous surface connection,” and “tributary.”

Establishing that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters either directly or through other features that provide predictable and consistent flow.

Reaffirming that wetlands must be indistinguishable from jurisdictional waters through a continuous surface connection, which means that they must touch a jurisdictional water and hold surface water for a requisite duration year after year.

Preserving and clarifying exclusions for certain ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems.

Adding a new exclusion for groundwater.

Incorporating locally familiar terminology, such as “wet season,” to help determine whether a water body qualifies as WOTUS.

According to the White House, the reset will save American families $109 billion in total.
It put tremendous upward pressure on car prices, combined with the insane electric vehicle mandate.
Meanwhile, U.S. oil producers and fuel traders are the biggest winners here.","Earlier in the year, President Trump signed legislation that effectively ended fuel economy penalties for automakers. The penalties applied to automakers for failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards dating back to the 2022 model year. The measure was part of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" signed into law in July 2025. And now the president has pushed the envelope further by rolling back Biden-era fuel economy standards, terming them ‘‘ridiculous.’’

Trump has officially ended CAFE rules, with automakers now required to meet just 34.5 mpg across their model fleet by 2031, much lower than 50.4 mpg that the Biden administration had imposed. Trump says the less stringent fuel standards will allow automakers to produce more affordable cars, cutting the price of vehicles by at least $1,000.

According to the White House, the reset will save American families $109 billion in total. Earlier in the year, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy claimed the Biden administration wrongly assumed that fuel economy averages for automaker fleets would automatically rise in the coming years as EV adoption accelerates.

""And we're not only talking about outside of our country, because nobody could do it. Nobody wanted to do it. And it was ridiculous, very expensive. It put tremendous upward pressure on car prices, combined with the insane electric vehicle mandate. Biden's burdensome regulations have caused the price of cars to soar more than 25%, and in one case, they went up 18% in one year,"" Trump said.

Not surprisingly, automakers are now breathing a sigh of relief, “Today is a victory for common sense and affordability,” Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) CEO Jim Farley said at the event. “This is the right move … We will invest more in affordable vehicles.”

The EV sector is the biggest loser of this policy change. EV adoption in the United States remains low compared to other major world economies. Indeed, just 7.5% of new vehicle sales in the country are Battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), compared to 50% in China and less than a tenth of Norway’s 80%. These rules were designed to push automakers toward producing more EVs, and their relaxation removes a primary regulatory driver for the transition to electric mobility. To exacerbate matters, the administration has canceled the $7,500 consumer tax credit for EV purchases effective September 30, a major financial incentive that helped offset the higher upfront cost of electric vehicles.

Meanwhile, U.S. oil producers and fuel traders are the biggest winners here. According to Will Anderson, zero-emission vehicles policy advocate at Public Citizen, the Biden-era regulations could have cut U.S. fuel consumption by 70 billion gallons per year, saving Americans $23 billion in fuel costs. However, the real impact is likely to come from the expected slowdown in EV sales. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has forecast that EVs will displace over 5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, or ~5% of global oil demand. Some analyses suggest that this number could be even higher, with projections of displacing 10 million barrels per day by 2035 based on announced policies. Those are big numbers by any measure, and could easily offset demand growth by other sectors.

Overall, Trump’s energy policies will have a negative effect on a cleaner America. Policies supporting electric vehicles and wind/solar projects have been targeted, including restrictions on tax credits for renewable energy. The administration is also attempting to revoke California's authority to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal requirements. The administration has declared a national energy emergency to expedite domestic oil and gas production, including in protected offshore areas.

This emphasis on ""energy dominance"" favors traditional energy sources over renewable ones and is expected to increase the burning of fossil fuels. Numerous environmental protections have been targeted for repeal or weakening, including air and water quality standards, limits on methane emissions, and coal mining oversight. These actions are projected to increase cancer-causing pollutants like soot, benzene, and heavy metals in the air and water. The U.S. has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement and the Climate Loss and Damage Fund, and rescinded domestic net-zero GHG emission goals. The ""social cost of carbon"" metric, used to justify climate regulations, is also being targeted for elimination or reduction.

Carbon Brief’s analysis shows that this means Trump’s policies will add an extra 7 billion tonnes of emissions to the environment. U.S. emissions will now effectively flatline, rather than fall by the required 40% in order to hit climate targets.

The critical raw materials act represents the EU's most ambitious attempt at achieving strategic autonomy in the 21st century, addressing vulnerabilities that have become increasingly apparent amid rising geopolitical tensions.

What Is the EU's Critical Raw Materials Act and Why Does It Matter?

The Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA) represents the EU's most comprehensive legislative response to supply chain vulnerabilities that have plagued European industries for decades. This landmark regulation, which came into force in 2024, establishes binding targets across all 27 EU member states and fundamentally reframes how Europe approaches resource security.

Legislative Framework and Strategic Objectives

At its core, the CRMA addresses three critical dimensions of resource independence through legally binding numerical targets. The legislation mandates that by 2030, the EU must achieve domestic extraction of 10% of its critical raw materials needs, establish processing capacity for 40% of requirements, and implement recycling systems capable of recovering 25% of essential materials.

The strategic objectives extend beyond mere numerical compliance. European policymakers designed the framework to reduce dangerous dependencies on single-source suppliers, particularly in sectors where supply disruptions could cripple entire industries. Furthermore, the regulation acknowledges that Europe's industrial competitiveness depends fundamentally on secure access to materials essential for clean energy transitions, digital infrastructure, and defence capabilities.

Timeline and Implementation Status

Implementation follows a structured timeline with specific milestones and measurement points. The 2030 targets serve as the primary benchmark, however, intermediate assessments will monitor progress and adjust policies as needed. Member states must coordinate their national strategies with EU-wide objectives, creating a complex web of regulatory requirements and compliance mechanisms.

According to Aurubis CEO Toralf Haag, whose company represents Europe's largest copper producer, early implementation discussions with EU authorities have proven challenging. Haag noted that while the company anticipates positive long-term effects for the sector, the regulatory negotiation process has been particularly demanding as industries work to align operational realities with policy objectives.

Key Performance Indicators and Benchmarks

The CRMA establishes measurable performance indicators that will determine success or failure of the regulatory framework. These include specific material availability ratios, processing capacity utilisation rates, recycling efficiency metrics, and supply chain diversification indices. Regular monitoring will assess whether the targets translate into genuine strategic autonomy or merely statistical compliance.

The European Commission will evaluate progress through comprehensive stress testing, supply chain risk assessments, and regular reporting from member states and key industrial players. Consequently, this monitoring system aims to provide early warning signals if dependencies on third countries exceed acceptable thresholds or if domestic capacity development falls behind schedule.

How Will the CRMA Transform Europe's Raw Materials Independence by 2030?

Europe's path to raw materials independence relies on a carefully calibrated balance between domestic production expansion, processing infrastructure development, and circular economy optimisation. The transformation requires unprecedented coordination between public policy, private investment, and technological innovation.

The 10-40-25 Formula Explained

The numerical framework represents more than arbitrary targets; it reflects a strategic assessment of what constitutes achievable yet meaningful progress toward resource security. The 10% domestic extraction target acknowledges geological realities while pushing for expanded mining activities in regions with viable deposits. Meanwhile, the 40% processing capacity goal addresses the critical bottleneck where raw materials are refined into usable industrial inputs.

CRMA Target Percentage Current EU Performance Gap to Close Domestic Extraction 10% Varies by material (2-8%) Significant expansion needed Processing Capacity 40% Limited (5-15% typical) Major infrastructure investment required Recycling Achievement 25% Mixed (10-60% depending on material) Technology and collection improvements essential

The 25% recycling target may prove most achievable in the near term, as it builds on existing circular economy initiatives and requires less capital-intensive infrastructure compared to mining or processing facilities. However, as Aurubis leadership emphasised, keeping recycling materials within European borders remains a critical challenge requiring export restrictions and customs duties to prevent material outflows.

Strategic Raw Materials vs Critical Raw Materials Classification

The critical raw materials act distinguishes between strategic and critical raw materials based on economic importance, supply risk, and substitutability factors. Strategic raw materials include those essential for emerging technologies and defence applications, while critical raw materials encompass a broader range of materials vital for industrial production.

This classification system determines regulatory priorities, funding allocation, and policy interventions. For instance, materials classified as strategic receive enhanced protection through export controls, stockpiling requirements, and preferential access to EU funding programmes. The distinction also influences trade policy, with strategic materials subject to more restrictive export licensing and foreign investment screening.

Supply Chain Diversification Requirements

Diversification mandates require companies to demonstrate resilience against supply disruptions through multiple sourcing strategies, alternative material development, and geographic distribution of suppliers. Large companies must conduct supply chain due diligence and develop contingency plans for critical material shortages.

The diversification approach recognises that complete self-sufficiency remains unrealistic for many materials. Instead, the strategy focuses on reducing dangerous over-reliance on single suppliers or regions while building robust networks of alternative sources across different geopolitical zones.

Which Industries Stand to Benefit Most from CRMA Implementation?

The regulatory framework creates distinct advantages for industries positioned to capitalise on enhanced supply chain security, domestic processing capacity, and recycling infrastructure development. Early beneficiaries will likely be companies with existing European operations and established relationships with EU policymakers.

Clean Energy Technology Manufacturers

Renewable energy equipment manufacturers stand to benefit significantly from guaranteed access to critical materials like rare earth elements, lithium, and specialised alloys. The critical minerals energy transition focus on processing capacity development could reduce costs and delivery times for companies producing wind turbines, solar panels, and energy storage systems.

European companies in this sector will gain competitive advantages over non-EU rivals who may face export restrictions or higher costs when sourcing materials from European recycling streams. Furthermore, the regulatory framework essentially creates a protected market for clean energy materials, supporting the EU's broader climate objectives.

Automotive and Battery Production Sectors

Electric vehicle manufacturers and battery producers represent primary beneficiaries of critical raw materials act implementation, particularly regarding lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite supply chains. The regulation's emphasis on recycling could create cost-effective sources of battery materials while reducing reliance on geopolitically sensitive mining regions.

Automotive companies with European production facilities will benefit from enhanced material security and potentially lower input costs as domestic processing capacity expands. Additionally, the regulatory framework supports the industry's transition to electric mobility by addressing one of the most significant supply chain vulnerabilities.

Electronics and Digital Infrastructure Companies

Semiconductor manufacturers, telecommunications equipment producers, and digital infrastructure companies require stable access to specialty metals and rare earth elements. The CRMA's processing capacity targets could establish European sources for materials currently dominated by Asian suppliers.

These industries will particularly benefit from battery recycling initiatives, as electronic waste contains significant concentrations of valuable materials that can be recovered and reprocessed. The regulatory framework's focus on circular economy principles aligns well with electronics industry sustainability goals.

Defence and Aerospace Applications

Military and aerospace industries require materials with specific performance characteristics and secure supply chains free from geopolitical interference. The CRMA's strategic materials classification provides enhanced protection for defence-critical materials through export controls and stockpiling requirements.

European defence contractors will benefit from guaranteed access to specialty alloys, rare earth elements, and other materials essential for advanced weapons systems, aircraft, and space technology. Consequently, the regulatory framework supports European strategic autonomy objectives in defence procurement.

What Are the Key Regulatory Mechanisms Driving CRMA Success?

The CRMA's effectiveness depends on sophisticated regulatory mechanisms that streamline approvals, coordinate member state actions, and provide targeted support for strategic projects. These mechanisms represent significant departures from traditional EU regulatory approaches.

Streamlined Permitting Processes and Timeline Reductions

The streamlined permitting reforms aim to reduce approval timelines for mining, processing, and recycling facilities through coordinated procedures and standardised requirements across member states. The regulatory framework establishes clear deadlines for permitting decisions and creates fast-track procedures for strategic projects.

Extraction Permit Timeline Target: 24-27 Months

The CRMA establishes ambitious targets for permitting timeline reductions, aiming to process extraction permits within 24-27 months compared to current procedures that often require 5-10 years for complex projects.

These timeline reductions require significant changes in member state regulatory procedures, enhanced coordination between different approval authorities, and streamlined environmental impact assessments. The success of permitting reforms will largely determine whether the 2030 targets remain achievable.

Strategic Project Designation and State Aid Flexibility

Projects receiving strategic designation benefit from enhanced state aid flexibility, expedited approvals, and preferential access to EU funding programmes. The designation process considers economic importance, supply chain impact, and contribution to EU strategic objectives.

State aid flexibility allows member states to provide financial support that would normally violate EU competition rules, recognising that strategic autonomy objectives may require temporary market interventions. This mechanism provides crucial support for projects that deliver public benefits but may not be commercially viable without assistance.

Each member state must establish single points of contact to coordinate CRMA implementation, facilitate cross-border projects, and ensure consistent application of regulatory requirements. These coordination mechanisms aim to prevent bureaucratic fragmentation that could undermine policy effectiveness.

The single point of contact system enables companies to navigate complex multi-jurisdictional requirements through centralised coordination rather than separate negotiations with multiple national authorities. This approach particularly benefits projects spanning multiple member states or requiring coordinated supply chain development.

How Does the CRMA Address Supply Chain Vulnerabilities?

Supply chain resilience forms the foundation of the CRMA's strategic approach, recognising that Europe's industrial competitiveness depends on reliable access to essential materials. The regulatory framework addresses vulnerabilities through diversification requirements, monitoring systems, and protective measures.

The 65% Third-Country Dependency Limit

The 65% threshold represents the maximum acceptable level of dependence on any single third country for critical materials supply. When dependencies exceed this limit, the EU must implement corrective measures including alternative sourcing, domestic capacity development, or strategic stockpiling.

This mechanism provides objective criteria for identifying dangerous dependencies before they create systemic vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the threshold applies to both primary materials and processed products, ensuring that supply chain security extends throughout the value chain rather than focusing solely on raw material extraction.

Stress Testing and Risk Monitoring Requirements

Regular stress testing evaluates supply chain resilience under various scenarios including geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, trade disputes, and market volatility. These assessments identify potential failure points and inform policy responses before disruptions occur.

Risk monitoring systems track supply chain indicators in real-time, providing early warning signals when dependencies approach dangerous levels or when alternative sources become unavailable. Consequently, the monitoring framework enables proactive rather than reactive policy responses to emerging threats.

Strategic Stock Coordination Mechanisms

Member states must coordinate strategic stockpiles to ensure adequate reserves exist for critical materials during supply disruptions. The coordination mechanism prevents duplication of effort while ensuring comprehensive coverage across different materials and regions.

Strategic stockpiling balances cost considerations with security objectives, recognising that maintaining reserves for all critical materials would be economically prohibitive. The coordination system enables efficient resource allocation and shared responsibility among member states.

Large Company Supply Chain Due Diligence Obligations

Companies above specified size thresholds must conduct comprehensive supply chain due diligence, including mapping supplier networks, assessing risk factors, and developing contingency plans for material shortages. These obligations create transparency and accountability in critical materials sourcing.

Due diligence requirements extend beyond immediate suppliers to include upstream mining operations, processing facilities, and transportation networks. Companies must demonstrate understanding of their complete supply chains and ability to respond effectively to potential disruptions.

What Role Does Recycling Play in CRMA's Circular Economy Vision?

Recycling represents the most immediately achievable component of the CRMA's 2030 targets, building on existing waste management infrastructure while creating new opportunities for material recovery and industrial competitiveness. The circular economy approach addresses both supply security and environmental objectives.

25% Recycling Target Implementation Strategy

Achieving the 25% recycling target requires systematic improvements in collection, sorting, processing, and material recovery across multiple industries. The implementation strategy focuses on materials with high recycling potential and established processing technologies.

Collection system improvements must capture materials currently lost to landfills or exported outside the EU. Enhanced sorting technologies will improve material purity and processing efficiency, while processing infrastructure development will expand capacity to handle increased recycling volumes.

According to Aurubis financial reporting, recycling operations face current market challenges including slight revenue declines and competitive pressures. However, the company expects long-term protection for European recycling markets through regulatory measures that prevent material export and strengthen domestic processing capabilities.

Export Restrictions and Customs Duties on Recycling Materials

Export controls on recycling materials aim to ensure adequate domestic supply for European processing facilities while preventing material outflows that undermine circular economy objectives. Customs duties create economic incentives for domestic processing rather than material export.

Aurubis CEO Toralf Haag emphasised that recycling materials are urgently needed to fulfil strong European demand, advocating for export restrictions and customs duties at the EU level. The company maintains active discussions with EU authorities regarding these protective measures, though negotiations have proven challenging as industries and policymakers balance market access with supply security objectives.

Technology Innovation Requirements for Material Recovery

Advanced recovery technologies will be essential for achieving ambitious recycling targets, particularly for complex materials and low-concentration waste streams. Innovation requirements focus on improving recovery rates, reducing processing costs, and expanding the range of recyclable materials.

Research and development priorities include hydrometallurgical processes, biotechnology applications, and artificial intelligence systems for waste sorting and material identification. These technological advances will determine whether the 25% recycling target translates into genuine supply chain benefits or merely statistical compliance.

Which Countries and Regions Will Be Most Affected by CRMA Trade Policies?

The CRMA's implementation will reshape global trade relationships and create new patterns of competition and cooperation in critical materials markets. Different regions face varying opportunities and challenges depending on their current market positions and strategic relationships with the EU.

China's Dominant Position in Critical Materials Processing

China currently controls significant portions of global critical materials processing capacity, particularly for rare earth elements, battery materials, and specialised alloys. The critical raw materials act 40% processing target directly challenges this dominance by creating alternative European capacity.

Chinese companies may face reduced access to European markets as domestic processing capacity expands and supply chain diversification requirements take effect. However, China's technological advantages and cost competitiveness in processing operations will likely maintain significant market influence despite European efforts to reduce dependencies.

The competitive dynamic between European processing development and Chinese market position will influence global pricing, technology transfer patterns, and investment flows in critical materials industries. These developments parallel broader US‑China trade war impacts on global supply chains and industrial competitiveness.

African Mining Partnerships and Strategic Agreements

African countries with significant critical materials deposits represent important partners for European supply diversification efforts. The CRMA creates incentives for enhanced mining partnerships, infrastructure investment, and technology transfer to African producers.

Countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo (cobalt), Guinea (bauxite), and Morocco (phosphates) could benefit from preferential trade relationships with the EU as European companies seek alternatives to Asian suppliers. However, these partnerships must address environmental standards, labour conditions, and revenue-sharing arrangements to ensure sustainable development.

Latin American Lithium Triangle Implications

Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile possess substantial lithium resources essential for European battery manufacturing and electric vehicle production. The CRMA's implementation could strengthen trade relationships with these countries while creating competition with Asian buyers for limited lithium supplies.

European investment in Latin American lithium processing infrastructure could support both EU strategic objectives and regional economic development. Nevertheless, environmental concerns, indigenous rights issues, and resource nationalism policies in some countries create potential complications for expanded trade relationships.

North American Trade Relationship Adjustments

The United States and Canada possess significant critical materials resources and processing capabilities that could complement European supply diversification efforts. However, US Inflation Reduction Act requirements and Canadian resource policies create potential areas of cooperation and competition.

Transatlantic coordination on critical materials policies could enhance supply security for both regions while creating competitive advantages relative to other global players. However, different regulatory approaches and industrial policy priorities may also create trade tensions or conflicts over access to limited materials supplies.

What Are the Main Implementation Challenges Facing the CRMA?

Despite ambitious objectives and comprehensive regulatory mechanisms, the CRMA faces significant implementation obstacles that could prevent achievement of 2030 targets. Understanding these challenges is essential for realistic assessment of policy effectiveness and potential modifications.

Funding Gaps and Investment Requirements

Achieving CRMA targets requires massive capital investment in mining infrastructure, processing facilities, recycling systems, and technology development. Current funding mechanisms may prove insufficient for the scale of investment needed across multiple industries and member states.

Investment Sector Estimated Requirement (€ Billions) Current Funding Gap Primary Funding Sources Mining Infrastructure 15-25 High Private investment, state aid Processing Facilities 30-50 Very High EU funds, member state support Recycling Systems 10-20 Moderate Mixed public-private R&D and Technology 5-10 Moderate Horizon Europe, national programmes

Private sector investment will be essential but requires confidence in long-term policy stability, market demand, and return on investment. Public funding mechanisms must balance fiscal constraints with strategic necessity, while coordination between EU and member state programmes prevents duplication and ensures comprehensive coverage.

Aurubis reported operating pre-tax earnings of €355 million for the year ended September 30, representing a 14% decline. The company's results reflect challenges including lower concentrate throughput, reduced treatment and refining charges, and higher costs associated with strategic project expansions such as the Bulgaria plant development.

Environmental and Social Acceptance Barriers

Expanded mining and processing activities face significant environmental opposition and social resistance in many European communities. Permitting reforms must balance accelerated approvals with legitimate environmental concerns and stakeholder consultation requirements.

Public acceptance challenges include concerns about environmental impacts, community disruption, and health effects from mining and processing operations. Addressing these concerns requires transparent environmental assessments, community engagement programmes, and comprehensive mitigation measures.

Technical Capacity Building Requirements

Europe's mining and processing industries have declined significantly over recent decades, creating skills gaps and technical capacity limitations that constrain rapid expansion. Rebuilding these capabilities requires comprehensive workforce development and technology transfer programmes.

Educational institutions must develop specialised training programmes for mining engineering, metallurgy, and materials processing. Industry partnerships with universities and research institutions will be essential for building the human capital needed to achieve CRMA objectives.

Permitting Complexity Despite Streamlining Efforts

While the CRMA includes permitting reform provisions, the complexity of mining and processing projects creates inherent challenges for timeline reductions. Environmental assessments, stakeholder consultations, and technical reviews require substantial time regardless of regulatory reforms.

Cross-border projects face additional complexity through multiple jurisdictional requirements and coordination challenges. Even with single points of contact, the technical complexity of critical materials projects may limit the effectiveness of permitting streamlining measures.

How Does the CRMA Compare to Similar Legislation Globally?

The CRMA represents one of several national and regional initiatives addressing critical materials supply security, reflecting growing global recognition of these vulnerabilities. Comparative analysis reveals different approaches and potential areas for international coordination.

US Inflation Reduction Act Critical Minerals Provisions

The US Inflation Reduction Act includes substantial support for domestic critical minerals production and processing, with tax credits and funding programmes designed to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers. The approach emphasises private sector incentives rather than regulatory mandates.

Key differences include the US focus on tax incentives versus EU regulatory requirements, different material classification systems, and varying approaches to international partnerships. Both frameworks aim to reduce dependence on Chinese processing capacity but use different policy tools to achieve these objectives.

China's Rare Earth Export Control Measures

China has implemented comprehensive export control systems for rare earth elements and other critical materials, demonstrating how dominant suppliers can use trade policy to maintain strategic advantages. These measures provide insights into potential responses to European diversification efforts.

Chinese export controls include licensing requirements, quantity restrictions, and quality specifications that influence global market dynamics. Understanding these policies is essential for assessing the effectiveness of European supply diversification strategies.

Australia's Critical Minerals Strategy

Australia's approach emphasises international partnerships, technology development, and downstream processing capacity to capture more value from its substantial critical minerals resources. The critical minerals strategy focuses on building processing capabilities rather than simply exporting raw materials.

Australian policies complement European diversification objectives by providing alternative supply sources and processing partnerships. The alignment between Australian supply capabilities and European demand creates opportunities for enhanced trade relationships.

Canada's Critical Minerals List and Policy Framework

Canada's critical minerals strategy emphasises resource development, Indigenous partnerships, and environmental sustainability while building processing capacity for domestic and export markets. The approach balances resource development with environmental protection and social responsibility.

Canadian policies offer potential synergies with CRMA objectives through complementary supply chains and technology cooperation. However, competition for limited processing capacity and skilled workforce could also create tensions between Canadian domestic priorities and European supply needs.

What Does CRMA Success Look Like for European Businesses?

Successful CRMA implementation will fundamentally transform the operating environment for European businesses across multiple sectors, creating new opportunities while addressing longstanding vulnerabilities in global supply chains.

Reduced Supply Chain Risk Exposure

European companies will benefit from decreased vulnerability to supply disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and price volatility in critical materials markets. Diversified supply sources and domestic processing capacity will provide greater operational stability and planning certainty.

Risk reduction extends beyond material availability to include price stability, quality consistency, and delivery reliability. Companies will be able to develop longer-term strategies without constant concern about supply chain disruptions affecting production schedules and customer commitments.

Enhanced Investment Certainty and Planning Horizons

The CRMA's regulatory framework provides greater certainty for long-term investment planning in materials-intensive industries. Companies can invest in capacity expansion, technology development, and product innovation with confidence in material availability and supply chain stability.

Investment certainty particularly benefits industries with long development cycles and high capital requirements, such as renewable energy infrastructure, electric vehicle manufacturing, and advanced electronics production. The regulatory framework reduces technology risks associated with material availability uncertainties.

Competitive Advantages in Global Markets

European companies with secure access to critical materials will gain competitive advantages over rivals facing supply constraints or higher material costs. Domestic processing capacity and recycling capabilities could provide cost advantages and shorter supply chains.

The competitive benefits extend to export markets where European companies can offer greater supply security and sustainability credentials compared to competitors dependent on less reliable or environmentally problematic supply chains.

Innovation Opportunities in Processing Technologies

CRMA implementation will drive innovation in materials processing, recycling technologies, and alternative material development. European companies that develop advanced processing capabilities could become global technology leaders in critical materials industries.

Innovation opportunities include hydrometallurgical processing, biotechnology applications, artificial intelligence for materials optimisation, and circular economy technologies. These developments could create new export industries and intellectual property advantages for European companies.

Critical Raw Materials Act Implementation: Frequently Asked Questions

The Board includes representatives from member states, industry associations, and technical experts to ensure comprehensive perspective on policy development and implementation.

Board functions include monitoring progress toward targets, coordinating cross-border projects, providing technical guidance on policy implementation, and facilitating information sharing between stakeholders. Furthermore, the Board also advises on strategic project designations and policy adjustments based on implementation experience.

What happens if member states fail to meet 2030 targets?

The CRMA includes provisions for corrective measures if member states fail to achieve 2030 targets, including enhanced monitoring, technical assistance, and potential policy adjustments. The framework emphasises collaborative problem-solving rather than punitive measures.

Failure to meet targets could result in revised implementation strategies, additional EU funding support, or modifications to regulatory requirements based on practical implementation experience. The approach recognises that ambitious targets may require adjustments based on technical and economic realities.

Long-term Implications: Europe's Resource Security Beyond 2030

The CRMA's impact extends far beyond its 2030 targets, establishing institutional frameworks and industrial capabilities that will influence European competitiveness and strategic autonomy for decades. Understanding these longer-term implications is essential for assessing the regulation's true significance.

Geopolitical Shifts in Global Materials Markets

Successful CRMA implementation will contribute to fundamental realignment of global critical materials markets, reducing European dependence on dominant suppliers while creating new patterns of international trade and cooperation. These shifts will influence global pricing, technology transfer, and investment flows.

The geopolitical implications extend beyond Europe to affect relationships between major economies, developing country resource policies, and international cooperation frameworks. European success in building strategic autonomy could encourage similar efforts by other regions, further fragmenting global supply chains.

Technology Innovation Acceleration Potential

CRMA requirements will drive innovation in materials processing, recycling technologies, and alternative material development that could position Europe as a global leader in next-generation materials technologies. These innovations may create new export industries and intellectual property advantages.

Technology leadership in critical materials processing could provide economic benefits extending well beyond supply security objectives, creating high-value industries and export opportunities that enhance European competitiveness in global markets.

Environmental Sustainability Integration

The CRMA's emphasis on recycling and circular economy principles establishes foundations for more sustainable approaches to materials consumption and waste management. Long-term success could demonstrate that strategic autonomy objectives align with environmental protection goals.

Sustainability integration includes reducing environmental impacts of materials extraction and processing while building circular economy capabilities that minimise waste and maximise resource efficiency. These approaches could become models for other regions facing similar challenges.

Next-Generation Critical Materials Identification

Technological evolution will continuously create demand for new materials not currently classified as critical, requiring adaptive policy frameworks and flexible supply chain development capabilities. The CRMA's institutional mechanisms must evolve to address emerging material requirements.

Future critical materials may include quantum computing components, advanced energy storage materials, and specialised alloys for aerospace applications. The regulatory framework must maintain flexibility to address these evolving requirements while building on established capabilities and relationships.

It follows other state consumer privacy laws by providing consumers with rights related to the collection and processing of their information. On November 25, 2025, Indiana’s Attorney General issued a Consumer Data Protection Bill of Rights as “a tool to educate Hoosiers on how the new law works, the rights offered to consumers and the obligations placed on applicable businesses.”

The Bill of Rights details core consumer rights under the CDPA and adds specific clarity, examples, and expectations for how businesses should operationalize them. Though the guide is intended to clarify the law for consumers, it also puts businesses on notice about the Indiana Attorney General’s compliance expectations under the privacy law.

Rights Summarized in the Bill

The Bill of Rights outlines 15 protections for Indiana consumers, including rights to delete personal data held by companies, opt out of targeted advertising and data sales, and request a copy of their information in a portable format. Amongst other guidelines:

Consumers can find out if a business is processing their data and request one free copy of their personal data each year;

Consumers can request corrections to inaccurate data, or have their personal data deleted, regardless of its source;

Customers can opt out of targeted advertising, profiling, and sale of their personal data.

Businesses may not discriminate if a consumer exercises their rights, including by changing services, pricing, or quality;

Requests must be addressed within 45 days, with one possible 45-day extension; and

Sensitive data, including health, biometric, immigration, religious, and precise location data, and all data on children under 13, cannot be processed unless the consumer or parent/guardian gives opt-in consent.

A Step-by-Step Consumer Guide

Unlike statutes or regulations, the Bill of Rights gives consumers step-by-step instructions for determining if a business is a “controller” subject to the CDPA, how to exercise their rights, and what to do if their request is denied. Consumers are advised to first confirm whether the CDPA even applies, checking for coverage, exemptions, and whether the business meets the relevant data thresholds. Next, they are encouraged to use the methods described in the company’s privacy notice (such as an online form, email, or mailing address) to submit requests to access, correct, or delete their data. For opt-out requests, such as stopping targeted advertising or the sale of personal data, the Bill of Rights instructs consumers to use specifically provided mechanisms, like opt-out buttons or forms.

If a business denies a request, the Bill outlines how to appeal through the company’s process and reminds consumers that if a company does not comply, the consumer can file a formal complaint with the Attorney General’s office. The document also highlights the need for timely responses and requires companies to provide appeal instructions and reasons for denials.

Takeaways

Make your privacy notice easy to find and understand. Given its ease of use and accessibility, consumers are likely to use this document to evaluate companies’ websites for CDPA compliance. Privacy notices should clearly detail what data is collected, with whom it is shared, and how customers can exercise their rights; and

Build user-friendly request and appeal processes. The Bill of Rights expects companies to provide a clear, practical mechanism for requests. Companies should test their processes to determine whether they are accessible and available in the way consumers are likely to make requests. Companies should also train legal and compliance teams on timely responses to consumer requests.

Indiana’s Consumer Data Protection Bill of Rights is likely to drive public understanding, customer expectations, and regulator priorities. As January 2026 approaches, companies should review and update their privacy practices, notices, and response procedures accordingly.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-12/privacy-law-litigation-security-177684106_1.jpg.webp?itok=Y0zA9Fs3,N,,2025-12-05 00:58:10.425438

Forward-Looking Statements

This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions including statements regarding our projected revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2026. There are a significant number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made in this press release, including: macroeconomic trends including changes in or sustained inflation, interest rate volatility, increased tariffs or other events beyond our control on the overall economy which may reduce demand for our products and services; geopolitical events and conflicts; adverse impacts to our business and those of our customers and suppliers, including due to supply chain disruptions, component shortages, and associated logistics expense increases; our limited operating history as a public company; our ability as an organization to successfully acquire, integrate or partner with other companies, products or technologies in a successful manner such as our partnership efforts with Eaton Corporation; our dependence on widespread acceptance and adoption of EVs, including any delays or modifications to auto manufacturers' plans and strategies to transition to predominately manufacture EVs and any corresponding decreased demand for installation of charging stations; our current dependence on sales of charging stations for the majority of our revenues; overall demand for EV charging and the potential for reduced demand for EVs if governmental policies, rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives are reduced, modified or eliminated or governmental mandates to increase the use of EVs or decrease the use of vehicles powered by fossil fuels, either directly or indirectly through mandated limits on carbon emissions, are reduced, modified or eliminated; our ability, and our reliance on our customers, to successfully implement, construct and manage state, federal and local charging infrastructure programs in accordance with the respective terms of such program in order to validly secure and obtain awarded funding and win additional grant opportunities; our reliance on contract manufacturers, including those located outside the United States, may result in supply chain interruptions, delays and expense increases which may adversely affect our sales, revenue and gross margins; our ability to expand our operations and market share in Europe; the need to attract additional fleet operators as customers; potential adverse effects on our revenue and gross margins due to delays and costs associated with new product introductions, such as our new AC and Express DC fast charging product architecture featuring bidirectional charging, inventory obsolescence, component shortages and related expense increases; the ability or success of our new AC and Express DC fast charging product architecture to result in an increased demand for charging products by commercial, residential and fleet charging customers; adverse impact to our revenues and gross margins if customers increasingly claim clean energy credits and, as a result, they are no longer available to be claimed by us; the effects of competition; risks related to our dependence on our intellectual property; and the risk that our technology could have undetected defects or errors. Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results are included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 8, 2025, which is available on our website at investors.chargepoint.com and on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in other filings that we make with the SEC from time to time. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update the forward-looking statements provided to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made, except as required by applicable law.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

ChargePoint has provided financial information in this press release that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). ChargePoint uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results. ChargePoint believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and believes they provide meaningful supplemental information to investors regarding ChargePoint’s underlying operating performance because they exclude items ChargePoint believes are unrelated to, and may not be indicative of, its core operating results.

The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with ChargePoint’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of ChargePoint’s historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations.

Non-GAAP Gross Profit (Gross Margin). ChargePoint defines non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets and restructuring costs for severances and employment-related termination costs, and facility and other contract terminations. Non-GAAP gross margin is non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenue.

Non-GAAP Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses (includes Non-GAAP research and development, Non-GAAP sales and marketing and Non-GAAP general and administrative). ChargePoint defines non-GAAP cost of revenue and operating expenses as cost of revenue and operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs for severances and employment-related termination costs, and facility and other contract terminations, and non-cash charges related to tax liabilities and litigation settlements, including associated non-recurring legal expenses and professional service fees.

Non-GAAP Net Loss. ChargePoint defines non-GAAP net loss as net loss excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs for severances and employment-related termination costs, and facility and other contract terminations, and non-cash charges related to tax liabilities and litigation settlements, including associated non-recurring legal expenses and professional service fees. These amounts reflect the impact of any related tax effects. Non-GAAP pre-tax net loss is non-GAAP net loss adjusted for provision for income taxes.

Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA Loss. ChargePoint defines non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss as net loss excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs for severances and employment-related termination costs, and facility and other contract terminations, non-cash charges related to tax liabilities and litigation settlements, including associated non-recurring legal expenses and professional service fees, and further adjusted for provision of income taxes, depreciation, interest income and expense, and other income and expense (net).

Investors are cautioned that there are a number of limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial results and trends. In particular, many of the adjustments to ChargePoint’s GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in its financial results for the foreseeable future, such as stock-based compensation, which is an important part of ChargePoint’s employees’ compensation and impacts hiring, retention and performance. Furthermore, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP, and the components that ChargePoint excludes in its calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the components that other companies exclude when they report their non-GAAP results. In the future, ChargePoint may also exclude other expenses it determines do not reflect the performance of ChargePoint’s operating results.

,American Energy,2025-12-04 22:41:53+00:00,Axios,AI model helps geothermal energy company with big discovery in Nevada - Axios,Chuck McCutcheon,,,,,https://www.axios.com/2025/12/04/nevada-energy-ai-models-discovery-research,"A geothermal energy company announced Thursday that it has discovered — with AI's help — the first commercially viable system of its kind in over 30 years.
Driving the news: The Nevada formation, dubbed ""Big Blind,"" had no surface signs of geothermal activity or any prior history of exploration.
They fed data into Zanskar's AI prediction engine, which helped narrow down the list of options.
Context: The Big Blind discovery follows Zanskar's work at two other geothermal sites — Pumpernickel in northern Nevada and Lightning Dock in New Mexico.
Congress and the Trump administration strongly support geothermal energy.","A geothermal energy company announced Thursday that it has discovered — with AI's help — the first commercially viable system of its kind in over 30 years.

Why it matters: Zanskar Geothermal and Minerals officials said the underground find, in a remote area of western Nevada, offers fresh evidence that geothermal can become an attractive option to meet soaring U.S. energy demand.

Geothermal is the rare alternative energy source with wide bipartisan backing. Democrats are attracted to its zero-emissions footprint, while Republicans like its potential to offer round-the-clock power.

Driving the news: The Nevada formation, dubbed ""Big Blind,"" had no surface signs of geothermal activity or any prior history of exploration.

Zanskar scientists used computer models to locate a geothermal anomaly that indicated exceptionally high heat flow at the site.

They fed data into Zanskar's AI prediction engine, which helped narrow down the list of options.

Zoom in: The result led to ""fewer bad wells"" being drilled, Joel Edwards, Zanskar's co-founder and chief technology officer, told Axios. That reduces the cost of the projects, he said.

Carl Hoiland, the company's other co-founder and CEO, said AI technology ""has allowed us to target deeper and more precisely.""

""The analogy here is really every other natural-resource industry, from oil to minerals to shale gas,"" he said. ""They all started on what was at the surface and over time got better at going deeper.""

Context: The Big Blind discovery follows Zanskar's work at two other geothermal sites — Pumpernickel in northern Nevada and Lightning Dock in New Mexico.

Unlike Big Blind, both sites had been known to have evidence of geothermal activity, but neither had been fully examined to identify their potential.

What's next: The company plans to seek permits to develop Big Blind into a commercial venture. It hopes the site will provide power by later this decade.

The big picture: The International Energy Agency predicted that geothermal could meet up to 15% of global power demand growth through 2050 — but said greater government policy support, specialized labor, and other boosts will be necessary.

Congress and the Trump administration strongly support geothermal energy. Energy Secretary Chris Wright in March called it ""an awesome resource that's under our feet"" that could provide the power needed for AI innovation.

The giant tax and spending bill that President Trump signed into law this summer cut tax credits for many renewable energy tax incentives but preserved them for geothermal.

A few weeks ago, in the middle of November, more than a hundred people showed up to make sure the Indiana Department of Environmental Management heard their opposition to a data center being built in southeast Fort Wayne.

“We’re not just here to defend our neighborhoods in the backyard of this data center, we’re here to defend everyone down river,"" Kelly Atkins said to represenatives from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management at a hearing about the latest request from the Google data center. At the end of the hearing, the crowd of speakers began chanting at the representatives; ""Deny, deny, deny.""

Hatchworks LLC, a subsidiary of Google, is requesting an additional 143 diesel generators to support the campus.

To understand the opposition to the build, first, a look at how the data center came to Fort Wayne, when it was known only as “Project Zodiac.”

How the data center came to Fort Wayne

In October of 2023, what was then described as an “unnamed Fortune 100 company” proposed a data center campus around Adams Center and Paulding roads, using nearly 900 acres of land and requiring an annexation of more than 700 acres into Fort Wayne.

The months that followed included a “super-voluntary” annexation, land sale and tax abatement approvals. In January 2024, after everything was finalized, the anonymous company’s name was released; Google would be building a data center campus with up to 12 buildings.

Community development director Jonathan Leist recalled how the property sale went through.

“So we sold our portion of the property for a little less than $12 million, $11.4 (million) I believe, something like that,"" Leist said. ""So that was over and above our last appraisal that we had of the property. So definitely market rate on the land sale.”

In December 2023, Mayor Sharon Tucker was still serving as the city council representative for the sixth district, the area where the data center is currently being built. Following a visit to a similar data center in Columbus, Ohio, at the December 22, 2023 city council meeting, Tucker spoke in favor of approving the project.

“There have been a multitude of bad projects that have tried to be dumped on the south side and I have fought every single one of them,"" Tucker said at the December 2023 meeting. ""This is not one, council, that I’m fighting.”

In her visit to the campus in Columbus, joined by Leist, he said their concerns specifically about sound pollution diminished.

""I think what we saw and heard there was that the only sound really being emitted was construction,"" Leist said. ""Like there was no unique data center sound that I think people in other locations had.”

A change in the energy landscape

The Midwest has become something of a breeding ground for data centers, due to cooler temperatures that require less energy-intensive cooling than Southern states. Great Lakes states like Indiana, Ohio and Michigan have seen a boom in data center builds over the last several years.

There are 72 facilities under construction in Indiana alone.

Earlier this year, the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan published a study into what happens when data centers come to towns.

The study found that, while many data centers propose to eventually run entirely on green energy, the green energy needed for that much energy running all the time isn’t currently possible.

And in cases like Fort Wayne, the company then asks for more of the old energy sources.

Molly Kleinman is the managing director of the science, technology and public policy program at the Ford School.

“I haven’t seen solid justification for the humungous embrace of as much energy, dirty as it needs to be, as we can get now, and we’ll worry about clean energy down the line,"" Kleinman said.

But it isn’t just about not using green energy. In many cases, the issue is the way data centers have increased reliance on fossil fuels. In many areas, increased energy needs from data centers are helping coal and gas plants slated for closure to find a second life.

“We’ve seen that data centers have eaten up all of the renewable capacity that the countries added over the last several years, and then gone beyond it,"" Kleinman said. ""They have essentially canceled out all of the gains that we had previously made in renewables.”

Bryce Gustafson is program organizer with Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer and environmental advocacy group based out of Indianapolis.

“This may come as a shock to some people, but Indiana was on a trajectory of getting away from fossil fuels,"" he said. ""This has completely upended that trajectory.”

Indiana Michigan Power just got permission to acquire an existing 870-megawatt gas-fired power plant in Ohio. NIPSCO announced plans in September to build a natural gas plant, through separate company NIPSCO GenCo, to address the increased needs from data centers throughout the state.

A large investment to the city

When city officials approved the Google data center for southeast Fort Wayne, they agreed to a somewhat unusual tax abatement. Fort Wayne community development director Jonathan Leist explains;

""We knew we were up against some other locations, some other states, so we wanted to be competitive. And so rather than our traditional phase in which has a lower amount in the beginning of taxes paid and a higher amount abated, the company, they were comfortable, and we were comfortable with a 50% kind of across the board, which actually ends up being about the same amount as you would get on a 10 year.”

That means that in the year 2025, it changed how the property was evaluated and Google is expected to pay $1 million in property taxes this year. In an area of the city that’s already facing a $3 million cut in city investments, that $1 million is significant.

And, at the end of the full build on the property, Google will generate about $5.9 million per year in property taxes, according to Leist.

“So in this case, a very large investment,"" he said. ""Larger than probably anything we had seen at least in the last five years, for sure, probably 10 years or more.”

In the nearly two years since the project was approved, Google has invested money through grants and donations into the community.

In April of 2024, the data center broke ground and, at that groundbreaking, announced initial investments to the Fort Wayne Early Learning Center and Just Neighbors Interfaith Homeless Network.

In October of this year, the Allen County Public Library received a $35,000 grant from Google for the Rolland Center for Lincoln Research.

Bryce Gustafson, program organizer with Citizens Action Coalition, says companies should give back to the communities they’re building in, but he questioned if what they’re giving is enough.

“I don’t begrudge that but, also, you have to take into account how much money they’re gonna save at the state-level through state sales tax exemptions,"" Gustafson said. ""It would be great to have those numbers to compare because in some situations I’ve seen where ‘we’re gonna give half a million dollars a year here,’ or ‘a million dollars there.’ In the grand scheme of things that’s a nickel to them.”

The environmental risks that data centers bring

With the benefit of economic impact comes potential environmental risks.

In Fort Wayne, the Google data center’s developer’s original plan

included 34 emergency diesel generators and took about three and three-quarters acres in wetlands. This year, developers were approved to take nearly 10 additional wetlands. They’ve more than quadrupled their request for diesel generators, now asking for an additional 143.

“Eighteen months ago, they knew, or should have known, at that time, that that was not enough to sustain their operations. Which means they submitted something that is in bad faith at best,"" Gina Burgess said.

Burgess showed up to speak at the hearing with the Indiana Department of Environmental Management about the request for more generators.

About 75 people spoke at that meeting, which took place in mid-November, but more than a hundred signed up to speak before the meeting ran out of time.

Every single person who spoke encouraged IDEM to deny the permit.

Resident Danielle Doepke spoke specifically about the health risks the diesel generators pose.

“Diesel exhaust has been classified as a group one carcinogen by internation and national organizations, meaning it is a definite cause of cancer in human,"" Doepke said. ""Studies have found links between diesel exhaust and cancers of the lung, bladder, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, as well as blood cancers like lymphomas and leukemias.""

Residents, especially those who live on the south side, expressed concern about air pollution from the generators. Designated as emergency generators, they are only allowed to run them 100 hours a year, about four total days.

The AI ""bubble""

In September, a report found construction spending on data centers was at an all-time high of $40 billion in the U.S.

Molly Kleinman is with the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, which has been researching data centers. She says there’s a concern that most of these data centers are being built to support tech companies’ AI features and what might happen when the “AI bubble” pops.

""We’re hearing more and more experts weigh in that the way these giant data centers are being funded is not sustainable and, at some point, bubble’s pop.”

A response from city council

In October, WANE15 reported language in the contract between the city and DMI FW LLC, which bought the property for Hatchworks LLC, a subsidiary of Google, included a promise the city wouldn’t turn against Google if public opinion does.

While it makes sense from a business standpoint, Bryce Gustafson with Citizens Acton Coalition said it risks public officials losing their power to listen to the public.

“Normal people just don’t have the same level of power in these issues, so if your decision makers are taking away their power, the everyday Hoosier; What kind of power do they have?"" He said.

In 2023, the city council approved the land sale to Hatchworks LLC unanimously. Though, some members of the current council had no hand in that decision.

Activist groups in Fort Wayne have recruited residents to show up at meetings like the IDEM hearing and city council over the past several weeks. They’ve been holding town halls of their own to share information about the center.

At the final city council meeting in November, residents showed up to offer further public comment to the council about the data center and Google’s request for a further 143 diesel generators.

City council has no power to deny the permit. It’s a decision that is in the hands of IDEM and subject to review by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Despite that, fifth district representative Geoff Paddock, who is serving as council president through the end of the year, announced ahead of the public comment he was sending a letter to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management about the request.

""I am asking them to sit down with us, work with us, the city of Fort Wayne, Google, the Mayor’s office, city council members who may be interested, other interested parties to find an alternative,"" Paddock said.

Once again, residents expressed their concerns about air pollution...

""I already have to carry an emergency inhaler around with me, everywhere I go,"" said one young resident who spoke at the meeting. ""I don’t really want to go outside and suffocate in the first two seconds after that data center is complete.”

Following public comment, councilmembers-at-large Chambers and Friestroffer agreed to work with Paddock, IDEM and Google to better understand the energy needs and the risks of the generators.

Sixth district councilwoman Rohli Booker attended a townhall put on by advocacy groups earlier in the month as well as the IDEM hearing. She commended those who spoke for their continued advocacy and how it has helped her advocate in meetings with Google.

“There are things that I heard at that IDEM hearing that I was able to share with them – some of the solutions, some of the concerns, some of the health implications – that if I hadn’t attended, I would not have been able to do,"" Booker said.

Booker took on the role of sixth district representative after the data center was already under way.

Amid public hearings, council meetings and town halls, one voice has been missing from the conversation about the data center – Google.

Mayor Sharon Tucker, who has been a proponent of the build since she was still serving as the city council representative for the 6th district, said she’d like Google to work with the public.

“I do wish our Google partners would do what I’ve done and try to answer those concerns and so that would probably be the one thing that I am disappointed in, that they have not answered those cries of concern,"" she said.

Google hasn’t returned a request for comment.

Following public comment at the council meeting, Chambers said the city is planning a town hall that she hopes Google will attend.

Elsewhere in Indiana, communities are beginning to reject data center builds. Marshall, White and Putnam counties have enacted moratoriums on data centers until they better understand the impacts of them.

The public comment period on the requested extra diesel generators ended November 17, and IDEM has yet to announce a decision on the permit. Due to the requirement to address all comments received, both in writing and verbally, a representative for IDEM says it may take several months for a final permitting decision to be issued.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8d053d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb8%2F7d%2F756294e54ceeb4abb10e43a4af06%2Fdata-center.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 21:00:37.292663

The federal government collects these dollars from energy companies for rent, royalties and lease fees. Then it disperses some of that back to individual states. States later use the funds to pay for day-to-day spending and savings.

New Mexico continues to receive the largest payments, accounting for nearly 70% of state disbursements. It received almost $3 billion in the 2025 fiscal year.

That’s because the state partially sits on top of the oil-rich Permian Basin, according to Kristin Smith, a researcher at the Montana-based nonprofit, Headwater Economics.

“If you took out New Mexico, there'd be a different story in these numbers,” Smith said.

For Wyoming, the next largest recipient of revenue payments, Smith said the story is all about declining coal revenues. The state received $544.87 million this fiscal year. That’s nearly $50,000 less than 2024 and almost $300,000 less than 2023, according to federal data.

Utah also saw drops, though it did gain more revenue from geothermal energy production ($5 million). Montana and Colorado saw upticks, largely due to oil and gas development.

Overall, the state revenue total was down slightly from previous years, which the Trump administration blamed on a drop in commodity prices. A U.S. Department of Interior press release said the administration’s efforts to unleash American energy helped unlock those dollars.

However, Smith said the market often plays a bigger role in revenue totals than federal policy.

“When you think about where are the places that are benefiting the most or the least, or who's experiencing changes, that is often dictated by market and commodity prices,” Smith said.

She added that this revenue source is volatile, and states should rely on it less for day-to-day spending and invest more in long-term savings.

“ There’s always a risk of economic dependance,” Smith said. “You don't wanna be dependent on revenue that just goes poof and isn't there next year.”

Louisiana, North Dakota, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, California and Alaska also received millions in energy revenue payments.

About I founded Science 2.0® in 2006 and since then it has become the world's largest independent science communications site, with over 300,000,000 direct... View Profile","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has signaled it will once again examine formaldehyde under the Toxic Substances Control Act.

It is not a surprise. Formaldehyde is one of the most exhaustively used, and therefore studied and regulated, chemicals. Scientists lament that it keeps being a political football due to misunderstandings of one of the most basic tenets of chemistry; the dose makes the poison. For example, various environmental groups insisted for decades that formaldehyde in vaccines was 'probably' a key cause of autism diagnoses, along with many other things, while scientists tried in vain to note that a single pear has 120X the formaldehyde found in a vaccine, and you're only taking a vaccine once. Yet if you ignore science and only believe epidemiology, formaldehyde is used more than 40 years ago and vaccine diagnoses went up so they insist the chemical must be causing it.

It does not work that way. You simply are not getting enough to harm you unless you fall into a vat of it and drown. It's a chemical intermediate, so it becomes converted into other chemicals in processes that lead to a final product. Just because it is in products does not mean you are ingesting formaldehyde. So little formaldehyde remains in products you have to believe in homeopathy to think you are getting enough to matter. Nearly all of it is instead found in nature so humans would have alarming health issues if it were a problem.

You're not getting enough in vaccines or food or flooring to worry about; unless you think a pinch of salt in 120 Olympic-sized swimming pools is changing your hormones.

CH2O. Not so scary when you ignore the hype and look at the science.

The downside to having it in use is nothing. The upside is that it makes a lot of products affordable in a way alternatives cannot. Formaldehyde is a chemical chemical in a chain of 1,500,000 jobs and $1,600,000,000,000 in manufacturing.

Because of its importance, and its ubiquity, it is important that it be reviewed regularly. Not in a 'scientists need to keep reviewing it until they agree with Sierra Club' way that some administrations have done, but in a thoughtful, rigorous manner. Using science, not just epidemiological correlation in surveys or dead mice.

That is why the EPA taking another look at formaldehyde is a win for public trust in science, especially during the period since 2009 when people are unsure what it science and what is politicization of science. Activists try to claim that an examination of a chemical means it must be risky. It does not. It only means it is popular.

Here are the important things to know:

1. Does it cause cancer? No. EPA has never said it does nor has any science body.

2. Is it harmful in air? No. You are fine even living next to a chemical plant that makes it. And no one lives that close.

3. Is it harmful in water? No. The alcohol in alcoholic beverages is harmful, not the formaldehyde which occurs naturally in alcoholic beverages. Even Korean Soju, which used to be the delight of adventurous Americans because it contained 'embalming fluid', only has as much as the pear mentioned above, and less than wine.

4. Are unprotected workers at risk? Yes, if they don't wear masks. EPA cautions about that because while they know companies mandate protective gear, they do not know that workers will always use it.

5. Are unprotected consumers at risk? Yes. Like most chemicals, there are warnings about eye irritation when this is used at high levels without protective gear.

So why is EPA looking at it again? The last assessment of formaldehyde delighted environmental lawyers but was controversial in the science community. Instead of using rigorous, transparent methods they abdicated the work to their Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program, an administrative group created to help EPA do research and then bizarrely (and illegally, if government were not so bloated it has bigger problems to solve) began to issue its own risk assessments.

The group has never been respected by scientists, they are like that uncle who spouts food coloring conspiracy theories at Christmas dinner, but they are not usually anti-science fifth columnists like they have been for the last few years. The National Academies of Science (NAS) has criticized IRIS for “recurring problems with clarity and transparency of the methods” they use in making their claims while the Government Accountability Office (GAO) doesn't think IRIS has any value at all.

GAO is right. For example, IRIS created a reference dose for acetone that defies scientific comprehension. If IRIS had any authority, human breast milk would be banned because the acetone produced by mothers is twice their reference dose. Government would have to ban orange juice due to methanol.

Back to formaldehyde. IRIS created a safety standard of 0.008 parts per billion (ppb).Human breath is 8 ppb. With each breath humans are exposing themselves to 1000X the IRIS safe level. If IRIS had any standing, human breath would be banned even faster than human breast milk.

Unfortunately, the Biden administration's EPA was in an overt war on science. Not just weedkillers, where they did strange things like go to court against their own scientists to undo science-based regulations and replace them with epidemiology. They also began the process to create a de facto ban on formaldehyde by using IRIS beliefs rather than science.

A spreadsheet created using surveys is not how science should be done but because it was done, EPA now has to go and do the science all over again.

After the artificial intelligence (AI) industry took off, food processors are now in competition with data centers to secure scarce electricity from the grid, and this scarcity is driving up wait times and energy costs. This is the first industry survey to measure how the U.S. F&B and CPG industries are adapting to the unfolding energy crunch. The results convey just how much these industries are facing energy disruption — and the ways they’re finding creative solutions.

“This survey data points to the reality of systemic energy risk,” said Juan Macias, CEO of AlphaStruxure. “The issues food processors are facing – delays, outages, and sudden rate increases — are now increasingly common. For instance, we know of food processors that have already broken ground on new facilities, only to discover they can’t get power to the site by the time their facility opens. That’s why we’re seeing the industry turning toward alternative energy solutions.”

“America’s aging grid and surging demand are creating new risks for energy-intensive industries,” said David Cooper, Director of CPG, North America, at Schneider Electric. “We’re seeing more frequent outages and higher costs, especially in regions like California. Our research shows that nearly half of processors have seen energy costs spike by more than 25% in five years.”

The report also highlights sustainability priorities: fleet and facility electrification and Scope 1 emissions reduction rank highest, even as confidence in achieving these goals varies.",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/adobestock_1513743850.jpeg,N,,2025-12-04 18:04:40.860219

Holtec Government Services will receive $400m to deploy two SMR-300 reactors at the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station site in Covert, Michigan, under the US DOE SMR funding plan.
The remaining $100m of US DOE SMR funding will be awarded later this year to support additional deployments and address key barriers in design, licensing, supply chain, and site readiness.
Holtec President Kelly Trice, who has overseen the Palisades restart programme since its inception, will also guide the Palisades SMR-300 project.
GE Vernova Hitachi has similar ambitions for its BWRX-300 SMR to be the first SMR to start operation in the US.","The US Department of Energy (DOE) has awarded up to $800m in federal cost-shared funding to Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Holtec Government Services to support early deployments of advanced light-water small modular reactors (SMRs). Using US DOE SMR funding, the project teams will advance initial projects in Tennessee and Michigan and help expand US capacity while facilitating additional follow-on projects and associated supply chains.

TVA will receive $400m to advance deployment of a GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 SMR at the Clinch River Nuclear site in Tennessee, as well as accelerate the deployment of additional units with Indiana Michigan Power and Elementl. TVA plans to work with the domestic nuclear supply chain partners Scot Forge, North American Forgemasters, BWX Technologies, and Aecon. Other partners supporting the project include Duke Energy, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, and the Electric Power Research Institute.

Holtec Government Services will receive $400m to deploy two SMR-300 reactors at the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station site in Covert, Michigan, under the US DOE SMR funding plan. The goal is to demonstrate viability for additional orders both domestically and abroad. DOE said Holtec is pursuing an innovative one-stop-shop approach to SMR deployment by fulfilling the roles of technology vendor, supply chain vendor, nuclear plant constructor in partnership with Hyundai Engineering & Construction, plant operator, and electricity merchant selling the power to near-by utilities and end-users.

“President Trump has made clear that America is going to build more energy, not less, and nuclear is central to that mission,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “Advanced light-water SMRs will give our nation the reliable, round-the-clock power we need to fuel the President’s manufacturing boom, support data centres and AI growth, and reinforce a stronger, more secure electric grid. These awards ensure we can deploy these reactors as soon as possible.”

In March, DOE issued a $900m solicitation to de-risk the deployment of Gen III+ SMRs. The remaining $100m of US DOE SMR funding will be awarded later this year to support additional deployments and address key barriers in design, licensing, supply chain, and site readiness.

Holtec said the award will catalyse the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) deployment of Holtec’s dual-unit SMR-300 plant at the company’s Palisades Energy site where a formerly shuttered 805 MWe pressurised water reactor is poised for imminent restart with the support of a DOE loan. “Fittingly, the twin-unit SMR-300 plant has been named PIONEER 1&2, which captures its trailblazing mission to spearhead the rise of the SMR industry in the U.S. and the world.”

The project, which will add 680 MWe in a dual unit (340 MWe per unit) configuration, is envisaged to be built by Holtec with construction financing from the DOE’s Loan Programs Office. “With the financial pathway secured, we look with guarded confidence to implement our Mission 2030, which contemplates the Pioneer reactors being brought online in the first years of the 2030s.”

As part of the programme, DOE will provide milestone-based cost-share support to advance licensing, pre-construction, and supply-chain mobilisation for the Palisades SMR-300 project. Holtec’s proposal includes a multi-site deployment pathway that establishes a repeatable, fleet-scale model intended to drive down costs and shorten construction durations through standardisation and manufacturing efficiency.

Holtec said DOE’s support “is an essential enabler of the Palisades SMR-300 project, moving it from development to deployment by building on the government’s prior support for Holtec’s SMR technology under the 2020 DOE Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) Risk Reduction for Future Demonstrations to support commercial readiness.”

Holtec CEO and Executive Chairman Dr Kris Singh said the future of nuclear energy as a source of reliable baseload electricity to power the economy of the future will be realised only if the industry makes reactors predictably cost competitive. “With a well-exercised and proven supply chain, a world-class (exclusive) alliance partner, Hyundai E&C, and the plant design marinated with four decades of practical corporate experience, we consider it our duty to lead the industry in building, owning, and operating the first SMR-300 plant in the United States.”

The Palisades restart project is due to be synchronised with the grid in early 2026, months ahead of the committed schedule and substantially below the allotted budget. Holtec President Kelly Trice, who has overseen the Palisades restart programme since its inception, will also guide the Palisades SMR-300 project.

GE Vernova Hitachi has similar ambitions for its BWRX-300 SMR to be the first SMR to start operation in the US. Welcoming the award to TVA, the company noted: “With commercial operation of the first BWRX-300 at the utility’s Clinch River Site targeted for the early 2030s, it would become the nation’s first commercial SMR.”

GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik noted: “The BWRX-300 is the only commercial SMR technology being built right now in the Western world, and this grant will accelerate its deployment in the US. We would like to recognise the DOE for its leadership in support of the nuclear industry and for championing public-private partnerships to advance the next generation of nuclear technology and bolster the nation’s energy security.”",https://www.neimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/12/SMR-Palisades_View062525-1200x779-2.webp,N,,2025-12-05 00:58:21.146856

Great British Energy (GBE) has marked a significant moment in the UK’s energy transition with the publication of its first Strategic Plan, setting out how the new publicly owned company intends to turn political ambition into bricks, steel and megawatts over the rest of the decade.

Launched in 2024 and backed by over £8.3 billion in capital alongside its sister company GBE Nuclear, GBE was created to act as a national champion for clean, home-grown energy. Its remit is deliberately broad: accelerate deployment of renewables and storage, strengthen industrial supply chains, and ensure that the economic and social dividends of the transition flow back to UK workers, communities and taxpayers.

From remit to measurable outcomes

The new Plan translates that remit into a clear set of outcomes. By 2030, GBE expects its investments to help deliver at least 15 gigawatts of clean generation and storage – enough to power the equivalent of almost ten million homes – and to mobilise around £15 billion of private capital over time through long term partnerships and co investment. It also promises support for more than 1,000 local and community energy projects and at least 10,000 jobs, with a particular focus on places historically dependent on oil and gas. Returns from the assets GBE owns on the public’s behalf will be ploughed back into new capacity and further opportunities.

Public ownership with purpose

Chief Executive Dan McGrail describes this as “public ownership with purpose” rather than a return to an old style, centralised utility model. GBE will act as a developer and equity investor, not simply a funding agency. By taking carefully judged risks in areas where private capital is hesitant – for example emerging technologies, earlier stage projects or new commercial models – it aims to de risk projects and crowd in private partners, rather than crowd them out.

British resources, British engineering, British ownership

Chair Juergen Maier situates this approach in a wider story about industrial renewal. After decades in which key energy assets have been sold overseas and domestic manufacturing hollowed out, GBE is intended as part of a new settlement: British resources, British engineering and British ownership working together to deliver clean power, secure supply and high-quality employment. That ambition is given concrete expression in the Plan through a dedicated £1 billion “Energy – Engineered in the UK” programme, which will target supply chain bottlenecks, support factories and skills, and align with the government’s Industrial Strategy and Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan.

The scale of the challenge

Underpinning all of this is a stark assessment of the challenge. National Energy System Operator analysis shows that electricity demand will rise sharply as transport, heating, industry and data centres electrify. By 2035 Britain may need tens of gigawatts more capacity than is currently in the pipeline, and key technologies such as offshore wind will have to scale many times over to keep the UK on track for net zero and to avoid continued exposure to fossil fuel price shocks.

Three investment priorities for Great British Energy

GBE’s response is organised around three investment priorities.

GBE Local: making community energy mainstream: The first is GBE Local, a business line dedicated to making local and community energy mainstream. Here GBE will work alongside the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero on a joint Local Power Plan, due in 2026, which will articulate a shared vision for community and municipal renewables, clarify institutional roles, and tackle the policy and finance barriers that have held the sector back. The aim is not only to add clean generation, but to hard wire public participation and benefit into the transition through grants, concessional loans, shared ownership models and blended finance. Evidence cited in the Plan suggests that community ownership improves public acceptance, unlocks additional capital through community share offers and enhances system resilience by spreading generation. GBE Local is already visible on the ground. A £255 million solar scheme is cutting bills in around 250 schools, more than 270 NHS sites and a number of military estates, with lifetime savings expected to run into hundreds of millions of pounds and be reinvested in frontline services. The GBE Community Fund is backing early-stage community energy projects, helping local groups turn ideas into investable proposals. Over time, an open access GBE Local platform will offer an end-to-end route for councils, housing providers, community organisations and others to develop onsite generation, aggregating demand and creating a trusted delivery partner network.

Onshore Energy: unlocking public land: The second priority is Onshore Energy, where GBE will focus on unlocking the potential of public land and investing strategically in generation and storage that can provide flexibility and support grid stability. In practice this is likely to mean onshore wind and solar, batteries and other forms of flexible capacity, developed in partnership with public landowners and private developers. The Plan signals an intention to evolve this into a fully-fledged independent power producer business over time, building in house development capability and expertise across a range of technologies.

Offshore Energy: scaling the next wave of wind: The third pillar is Offshore Energy, particularly floating and deep-water wind in Scottish and Celtic Sea waters. These projects are central to future scenarios that see offshore wind capacity rising several fold by the mid-2030s, yet only a small fraction of the required floating capacity has been deployed to date. GBE will work to de risk this frontier, supporting pre commercial projects and investing in shared infrastructure and supply chains that can anchor long term growth.

Working with markets, not replacing them

Throughout, GBE stresses that it is not a substitute for the wider market. The Plan repeatedly emphasises collaboration: more than 100 organisations contributed to its development through workshops and roundtables in Edinburgh, London, Belfast and Cardiff. The company expects to partner with private developers, institutional investors, local authorities and community groups, offering not just capital but technical expertise, templates and guidance to help structure projects and embed community benefit.

From slogan to strategy

Politically, the Plan allows ministers to demonstrate that GBE is more than a slogan. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband presents the company as a national champion that will help the UK “reap the benefits of Britain’s natural resources” and deliver “an abundance of clean, homegrown energy for British people and thousands of good jobs across the country”. The document anchors that rhetoric in specific metrics, timelines and programmes, while also making clear that GBE operates at arm’s length from government, with independence framed as essential to making credible, evidence-based investment decisions.

Uncertainties, learning and adaptation

There are, of course, open questions. The Plan is candid that GBE is at the start of its journey and that the next few years will focus on building core capabilities, recruiting and developing its workforce, and delivering early commercial successes that prove the model. It also acknowledges that electricity demand growth, technology costs and policy frameworks remain uncertain, requiring the organisation to update its strategy every two years and adapt as markets evolve.

A fairer, faster energy future

Nonetheless, today’s publication is a clear statement of intent. It sketches a future in which the UK’s shift to clean energy is not only faster, but fairer: with communities owning assets in their area, public services cutting bills through onsite generation, and British factories and engineers supplying more of the kit that keeps the lights on. If GBE can deliver on its promise to combine public purpose with commercial discipline, it will become a central institution in that story – and a visible symbol of the UK choosing to lead, rather than follow, in the next energy era.

Report Summary

GBE has today published its first Strategic Plan, setting out how the UK’s new publicly owned energy company will accelerate clean power deployment, crowd in private investment, and expand public and community ownership of energy assets over the rest of this decade. The Plan is GBE’s formal response to the Energy Secretary’s Statement of Strategic Priorities and covers its initial five-year planning horizon, while looking ahead to 2035, 2050 and beyond.

GBE’s mission is framed as “public ownership of energy with purpose”: using public capital and an active developer role to accelerate clean generation and the industries that support it, while ensuring that workers and communities share in the benefits of home grown, secure energy. The company will develop, own and operate clean energy assets, taking equity stakes and recycling returns into further projects rather than distributing profits to shareholders.

From GBE spend between now and 2030, the Plan commits to a portfolio that will deliver at least 15 gigawatts of clean generation and storage capacity, mobilise around £15 billion of private finance over time, support more than 1,000 local and community energy projects, and directly back over 10,000 jobs, including in areas historically reliant on oil and gas. By 2030 GBE expects to have an income generating portfolio and to be on a pathway to whole company profitability in the longer term.

Delivery will be organised around three priority business areas. GBE Local will scale local and community energy, including through a joint Local Power Plan with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero that will clarify roles, address policy and regulatory barriers, and provide grants, concessional loans and blended finance to unlock projects. Onshore Energy will focus on unlocking the energy potential of public land and investing in flexible generation and storage that support grid stability. Offshore Energy will concentrate on deep water floating wind in Scotland and the Celtic Sea, where GBE aims to help close the gap between current deployment and the levels required under future energy scenarios.

Across these priorities, a £1 billion “Energy – Engineered in the UK” programme will support domestic supply chains, manufacturing and skills so that more of the value from the energy transition is retained in the UK. Early activity includes a £255 million solar programme for schools, hospitals and military sites and the GBE Community Fund, which provides grants to community energy schemes.

GBE is headquartered in Aberdeen and operates independently of government within the framework of the Great British Energy Act and the Statement of Strategic Priorities. The Plan positions the organisation as a long-term national institution, working in partnership with industry, investors, local government and communities to deliver an energy system that is “clean, secure, yours”.

“The state of Maine has been on the forefront of these efforts, but additional federal investments are vitally needed,” King said in a news release.

The money could be used to test for and remediate PFAS, as well as help farmers relocate from contaminated land, according to a news release from Pingree’s office.

The bill, known as Relief for Farmers Hit with PFAS Act, was originally cosponsored by the other members of Maine’s delegation, independent U.S. Sen. Angus King and Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden.

Collins said the U.S. Department of Agriculture “must provide support to our nation’s farmers, who through no fault of their own are at risk of losing their livelihoods,” adding that the federal government’s response has failed to keep pace with the problem.

Maine is regarded as a national leader for its work to implement policies that stymie the spread of PFAS, which is a known carcinogen linked to an array of health issues. Many farmers have seen their land, and even their own bodies, contaminated by the substance because of the historic practice of spreading sewage sludge as a fertilizer.

In addition to responding to high levels of PFAS in agricultural land, Maine was the first state to pass a rule requiring manufacturers to report intentionally added PFAS in products. Earlier this year, state lawmakers also worked on proposals to expand testing for contaminants in private wells and rid the state of PFAS-laden firefighting foam, which is another significant source of contamination.

Additionally, Maine lawmakers passed legislation to codify programs that support farms with high levels of PFAS into state law to ensure the assistance for farmers and remediation can continue. In August, Massachusetts lawmakers visited the Pine Tree State to learn more about how they can replicate those efforts back home.

“The state of Maine has been on the forefront of these efforts, but additional federal investments are vitally needed,” King said in a news release.

The federal bill that Collins and Pingree reupped could provide those additional investments. If passed, the money authorized by that legislation could increase capacity for soil and water testing, monitor individuals’ blood levels for PFAS contamination or even upgrade equipment to help farms stay profitable.

That money could also be used to develop education programs that would inform farmers on what to do if their land is contaminated or research the viability of new remediation systems for soil and water on farms.

The federal legislation would also create a USDA task force that would identify ways to bring more resources to farmers through existing programs. It would also provide technical assistance to states so they can coordinate effective responses to contamination.

“For farmers already navigating thin margins, discovering ‘forever chemicals’ on their land can mean lost income, unusable land, and questions about the safety of their crops and livestock,” said Pingree, who is also a longtime farmer. “They deserve federal support that matches the scale of the crisis.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_6868-scaled-e1744833308558-2048x1494.jpeg,N,,2025-12-04 18:03:59.862051

I’m dealing with a little warm weather inside my house.” Diving into her bills, Tate found something surprising.
Increasingly, the costs of meeting those goals are showing up on utility bills around the country.
Across the country, the rising costs of updating aging energy infrastructure are inflating bills.
Electric utilities are making “essential investments” to strengthen the grid, said Drew Maloney, president and CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, an electric utility trade group.","Stephanie Tate couldn’t figure it out. After three years of living in her new Illinois home, her winter energy costs last year suddenly spiked to $400 per month.

She had three different technicians come to look at her HVAC system and furnace, but nothing was wrong with it. She had her home insulation inspected and found no issues. She installed new, energy efficient windows to stop cold air from leaking into the house.

“It still didn’t make a dent,” she said.

In the summer, her bills were even higher, driven by the cost of the electricity needed to run her air conditioner. Tate tried to use her heat and cooling sparingly in hot and cold months.

“In the winter, I keep my heat well below 68 — and it gets cold here, so you just bundle up,” Tate said. “In the summer, my AC is at 75. I’m dealing with a little warm weather inside my house.”

Diving into her bills, Tate found something surprising. Her electricity bill’s delivery fees — the costs customers pay to help maintain electric infrastructure like the poles and wires carrying power to their homes — were often just as high as the cost of the electricity she used.

“That’s ridiculous,” she said. “You’re paying more for everything right now, and the electrical costs — the way they increase so exponentially and so quickly is stunning to me.”

Around the country, customers like Tate are getting sticker shock when they open their monthly utility bills. Since last September, residential electricity rates nationwide increased by 7.4%, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. Tate’s home state of Illinois had the third-highest increase nationwide, with a 20.6% jump year-over-year, behind the District of Columbia and New Jersey.

And electricity rates themselves — a bill’s “supply charges,” — don’t explain the total increase, because they don’t include those electric infrastructure “delivery charges” like Tate found.

Cost increases in Tate’s area are largely about the cost of generating electricity, said a spokesperson for Ameren, the Illinois and Missouri-based utility that Tate uses. The company doesn’t generate power itself in Illinois, and has to buy it from third-party suppliers, which can result in big price fluctuations during high-demand times, like summer.

But, like many other utilities, Ameren is also “investing in strengthening and modernizing the grid,” the spokesperson said. Increasingly, the costs of meeting those goals are showing up on utility bills around the country.

Customers often think of their utility bill as a measure of the energy they use to keep the lights on, and heat and cool their homes. But it’s also a reflection of what their utility is building or upgrading. Across the country, the rising costs of updating aging energy infrastructure are inflating bills.

The nation’s electricity infrastructure is old, and utilities across the country have recently been pouring money into upgrading it; in just five years, US utilities increased their spending by $5 billion on transmission (the massive high-voltage towers carrying electricity from one region to another) and another $16 billion on distribution (the smaller substations, poles and wires).

Electric utilities are making “essential investments” to strengthen the grid, said Drew Maloney, president and CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, an electric utility trade group.

“Our electric grid is America’s most important machine — and we have to make sure it works reliably every day for families, businesses, and local communities,” Maloney said in a statement to CNN.

Part of that investment is driven by new demand growth. Electricity demand in the US used to be pretty flat. Now, demand is exploding primarily from data centers, along with new manufacturing and home and vehicle electrification. Power demand from data centers alone is projected to reach 106 gigawatts in the next decade, according to a report from research firm BloombergNEF.

“Over the last decade or two, we’ve been able to get by with the grid that we have,” said Ryan Hledik, a principal at the research and consulting firm Brattle Group and author of a recent study on electricity prices. “The unfortunate thing is, we’ve been needing to make those investments to basically tread water and keep the grid as reliable as it has been in the past, at a time when the cost of that equipment has been getting more expensive.”

New demand is coming at a pricey time for upgrades. The Covid-19 pandemic thrust global supply chains into chaos and made everything more expensive. As a result, the cost of some electrical equipment like transformers has risen faster than the rate of inflation, Hledik said.

Electrical systems have also taken beatings from flooding, high winds and wildfires, and companies often need to invest more to try to make systems more resilient to future storms.

“The grid is being updated, but it’s definitely still old,” Hledik said. “We’re continuing to confront the reality of more volatile weather conditions. So, it’s not my expectation that the need for this investment is going to be finished” anytime soon.

In some cities around the country, the same is true for the network of gas pipelines that deliver winter heating fuel to millions of homes. There was a customer outcry in Baltimore earlier this year as winter heating costs shot monthly bills above $1,000 for some residents.

Those spikes related to seasonal heating needs were also driven by the cost of replacing (extremely) old equipment. Baltimore Gas and Electric operates the oldest gas system in the country and is replacing hundreds of miles of the most ancient, leakiest iron and steel pipes in the ground, CNN recently reported. One pipe scheduled for replacement this year was first installed during Ulysses S. Grant’s presidency in the 1800s, BGE spokesperson Nick Alexopulos told CNN.

“Our hundreds of miles of century-old gas main is far past the end of its useful life,” Alexopulos said. “We’ve got to upgrade this system.”

BGE crews have already replaced around 600 miles of elderly metal pipes with new, plastic ones and have around 800 miles left to complete, Alexopulos said.

In Illinois, Stephanie Tate got so fed up with her electricity bills that she decided this year to take the plunge and outfit her house with solar panels and a battery storage system, which she expects to be producing power soon.

Tate said she was “stunned” at how expensive her home solar and battery system was, but she expects state and federal tax credits and rebates will cover half of the cost. She plans to pay off the remaining balance in a year and expects the new system will save her thousands of dollars per year on her utility bills.

“I’m extraordinarily excited,” she told CNN. “Every day it’s sunny outside, I’m like, ‘oh gosh, I missed this day with solar. I wish it was up now so that I could reap the benefits.’”

She’s looking forward to having a cooler temperature in her house this summer and also anticipating a more reliable home system that will keep her power on during severe spring storms that can knock electricity out for days.

“Those batteries will run even when Ameren is offline,” Tate said.

She’s hopeful she’ll see her monthly bill reduced to a shell of its former self. However, Tate won’t be completely off the grid; she’ll still have to pay delivery fees to Ameren to remain connected to their system, even as she’s generating and storing her own power. Nevertheless, she remains optimistic.

“I’m just incredibly frustrated with the high bills,” she said. “It doesn’t seem logical that they should be this high, this quick.”

Switching to solar and batteries is “a leap of faith,” she said.

Market Expansion Amazon is present worldwide, which could require Rivian delivery vans to be used outside North America, where the EV maker currently operates.
Recently, the company began hiring for the Mobile Support Service in the country, which will service fleet customers directly at their location.
However, it is unclear whether the company intends to produce electric delivery vans in right-hand drive as well.","Amazon is reportedly preparing to quit its partnership with the US Postal Service by the end of 2026, as it focuses on expanding its own delivery network in both the United States and globally.

The information was reported by The Washington Post — owned by Amazon’s founder Jeff Bezos — on Thursday, which cited three people familiar with the matter.

The USPS had about 7.5% of its revenue last year tied to the retail giant.

The service has faced multibillion-dollar losses over the past decade, with Congress approving a $107 billion financial assistance package to support it in 2022.

The media outlet further noted that these plans could change, as the two companies still aim to reach an agreement.

Approached by The Washington Post, Amazon‘s spokesperson Steve Kelly called the USPS a “long-standing and trusted partner” and added that the retail giant is seeking ways to extend their partnership.

However, if the deal falls through, Amazon will need to further expand its internal delivery network.

This would involve both increasing the number of delivery service partners and adding more vehicles from its partnered brands — such as Rivian.

Delivery Fleet

Amazon has been testing and including several electric delivery vehicles from different brands in its fleet.

The delivery fleet includes electric heavy trucks and delivery vans from Mercedes-Benz.

Just a couple of months ago, the retail giant was seen testing General Motors‘ BrightDrop vans — weeks before the Detroit automaker halted production of these vehicles.

However, most of Amazon‘s delivery fleet consists of Rivian electric delivery vans.

Amazon ordered 100,000 EDVs in 2019, to be delivered by 2030, as part of its early investment in the EV maker, and began deploying them in mid-2022.

As of the latest update in late October, Amazon‘s fleet included more than 35,000 Rivian EDVs — not only in the United States, but also in Canada, where the first units were recently delivered, and in Europe.

Despite the ramp-up being slower than originally expected, the company expects it “to grow quite meaningfully as we look at going into 2o26 and 2027.”

Outlook

When questioned if the 100,000 Amazon units were still on track, founder and CEO RJ Scaringe reaffirmed the target and said that Rivian is already “thinking about what comes beyond that initial 100,000 unit contract.”

Although Amazon has not officially confirmed a contract expansion, it has indirectly extended its collaboration with Rivian by signing a deal with Also, its micro-electric mobility spin-off.

Upon unveiling its first product(s), Also announced that it will provide Amazon with thousands of its new pedal-assist cargo quad vehicles.

These vehicles are large enough to carry over 400 pounds of packages, yet compact enough to operate safely in a bike lane.

Market Expansion

Amazon is present worldwide, which could require Rivian delivery vans to be used outside North America, where the EV maker currently operates.

Although Rivian is not yet selling in Europe (planned for 2027), it already has a presence there, managing repair services for the EVs Amazon has deployed on the continent.

The first commercial vans from the EV maker were first seen in Germany two years ago.

Recently, the company began hiring for the Mobile Support Service in the country, which will service fleet customers directly at their location.

According to RJ Scaringe, Rivian will launch in Europe next year with the R2 SUV — which will also be offered in right-hand drive versions, signaling its entry in the UK.

However, it is unclear whether the company intends to produce electric delivery vans in right-hand drive as well.

Last month, Amazon announced that “over 800 new Mercedes-Benz eSprinter vans will arrive in the UK in the coming months and will be deployed for Amazon deliveries.”

Rivian opened orders for fleet customers (besides Amazon) earlier this year, adding two food-related companies to its client base so far.

Other companies have been spotted testing the vans, though no official announcement has been made yet.",https://eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rivian_CEO__RJ_Scaringe__at_the_Amazon_Custom_Electric_Delivery_Vehicle_Launch_Event_idx7xx-optimized.webp,N,,2025-12-04 17:02:36.411468

And DOE will no longer provide technical assistance related to the national definition.
“It also would reduce energy waste, at a time when energy demand is at an all-time high, and lead to lower utility bills.
With all the rollbacks of energy efficiency standards and clean building guidelines, alongside soaring energy costs, Trump’s Energy Department is creating an actual energy emergency.” The change happened just days after the DOE renamed the National Renewable Energy Laboratory as “the National Laboratory of the Rockies.”","In 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation issued a national definition outlining what constitutes a building as net-zero. The national definition was part of President Biden’s project to reduce U.S. building emissions 65 percent by 2035 and 90 percent by 2050.

On December 3, the DOE rescinded its definition of a zero-emissions building. DOE said in a statement this will lower costs and promote “freedom of choice” for “developers, investors, and building owners.” All of this is part of U.S. DOE secretary Chris Wright’s mandate from President Trump to “unleash [a] Golden Era of American energy dominance.”

DOE added that the definition established in 2024 was not a regulatory standard, and that compliance was voluntary. Now, the definition has been removed from the DOE’s website and informational materials. And DOE will no longer provide technical assistance related to the national definition.

The rescinding was mandated in President Trump’s Executive Order 14154, “Unleashing American Energy.” The EO said that the national definition “does not align with the [Trump] administration’s policies” because it imposes “an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources.”

The document outlining the removal was signed off on November 19 by Audrey Robertson, a DOE employee hired by Trump. Robertson previously worked for oil and gas companies; she has a board seat at Liberty Energy, a fracking services company that DOE secretary Chris Wright previously led.

“The interaction of America’s 130 million buildings with our energy system should not be further complicated by arbitrary and imprecise federal guidance,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation Lou Hrkman in a statement. “The Department will no longer make use of this definition and recommends that state and local government agencies and standard-setting bodies do the same.”

The Sierra Club, an environmentalist group, outlined its opposition to the DOE’s definition removal in a statement. Sierra Club Clean Heat Campaign Deputy Director Amneh Minkara said: “This decision by DOE to rescind the Zero Emissions Building definition is yet another move by the Trump administration that leaves consumers in the dark. This definition did not place any additional burden on builders or owners, but was a clear way to meet consumer demand for pollution-free buildings.”

“Defining what makes a building ‘zero emissions’ gives consumers certainty that when builders or sellers say a building is clean that it actually meets a specific set of criteria,” Minkara continued. “It also would reduce energy waste, at a time when energy demand is at an all-time high, and lead to lower utility bills. With all the rollbacks of energy efficiency standards and clean building guidelines, alongside soaring energy costs, Trump’s Energy Department is creating an actual energy emergency.”

“For four years, the Biden administration ignored federal law and the people who live on the North Slope, especially Kaktovik, to undercut any potential for responsible development on our Coastal Plain.
“This resolution will help restore a balanced program that ensures both responsible energy development and environmental protection.
The 2024 ROD adopted the “most restrictive” alternative, arbitrarily closing 74 percent of the Coastal Plain while making development on remaining acres impossible.
According to BLM’s own analysis, their plan would have dramatically limited (and likely fully eliminated) future production from the Coastal Plain.","WASHINGTON—Earlier today, the U.S. Senate voted to overturn an unlawful and restrictive Record of Decision (ROD) for the Coastal Plain oil and gas program that the Biden administration imposed in December 2024. The Senate moved yesterday to begin debate on S.J. Res. 91, sponsored by Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (both R-Alaska), before voting to pass H.J. Res. 131, from Congressman Nick Begich (also R-Alaska). The Senate moved the House resolution because it can go directly to the President’s desk for signature.

These disapproval resolutions overturn the Biden administration’s unilateral rewrite of the Coastal Plain program. Through its ROD, the Biden administration restricted leasing on more than 74 percent of the Coastal Plain, while layering on additional restrictions and stipulations to prevent any development of the lands theoretically left open for leasing.

“For four years, the Biden administration ignored federal law and the people who live on the North Slope, especially Kaktovik, to undercut any potential for responsible development on our Coastal Plain. They paused everything, illegally canceled every lease, and then rewrote the program to ensure that neither leasing nor development would occur. Their worldview was exactly backwards: easing up on the likes of Iran and Venezuela, while clamping down on Alaska and refusing to accept that we can safely produce from a very, very small fraction of our Coastal Plain,” Senator Murkowski said. “This resolution will help restore a balanced program that ensures both responsible energy development and environmental protection. It upholds the rule of law, bolsters our domestic energy security, and will limit the consequences of sending our dollars abroad for energy we have right here at home. I look forward to the President signing it.”

“The Biden administration’s 2024 ROD to restrict responsible development in the Coastal Plain of ANWR blatantly defied the clear language that the Alaska congressional delegation wrote in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” said Senator Sullivan. “This action—one of 70 executive orders and actions targeting Alaska—also cancelled the voices of the Native people of the region who overwhelmingly support responsible development, because it builds vital infrastructure, supports their communities, and has literally led to their residents living longer. Today, we are on the cusp of righting this wrong, rolling back the lawless lock-up of ANWR, and unleashing good-paying jobs and opportunity for Alaska’s working families. I want to thank a majority of my Senate colleagues today for passing our legislation to support Alaska’s economy, strengthen American energy security, and vindicate the rule of law and the Iñupiat people of the North Slope.”

“For years, the Biden administration ignored the law and imposed restrictive policies that effectively shut down the 1002 Area, despite its immense strategic value to Alaska and to the nation. H.J. Res. 131 reverses the Biden administration’s unlawful and restrictive Record of Decision that effectively shut down the 1002 Area of the Coastal Plain - an area Congress specifically set aside for responsible development more than forty years ago,” said Congressman Begich. “The Alaska Delegation has worked tirelessly to reverse these harmful decisions and restore access to some of the most resource-rich lands in the United States and I am grateful for the efforts. By moving swiftly to pass H.J. Res. 131, we are restoring a lawful program that balances stewardship and allows Alaska to supply the affordable and reliable energy our nation needs. I am proud to see this generational opportunity for Alaska head to the President’s Desk. America is strongest when Alaska is empowered to responsibly develop its resources.”

Background: In 1980, as part of a grand bargain to balance conservation and resource development in Alaska, Congress established the 19.3-million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), an area nearly the size of South Carolina, while explicitly setting aside the 1.56-million-acre Coastal Plain for further study, exploration, and potential energy development.

In 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which established an oil and gas program for the Coastal Plain (also known as the 1002 Area) and required at least two area-wide lease sales over the next 10 years, the first by December 2021 and the second by December 2024. The 1002 Area is estimated to contain a mean of 7.7 billion barrels of oil that would help boost throughput through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which sits at one-quarter of its peak capacity. Congress authorized development of no more than 2,000 surface acres in the 1002 Area—just 0.01 percent of ANWR—to bring those barrels to market.

In December 2024, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) replaced the 2020 ROD with an unlawful plan that immediately removed more than 1.1 million acres of the Coastal Plain from oil and gas leasing. The 2024 ROD adopted the “most restrictive” alternative, arbitrarily closing 74 percent of the Coastal Plain while making development on remaining acres impossible. According to BLM’s own analysis, their plan would have dramatically limited (and likely fully eliminated) future production from the Coastal Plain. This was evidenced soon after when the administration held a lease sale that was designed to fail and predictably resulted in no bids.

The Alaska delegation wrote to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) earlier this year, requesting that the 2024 ROD be deemed a “major rule” for the purposes of the Congressional Review Act. GAO affirmatively made that determination in August 2025, leading the delegation to file identical disapproval resolutions.

The House of Representatives passed H.J. Res. 131 with bipartisan support on November 18, 2025. The measure now heads to the President’s desk.

“My bill restores commonsense by preventing the EPA from punishing states for pollution they didn’t cause – including foreign emissions, cross-state transport, wildfire smoke, and mobile-source emissions outside their control.
Under current law, states can adjust their air quality plans if foreign emissions affect their ability to meet federal air standards.
The FENCES Act clarifies that all foreign emissions, whether natural or man-made, are excluded when determining whether a state meets national air quality standards or when reviewing new facility permits.

The ""Foreign Emissions and Nonattainment Clarification for Economic Stability (FENCES) Act"" will ensure fair and consistent air quality designations by making clear that states will not be penalized for emissions outside U.S. borders. It will also protect producers from unnecessary compliance burdens caused by events beyond their control, such as foreign wildfires or dust storms, while upholding environmental standards under the Clean Air Act.

Read more about this legislation in E&E News, here.

“American companies are being unfairly penalized for pollution originating outside the United States. We’ve seen how even the mention of a nonattainment designation, like when the Biden EPA threatened to redesignate the Permian Basin, can create significant uncertainty for businesses and communities. These designations delay permits and hurt economic growth, while failing to address the very problem they are trying to solve,” said Rep. Pfluger. “My bill restores commonsense by preventing the EPA from punishing states for pollution they didn’t cause – including foreign emissions, cross-state transport, wildfire smoke, and mobile-source emissions outside their control. I’m proud to lead this bill as another major step in modernizing and strengthening America’s broken permitting system.”

Text of the legislation is available here.

Background:

States across the country are being unfairly penalized for pollution that originates beyond U.S. borders, including from natural events like the Canadian wildfires. Under current law, states can adjust their air quality plans if foreign emissions affect their ability to meet federal air standards. However, EPA guidance under the Biden administration limited those adjustments only to human-caused emissions, creating unnecessary hurdles for states and industries already working to comply with the Clean Air Act.

In addition, the administration has deleted reports on rising homeowners insurance from the Federal Insurance Office’s website — making it more difficult for insurance regulators, insurers and consumers to get data.
That has increased insurance costs as insurers become more cautious about underwriting such projects, citing increased risks.
“We’re going backwards because we’re not doing the things at the federal level to tackle climate change and lower insurance costs for consumers,” Thornton said.
Hindered federal climate risk regulation Federal financial regulators have withdrawn policies that required climate risk disclosures from financial firms, including insurers, in response to the administration’s anti-environmental, social and governance stance.","Property insurance rates have spiked since 2021 due to the increasing frequency of climate-related natural disasters, inflation in the cost of building materials and supply chain issues. The typical homeowner saw an average increase of $648 in their annual premium from 2021 to 2024. And those rates are expected to increase by an average of 8% nationwide this year — with homeowners in some states facing much higher increases, such as a projected 27% hike in Louisiana.

An increasing number of American homeowners are linking those increases to climate change. A majority of them (72%) say that natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires exacerbated by climate change are somewhat or very responsible for the rise in homeowner insurance costs, according to a poll by Data For Progress.

There is a bipartisan consensus that prices are rising too fast — nearly 80% of homeowners in Texas, for instance, want to see rates reduced, and one-third of Florida homeowners say that rate increases are the most important issue for them (even ahead of inflation and housing costs) — though Americans are torn on the role of climate change.

Insurance companies are regulated on the state level, and there have been heated debates in states as diverse as Idaho, Minnesota, Louisiana and Colorado about policies and regulations to slow the increase in rates. In Iowa, which was expected to see a 19% increase in home insurance rates this year, nearly 180 researchers and educators signed a statement calling attention to the role of climate change in driving up insurance costs — and calling for better building standards and a faster transition to more renewable energy sources in the state, such as solar and wind.

The federal government plays a role in all this through its funding of programs to share the risk of losses such as the National Flood Insurance Program and disaster relief efforts. It also provides access to climate data used by insurers to foresee potential risks and formulate rates.

The Trump administration’s policies on climate, cutting funding to key programs, reducing access to and limiting the collection of climate data, and slashing the ranks of federal regulators are contributing to an increase in property insurance rates for homeowners, said insurance industry analysts and experts.

“At a time when homeowners are struggling to afford home insurance premiums, the Trump administration has a bunch of policies that are all driving up insurance costs,” said Michael DeLong, the Consumer Federation of America’s research and advocacy associate.

Asked about the Trump administration’s plans to help reduce property insurance rates, a White House spokesperson declined to speak on the record, but provided Capital & Main with a statement from an unnamed official:

“More people are living in Florida than ever before, which naturally causes an increase in rates,” the statement said. “It’s inaccurate and silly to pin this on climate change. The Administration is working to lower costs across all industries for Americans.”

Consumers likely to hear tariff costs

The steep tariffs on materials like lumber, steel and aluminum are raising construction and repair costs, which will likely be passed on to consumers through higher home insurance premiums. First, insurance coverage limits “may no longer provide enough protection as the cost of materials and labor needed to rebuild your home increases,” noted Wawanesa Insurance in a blogpost. “Second, repair costs following claims will be higher, potentially influencing future premium rates.”

The main insurance industry trade group, the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, has been actively lobbying against tariffs because of their impact on home insurance.

Cuts to disaster relief funding, resiliency programs

The administration has cut disaster relief funds at the Department of Housing and Urban Development that are given to local governments and states following natural disasters. The money is used to repair or reconstruct homes and finance housing. Without those resources, communities devastated by such catastrophes won’t be able to rebuild homes and infrastructure in more resilient ways, “and these communities will pay higher insurance premiums as a result,” writes DeLong, the Consumer Federation advocacy associate, and Ethan Weiland, another CFA research associate.

In April the Federal Emergency Management Agency terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program, which provided grants to states and communities to fund projects that reduce the risk of damage from flooding, tornadoes and other natural disasters. Ending the program “means terminating mitigation projects that would have saved lives, lowered the risk of property loss, and reduced homeowner, farm, and business property insurance premiums,” DeLong and Weiland noted.

Reduced access to critical climate data

In May, the administration stopped updating the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration database for weather and climate disasters that cause more than $1 billion in damage. The database has historically been used by insurance and reinsurance companies to assess risks and project future losses. The loss of that data is likely to lead to less accurate pricing, and cause insurers to hike rates in response to unquantified risk.

In addition, the administration has deleted reports on rising homeowners insurance from the Federal Insurance Office’s website — making it more difficult for insurance regulators, insurers and consumers to get data.

One of the reports, which was uploaded by the Consumer Federation of America, on rising homeowners insurance costs from 2018 to 2022, showed how this increase outpaced the rate of inflation and that policy nonrenewal rates were higher in areas with higher-than-expected losses from climate-related disasters.

“We need reliable, long datasets,” said Kieran Bhatia, head of climate and sustainability for North America at the global reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter. “Without them, you basically are kind of putting your finger up to the wind a little bit about what is a realistic [extreme weather] event.”

Bhatia and other climate risk specialists expressed their concerns during a panel discussion during New York Climate Week in September.

“If you want to promote economic growth, the best way to do that is to have good information,” said Alexandra Thornton, senior director of financial regulation at the Center for American Progress. “Capitalism relies on good information to make an efficient economy and insurers are subject to that rule as well. But now no one has this essential climate information.”

Rollback of renewable energy initiatives

The administration’s rollback of renewable energy initiatives — such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s $7 billion Solar for All initiative — has directly impacted the underwriting market for clean energy projects. That has increased insurance costs as insurers become more cautious about underwriting such projects, citing increased risks.

And President Donald Trump’s executive orders to block state and local climate change measures — such as those that seek to limit carbon emissions or require oil and gas companies to pay for climate damage — could escalate future litigation risk for insurers as climate change worsens.

“We’re going backwards because we’re not doing the things at the federal level to tackle climate change and lower insurance costs for consumers,” Thornton said.

Hindered federal climate risk regulation

Federal financial regulators have withdrawn policies that required climate risk disclosures from financial firms, including insurers, in response to the administration’s anti-environmental, social and governance stance.

By reducing federal oversight, the administration is downplaying climate-related financial risks. This leaves property and financial markets more exposed and increases the instability that can be caused by higher costs and limited insurance availability.

Approval of new fossil fuel projects

The administration’s strong push to increase oil and gas production, such as approving six new liquefied natural gas terminals along the Gulf Coast, will likely accelerate the pace of climate change and lead to higher insurance premiums, said Ethan Nuss, senior campaigner with the Rainforest Action Network.

“The Trump administration’s fast-tracking of dirty energy mega-projects — like the Calcasieu Pass 2 LNG (CP2) methane export terminal — increases the risk exposure of both insurers and neighboring communities that will be stuck paying out larger claims and skyrocketing premiums or be forced out of their ‘uninsurable’ homes.”

Already, the economic laws of supply and demand are reacting to the data center boom, pressing prices upward in regions expected to see the largest data center growth.

Why is the data center boom a problem for the power grid?","The push to build artificial intelligence data centers is speeding up, with a new report estimating the tech industry will require 106 gigawatts of electricity by 2035. But the breakneck pace at which Big Tech wants to secure computing power is raising serious concerns over whether power companies and regional grid operators can provide enough electricity for spiking demand.

In a new forecast from BloombergNEF, industry analysts found a 36% increase in the amount of electricity needed for existing and planned data centers, compared with BloombergNEF’s April analysis. The research and analytics company said it added 150 data centers to its tracker, and more than a quarter of them are immense pieces of infrastructure, needing upwards of 500 megawatts of power to run.

As demand for power increases, it’s unclear whether supply can keep up. Generating more electricity requires major investments and time to build the physical infrastructure of power plants, solar arrays and batteries. Already, the economic laws of supply and demand are reacting to the data center boom, pressing prices upward in regions expected to see the largest data center growth.

How much electricity is 100 gigawatts?

A watt is an instantaneous measurement of how much electricity a device or data center needs in order to run, and how much power a power plant or solar panel can provide. As opposed to a quantity of electricity consumed over a certain time, a watt — and its multiples such as megawatts and gigawatts — is how much electricity is produced or consumed in a split second.

One gigawatt is 1,000 megawatts, which is 1,000 kilowatts and a kilowatt is 1,000 watts.

In 2025, data centers account for around 40 gigawatts of power already, so BloombergNEF’s estimates say more than 60 additional gigawatts will be needed in the next 10 years.

The regional power grid serving California has never exceeded a peak demand record of 52 gigawatts set in 2022. If BloombergNEF’s forecast holds true, in 2035, data centers will need roughly double the amount of power as California currently requires to keep the lights on and the air conditioning pumping on its hottest summer night.

The new data centers that clock in at 500 megawatts or more are large enough to consume the electric generating capacity of entire power plants.

Why is the data center boom a problem for the power grid?

BloombergNEF describes the forces creating an “inflection moment for U.S. grids: the desire to accommodate AI-driven load without undermining reliability or driving up power costs.”

Last month, the independent market monitor on America’s largest regional electric grid PJM, which stretches from data center hubs in Virginia to Chicago, warned federal regulators that data centers threaten reliability — increasing the risk of blackouts.

“PJM is currently proposing to allow the interconnection of large new data center loads that it cannot serve reliably and that will require load curtailments (black outs) of the data centers or of other customers at times,” the independent grid watchdog Monitoring Analytics, LLC wrote in a filing to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

Monitoring Analytics asked FERC to stop PJM from approving new data centers unless the grid operator can guarantee new facilities can be “served reliably as defined both by transmission and capacity adequacy.”

BloombergNEF’s forecast shows new data centers coming to the PJM grid by 2030 will exceed the electricity additions from new power plants or renewable energy estimated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

In Texas, BloombergNEF warns that the grid run by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas could be in trouble as soon as 2028.

The grid has reserve power, an extra capacity to generate electricity from batteries or power plants that is kept offline during normal operating conditions, but is used as needed during emergencies. BloombergNEF said the ERCOT reserve margin could “fall into risky territory after 2028, a sign that short-term growth can be absorbed, but longer-term supply will lag.”",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2161850999_Getty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 18:03:56.470124

Governor Lamont said, “At a time when American consumers are already struggling with high costs, this action by the federal administration will hit consumers in the wallet, resulting in cars that are less fuel efficient and more trips to the gas station. Fuel economy standards have been supported on a bipartisan basis for decades because they’re a win-win for the consumer and for our air quality.”

Commissioner Dykes said, “Over the past 15 years, the federal fuel economy standards have saved the average household $630 to $840 each year. In addition to increasing expenses on gas, the roll back will have other harmful impacts, including increased air pollution. Connecticut already faces high levels of air pollution from cars and trucks, which contribute to negative health outcomes for people with respiratory illnesses, particularly those in sensitive groups, such as children and older adults.”

There are more than 2.7 million vehicles registered in Connecticut. Cars and trucks account for almost 70% of smog-forming emissions in Connecticut and almost 35% of its climate pollution. Air quality in Connecticut exceeded the federal health-based standards for ozone (smog) on 23 days in 2024 and 22 days in 2025. Individuals in sensitive groups, including children, older adults, and those with pre-existing health conditions who are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution are at an increased risk of developing respiratory symptoms and may experience shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Children and people with asthma or other lung disease are most at risk of experiencing these symptoms. People experiencing severe symptoms are more likely to miss work or school and seek medical treatment.

In 2024, the NHTSA stated that its improved fuel economy standards would reduce fuel costs by $23 billion with net benefits at about $35 billion for drivers.

As a result, the addition of advanced fission nuclear power can reduce the total number of new generating facilities, transmission interconnections, and land area otherwise required to meet Washington's decarbonization goals.”","(The Center Square) – As Washington state invests in the electrification of its public transportation fleet while preparing for a ban on privately owned new gasoline-powered vehicles in 2035, regional energy stakeholders are addressing the practical issues of having the transmission lines necessary to meet demand.

At the same time, the state Legislature may give nuclear energy a renewed focus as a recent study warns of a regional energy resource gap beginning in 2026.

Western Transmission Expansion Coalition, or WestTEC, is an effort to create a transmission study for the regional energy grid that includes Washington along with states like Oregon, California, Colorado, Montana and Utah.

According to Energy Strategies Principal Keegan Moyer, acting on behalf of WestTEC, the grid for those states will see peak demands to increase by approximately 30% by 2035, with the need for about 20 gigawatts of resources per year. WestTEC's 10-year study calls for over 12,200 miles of either significant upgrades or additions to it, with an estimate price tag of $56 billion.

However, Moyer told the Joint Committee on Energy Supply, Energy Conservation, and Energy Resilience at its Wednesday meeting that “transmission is not easy to build.”

“There’s kind of an underlying issue with all of those factors, which is transmission is sort of a common constraint underlying all of these challenges,” he said. “So this network of lines, wires, equipment that helps to deliver power to our homes and businesses from where it's made is really short on capacity.”

He added that without the additional infrastructure, “our modeling indicates that we've failed to meet those [federal] standards, which could compromise grid reliability.”

According to Moyer, one of every 8 miles of transmission lines called for in their 10-year plan are upgrades to existing right of ways; additionally, one out of every 8 miles of transmission is currently under construction.

The need for expanded transmission infrastructure coincides with increased demand cased in part by “policy-driven electric vehicle adoption” and “anticipated data center interconnection,” according to a recent Pacific Northwest Resource Adequacy study. The study warned of a resource gap starting next year, noting that “preferred resources such as wind, solar and batteries make only small contributions to meeting resource adequacy needs.”

The study also noted that “timely development of all resources is extremely challenging due to permitting and interconnection delays, federal policy headwinds, and cost pressures,” according to a presentation to the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission.

In addition to the state’s electrification of the public and private transportation sector, the 2019 Clean Energy Transformation Act requires utilities to shift away from carbon emitting energy sources in favor of clean energy; the ultimate goal is for utilities to provide carbon-free energy by 2045.

The anticipated grid load growth, loss of reliable carbon emitting energy, and the inadequacy of some alternative energy sources could inspire state lawmakers to turn elsewhere to address those needs. House Bill 2090 pre-filed by Rep. Stephanie Barnard, R-Pasco, and cosponsored by Democrat Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-Seattle, would add advanced nuclear power to the state’s energy strategy. Nuclear energy is considered a “non-emitting” energy source under CETA.

The bill language notes that “advanced nuclear power technologies offer a particularly efficient pathway” to replacing carbon emitting energy sources “because nuclear generation operates at a significantly higher capacity factor than wind or solar resources, thereby producing substantially more clean, firm energy. As a result, the addition of advanced fission nuclear power can reduce the total number of new generating facilities, transmission interconnections, and land area otherwise required to meet Washington's decarbonization goals.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/fwbusiness.com/content/tncms/custom/image/e47550d8-b866-11ed-a481-ffd95f72d957.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-12-04 17:03:10.634211

About ARPA-E The UC Davis project is part of a $25 million investment to develop technologies that recover previously discarded critical minerals from U.S. wastewaters.","A new federally funded research project at the University of California, Davis, endeavors to extract valuable components for magnets, lasers and other modern technologies from an unlikely source: acidic wastewater from mines and industrial processes.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA‑E) awarded UC Davis researchers a $3 million grant to develop a bio‑based process that selectively captures rare earth elements from acidic mine‑influenced and industrial wastewater streams. The project is led by Yi Wang, an assistant professor in the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering.

Rare earth elements are essential for high‑efficiency permanent magnets in electric vehicles, wind turbines and advanced electronics. Yet, conventional extraction and separation methods are chemically intensive and generate significant waste. The UC Davis‑led team aims to transform this by engineering acid‑tolerant microbes to produce metal‑binding proteins that work directly at low pH, enabling low-cost onsite recovery.

“This technology aims to turn a liability into a resource,” said Wang. “By selectively capturing rare earths where acidic wastewater is generated — like acid mine drainage and tailings liquors — we can reduce chemical use and waste while strengthening a resilient domestic supply chain for clean‑energy manufacturing.”

The project aims to use artificial intelligence for protein design, structural characterization and acid‑compatible process development. Engineered biocatalysts, deployed in acid-tolerant microbial hosts, will selectively capture rare earth elements from acidic wastewaters, delivering a simpler, cleaner route from dilute waste streams to valuable materials.

Molecular precision

“Our AI‑guided protein design lets us tune the protein binding loops to remain fast and highly selective even at very low pH,” said Justin Siegel, co‑principal investigator and professor in the Department of Chemistry. “That molecular precision — coupled with acid-tolerant microbes — enables a shorter, greener recovery train with fewer unit operations.”

The UC Davis‑led ARPA‑E project hopes to demonstrate selective, low‑pH recovery and onsite concentration of critical rare earth elements from difficult wastewaters — reducing chemicals and energy, shrinking waste, and tapping large domestic inventories that are currently discarded.

In addition to the core science, the project includes a dedicated tech‑to‑market effort to chart a path from lab discovery to real‑world deployment. “Our job is to make sure this doesn’t stay just a great idea on paper,” said Boon‑Ling Yeo, co‑principal investigator and lead for the tech‑to‑market task at UC Davis. “We’re evaluating costs, markets and potential partners so that recovering rare earths from wastewater is not only technically feasible, but also economically attractive for utilities, mining operators and manufacturers across the United States.”

Besides UC Davis investigators, the project collaborators include Libin Ye from the University of South Florida, and Ning Sun and Chang Dou from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

The Proposal Development Services team within the Office of Research played an instrumental role to help create a successful proposal for the ARPA-E award. The team offers extensive services and resources to assist in the development and submission of extramural funding proposals.

About ARPA-E

The UC Davis project is part of a $25 million investment to develop technologies that recover previously discarded critical minerals from U.S. wastewaters. As part of a critical minerals and materials funding initiative announced by the Department of Energy earlier this year, the Realize Energy-rich Compound Opportunities Valorizing Extraction from Refuse waters (RECOVER) program aims to reduce American dependence on critical mineral imports by establishing new, secure, domestic supply chains.

Under the FY25 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the State Department was required to report on ways to promote internet freedom in Iran. That report was submitted, but it did not fully evaluate new direct-to-cell satellite technology, an emerging tool that could allow smartphones to connect directly to satellites and bypass the Iranian regime’s censorship and government-controlled networks. Internet shutdowns, surveillance, and digital repression are among the regime’s most powerful tools to silence dissent, making it essential for the U.S. to examine every possible option to help Iranians access secure, uncensored communication. The FREEDOM Act ensures the State Department, the FCC, and the Treasury conduct a full feasibility review of these technologies, so Congress has the information needed to stay ahead of authoritarian tactics and support basic freedoms abroad.

Smaller nuclear reactors spark renewed interest in a once-shunned energy source USC already has a head start.","COLUMBIA — State utility executives, legislators and the lead investor in the reboot of South Carolina’s abandoned nuclear reactors will tell the story behind the multibillion-dollar deal during a nuclear-focused conference in Columbia next week.

The state’s second annual nuclear summit will feature a panel conversation with Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton, president of the utility’s governing board Peter McCoy, House Speaker Murrell Smith, R-Sumter, and state Sen. Tom Davis, R-Beaufort.

Separately, attendees will hear from the executives of Brookfield Asset Management, the New York investment firm in negotiations with Santee Cooper for the purchase of two partially built reactors at the V.C. Summer nuclear station in Fairfield County.

The event is something of a celebration of actions taken over the past year and a half, according to Ethel Bunch, the founder of a nuclear advocacy group — the Palmetto Nuclear Coalition — made up of large energy-using companies and nuclear-related firms that is co-hosting the conference alongside the University of South Carolina.

After all, it was during the state’s inaugural nuclear summit in August 2024 that Davis, one of the project’s most vocal cheerleader in the Legislature, publicly broached the idea of a V.C. Summer restart.

“He came out on the stage after the breakout sessions and said, ‘We’re all talking around this opportunity. We need to talk about this opportunity,’” Bunch said.

Those remarks set into motion a chain of events: a scouting trip by a state advisory group to see the condition of the unfinished reactors, Santee Cooper putting them on the market, Gov. Henry McMaster’s calls for a “nuclear renaissance,” legislation supporting the effort, and now a pending deal for the sale.

A nuclear history

Whispers about rebooting V.C. Summer’s expansion had begun a year earlier, Bunch said, as tech giants and major manufacturers looked for sources of low-to-no carbon power. Nuclear became the answer.

South Carolina’s four nuclear power plants already supply 55% of the state’s total electricity and the state is the third-largest producer of nuclear power in the nation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The state also is home to nuclear fuel-maker Westinghouse’s U.S. facility. And the Savannah River Site, which once produced weapons-grade plutonium and tritium for the U.S. nuclear arsenal during the decades-long Cold War, now recycles the radioactive materials for reuse.

SC’s state utility enters negotiations on deal to restart failed nuclear project

Now state leaders want to double-down and make South Carolina a nuclear stronghold.

The V.C. Summer expansion, fraught with fraud and cost overruns, continues to be a black mark on the state that has left power customers footing the bill for the reactors that have never produced a megawatt.

But in the past year, restarting construction has gone from a far-fetched idea to one politicians and industry executives are championing.

At the conference Tuesday, Santee Cooper leadership is expected to talk in depth about the closed-door meetings where the decisions were made.

Executives from Brookfield will then take the stage to talk about their interest in the South Carolina power plant and other national trends. Brookfield now also owns Westinghouse, the company that designed the V.C. Summer reactors, having bought it when the nuclear debacle sent it spiraling into bankruptcy.

What’s next

In October, Brookfield, its subsidiary Westinghouse and Canada-based Cameco inked a partnership deal valued at $80 billion, with the U.S. government. The companies will build 10 reactors identical to those at V.C. Summer.

Under the agreement, the federal government will help secure financing and permits for the reactors. In return, the government could take a 20% share of any profits after Brookfield and Cameco take a $17.5 billion share.

If Westinghouse’s value surpasses $30 billion by 2029, the government could turn those profits into a 20% equity stake in the company.

Final executive punished for VC Summer failure to spend at least 10 months in prison

South Carolina’s reactors would be the first and second on the list, with construction starting by 2030.

“When you’re an engineer, all problems become opportunities,” said Hossein Haj-Hariri, the dean of USC’s engineering and computing school. “V.C. Summer was a major egg on the face of the state. But we have (the reactors.) They’re sitting there. They are partly done.”

The project still has a long way to go, Haj-Hariri acknowledges, but USC also wants to be part of the solution.

The state’s largest university system is offering up its technological expertise.

“The thing that has made nuclear struggle is not the design of the reactor. It’s how do you put it together so that you come in on time and on budget?” Haj-Hariri said.

His suggestions: use modern tools, such as artificial intelligence and sensors, to gather data and learn as you build; make use of new, more advanced building materials; and use drones to manage the construction site.

“We are going to develop construction engineering with a focus on nuclear so that we can help the eventual builder of V.C. Summer,” Haj-Hariri said. “We are not just building two reactors. We are building the infrastructure that helps build future reactors. We come up with processes.”

To ensure the plans will work, USC has the technology to create virtual simulations to test them out before building begins, something the school has been doing for years at its McNair Aerospace Center, alongside Columbia-based Integer Technologies, on contracts for the U.S. Department of Defense.

Other opportunities

In addition to the Trump administration’s push for 10 new, large-scale reactors, Haj-Hariri sees opportunity in another of the president’s executive orders.

That order calls for small-scale, micro reactors at nine U.S. Army bases by 2028: Fort Benning in Georgia, Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Campbell in Kentucky, Fort Drum in New York, Fort Hood in Texas, Fort Wainwright in Alaska, Holston Army Ammunition Plant in Tennessee, Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington, and Redstone Arsenal in Alabama.

Smaller nuclear reactors spark renewed interest in a once-shunned energy source

USC already has a head start. The college has worked on micro reactor projects in the past, Haj-Hariri said.

The Army previously explored them as a way to replace the need for diesel generators used to power battlefield outposts for deployed troops. The school also was developing mini reactors for fueling naval ships until the Trump administration defunded the project in its DOGE-led purge of clean energy grants, Haj-Hariri said.

USC hopes to channel this momentum around nuclear into a new innovation center planned for the south end of campus. The five-story building would house reactor-related research on three floors while renting out the remaining space to industry partners.

And more nuclear in the state could spell more jobs of USC engineering graduates.

Of the 1,700 South Carolina college students who graduated in 2021 with a bachelor’s degree in engineering, only 54% were working in the state a year after graduation, according to data from the state employment agency.

“It’s not because our graduates don’t want to stay here,” he said. “But if there are no jobs, then where do they go? They go to North Carolina, Georgia, somewhere else.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Advanced_Nuclear_Summit_2024-137.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 16:02:46.346178

Developed in partnership with distributed clean energy developer PowerFlex, the project features a Tesla Megapack 2XL battery storage system and over 10,800 modules. It is one of the region’s few distributed projects that will directly serve a major industrial facility, relieving strain on the local grid and surrounding areas.

This project will support Prysmian’s commitment to reduce Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 90% and achieve net zero GHG emissions throughout its value chain by 2035. It will also enable Prysmian to participate in the state’s Illinois Shines program, an initiative to support clean energy development developed by the Illinois Power Agency (IPA). The Illinois Shines program will purchase renewable energy credits (RECs) generated by this solar project.",https://www.smartenergydecisions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ss_solar_on_lawn.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 21:00:17.677280

While upfront vehicle prices drop an estimated $930, Americans will spend up to $185 billion more on fuel over the coming decades.
Trump’s reversal extends beyond fuel economy.
He’s rescinded EV tax credits, blocked California from banning gas vehicle sales after 2035, and signed legislation ending fuel economy penalties for automakers.
One claim from Trump Wednesday didn’t match reality: he said vehicle prices were declining, but September data shows new vehicle prices up 0.8% year-over-year.","President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping changes to America’s fuel economy regulations on Wednesday, slashing efficiency targets that would force drivers to burn 100 billion more gallons of gasoline through 2050 while handing automakers a $35 billion windfall.

Key Takeaways:

Fuel economy requirements drop from 50.4 mpg to 34.5 mpg by 2031, reducing vehicle costs by $930 but increasing lifetime fuel expenses significantly

Automakers save billions—GM gets $8.7 billion, Ford and Stellantis each receive over $5 billion in compliance relief

Credit trading between manufacturers ends in 2028, potentially devastating Tesla and Rivian’s revenue from selling emissions credits

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s proposal reverses course on Biden-era climate initiatives, cutting requirements for model years 2022 through 2031. Instead of Biden’s aggressive 8-10% annual efficiency increases, Trump’s plan calls for modest 0.25-0.5% yearly improvements.

“People want the gasoline car,” Trump declared at the White House, flanked by Ford CEO Jim Farley and Stellantis leadership. Farley characterized the rollback as “a victory for common sense and affordability,” promising investments in cheaper vehicles.

The numbers tell a different story for consumers. While upfront vehicle prices drop an estimated $930, Americans will spend up to $185 billion more on fuel over the coming decades. Carbon dioxide emissions climb 5%, equivalent to adding 7.7 million vehicles to the roads annually by 2035.

Environmental groups attacked the proposal immediately. Kathy Harris from the Natural Resources Defense Council said drivers would pay “hundreds of dollars more at the pump every year” to benefit oil companies. California Governor Gavin Newsom accused Trump of “poisoning the air in our communities.”

The plan eliminates credit trading between automakers in 2028—a system NHTSA now calls a “windfall for EV-exclusive manufacturers.” Tesla and Rivian have generated substantial revenue selling these credits to traditional automakers struggling with compliance. That income stream disappears under Trump’s framework.

GM CEO Mary Barra defended the changes Tuesday, revealing the company faced potential plant closures under California’s previous zero-emission vehicle mandates. Before Congress blocked those state rules in June, manufacturers confronted requirements that 35% of 2026 vehicles be electric.

“We were going to have to start shutting down plants because we weren’t going to be able to build and sell those vehicles,” Barra explained.

Biden’s original 2022 standards would have reduced gasoline consumption by 200 billion gallons through 2050, cutting 659 million metric tons of emissions. The administration projected $35.2 billion in net benefits for drivers through reduced fuel costs.

Trump’s reversal extends beyond fuel economy. He’s rescinded EV tax credits, blocked California from banning gas vehicle sales after 2035, and signed legislation ending fuel economy penalties for automakers. No manufacturer faces fines dating back to 2022 model year vehicles.

Transportation generates the largest share of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Trump’s proposal doesn’t eliminate gasoline vehicles—Biden’s rules never required that—but it removes incentives for automakers to accelerate electric vehicle production.

The proposal now enters a public comment period before final implementation. Trump emphasized consumer choice, though critics argue the real winners are automakers and oil companies, not drivers facing higher pump prices.

One claim from Trump Wednesday didn’t match reality: he said vehicle prices were declining, but September data shows new vehicle prices up 0.8% year-over-year. Kelley Blue Book reported in October that average new car prices crossed $50,000 for the first time, climbing 3.6% annually.

The rule revision reduces past-year requirements retroactively, making compliance dramatically easier for a period still under NHTSA review. This administrative maneuver delivers immediate financial relief to Detroit’s Big Three and other manufacturers.",https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dawn-mcdonald-TIZmsrOw7vc-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 18:03:47.004691

“I think it’s helpful when we have leaders in those important positions that come from the West, when they understand uniquely the challenges we face as it relates to federal land, state land, private land.
While conservation and public land advocates have pushed back against Pearce’s nomination, industry groups have applauded Trump’s pick.
As a former congressman and chair of the Congressional Western Caucus, his record shows he’s been a champion of multiple-uses of public lands.","Conservation groups in Montana and across the West are raising concerns about Steve Pearce, a former New Mexico representative who is President Donald Trump’s newest nominee to lead the Bureau of Land Management.

The nomination has reignited a fight over the management of public lands which was highlighted during negotiations over Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” due to proposed amendments to sell off federal land. The fight also spawned two new bipartisan caucuses in Congress, both co-chaired by Montanans, and predicated on public land access and management.

In Montana and the two Dakotas, the BLM manages more than 8.3 million acres of federal land. Nationwide, the BLM oversees 245 million acres of federal land, along with 700 million acres of subsurface rights for extraction and energy development, putting the position directly in the crosshairs of energy developers and outdoor industry groups.

According to the Center for Western Priorities, Pearce amassed a “lengthy anti-public lands record,” sponsoring bills to shrink national monuments and increase extraction on national forest land.

Many conservation groups are specifically honing in on Pearce’s long record of advocating to sell off federal lands, including sponsoring legislation in Congress to authorize land sales or exchanges with local governments.

In a letter to then-House Speaker John Boehner in 2012, Pearce wrote that of the federal lands located in the West, “most of it we do not even need.”

He proposed using land sales to reduce the deficit, similar to rhetoric heard earlier when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum equated federal lands to the nation’s “balance sheet.”

“We cannot afford to hand the keys to 245 million acres of our public lands over to someone who has spent his career trying to auction them off to the highest bidder,” Aubrey Bertram, staff attorney and federal policy director at Wild Montana, said. “Steve Pearce’s record is crystal clear: he believes public lands should be privatized for billionaires’ benefit, not protected for the people’s.”

But Pearce’s nomination has been greeted with enthusiasm by mining and energy companies that operate on federal land, as well as by many Republican officials, including Montana Sen. Steve Daines.

“I knew Steve in the House days, and Steve is a great pick. And I particularly like the fact that it’s a Westerner,” Daines said in an interview. “I think it’s helpful when we have leaders in those important positions that come from the West, when they understand uniquely the challenges we face as it relates to federal land, state land, private land. And Steve Pearce has lived it and breathed it.”

Daines is a member of the newly formed Senate Stewardship Caucus, which is co-chaired by Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy.

The two Montanans also bucked their party earlier this year by joining Senate Democrats in a resolution that would have prevented the use of public land sales to reduce the deficit.

Representatives for Daines and Sheehy did not respond to questions about Pearce’s nomination.

Sheehy has not publicly stated whether he will support Pearce.

But Montana’s federal delegation has been supportive of increasing coal and energy extraction in the state.

In eastern Montana, Congress recently voted to overturn a Biden-era restriction on resource extraction on federal land, reopening nearly 1.7 million acres to future coal leasing.

All members of the state’s delegation supported the move calling it vital to the state’s economy and the nation’s energy security.

Pearce has roots in the oil and gas industry that stretch beyond his political work.

In the 1980s, Pearce founded an oilfield services company in New Mexico, which he later sold when he won his first election.

Starting in 2003, he represented New Mexico in Congress for seven terms.

He lost races for the U.S. Senate in 2008 and governor in 2018.

While conservation and public land advocates have pushed back against Pearce’s nomination, industry groups have applauded Trump’s pick.

The National Cattleman’s Beef Association said Pearce’s experience makes him “thoroughly qualified to lead the BLM and tackle the issues federal lands ranchers are facing.”

The Western Energy Alliance, comprising oil and gas companies across nine western states, also put out a statement of support for Pearce.

“As a westerner coming from a state that’s nearly 20 percent BLM land, he understands the bureau’s mission. As a former congressman and chair of the Congressional Western Caucus, his record shows he’s been a champion of multiple-uses of public lands. Steve has been a longtime friend who understands the value of energy development among other uses,” the Alliance said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BLM-office-I-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 17:02:23.165545

The policy shift, revealed at a White House event attended by Detroit’s major automakers, significantly reduces the pressure to accelerate electric vehicle (EV) adoption. The announcement represents a major strategic win for Stellantis, whose U.S. sales success depends heavily on popular — and fuel-consuming — trucks, SUVs, and muscle cars.

A Regulatory Reset Favoring Stellantis’ Core Products –

Under the Biden administration, fuel-economy rules were designed to push the national fleet toward an average of more than 50 mpg by 2031, which would have required aggressive electrification across vehicle lineups. Trump’s new proposal drops that requirement to 34.5 mpg — a number more compatible with current consumer behavior.

This shift aligns far better with Stellantis’ internal planning. Brands such as Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep®, and Ram rely heavily on traditional gasoline vehicles with higher performance, towing capability, and size — characteristics that generally work against strict mileage mandates.

Filosa: A “Great Day” for Stellantis Customers –

CEO Antonio Filosa spoke directly to how the revised standards support demand-driven manufacturing rather than forced transitions. Standing alongside Trump, he told the audience:

“It’s a great day for us at Stellantis today, because it’s a day where we see CAFE regulation reconciled with real customers’ demand.”

That statement encapsulates Stellantis’ position: consumers — not federal regulators — should shape the powertrain mix sold in U.S. showrooms.

Ford CEO Jim Farley echoed that sentiment, adding:

“Today is a victory for common sense and affordability. We believe that people should be able to make a choice, as you said, Mr. President, and we will invest more in affordable vehicles.”

While Farley’s quote supports the broader industry consensus, Stellantis was noticeably more enthusiastic about the rollback’s immediate benefits to its U.S. portfolio.

Policy Instability Remains a Concern –

Even as Stellantis celebrates this regulatory shift, industry experts warn that America’s automotive rules continue to swing dramatically from administration to administration. Long-term product planning—typically spanning 8 to 12 years—becomes more complicated, costlier, and riskier when rules change every 4 years.

For the moment, Stellantis enjoys a rare alignment between government policy and its strongest market offerings. Yet the company must still prepare for the possibility of another rapid reversal depending on future election outcomes.

The rollback of fuel-efficiency rules marks a pivotal moment for Stellantis and the Mopar brands it leads. With fewer constraints pushing immediate electrification, the company can continue investing in the vehicles that define its U.S. identity: big trucks, capable SUVs, and performance-driven muscle cars.

Nuclear power is particularly sensitive to the cost of capital due to long construction periods and high upfront costs relative to later operational expenses.
For countries serious about universal energy access and climate commitments, nuclear power deserves a prominent place in the conversation.","Countries across the emerging and developing world face a defining challenge: how to expand energy access, power economic growth, and meet climate targets all at once. Nuclear power was once seen as a cornerstone of clean energy expansion, but as projects in high-income countries ran into major cost overruns and long construction timelines, it slipped off the development agenda.

Our analysis of eight emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) — Brazil, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, the Philippines, Rwanda, and South Africa — shows that integrating nuclear power into clean energy transitions can reduce total system costs by 2-31% compared to renewable-only pathways.

Nuclear as a Complement, Not a Competitor

The modelling reveals an important insight: nuclear and renewables work better together than either does alone. Across all scenarios where nuclear deployment was permitted, nuclear power accounted for 10-30% of generation by 2050 in cost-optimal pathways, while solar and wind continued to dominate the overall generation mix.

This complementarity stems from how different technologies meet different system needs. Solar provides cheap daytime power; wind adds variability and geographic diversity; and nuclear offers firm, dispatchable generation that reduces storage requirements and smooths daily dispatch patterns. We considered other baseload technologies like geothermal and hydropower, and found that nuclear works especially well in areas where these two are not geographically or geologically feasible. Together, they create more resilient systems than any single technology could provide.

When Ambition Scales, Nuclear's Value Grows Even More

The main analysis assumes countries reach at least a “Modern Energy Minimum” of 1,000 kilowatt-hours per person per year by 2050. But what happens when countries pursue genuine energy abundance to power large-scale industrialization?

A case study of Ghana illustrates nuclear’s role when ambitions scale dramatically. Rather than modest growth to the minimum threshold, this scenario models Ghana reaching 3,500 kWh per capita by 2050, which is comparable to India’s projected demand.

To meet this fourfold increase in demand with renewables alone, Ghana would need to build more than 300 gigawatts of generation capacity, 40 GW of storage, and 50 GW of transmission by 2050. The nuclear pathway delivers the same power requirements with a far smaller system: roughly 60 GW of generation, 10 GW of storage, and 30 GW of transmission.

Benefits Beyond the Balance Sheet

Lower electricity costs matter enormously for development, but nuclear energy offers additional advantages that modelling alone cannot fully capture.

Nuclear plants create more numerous, higher-paid, and longer-lasting jobs than other clean energy technologies, with roughly half of coal plant jobs directly transferable to nuclear facilities. For countries like South Africa looking to transition away from coal, this represents a genuine pathway to a just transition that doesn’t abandon workers.

The Path Forward Isn't Without Obstacles

If nuclear power offers such clear benefits, why hasn’t deployment accelerated in EMDEs? The barriers are substantial and varied.

Expert interviews identified three critical challenges: government capacity and effectiveness, public engagement and acceptance, and nuclear project financing.

Nuclear power is particularly sensitive to the cost of capital due to long construction periods and high upfront costs relative to later operational expenses.

Yet recent experience shows these barriers can be overcome. Since 2000, eight countries have started to build or successfully built their first nuclear plants, with the UAE achieving 23% nuclear generation after 16 years. Each selected proven reactor designs, secured international partnerships for financing and expertise, and built government-led programs with sustained political support.

A Role for Catalytic Support

The most effective nuclear deployments will require support beyond what market forces or national governments can provide alone. This is where international cooperation and strategic philanthropy can play catalytic roles.

The need is urgent. While nuclear energy accounts for 20% of global clean electricity generation, it receives less than 0.2% of climate philanthropy, which is a striking imbalance given nuclear’s proven role in decarbonization.

Time to Act

The modelling makes clear that the cost savings from nuclear energy emerge primarily in the final phase of decarbonization (after 2040 in most modelled countries). But construction timelines mean that planning and building must begin decades earlier, well before market signals alone would trigger investment.

Countries don’t need to choose between economic growth and climate action, or between energy access and environmental protection. With the right technology mix, supportive policies, and strategic investment, emerging economies can achieve energy abundance while building cleaner, more resilient power systems.

The window for action is now. Every year of delay makes the final phase of decarbonization more expensive and more difficult. For countries serious about universal energy access and climate commitments, nuclear power deserves a prominent place in the conversation.

The United States added 2 GW of utility-scale solar to the grid in September, bringing total solar installed this year to 21 GW — slightly above the 20 GW installed over the same period last year, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s latest monthly infrastructure update.

Solar accounted for 75% of the 28 GW of new generation installed in 2025 so far, followed by wind at 13% and gas at 11%.

Natural gas is still the largest single generation resource in the U.S. electric power system, comprising 42% of total installed generating capacity. Wind, solar and hydro together make up 31% of the capacity mix.

Dive Insight:

The results of FERC’s latest infrastructure report show that solar continues to dominate new generation coming online as the country experiences rising demand for the first time in about two decades. The report does not include energy storage or rooftop solar.

Enverus Intelligence Research recently released its long-term U.S. power capacity expansion outlook, which projected a 57% increase in installed capacity by 2050 driven largely by solar and nuclear.

EIR analysts said they expect solar additions to peak in 2028, “but remain competitive, supported by ongoing demand for power purchase agreements (PPAs) and low costs.”

“Our analysis shows the U.S. grid is entering a transformative period, with solar installations surging in the near term and nuclear power taking a leading role in the decades ahead,” Juan Arteaga, principal analyst at EIR, said in a statement.

EIR’s relatively positive outlook for solar comes despite attacks on renewable energy by the Trump administration, whose officials have derided solar and wind as unreliable and expensive. In July, President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act sunsetting renewable energy tax credits early, and his administration has also sought to revoke permits for some renewable energy projects and subject others to additional scrutiny that has slowed deployment.

But the administration’s preferred alternatives — nuclear, gas and coal — face myriad obstacles to replacing solar as the dominant new generation source.

Ted Yackulic worked for the EPA for more than 35 years and focused on ensuring polluters paid for environmental cleanup. He would help write orders and negotiate agreements to clean up some of the Northwest’s most polluted places.

This summer, he and more than 150 of his colleagues across the U.S. signed a letter advocating for the agency to continue its mission and condemning EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s efforts to dismantle human health and environmental protections and slash the agency’s scientific research and environmental justice programs.

Yackulic and 145 other EPA employees who signed the letter were reportedly placed on administrative leave in July. Nine probationary employees were fired on the spot, and another nine were fired after receiving notices of proposed removal, including Yackulic, according to the American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, the EPA’s largest union.

On Wednesday, Yackulic and five other former employees filed legal challenges to their firings with the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board. They argue their firings are illegal retaliation for perceived political affiliation.

These are people who exercised their First Amendment right by raising an issue of public concern outside of their official capacities, said Joanna Citron Day, one of the attorneys representing the fired EPA employees and general counsel for Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility.

When asked for comment about Yackulic’s challenge, an EPA spokesperson wrote Wednesday evening, “As a matter of longstanding practice, EPA does not comment on current or pending litigation.”

The former employees also argue their firings were arbitrarily harsh and inconsistent punishment for their actions compared to other signatories of the letter and that they were fired without cause.

Yackulic said he witnessed the ebb and flow of presidential administrations’ contrasting priorities. He said he’d always been able to work within those boundaries and keep the pace of what he’s working on.

Yackulic said that at the time of signing the letter, the administrator had announced intentions to change the direction of the agency.

The EPA has fundamentally changed this year by rolling back cornerstone environmental policies that protect clean water and air.

It has also proposed to remove federal protections for millions of acres of wetlands and streams. It plans to stop acknowledging that greenhouse gas emissions endanger human health. And the administration continues to undo limits on toxic chemicals in drinking water, fossil fuel emissions, among other human health protections.

Earth saw its warmest year on record in 2024. Climate change is fueling drought, record deadly heat, more wildfire and longer fire seasons in the Pacific Northwest.

Rising ocean temperatures fueled by human-caused climate change have intensified hurricanes in the Atlantic, low-oxygen conditions off the Pacific Northwest coast are becoming more frequent and ocean acidification threatens the food web, fisheries and the people who depend on them.

A long career

Yackulic was born in Colville, Stevens County, grew up in Bellevue and never strayed far from the Northwest.

Scrambling along Index Town Wall and hiking across the Enchantments, a young Yackulic developed a reverence for the wild, and an appreciation for a green world.

He attended Seattle University and law school in California and met his wife Corrie while studying for the bar exam at the University of Washington. He hoped to leave the world he had experienced as a child in at least as good of shape as it was for generations to come.

After law school, Yackulic began to see glaciers recede and other signs of a changing climate.

On his first day at the EPA in 1989, he was assigned to work on the Bunker Hill Mining and Metallurgical Complex Superfund Site. After decades of smelter emissions and dumping mine waste into rivers and streams, the area in Idaho’s panhandle was one of the largest and most complex cleanups in the nation.

Many children in the community at the time had high blood lead levels, an epidemic.

Over time, the result of work by the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, state of Idaho, local public health officials, Yackulic and his colleagues at the EPA to address the heavy metal contamination was tangible.

Diagrams showed steep declines in blood lead levels in tandem with cleanup efforts: when the smelter stopped emitting, when contaminated soil was removed from residents’ yards and the site itself. Fish and wildlife began to recover.

Over the decades, he worked with King County and the city of Seattle to ensure their sewage management was compliant with the Clean Water Act, worked alongside tribal nations to recognize their authority to implement federal environmental laws within their lands, and advanced Superfund cleanups through orders and negotiating settlements.

Simply put, his role over the years was to ensure the fundamental principle of the nation’s Superfund law: The polluter pays for the cleanup.

Now 68, Yackulic hadn’t tied his retirement to a specific age, or an amount hitting his savings, but rather to seeing some of his cases through.

In particular, he wanted to see a consent decree entered on the lower Duwamish and then, he said, stick around for maybe a few more construction seasons to see how the work progresses.

Last year, he drafted an order so Boeing, the city of Seattle and King County could begin in-water cleanup on the lower Duwamish before a court-approved settlement was reached. He and his colleague Nick Vidargas didn’t want to see the pace of the cleanup slowed down.

Yackulic had begun mentoring another attorney who would take over the Quendall site along Lake Washington.

It was another site he had hoped to see through, but both he and the probationary attorney he was working with were fired for signing the letter.

“Stand up for science”

EPA Administrator Zeldin promised weeks into his tenure to drive “a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.”

The Trump administration in February began firing probationary employees across the federal government.

Zeldin would order the closure of the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights and cut millions of dollars destined for communities bearing the brunt of the impacts polluting industries and climate change.

Yackulic would open his federal inbox and find regular newsblasts from Zeldin, a newsletter dubbed “Call it a Comeback.”

In March, the newsletter announced “the greatest day of deregulation in American history,” including reconsidering the Endangerment Finding, which provided a legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, and plans to limit the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act.

An early June newsblast highlighted proposals to protect “Beautiful, Clean Coal.”

Others celebrated efforts to slash EPA jobs and block policies to encourage the use of electric vehicles.

Yackulic continued with his work.

When he became aware of the EPA employees’ public letter, organized by the “Stand Up for Science” activists, he saw many of his colleagues had already signed on. It was an opportunity to ask the agency to reaffirm its commitment to its mandate, so he signed.

On July 3 he was asked to leave. He spent a few hours collecting the decades of work at his desk and left the office.

“It was heartbreaking. I was shocked,” he said. “I worked with incredible people, and we did good work.”

Concerns foreshadowed in the letter were becoming a reality, Yackulic said.

Just before Labor Day, he would receive a notice of proposed removal on a charge of “Conduct Unbecoming a Federal Employee,” because he had admitted to signing the “Declaration of Dissent.”

In response, Yackulic wrote that signing the letter “is protected First Amendment speech under applicable caselaw,” but was fired Oct. 4.

Decisions about the firings can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12032025_tzr_tzr_163248.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-12-04 16:02:23.431471

They also expressed frustration and distrust with DTE Energy. The utility is asking the state for expedited approval of the company’s contracts with Oracle Corp. for a data center planned in Saline Township, near Ann Arbor.

The facility would require 1.4 gigawatts of power from the electricity provider. The data center is part of Stargate, OpenAI’s $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure around the United States.

DTE Electric has asked the Michigan Public Service Commission to fast-track approval for its plan with Oracle to power the data center. That would bypass a process called a “contested case” that requires the commission to consider evidence and testimony from a variety of sources. Michigan’s Attorney General expressed alarm about the process, calling the hearing “performative listening” in a rebuke last month.

Protest

A small group of protesters gathered Wednesday afternoon across the street from DTE Energy’s Detroit headquarters. They were unhappy that DTE has tried to push plans for the data center through without public hearing.

Sarah Brabbs is from York Township, next to Saline. While she is not totally opposed to a data center, she said she’s not a fan of DTE trying to push the project through without allowing the public in on the process.

“Putting rate payers in a situation that you know we will be paying for, probably on multiple levels, is disingenuous, dysfunctional, and unacceptable,” Brabbs said.

Others at the protest said they’re concerned about the potential environmental impact, like how much water the facility could use and the amount of energy it would need to function.

“The access to the Great Lakes, they’re definitely taking advantage of whatever God-given resource in order to just implement whatever quantum, whatever new level of science and technology that they haven’t got consent from the people on if they even want it in the first place,” said Elijah Williams.

A virtual hearing Wednesday evening drew almost 90 participants. About 45 people spoke over the two and a half hours, with more in queue when the meeting ended at 9 p.m.

Appealing to Michigan’s workforce

A few speakers voiced support for the project. Most of the supporters represented trade unions or business associations who supported the project for creating jobs.

Randall Whitaker is the president of the Washtenaw County Skilled Building Trades Council. He said the project was an investment in Michigan’s workforce.

“A project like this is huge for workers,” he said.

Constructing the data center would create about 2,500 union jobs, according to DTE’s application. Other supporters argued that the facility would generate millions in tax revenue and attract talent to Michigan.

Burdening the electric grid?

DTE has said it expects the facility to increase its current peak electrical load by about 25%, but building out the capacity to accommodate that demand would not affect current ratepayers. DTE argues in its application that the data center won’t impact existing customers’ rates because of safeguards they’ve placed in the contracts with Oracle.

“The project strengthens Michigan’s long-term competitiveness in the fast-growing AI and advanced computing sectors, helping ensure our state remains a destination for innovation and talent,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement supporting the project.

But most participants opposed DTE’s request, citing the same concerns as the protesters – future electricity costs, how much water the facility would use, and whether the data center would actually benefit the local community.

A lack of transparency

Nichole Biber is a member of the Little Traverse Band of Odawa Indians, one of the 12 federally recognized tribes in Michigan. She said she doesn’t trust DTE or Oracle to do what’s best for residents.

“These ‘meaningful guardrails,’ from what I’ve heard so far, are all on the assurances of DTE and the multibillion dollar corporations that are pushing AI and data centers on us,” she said. “That does not reassure me.”

DTE’s application, which includes the contracts with Oracle, is partially redacted.

Maggie Kaercher, who runs a small fish farm in Dexter and also attended the hearing, said she wants the commission to deny DTE’s request and have the application available for a more thorough review.

“You can’t pretend that there’s transparency when there is so much redacted out of the papers that we’ve been able to see,” she said.

“What we are asking, and what many other people are asking for as well, is that the Commission give DTE’s proposal the proper scrutiny and ensure transparency,” said Katie Duckworth, an attorney with the Environmental Law and Policy Center. “Because this is the largest data center to be proposed in Michigan, and it’s one of the largest in the nation.”

Renewable energy or more fossil fuels?

Duckworth said the organization is concerned with how the data center’s power load will impact DTE’s ability to comply with Michigan’s climate change plans.

“It would also significantly increase the company’s renewable energy obligation under Michigan’s clean energy laws,” she said.

DTE is prepared for that challenge, the company said.

“Bringing on a data center of this size means more renewables, and more battery storage,” DTE said in a statement. The company also said the data center’s operators will finance the energy generation and storage needed to run the facility.

Duckworth said that solution would be “transformational” for DTE’s grid – if it happens.

“It raises a lot of questions including as to how those batteries would be charged and whether they will be charged by renewable energy, or whether it would involve prolonging the life of polluting fossil fuel plants or even building additional fossil fuel plants in the future,” she said.

Oracle expects the facility to open in December 2026. It won’t reach its maximum capacity of 1.4 gigawatts until December 2027, according to DTE’s application to the commission.

In October, DTE asked the commission to issue a decision by Friday, December 5. The commission is meeting at 1 p.m. that day.

At the virtual hearing, commissioners encouraged members of the public to attend a hearing on December 18 about the facility’s wetland impact permit, hosted by the state Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks.

The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The administration and automakers say the rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year, down from a projected 50.4 miles per gallon in 2031 under the Biden-era rule.

The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles, and it sparked criticism from environmental groups. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

“From day one I’ve been taking action to make buying a car more affordable.” Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from two of the largest U.S. automakers.

The rule reverses a Biden-era policy that “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,” Trump said.

Automakers applaud and environmentalists decry rule change

The action is expected to save consumers about $1,000 off the price of a new car, Trump said. New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October, according to Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers applauded the planned changes, which came amid industry complaints that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense.”

“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” he said.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the mileage standards “with real world market conditions.”

Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

Environmentalists decried the rollback.

“In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.

“Gutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,” said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All program. “This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly.”

‘People want the gasoline car’

Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.

Trump called Democrats’ efforts to promote EVs “insane,” adding, “People want the gasoline car.”

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety administration was empowered to update the requirements.

The new rules “are going to allow the automakers to make vehicles that Americans want to purchase, not vehicles that Joe Biden and (former Transportation Secretary Pete) Buttigieg want to build,” Duffy said Wednesday.

Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today. The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of gasoline from being burned by 2050, according to the traffic safety administration’s 2024 calculations. Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tons a year of deadly soot particles and 4,870 additional tons a year of smog components such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds going into the air in coming years.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.

“Weakening fuel economy standards won’t do much to make cars more affordable but is certain to make Americans buy a lot more gasoline,” said Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association.

The action also harms domestic manufacturers that have invested heavily in EV technologies and hired thousands of employees to build them, Gore said.

GM CEO skips White House event

Notably absent Wednesday was General Motors CEO Mary Barra, who was attending a previously scheduled event in New York City, a company spokesperson said. A GM plant manager represented the automaker at the White House instead.

Like Ford and Stellantis, GM has poured billions of dollars into electrification of its fleet. In a statement, the company said it “supports the goals” of the proposed rule. “We remain committed to offering the best and broadest portfolio of electric and gas-powered vehicles on the market,” GM said.

,Louisiana American Energy ,2025-12-04 19:07:37+00:00,www.ajot.com,"Washington – Caracas: Crude words, heavy barrels—Rystad Energy oil market note",Not Available,,,,,https://www.ajot.com/news/washington-caracas-crude-words-heavy-barrels-rystad-energy-oil-market-note,"Dubai crude oil price premiums to ICE Brent will likely increase if Venezuelan supply is lost even in part.
This will drive global heavy crude oil discounts to lighter grades to narrow until Venezuelan supply is re-established.
In 2024, Venezuela produced 975,000 bpd of crude oil, of which 657,000 bpd was heavy.
Venezuela’s production was approximately 1% of global supply but 4.5% of global heavy crude oil supply in 2024.
US Gulf Coast refineries are configured to process heavy crude oil for up to 30% of their slate, with some in the region capable of running in excess of 75% heavy oil.","Benchmark crude oil prices could be impacted significantly by escalating military tensions between the US and Venezuela, with the Trump administration tightening pressure on Nicolas Maduros’ regime and signaling the possibility of a US incursion.

Venezuela currently produces 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, placing this volume at risk depending on the scale of military activity. Although the volume is small in terms of global trade flows, the quality is unique as over 67% of the output is heavy.

Signals

US military activity is ramping up near Venezuela with reports that the Trinidad and Tobago government supported the installation of a radar station at the Tobago airport for US use.

Venezuela supplies 1.1 million bpd of crude oil, mainly to China. This supply could be reduced or completely shut-in if an incursion occurs.

Dubai crude oil price premiums to ICE Brent will likely increase if Venezuelan supply is lost even in part. This will drive global heavy crude oil discounts to lighter grades to narrow until Venezuelan supply is re-established.

Venezuela claims to have the largest proven reserves in the world, around 300 billion barrels as of 2024, concentrated in the Orinoco belt with most being heavy oil. Rystad Energy estimate point towards 4 billion barrels of proven and 23 billion barrels of discovered reserves. In any case, large reserves prompted significant investment historically from a number of countries: China, Russia, Iran, and the US to name a few. Ultimately, irrespective of significant reserves, technical problems and underinvestment have resulted in steady declines in production since the early 2010s. At its peak, Venezuela was responsible for nearly 3 million bpd, but declines set in following a governmental change and nationalization of assets. A trough was hit in 2020 when the total averaged 624,000 bpd. In addition to the output drop, most of Venezuela’s refining capacity is not operational as facilities have fallen into disrepair. While many domestic refining facilities have stopped operating, the PDVSA (The Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A) does own and operate several locations internationally. CITGO, a majority-owned subsidiary of PDVSA, operates three refineries in the US (Lake Charles, Louisiana; Corpus Christi, Texas; and Lemont, Illinois) and is a subsidiary for a number of refineries in the Caribbean and Europe.

In 2024, Venezuela produced 975,000 bpd of crude oil, of which 657,000 bpd was heavy. Light and medium crude oil production averaged 116,000 and 201,000 bpd, respectively. Venezuela’s production was approximately 1% of global supply but 4.5% of global heavy crude oil supply in 2024. This year is expected to be a peak year, topping out at 1.11 million bpd. Production is expected to decline slowly to 901,000 bpd by the end of 2030.

Of this, the vast majority has historically been exported to either the US, China, Spain, or India. Pre-2020, the split of crude oil exports was relatively even between these four countries. As of 2025, however, US sanctions have forced exports to be diverted to China, which in 3Q25 was the destination for 81% of Venezuelan exports. Significant movements away from the US have been prompted in Venezuela by US sanctions which were enacted in 2019 on PDVSA that banned all imports of Venezuelan crude oil. More recently, 25% tariffs on all goods imported to the US from countries which directly or indirectly import Venezuela crude oil have further crippled flows to the US.

US Gulf Coast refineries are configured to process heavy crude oil for up to 30% of their slate, with some in the region capable of running in excess of 75% heavy oil. The sanctions on Venezuela crimped heavy oil supply for the US. China is also dependent on heavy crude supplies to maximize secondary conversion unit utilization. The Venezuelan grades are an ideal fit for these refineries, and the loss of supply would tighten the heavy crude oil balance. While the US no longer runs significant volume of Venezuelan oil, the overall tightening of the global heavy market would strengthen the prices for grades that the US does depend upon, namely the Canadian heavy crude oils that ship to the Pacific markets via the Trans Mountain Pipeline and to US markets through various other pipeline systems.

Dubai is a benchmark grade for the Pacific Basin crude market. It has been trading at a premium to Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) Brent, first with OPEC+ cutting production in 2024, then with deeper sanctions on Russian crude oil making illegal barrels more difficult to source. A temporary loss to Venezuelan production is expected to drive up the price of Dubai against ICE Brent as Asia scrambles to replace the barrels.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Rystad_chart_5jpeg.jpeg,N,,2025-12-04 17:03:27.901259

Van Epps beat out Democrat Aftyn Behn by about 9 points in a district Donald Trump and Republican senator Marsha Blackburn each won in 2024 by 22 points. Yesterday’s vote shows a 13-point shift toward the Democrats in about a year.

Aaron Pellish and Meredith Lee Hill of Politico reported the comment of a House Republican after officials called the election: “Tonight is a sign that 2026 is going to be a b*tch of an election cycle. Republicans can survive if we play team and the Trump administration officials play smart. Neither is certain.”

As G. Elliott Morris of Strength in Numbers noted, “[t]he fact that a rural Tennessee district ended up just a high-single-digits win for Republicans should be a five-alarm fire for the party ahead of the 2026 midterms.” Morris explains that congressional special elections have swung 17 points on average toward the Democrats, while special elections for seats in state legislatures have swung toward the Democrats by about 11 points. Morris combines these results with turnout differences in special, midterm, and presidential elections, to estimate that—as of right now—the 2026 midterms can be expected to see a swing of 7 to 8 points toward the Democrats. These numbers would give Democrats control of the House of Representatives and put the Senate into play as well.

It is safe to assume, Morris says, “that something big has shifted in the national environment.” He adds that the Republican Party “will likely find itself defending an unusually wide array of seats next year, even in districts previously thought to be immune to national swings.”

Democrats and many Republicans think that shift has come about in large part over the issue of affordability, the rising costs of food, housing, energy, gasoline, and healthcare that are squeezing most Americans. Trump insisted yesterday that “affordability” doesn’t mean anything to anybody,” but most Americans would disagree. According to Morris of Strength in Numbers, the word “affordability” appears to mean not just the pressure of higher prices, but also frustration at economic stagnation, the unfair way in which the economic system operates, the idea of being stuck and unable to rise, the current illusiveness of the American dream.

After the voters rejected Republican candidates in the early November elections, Republicans vowed they would address affordability issues. Trump initially moved in that direction but now is rejecting the idea that his economic policies have caused hardship, although news dropped today from Automatic Data Processing (ADP), a private human resources management company, that the U.S. lost about 32,000 jobs last month. The losses were primarily in small businesses, which are often considered a bellwether for the rest of the economy.

The secretary of commerce, billionaire Howard Lutnick, admitted to CNBC that Trump’s policies have caused disruption, but promised they would start to build the economy in 2026. “Remember,” he said, “as you deport people, that’s going to suppress private job numbers of small businesses. But they’ll rebalance and they’ll regrow. So I think this is just a near-term event and you’ll see as the numbers come through over the next couple of months, you’ll see that all pass, and next year the numbers are going to be fantastic.”

On the table more immediately are the rising costs of health insurance premiums. The Republicans’ budget reconciliation bill of July extended tax cuts for the wealthy and for corporations but neglected to extend the premium tax credits that supported the purchase of healthcare insurance on the Affordable Care Act insurance markets. The loss of those credits will throw at least two million people off healthcare insurance while driving up healthcare costs for millions more. This will undermine the Affordable Care Act, a goal many Republicans have held since the measure became law about fifteen years ago. But in September, close to 80% of Americans wanted the credits extended; as the issue became politicized, some Republicans withdrew their support so the number dropped to about 75%.

In October, Senate Democrats refused to agree to vote in favor of a continuing resolution to fund the government unless the Republicans extended that premium tax credit, but after weeks of party members calling attention to the issue, seven Democrats and one Independent voted in November to end the shutdown in exchange for a Senate vote on a measure to extend the tax credits.

That bill is now coming due, trapping Republicans between their ideology, which calls for slashing all government programs, and voters, who overwhelmingly want the credits extended.

Trump said he was going to produce a healthcare plan that would extend the premium tax credit for two years, along with new restrictions on who could use the credits, by last Monday but postponed the announcement after Republican lawmakers demanded the extension include a nationwide abortion ban. The White House has not indicated when a new plan might appear. On Air Force One, Trump told reporters he doesn’t actually want to extend the tax credits. “I’d rather not extend them at all,” he said. “It may be, some kind of an extension may be necessary to get something else done, because the Unaffordable Care Act has been a disaster.”

Kaia Hubbard of CBS News notes that any plan Senate Democrats come up with will need the support of 13 Republicans to pass the 60-vote Senate filibuster threshold. So far, though, Republican senators seem inclined not to extend the credits as they currently exist, but to try to force through a partisan measure that Democrats will not support. Republican senators are proposing different options, but say there is no point in figuring out their own position until Trump tells them what he is willing to sign.

In the House, Republicans in safe districts don’t want to extend the credits, saying that an end to support for the system will make it easier to kill the law they insist is a disaster. According to Alice Miranda Ollstein and Robert King of Politico, some Republican strategists think that voters won’t care about healthcare costs by the time of the midterm elections, especially if Republican policies bring down the costs of housing, energy, food, and gas. They think voters will be angrier at support for the Affordable Care Act than at higher healthcare costs.

Vulnerable Republicans disagree. They are calling for a temporary extension of the credits to help lower costs again before the midterms.

Meanwhile, House Democrats have announced they have 214 signatures on a discharge petition to force a vote on extending the tax credits and invited Republicans to join them to bring the measure to the floor. Today, Democratic caucus chair Pete Aguilar (D-CA) told reporters: “Republicans have said that they want an extension, that they support the Affordable Care Act tax credits. We’re giving them an opportunity to do that. That’s what this discharge petition is about. As Leader [Hakeem] Jeffries has said for months, Democrats will go anywhere and have any discussion with our Republican colleagues about addressing the Affordable Care Act tax credits or the affordability crisis. If Republicans want to have a conversation about solutions, we’re all ears.”

The declining fortunes of MAGA Republicans are widening the rifts in the party. Annie Karni of the New York Times reported today on House Republicans’ anger at Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), who has defended the priorities of President Donald J. Trump at the expense of the interests of Republican lawmakers. Johnson’s letting Trump call the shots means the House has accomplished very little apart from passing the budget reconciliation bill Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a law the American people appear to hate.

Although Republicans hold the majority in the House, Johnson has kept the members subservient to Trump’s demands. He kept them out of session for almost eight weeks during the government shutdown, for example, to try to jam the Senate into either accepting the House version of a continuing resolution to fund the government or ending the filibuster to enable Trump to force through his unpopular policies. Now, angry that they will have to run in 2026 with little to show for their House majority, House members are talking to the media about their frustration with Johnson.

The Republicans have other concerns as well. Today House Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan (R-OH) subpoenaed former special counsel Jack Smith to testify in private, rejecting Smith’s offer to testify in public. Smith wanted to testify in public to prevent committee members from leaking his comments selectively to the press, spinning them to mislead Trump loyalists. But public testimony could expose some of the evidence Smith gathered about President Trump’s participation in the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and retention of classified documents.

In a statement, Representative Jamie Raskin (D-MD), the top-ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, asked: “What are our colleagues so afraid of, that they won’t let the American people hear directly from the Special Counsel?... The American people deserve to hear the full unvarnished truth about Special Counsel Smith’s years-long effort to investigate and prosecute the crimes committed by Donald Trump and his co-conspirators.”

Also today, Senators Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Jeffrey Merkley (D-OR), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), along with Representatives Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Thomas Massie (R-KY), wrote a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi asking for a briefing no later than Friday on what she has claimed is “new” material in the Epstein files that she said on November 14 had caused her to initiate investigations into connections between Jeffrey Epstein and former president Bill Clinton, former treasury secretary Larry Summers, and investor Reid Hoffman. On July 7, an FBI memo said there was no new evidence to open new investigations “against uncharged third parties.”

Now the bipartisan lead sponsors of the Epstein Files Transparency Act from both chambers of Congress are calling out what looks to be Bondi’s attempt to shield Trump, first by saying that there was no information in the files that would warrant an investigation of “uncharged third parties” and then by opening such investigations on Democrats to muddy the waters and possibly claim that she could not release the files because of ongoing investigations.

The lawmakers noted they “are particularly focused on understanding the contents of any new evidence, information or procedural hurdles that could interfere with the Department’s ability [to] meet [the] statutory deadline” of December 19, and expressed their interest in making sure “the law is fully implemented.”

Duke Energy filed with NCUC to request an annual revenue increase of $1 billion for Duke Energy Carolinas ($727 million in 2027, and $275 million in 2028), which would mean a 15% increase over current revenues, and $729 million for Duke Energy Progress ($528 million in 2027, $200 million in 2028), a 15.1% increase.
“I am pleased that the North Carolina Department of Justice is fighting for the people of North Carolina,” said Stein in a press release.
“Data centers suck up an incredible amount of energy, and energy costs are too high; as they are, they’re rising,” said Stein.
The Public Staff of the North Carolina Utilities Commission testified in 2023 that rates could ‘approximately double‘ before 2030.","Gov. Josh Stein opposes Duke Energy’s recent request with the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) to revise rates at Duke Energy Carolina and Duke Energy Progress, which would include a 15% increase from current revenues.

Duke Energy filed with NCUC to request an annual revenue increase of $1 billion for Duke Energy Carolinas ($727 million in 2027, and $275 million in 2028), which would mean a 15% increase over current revenues, and $729 million for Duke Energy Progress ($528 million in 2027, $200 million in 2028), a 15.1% increase. Duke Energy’s requests are based on a 10.95% return on equity and 53% equity capital structure; these requests are subject to approval by NCUC.

“I am pleased that the North Carolina Department of Justice is fighting for the people of North Carolina,” said Stein in a press release. “Duke Energy’s proposed rate hike is simply too high and comes as the company is also retreating on more affordable clean energy. At a time when families are struggling to make ends meet, we should be doing everything we can to make life more affordable, not less. I will continue to fight on behalf of every North Carolinian to lower costs and grow the economy.”

During a recent press conference, Stein highlighted data centers as one of the facilities that consume a tremendous amount of energy. Stein’s newly formed council on energy policy will be taking a close look at data centers.

“Data centers suck up an incredible amount of energy, and energy costs are too high; as they are, they’re rising,” said Stein. “Duke Energy has just asked for a double-digit rate increase at the Utilities Commission, something that I hope is severely scrutinized and shrunk because electricity is too expensive as it is. We have to take a hard look at the state about what the impact of these data centers is on energy demand and is this the right way that we want to deploy a limited resource, we do not have infinite energy, and so we will have more insight into that question going forward.”

NC Secretary of Commerce Lee Lilley clarified that data centers are not typical recipients of Job Development Investment Grants (JDIG), as are companies like Toyota and Jet Zero.

“Those are not typically offered on a data center project for a variety of different reasons,” said Lilley during the same press conference. “They do qualify for other incentives and, in particular, may qualify for local economic development incentives, particularly around property tax abatement. That’s the decision of a local county, and I think that’s why you’ve seen different local jurisdictions approach data centers in different ways. I’d say thus far, the answer on data centers in North Carolina has really been left to a local decision and a decision about whether or not power is available.”

Lilley explained that he believes decisions like these will continue to be made at the local county level, while simultaneously balancing the policy question of prioritizing the use of power and who pays the bill for large projects that consume a lot of power.

“It seems Gov. Stein is starting to learn of the consequences of the Carbon Plan law,” Jon Sanders, director of the Center for Food Power and Life at the John Locke Foundation, told the Carolina Journal. “We have been warning for years that shutting down working, paid-for power plants (coal) and overbuilding expensive, land-intensive, but unreliable renewable facilities that need far more transmission lines built is a recipe for much higher rates. The Public Staff of the North Carolina Utilities Commission testified in 2023 that rates could ‘approximately double‘ before 2030. Strangely, Stein vetoed Senate Bill 266, which was nevertheless passed into law and which eliminated the interim goal of the Carbon Plan law that would have cost ratepayers an additional $13 billion by 2050.”

Sanders explains that if Stein wants to protect rate payers and ensure reliable utility service at the lowest rates possible, he should urge the General Assembly to amend the Carbon Plan law to remove the “carbon neutrality” mandate by 2050 and ensure that the primary focus of energy policy in North Carolina is reliable, low-cost electricity.

New Democratic North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson agreed with his predecessor, Stein.

“With costs rising everywhere, it’s important we take a close look at Duke Energy’s proposed rate increase to ensure it is necessary,” said Jackson in a press release. “My office is intervening to make sure we find the right balance between investing in our energy infrastructure and protecting North Carolinians’ wallets.”",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2048px-Duke_Energy_Office.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 19:03:38.223917

The effects of such trade policy on final goods in retail are quite direct: higher prices cause consumers to pull back spending, dampening possibly not just short-term demand but also long-term demand depending on the duration of current trade policy. This dynamic could cause brick-and-mortar retailers to rethink their space needs if they believe depressed demand will last for an extended period of time. The effects on industrial commercial real estate, however, are perhaps less obvious. Nevertheless, the passthrough mechanism between goods demand and space demand for these two property types is now increasingly similar. Even with trade deals and exemptions, industrial properties in the U.S. have felt the effects.

Generally speaking, broad macroeconomic headwinds have led to sharp increases in warehouse and distribution vacancies, plateauing rent growth, and net negative absorption in many markets. Tariffs have only added to the strain, as warehouse and distribution space demand depends on storage and delivery demand for both intermediate goods and final goods. While causation related to tariffs is too strong of a conclusion, there is clear correlation. Some West Coast markets have experienced performance deterioration that significantly exceeds that of the national average. For example, while the U.S. has only seen a 50-basis-point increase in the warehouse and distribution vacancy rate year-over-year (see Figure 1), Los Angeles and Oakland–East Bay both exceeded 100-basis-point increases in the same metric even though inventory growth for both metros was below that of the national figure. However, other markets (e.g., San Diego and San Francisco) are on par or even show lower year-over-year vacancy rates, indicating a tightening market with sufficiently robust demand even with inventory growth that exceeds the national number, as is the case for San Diego. This pattern extends beyond the West Coast. Port cities along the East Coast whose daily tonnage is often skewed toward international cargo, like Philadelphia, are also feeling the impact.

Still, tariffs are only one factor behind weakening warehouse and distribution performance. In many cases, higher vacancy rates, and the accompanying weakness in rent growth, are more directly attributable to the amount of speculative square footage that has come online, despite a general slowdown in the new-supply pipeline nationally. Norfolk/Hampton Roads and Savannah are two prime examples as both markets have experienced outsized inventory growth year-over-year.

Two major headwinds for warehouse and distribution demand growth persist, both tied to final consumer goods spending: weak consumer sentiment over elevated inflation expectations, and the interaction between interest rates and borrowing costs, which has contributed to the plateauing of e-commerce growth.

The University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment shows rapidly declining confidence. The November 2025 reading stands at 50.3 — just shy of the record low of 50.0 in July 2022 — as consumers worry about food and goods prices this holiday season. Much of that concern relates to inflation that has yet to meaningfully reach the policy target. Meanwhile, over the past four quarters of data, from the third quarter of 2024 to the second quarter of 2025, e-commerce’s share of retail sales has held steady, just above 16 percent, oscillating between 16.1 percent and 16.3 percent. The record high of 16.3 percent, first reached in the second quarter of 2020, was only matched again in the second quarter of 2025.

Flex and research and development (R&D) properties have been a notable exception to such deteriorating performance. As their name implies, they provide more flexibility. From retail to office space to warehousing for smaller enterprises, flex space provides a more dynamic environment and a smaller footprint for businesses to scale up or down with ease. Thus, although this industrial subtype has been far more insulated, data from the second half of 2025 is starting to indicate a softening due to this intermingling of uses and blurring of lines, given the agglomeration of the aforementioned macroeconomic factors.

Turning to activity in the capital markets for the warehouse and distribution subsector, transaction volume has picked up year-over-year in the West, both by nominal dollar amount and property count. While activity remains more muted than years past, transaction volume is up 17 percent from the third quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2025 and the median transaction cap rate is down 60 basis points over the same time period even though the 10-year Treasury yield increased by 30 basis points. The other regions of the country have not been as lucky, with either declining transaction volumes or increasing cap rates, or both. However, the South Atlantic, the only other region to experience an increase in transaction volume over the aforementioned period, saw median transaction cap rates increase just 25 basis points, on par with the 10-year Treasury yield, meaning that the risk premium over the risk-free rate remained unchanged.

Although demand softening has led to a sharp deceleration in the amount of square footage completing over the past year, as well as square footage under construction, investor appetite for existing properties remains strong. Sizeable industrial portfolios are trading across the country, with particular investor interest in newer construction that offers features like higher ceiling clearance and advanced automation capabilities. Despite ongoing concerns regarding valuations due to the current interest-rate and Treasury-yield environment, in the wake of slowing, and in some pockets, stagnant, net operating income growth, industrial portfolios are finding access to capital with loans issued for new purchases and refinancing.

This resilience is largely due to minimal borrower distress across the industrial sector. Delinquency rates remain low (the lowest across all of the core property types) — just 1.5 percent as of September 2025 — indicating temporary headwinds rather than a long-term downward trend.",https://cdn9.areadevelopment.com/article_images/id898_TariffImpacts1000.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 18:04:36.804578

On its face, the July 15th memo requires elevated review for solar energy permits.
Businesses need certainty in order to continue making investments in the United States to build out much-needed energy projects.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, 143 solar energy companies sent a letter urging the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives to work with the Department of the Interior (DOI) to address the July DOI memo that has favored preferred energy sources and amounted to a near complete moratorium on permitting for solar projects. The letter also urges Congress to keep fairness and certainty at the center of permitting negotiations.

“Federal agencies are implementing this directive in a way that amounts to a nearly complete moratorium on permitting for any project in which the Department of Interior may play a role, on both federal and private land, no matter how minor,” wrote 143 solar companies in the letter. “Businesses need certainty in order to continue making investments in the United States to build out much-needed energy projects. Certainty must include a review process that does not discriminate by energy source. We urge Congress to keep fairness and certainty at the center of permitting negotiations.”

The letter outlines the numerous permitting processes that have been impacted since the DOI memo was issued on July 15, including permits that occur under any DOI agency for projects on federal lands and private lands; permits from non-DOI federal agencies where the DOI has a consultative role; and projects on private lands that utilize DOI resources.

“For America’s solar industry, permitting reform starts with permit certainty. As 143 solar companies wrote in their letter to our Congressional leaders, without action to address this unequal treatment of solar energy, the industry will continue to face significant barriers to deployment and investment at a time of skyrocketing energy demand,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “While the solar industry values the continued bipartisan engagement on permitting reform, the SPEED Act, as passed out of committee, falls short of addressing this core problem: the ongoing permitting moratorium.”

“To be clear, there is no question we need permitting reform,” Hopper continued. “There is an agreement to be reached, and SEIA and our 1,200 member companies will continue our months-long effort to advocate for a deal that ensures equal treatment of all energy sources, because the current status of this blockade is unsustainable.”

Last month, SEIA released an analysis of EIA data showing that more than 500 projects in the pipeline across the country are in danger of delays or cancellation as a result of political attacks.

Read the full letter here and below.

Dear Majority Leader Thune, Speaker Johnson, Minority Leader Schumer, and Minority Leader Jefferies,

As solar companies engaged in helping Americans across the country keep the lights on and prices low, we are writing today to express concern about the July 15 memo from the Secretary of Interior which creates burdensome red tape, effectively halting permitting for solar energy projects. This policy will significantly delay or cancel deployment of much-needed solar energy.

On its face, the July 15th memo requires elevated review for solar energy permits. However, federal agencies are implementing this directive in a way that amounts to a nearly complete moratorium on permitting for any project in which the Department of Interior may play a role, on both federal and private land, no matter how minor. This includes:

Permits and consultations that occur under any DOI agency for projects on federal lands or any other project with a clear federal nexus.

Permits and consultations for projects primarily on private lands that involve easements, rights-of-way or gen-ties crossing public land.

Permits and consultations for projects on private lands that occur under DOI agencies including those requiring compliance with Endangered Species Act, Migratory Bird Act and Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.

Permits from non-DOI federal agencies (e.g. Army Corps of Engineers) for private land projects where the DOI has a consultative role such as wetland impacts, water crossings, or tree removal.

Projects on private land utilize DOI resources, such as IPaC, to determine species impacts.

We urge Congress to work with the Department of the Interior to address the unduly discriminatory and unprecedented government overreach, by revoking the July 15th memo.

In the alternative, we believe there are reasonable steps the Department of Interior can take in the short-term to prevent unnecessary delays in energy development that is currently poised to help meet the growing energy demands of AI and other industries.

Businesses need certainty in order to continue making investments in the United States to build out much-needed energy projects. Certainty must include a review process that does not discriminate by energy source. We urge Congress to keep fairness and certainty at the center of permitting negotiations.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

###

The long-running legal saga surrounding the future of Houston-based Citgo Petroleum reached a major turning point after a federal judge approved the company’s $5.9 billion sale to Amber Energy. The decision follows years of litigation, global political implications, competing bids, and a highly watched court-supervised auction process.

U.S. District Judge Leonard P. Stark of the District of Delaware issued the approval after overseeing one of the largest court-ordered asset sales in modern history. According to Houston Public Media, the ruling moves Amber Energy closer to completing the acquisition in 2026, pending procedural steps, regulatory clearances, and final settlement of outstanding claims.

A Years-Long Path to the Sale

Citgo has been the center of legal conflict because it is owned by PDV Holding, a U.S.-based subsidiary of the Venezuelan state-run oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). The Venezuelan government’s debts and defaulted obligations prompted numerous creditors to pursue Citgo, one of Venezuela’s most valuable foreign assets.

Houston Public Media noted that earlier court rulings determined Citgo’s shares could be auctioned to compensate a Canadian mining company owed billions by PDVSA. That judgment opened the door to additional creditors and led to a complex, multi-round auction process supervised by the Delaware court.

The process required coordination among the U.S. government, creditor groups, court-appointed officials, and Citgo’s leadership as bids were secured and vetted.

Amber Energy Prepares for Transition

Following the judge’s announcement, Amber Energy CEO Gregory Goff stated the company plans to invest in Citgo’s operational future.

“We look forward to working with the talented CITGO team to strengthen the business through capital investment and operational excellence. I am confident that together we will help enhance America’s energy leadership position,” Goff said in a news release.

Citgo employs approximately 3,300 workers across three major U.S. refineries:

Corpus Christi, Texas

Lake Charles, Louisiana

Lemont, Illinois

The company also maintains branded fuel networks and extensive midstream and distribution operations. Houston Public Media reported that all existing Citgo operations are expected to continue functioning as the ownership transition progresses.

What’s Next

The transaction will move into its finalization phase, with completion expected in 2026, barring delays or new legal challenges. Additional steps include financial settlements, regulatory review, and execution of the purchase agreement as outlined by the Delaware court.

Citgo’s sale marks a significant moment in international energy, corporate law, and U.S.-Venezuela relations, concluding a dispute that has stretched across multiple countries, presidential administrations, and courts.

The US nuclear sector has been growing at an astonishing rate over the past few years, and has been boosted by the President’s mandate to revive the US nuclear market over his second term in office. Trump has been attempting to revive the nation’s nuclear sector to meet a substantial increase in energy demand that has swept across the nation and the world.

Terrestrial Energy has big plans to increase the US nuclear capacity over the next few years

Terrestrial has been working exceedingly hard to advance the status of its planned “Project Tetra”, which will significantly boost the US’s nuclear energy generation capacity. The company has noted that it plans to advance progress on its Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) technology, laying the groundwork for a commercial fleet by the early 2030s.

Terrestrial Energy’s small and modular IMSR plant is specifically designed to provide cost-effective energy for industrial operations, data centers, and domestic and international markets. The company has been making significant progress in advancing the IMSR technology, but it needs the support of the DOE and other federal institutions to further accelerate the progress that has already been made.

Terrestrial Energy has appointed two new crucial people to lead the company into a new era of nuclear energy production

While the company has been making strides in the advancement of its technology for the nuclear sector, it has now appointed Jim Howe as Vice President of Government Relations and David O’Keefe as Vice President of Business Development & Project Management. By doing so, it can now lobby the government for the much-needed support for the next step in developing the US nuclear sector.

The US-based nuclear firm will lean on the vast experience of its two new appointees

Jim Howe has significant experience working within the federal government infrastructure. He worked as a U.S. Coast Guard Captain for nearly two decades and has vast experience in the corridors of Washington. He served as an advisor to the Vice President of the United States, leading Congressional Affairs for the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard. Notably, he also advanced nuclear policy at ARC Clean Technology, Oklo, and Centrus Energy.

Mr David O’Keefe, on the other hand, brings his own set of skills to Terrestrial Energy after working as a business-development and finance expert and advisor for Centrus Energy and Pacific Gas & Electric. He will oversee the planned pipeline of IMSR plant deployment opportunities in the U.S. The US nuclear sector is growing, as evidenced by the news that Amazon will invest in a new 960 MW small modular nuclear facility in Washington state.

“Jim and David bring a wealth of valuable expertise in government relations and project management that will be critical to our ongoing efforts to commercialize IMSR technology. Their leadership further strengthens our ability to deliver clean firm and cost-competitive energy at scale for data centers, industry, and the U.S. grid – driving tangible long-term value for our shareholders and partners as America expands its nuclear-energy infrastructure.” – Simon Irish, CEO of Terrestrial Energy

LSVs are designed for usage in limited and use in local transportation including airports, tourist attractions, golf courses, hotels and resorts, residential and business complexes, and others. Utility and off-road vehicles are utilized for commercial and personal use in slow-speed areas.

Significant factors impacting the increasing investment in low-speed, owing to the upsurge in demand from the developing nations, technological advancement in the automotive industry coupled with increasing investment and support from the government for the development of low-speed electric vehicles market. However, the high price of batteries used in these vehicle are restricting the market growth.

According to the Indian Ministry of Road Transport and Highway in 2022 there were approx. 1,037,011 electric vehicles registered within the country, which accounted roughly 6.4% of the overall automobile sales within the country. Moreover, in 2021, the government released a handbook guide to EV infrastructure in India the focuses on the development of infrastructure in the country. In 2021, the publicly accessible charging station accounted for 900 in India, which jumped to nearly 11,000 in 2022. Countries around the globe are fostering the development of EVs, which is expected to provide opportunities for the low speed electric vehicle market share during the forecast period.

Governments and regulatory bodies are implementing strict regulations towards vehicle pollution; this is the major reason driving the demand for low-speed electric vehicles during the study period. The market demand for LSEV in developing countries, particularly in Asia-Pacific, is expected to be more than in developed regions in Europe and North America.

Rapid industrialization and rising disposable income drive regional growth. As rural-to-urban migration increases, customers want cheaper, greener transportation. Government measures are also advancing electric car technology, boosting growth. Over the past few decades, crude oil prices have steadily risen, shifting people’s focus from internal combustion engines to electric automobiles. This spurred manufacturers to create electric and low-emission vehicles.

For instance, in May 2022, Wuling Motors, a China-based automobile company, partnered with SAIC Motor and General Motors and developed the Wuling Mini EV, with a cost price of USD 5,000; the model outperformed the Tesla Model 3 in China. The low speed EV is only available in China, the car can carry 4 people and has some built-in standards features such as air conditioning, power windows, stereo system, storage, and compartments. Moreover, the car is also equipped with safety features such as anti-lock brakes, tire pressure monitoring sensors, and rear parking sensors. The rise in technological advancement in low-speed electric vehicles, along with rising income levels and the desire to own personal vehicles, will continue to drive the demand in countries such as China, India, and Southeast Asian countries during the forecast period.

Now in its fifth year, the ARI Grant Program recognizes and rewards farmers and ranchers working to make Santa Clara County’s agricultural lands more resilient to drought, heat, and changing climate conditions. Launched by the County Consumer and Environmental Protection Agency, Division of Agriculture, the program provides up to $30,000 per recipient for practices such as compost and mulch application, managed grazing, and other climate-friendly practices. These conservation practices mitigate greenhouse gasses, improve soil health, capture carbon from the air, and help farmland retain water, which are essential for the long-term sustainability of local agriculture.

“Santa Clara County is a leader in policies that protect farmland, strengthen local economies, and promote environmental stewardship,” said County Agricultural Commissioner Priscilla Yeaney. “ARI Grants allow us to partner with local farmers and provide them with the tools to help fight climate change right in their fields.”

The County received more than 25 competitive applications this year, reflecting growing local interest in climate-smart farming.

""Each applicant represents the innovation and determination that define Santa Clara County's agricultural community,"" said Julie Morris, the County's agricultural liaison. ""The success of this program has become a model for sustainable land management and climate action.""

Past recipients shared how these funds are helping them turn environmental goals into everyday practices.

“For a small farmer working hard to build healthy soil, this support arrived like a godsend at just the right time,” said Durgaprasad Ala, owner of Dil Farm in Gilroy. “The funds gave me confidence to experiment with cover crops and compost—natural ways to improve soil. It’s inspired me to share what I’ve learned with other growers who also want to farm sustainably.”

“The grant made it possible to apply compost across 34 acres of pasture, which is about 26 football fields,” said Ligimol Kedongaparambil, owner of Shillingsburg Farm in San José. “Through collaboration with the County, we were able to purchase enough quality compost at an affordable price from the local composting facility, which happens to be made up of yard trimmings collected from households throughout the County.”

Their stories illustrate how local agriculture, often thought of as a quiet industry in present day Santa Clara County, is in fact a frontline partner in climate action.

“Our farmers and ranchers are the foundation of our valley,” said Supervisor Sylvia Arenas. “Every acre improved through this program strengthens not only our food system, but also the health and well-being of Santa Clara County families.”

The County will begin accepting proposals for the next round of ARI funding in early 2026.

Addis Energy is backed by At One Ventures, Engine Ventures, Pillar VC, and Voyager Ventures.","Addis Energy, a company harnessing the Earth’s potential for affordable, abundant ammonia production, today announced it has raised $8.3 million in an oversubscribed seed round, bringing the company’s total funding to date to $17.3 million. The round was led by At One Ventures, with existing investors Engine Ventures and Pillar VC also participating. Addis Energy will use the fresh capital to further advance its AI-aided laboratory of chemical reactors that simulate subsurface conditions to produce ammonia at a cost advantage versus Haber-Bosch through a net energy-positive process. The company will also use the capital to expand its operations team and prepare for its first field pilot demonstration.

Ammonia is a critical component of the global food supply, with approximately 70% used to make fertilizer. Demand for ammonia is projected to increase 25% over the next five years; however, traditional ammonia production is extremely energy intensive, consuming ~2% of global energy. Over a third of traditional ammonia production costs come from consumption of natural gas as a feedstock and fuel for the high temperature, high pressure reaction. Addis Energy is scaling a fundamentally new approach to replace the energy-intensive process of traditional ammonia production. By identifying ferrous rocks, injecting water, nitrogen and catalyst to drive an ammonia synthesis reaction, the company leverages the chemical potential of iron plus the natural heat and pressure of the subsurface. Addis Energy dramatically decreases the energy intensity and costs versus typical ammonia produced from natural gas.

“By merging chemical innovation developed out of MIT with on-the-ground oil and gas industry experience, Addis Energy is enabling energy abundance and affordability, and creating new economic opportunities for domestic energy production with zero emissions,” said Michael Alexander, CEO and co-founder of Addis Energy. “Considering the U.S. imports ~12% of the domestic ammonia supply, we have a timely opportunity to create a new platform for U.S.-led, domestic clean fuel and chemical production. This funding will allow us to scale our novel approach to ammonia production and get ‘shovel-ready’ for our first pilot.”

Following its January 2025 launch, Addis Energy has:

Signed a partnership with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, one of the U.S. Department of Energy’s national laboratories, to conduct reactive transport modeling based on the laboratory’s expertise drilling wells and modeling chemical reactions in carbon sequestration and in-situ mining.

Sourced 600+ rock samples from various geologies and rock formations across the U.S. to demonstrate cost-advantage production of ammonia in new locations where natural gas supply isn’t abundant.

Hired 3 new full-time employees, with Douglas Wicks, previously the Program Director at ARPA-E, the U.S. Department of Energy’s advanced energy research agency, and Doug Hollett, previously the Acting Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, also joining as advisors.

“Addis Energy is not trying to “green” ammonia. They’re throwing out the model entirely. Instead of spending billions to recreate extreme pressure and heat above ground, they use what already exists underground. The Earth becomes the reactor,” said Laurie Menoud, Partner at At One Ventures. “Haber-Bosch is one of the most efficient industrial processes ever built, which is exactly why incremental innovations won’t compete with it. The only way to win is to change the physics and the system architecture. Addis is doing both. And that’s how you get a cost curve that incumbents simply can’t follow.”

In the coming months, Addis Energy will work to complete its nation-wide geological mapping and prepare for its first pilot field test.

Dive Brief:

Wolfspeed said it has received $698.6 million in cash tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service through a provision of the CHIPS and Science Act, strengthening its cash position after filing for bankruptcy earlier this year.

Wolfspeed is expecting about $1 billion in total from the CHIPS Act provision, which would accelerate its transition from 150-millimeter to 200-millimeter wafer technology. The company sought the 25% tax rebate after spending billions of dollars on a materials plant in Chatham County, North Carolina, and its Mohawk Valley fab in Utica, New York.

The North Carolina-based semiconductor company now has a cash balance of $1.5 billion following receipt of funds from the Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit under Section 48D of the Internal Revenue Code, according to an investor filing on Monday.

Dive Insight:

The refund comes months after Wolfspeed exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late September, a move that was related to weak demand and financial struggles. The semiconductor manufacturer received approval to cut its total debt by 70% and lower its annual cash interest payments by 60% as part of its restructuring plan. The company ended its latest quarter with $926 million in cash and investments, prior to the tax refund.

“This substantial cash infusion further strengthens our liquidity position at a critical phase in Wolfspeed’s strategic evolution,” CFO Gregor Van Issum said in a statement Monday. “It provides us with the financial agility to support long-term growth, manage our capital structure responsibly, and continue driving innovation across the silicon carbide value chain for our customers.”

As part of its lender agreement, Wolfspeed said it plans to allocate $192.2 million of the refund to paying down $175 million of debt, with the remaining funds for “general corporate purposes.”

Wolfspeed has been focused on ramping production of its 200mm silicon carbide products in Chatham County. In addition to supporting its electric vehicle customers, the company said it wants to reach growing markets, such as artificial intelligence data centers, aerospace, defense, industrial and energy.

Wolfspeed is also winding down its 150mm wafer production. It has been taking last-time buy orders from customers with plans to officially close its Durham, North Carolina, factory by the end of the calendar year, Issum said in an earnings call Oct. 29. Wolfspeed previously shared plans to shutter the plant over a year ago.

The company generated revenue of $196.8 million in its fiscal first quarter that ended Sept. 30, up 1% from last year. Roughly half of that total came from its 200mm Mohawk Valley fab in Marcy, New York. Wolfspeed also posted a net loss of $643.6 million during the period, largely due to one-time costs related to its Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

Looking ahead, Issum said the company is seeing a “meaningful shift” across its key markets and developing a new sustainable, long-term plan for the future while experiencing near-term soft demand. He added that Wolfspeed will provide more details on its plan in the first half of 2026.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/I01OrZ1j0omox5pYiM5zAjv5xLa7ZTov7e4zwj9YwTg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS93b2xmc3BlZWQuanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-04 14:02:08.018008

Janus tie-in: Project Pele—of course— is not the only nuclear power–related undertaking of the DOD or the broader federal government.","This fuel will be used for the Project Pele microreactor being developed through a collaboration among the three parties (alongside the Department of Energy) and represents a major milestone for the project. As Jeff Waksman, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy and Environment, put it, “This is real nuclear microreactor fuel delivered at its final destination, rather than some letter or memorandum promising to make fuel at a later date.”

More details: According to INL—and despite announcements coming out this week—the 40,000 fuel compacts that made up the shipment were delivered on November 5 (a video of the delivery is available here). BWXT manufactured and shipped the fuel from its facilities in Lynchburg, Va., where the company is also constructing the prototype reactor.

BWXT plans to begin formal system testing as early as 2027 and begin producing electricity at INL as soon as 2028.

While the SCO is leading Project Pele, INL director John Wagner highlighted how instrumental the DOE network has been in facilitating this project, saying, “This milestone reflects years of dedicated effort by the Office of Nuclear Energy’s Advanced Gas Reactor TRISO Fuel Qualification Program to fabricate and qualify TRISO fuel using world-class capabilities at INL’s Advanced Test Reactor and Materials and Fuels Complex, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory—capabilities that exist nowhere else in the world.”

Pele background: In May 2019, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, DOE, and SCO signed a preliminary MOU on microreactor research laying the groundwork for Project Pele. The original goal of the project was to develop a transportable 1–5 MWe advanced microreactor.

In March 2020, the DOD awarded contracts for three projects under Pele: one to BWXT, one to Westinghouse, and one to X-energy. BWXT emerged as the frontrunner in the project with its 1.5-MWe high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor.

In August 2023 (in a webinar organized by the American Nuclear Society), Waksman said that if all went according to plan, the reactor would be turned on at INL before the end of calendar year 2025. The new operational date of 2028 represents a three-year delay in prior plans but still aims to meet a September 30, 2028, deadline set by President Trump’s Executive Order 14299.

In September 2024, the DOD announced that it had broken ground at INL’s Critical Infrastructure Test Range Complex, where the reactor is set to be tested. In July 2025, BWXT announced that it had started fabrication on the Pele reactor core.

Janus tie-in: Project Pele—of course— is not the only nuclear power–related undertaking of the DOD or the broader federal government. Most directly related is the recently announced Janus Program, which seeks to deploy an operational demonstration microreactor power plant on a U.S. military installation by 2030. The DOD has stated that Janus will build on lessons learned from Pele and that the “laboratory teams which partnered on the technical, legal, and policy aspects of Project Pele will also be working closely on the Janus Program.”

Waksman reiterated this most recently in BWXT announcement, saying, “the army’s Janus Program will follow on to deliver affordable, reliable, commercial nuclear power to ensure that our critical infrastructure has power, even if the electric grid is disrupted.” In November, nine sites were selected for possible deployment as part of the program.

Don’t forget ANPI: Project Pele and the Janus Program are running parallel to the DOD’s separate Advanced Nuclear Power for Installations (ANPI) program, which was launched in 2024 to deploy microreactor systems at military sites. At the launch of the program, the DOD aimed to have two microreactors operational on military bases by 2030. In April of this year, the DOD announced eight companies that are eligible to receive Other Transaction Awards for the project.

At this year’s annual conference of the Association of the U.S. Army, Waksman reportedly said that Janus will differ from ANPI by virtue of having different technical requirements, reflecting recent changes in the nuclear power market, including new companies that have emerged since last year.",https://www.ans.org/file/22948/l/Picture1.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 14:01:15.943614

Practical Implications The Proposed Rule could substantially reduce permitting burdens and shorten project timelines.
Conclusion The Proposed Rule represents a significant shift toward narrowing federal jurisdiction under the CWA, potentially reducing permitting burdens for developers and landowners while increasing reliance on state and local regulation.
Stakeholders should consider reviewing the Proposed Rule carefully and may wish to submit comments by the January 5, 2026, deadline.","On November 20, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps, together the “Agencies”) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Proposed Rule) in the Federal Register to revise the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (CWA).[1]

The Proposed Rule represents the Agencies’ second effort to implement the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA[2], which narrowed federal authority over wetlands. If finalized, the rule would limit federal jurisdiction, reducing the number of projects requiring Section 404 dredge-and-fill permits and Section 401 water quality certifications. Public comments are due January 5, 2026.

Background

The CWA applies to “navigable waters,” defined as “waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.”[3] But Congress did not provide a precise definition of WOTUS, leading to decades of litigation, regulatory revisions, and uncertainty.

In Sackett, the Supreme Court clarified that WOTUS includes only relatively permanent, standing, or continuously flowing bodies of water—such as streams, rivers, lakes, and oceans—and wetlands that have a continuous surface connection to those waters. Intermittent, ephemeral, or hydrologically isolated waters are generally not jurisdictional.

After Sackett, the Agencies issued their “Amended 2023 Rule”[4] to align with the Court’s guidance. Stakeholders, however, raised concerns that the rule did not fully comply with Sackett and created implementation challenges. The Proposed Rule seeks to address these concerns by clarifying which waters are jurisdictional, redefining key terms, and expanding certain exclusions.

Key Changes in the Proposed Rule

1. Federal Jurisdiction Focuses on Relatively Permanent Waters

Under the Proposed Rule, WOTUS would include only:

Traditional navigable waters (TNW) and the territorial seas;

Most impoundments of WOTUS;

Relatively permanent tributaries (RPT) of TNW, the territorial seas, and impoundments;

Wetlands with a continuous surface connection to TNW, RPT, or impoundments; and

Lakes and ponds with a continuous connection to TNW or RPT.

Key definitions:

Relatively Permanent: Waters that stand or flow year-round or at least during the wet season.[5] Intermittent flow or seasonal flows outside the wet season do not qualify.

Continuous surface connection: Wetlands must touch (abut) a jurisdictional water and hold surface water at least during the wet season. Only the portions meeting both criteria are jurisdictional.

Tributaries: Waters with a bed and bank and relatively permanent flow that connect to downstream TNW or the territorial seas, directly or through features that convey relatively permanent flow. Culverts, ditches, berms, or other barriers that do not convey relatively permanent flow generally do not establish jurisdiction.

2. Interstate Waters No Longer Automatically Jurisdictional

The Proposed Rule removes the default federal jurisdiction for interstate waters. Such waters are now jurisdictional only if they meet another WOTUS category (TNW, RPT, or adjacent wetlands).

The Agencies explain that neither Sackett nor prior Supreme Court decisions support federal regulation of all interstate waters regardless of size or connectivity.[6] Non-jurisdictional interstate waters would instead be regulated by States and Tributes under their sovereign authorities.

3. Expanded and Clarified Exclusions

The Proposed Rule clarifies and broadens key exclusions:

Waste Treatment Systems: All components designed to convey, treat, retain, or remove pollutants—such as lagoons or treatment ponds—remain excluded. This reflects longstanding policy since 1979.

Ditches: Non-navigable ditches constructed entirely on dry land remain excluded, even if they carry relatively permanent flow. Ditches constructed within wetlands or that relocate a tributary may still be jurisdictional.

Prior Converted Cropland: Remains excluded unless abandoned (no agricultural use for more than five years with reversion to wetland).

Groundwater: Explicitly excluded, including groundwater drained through subsurface systems. However, groundwater that surfaces and contributes to a relatively permanent stream may still be jurisdictional.

Section 404(f) Agricultural Exemptions: Continue to protect many routine farming, ranching, irrigation, and pond construction activities without federal permits.

Practical Implications

The Proposed Rule could substantially reduce permitting burdens and shorten project timelines. Many greenfield and master-planned community developments may no longer require Section 404 permits, and projects that previously triggered compensatory mitigation could proceed without it. Similarly, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews—which are often triggered solely by the need for a Section 404 permit—may be avoided. These impacts are likely to be most significant in arid and western states, where ephemeral or intermittent waters would generally fall outside federal jurisdiction.

As federal oversight narrows, state and local authorities are expected to fill the regulatory gap. Approximately half of U.S. states, along with the District of Columbia, already regulate wetlands more broadly than the CWA. States such as Washington and Oregon are considering or implementing state-level dredge-and-fill programs. In these jurisdictions, wetlands lacking a continuous surface connection to a WOTUS may only require state permitting, rather than federal authorization, highlighting the growing importance of state-level compliance.

Conclusion

The Proposed Rule represents a significant shift toward narrowing federal jurisdiction under the CWA, potentially reducing permitting burdens for developers and landowners while increasing reliance on state and local regulation. Stakeholders should consider reviewing the Proposed Rule carefully and may wish to submit comments by the January 5, 2026, deadline.

The scale of change is staggering. Data centers, industrial growth, electric vehicles, and new generation sources are driving electricity demand to levels unseen. At the same time, climate imperatives require rapid deployment of clean energy infrastructure. Yet, every mile of transmission line, every interconnection agreement, and every investment decision is governed by complex legal rules that vary across jurisdictions.

Legal frameworks set the pace of progress. They define who pays for transmission upgrades, how quickly new generation is deployed, and what environmental safeguards apply. They influence whether projects move forward—or stall for years in regulatory limbo. The law is not a spectator in the grid revolution; it is a central player.

What’s at Stake?

Timely grid modernization is essential to powering the next generation of technological innovation and, in turn, economic competitiveness and national security Conversely, an outdated grid increases reliability risks, impedes the interconnection of new resources, and incumbers states from achieving their decarbonization targets. A well-designed legal strategy can unlock billions in investment, accelerate innovation, and open pathways to new energy resources.

For energy companies, large energy users and project developers , understanding these dynamics is essential. Litigation risks, environmental obligations, and financing structures are evolving rapidly, and regulatory decisions today will shape business models for decades.

Huang said U.S. competitiveness now depended on its ability to expand electricity generation as AI workloads surge.
Huang’s warning came as the U.S. intensified its efforts to upgrade federal permitting and expand domestic energy production.
He argued that the United States should compete globally rather than withdraw from markets that shape technical standards.
He said the United States could maintain its global leadership if it expanded energy capacity, modernized permitting rules, and restored domestic manufacturing.","WASHINGTON, Dec. 4, 2025 - The United States needs to rapidly expand energy capacity, accelerate data-center construction and rebuild domestic industrial infrastructure, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Without the energy expansion, warned the helm of the advanced chips manufacturer and the world’s highest-valued company, the U.S. risks losing long-term leadership in artificial intelligence.

AI progress “does not start with GPUs” but with the electricity and physical capacity needed to compute at scale, he said at the bipartisan CSIS think tank.

China had structural advantages across what he called the “five-layer stack” of AI - energy, chips, infrastructure, models, and applications - even as U.S. firms continued to design the world’s most advanced semiconductors. For example, China produced roughly twice the electricity of the U.S., giving it the power capacity required for semiconductor fabrication plants and AI supercomputing clusters.

Also, China now accounts for nearly 70 percent of global AI patents and said the U.S.’s effective exit from the Chinese market had ensured domestic Chinese companies would build their own full AI stack and export it abroad.

Huang pointed to China’s enormous consumer markets and dense manufacturing networks as factors that allow it to commercialize AI applications at scale, especially in robotics, logistics, and industrial automation.

China is constructing data centers at speeds the U.S. ‘cannot match’

He said China was constructing AI data centers at speeds U.S. firms “cannot match,” with approvals, land allocation, and full buildouts completed within months.

Huang said U.S. competitiveness now depended on its ability to expand electricity generation as AI workloads surge. He said NVIDIA continued improving chip-level efficiency “by five or ten times each year,” but demand for AI computation “is going up by a factor of 10,000 to a million.” He said chip fabs, robotics hubs, and hyperscale AI data centers could not be built or operated without dramatic expansion in national power supply.

Huang’s warning came as the U.S. intensified its efforts to upgrade federal permitting and expand domestic energy production. President Donald Trump issued a series of directives this year requiring agencies to accelerate environmental reviews, digitize permitting systems, and fast-track infrastructure projects - including data centers, transmission lines, and semiconductor facilities - to reduce multiyear delays.

Such reforms are necessary if the country expects to meet the energy and construction demands of next-generation AI.

U.S. export controls a burden

Huang also warned that U.S. export controls and Chinese countermeasures have effectively removed NVIDIA from the world’s second-largest AI market. He said the company was now “banned on both sides,” leaving Chinese firms such as Huawei positioned to scale domestically without direct U.S. competition. “We have conceded essentially the entire market to them,” he said.

He argued that the United States should compete globally rather than withdraw from markets that shape technical standards.

When asked about AI’s impact on the labor force, Huang said AI would reorganize work by automating tasks rather than eliminating occupations. Radiology is an example where AI increased capacity without reducing demand for specialists.

Both the U.S. and China face severe labor shortages in manufacturing, a dynamic he said would accelerate adoption of robotics, with China positioned to scale faster because of its engineering talent and domestic demand.

U.S. strengths

Despite the competitive pressures, Huang said the United States still held major strengths, including leadership in advanced semiconductor design, world-class research universities, and a startup ecosystem capable of turning scientific breakthroughs into commercial products. He said U.S. companies continued to define global AI software tools and that many of the most widely adopted model architectures originated in American labs.

Huang said the next decade would deliver major advances in biotechnology, materials science, and robotics, much of it driven by American research institutions applying AI to scientific discovery. He said the United States could maintain its global leadership if it expanded energy capacity, modernized permitting rules, and restored domestic manufacturing. “This is the one decade I simply will not miss,” he said.

“The best of days are ahead of us,” Huang said, “but only if we build the infrastructure to support them.”",https://broadbandbreakfast.com/content/images/2025/12/AP25304389918382-jensen.jpeg,N,,2025-12-04 17:02:16.468803

The utility is asking the state for expedited approval of the company’s contracts with Oracle Corp. for a data center planned in Saline Township, near Ann Arbor.
The data center is part of Stargate, OpenAI’s $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure around the United States.
DTE Electric has asked the Michigan Public Service Commission to fast-track approval for its plan with Oracle to power the data center.
“Bringing on a data center of this size means more renewables, and more battery storage,” DTE said in a statement.","Michigan residents demanded more scrutiny of the plan to provide electricity to a proposed data center in rural Washtenaw County on Wednesday night.

They also expressed frustration and distrust with DTE Energy. The utility is asking the state for expedited approval of the company’s contracts with Oracle Corp. for a data center planned in Saline Township, near Ann Arbor.

The facility would require 1.4 gigawatts of power from the electricity provider. The data center is part of Stargate, OpenAI’s $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure around the United States.

DTE Electric has asked the Michigan Public Service Commission to fast-track approval for its plan with Oracle to power the data center. That would bypass a process called a ""contested case"" that requires the commission to consider evidence and testimony from a variety of sources. Michigan’s Attorney General expressed alarm about the process, calling the hearing “performative listening” in a rebuke last month.

A small group of protesters gathered Wednesday afternoon across the street from DTE Energy’s Detroit headquarters. They were unhappy that DTE has tried to push plans for the data center through without public hearing.

Sarah Brabbs is from York Township, next to Saline. While she is not totally opposed to a data center, she said she’s not a fan of DTE trying to push the project through without allowing the public in on the process.

“Putting rate payers in a situation that you know we will be paying for, probably on multiple levels, is disingenuous, dysfunctional, and unacceptable,” Brabbs said.

Others at the protest said they’re concerned about the potential environmental impact, like how much water the facility could use and the amount of energy it would need to function.

“The access to the Great Lakes, they’re definitely taking advantage of whatever God-given resource in order to just implement whatever quantum, whatever new level of science and technology that they haven’t got consent from the people on if they even want it in the first place,” said Elijah Williams.

At a virtual hearing Wednesday evening drew almost 90 participants. About 45 people spoke over the two and a half hours, with more in queue when the meeting ended at 9 p.m.

A few speakers voiced support for the project. Most of the supporters represented trade unions or business associations who supported the project for creating jobs.

Randall Whitaker is the president of the Washtenaw County Skilled Building Trades Council. He said the project was an investment in Michigan’s workforce.

“A project like this is huge for workers,” he said.

Constructing the data center would create about 2,500 union jobs, according to DTE’s application. Other supporters argued that the facility would generate millions in tax revenue and attract talent to Michigan.

DTE has said it expects the facility to increase its current peak electrical load by about 25%, but building out the capacity to accommodate that demand would not affect current ratepayers. DTE argues in its application that the data center won’t impact existing customers’ rates because of safeguards they’ve placed in the contracts with Oracle.

“The project strengthens Michigan’s long-term competitiveness in the fast-growing AI and advanced computing sectors, helping ensure our state remains a destination for innovation and talent,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement supporting the project.

But most participants opposed DTE’s request, citing the same concerns as the protesters - future electricity costs, how much water the facility would use, and whether the data center would actually benefit the local community.

Nichole Biber is a member of the Little Traverse Band of Odawa Indians, one of the 12 federally recognized tribes in Michigan. She said she doesn’t trust DTE or Oracle to do what’s best for residents.

“These ‘meaningful guardrails,’ from what I've heard so far, are all on the assurances of DTE and the multibillion dollar corporations that are pushing AI and data centers on us,” she said. “That does not reassure me.”

DTE’s application, which includes the contracts with Oracle, is partially redacted.

Maggie Kaercher, who runs a small fish farm in Dexter and also attended the hearing, said she wants the commission to deny DTE’s request and have the application available for a more thorough review.

“You can't pretend that there's transparency when there is so much redacted out of the papers that we've been able to see,” she said.

“What we are asking, and what many other people are asking for as well, is that the Commission give DTE's proposal the proper scrutiny and ensure transparency,” said Katie Duckworth, an attorney with the Environmental Law and Policy Center.

“Because this is the largest data center to be proposed in Michigan, and it's one of the largest in the nation,” Duckworth said at the hearing.

Duckworth said the organization is concerned with how the data center’s power load will impact DTE’s ability to comply with Michigan’s climate change plans.

“It would also significantly increase the company's renewable energy obligation under Michigan's clean energy laws,” she said.

DTE is prepared for that challenge, the company said.

“Bringing on a data center of this size means more renewables, and more battery storage,” DTE said in a statement. The company also said the data center’s operators will finance the energy generation and storage needed to run the facility.

Duckworth said that solution would be “transformational” for DTE’s grid – if it happens.

“It raises a lot of questions including as to how those batteries would be charged and whether they will be charged by renewable energy, or whether it would involve prolonging the life of polluting fossil fuel plants or even building additional fossil fuel plants in the future,” she said.

Oracle expects the facility to open in December 2026. It won’t reach its maximum capacity of 1.4 gigawatts until December 2027, according to DTE’s application to the commission.

In October, DTE asked the commission to issue a decision by Friday, December 5. The commission is meeting at 1 p.m. that day.

Since the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, states have scrambled to advance their clean energy progress against the barrage of threats and rollbacks to both renewable investments and financial incentives that support homes and businesses. But with the passage of Illinois Senate Bill 25—the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability (CRGA) Act—on October 30, 2025, a beacon of hope is fixed upon the Prairie State.

The CRGA Act is a massive, comprehensive energy package initiated by NRDC and our partners in the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition, along with Governor JB Pritzker and House and Senate leadership.

In spite of federal headwinds, NRDC is going on the offense to drive climate progress forward at the state level. The problems we set to solve for with the CRGA Act were twofold:

Reliability: Illinois has been in desperate need of a smart, efficient grid that can best optimize clean energy connectivity and keep the lights on when we’re faced with ever-increasing extreme weather events.

Affordability: Energy capacity prices, which consumers pay through monthly utility bills, have increased exponentially as grid operators have proven they are slow to connect cheap, clean energy to our system.

Over the last two years, NRDC dug into the solutions. We engaged with climate, consumer, and environmental justice advocates; utilities; state agencies and elected officials; organized labor; renewable energy companies; and more.

Backed by science, analysis, and best-practice policy, the solutions are commonsense:

1) Reduce the amount of electricity needed to power our homes and businesses

2) Build more clean energy supply

3) Modernize the grid’s physical infrastructure

4) Plan more comprehensively and transparently for our energy future

The following is a snapshot of the critical highlights of the CRGA Act that accomplish just what the state needs and Illinoisans demand.

Reducing electric demand

Strengthens electric utility energy efficiency programs that provide consumers with financial incentives for technologies like heat pumps and wall insulation to reduce electricity waste and lower monthly utility bills. Going forward, utilities will need to save the equivalent of 2 percent of their annual electricity sales to customers—one of the highest targets in the country. That might not seem like a big number on the surface, but we estimate that through these strengthened programs, the equipment and building upgrades invested in a given year will, over their lifetime, save enough electricity to power more than two million homes for a year. The bill also triples existing requirements on minimum income-qualified investment and increases the amount of appliance electrification these programs can facilitate.

Requires utilities and alternative electric suppliers to offer customers opt-in “time of use” electric rates so that households and small businesses can better prioritize activities that use a lot of electricity—like running your clothes dryer or charging your electric vehicle (EV)—when prices are low.

Building energy supply

Requires the Illinois Power Agency to procure 3 gigawatts of large-scale battery storage by 2030, expanding our grid’s capacity and keeping electric capacity costs under control. These batteries will store excess generation from solar and wind energy and then dispatch it to the grid when it’s most needed, like at peak times in the evenings or during emergency grid events. This ambitious storage procurement is estimated to provide the equivalent power consumed by half a million homes over 24 hours during times of need.

Enhances various initiatives for increased solar energy deployment, such as allowing annual renewable portfolio standard financing limits to be increased and adjusted with inflation, as well as reforming clean energy interconnection dispute processes and expanding minimum standards for solar project siting.

Stands up various policies that invest in geothermal energy and community thermal energy networks, which will facilitate infrastructure projects that transfer heat in and out of buildings using zero-emission thermal energy.

Modernizing the grid

Amends the existing Renewable Energy Access Plan to study transmission headroom—the grid’s available capacity to accommodate growth—and identify opportunities for advanced transmission technologies. Based on the assessments, utilities will be encouraged to deploy these modern and cost-effective technologies that maximize powerlines’ ability to carry clean electricity and reduce unnecessary bottlenecks within our infrastructure.

Requires ComEd and Ameren to roll out opt-in virtual power plant programs where Illinoisans can allow certain smart technologies, like EV chargers and smart thermostats, to be centrally managed during times of high energy demand. Customers can then be compensated for providing grid services and reducing peak demand.

Requires ComEd and Ameren to meet timelines for connecting large EV charging stations to the grid, making it easier and more predictable for businesses to invest in large charging stations across the state.

Setting the state on the path for better energy planning

Initiates a statewide integrated resource plan (IRP) which, beginning in 2026 and every four years thereafter, will bring together state agencies, utilities, and advocates to evaluate our state’s energy needs and rightsize our clean energy targets and investment into demand-reduction resources. The IRP also allows for more efficient utilization of the existing power grid, which will help new power plants come online faster. The Illinois Commerce Commission will coordinate with regional grid operators PJM and MISO to replace retiring fossil power plants with new clean ones at the same site and allow resources like battery storage to plug in alongside aging power plants to maximize their efficiency.

Corrects a long-ignored definition of the true societal cost of carbon emissions in Illinois law, updating it to reflect science-based assessments of the damage caused by emissions that will ensure assessments in utility investments properly value climate benefits.

All in all, the CRGA Act is a momentous win for accelerating our transition to a clean energy future. CRGA expands family-sustaining jobs, protects consumers from volatile price spikes, and invests in Illinois residents while the federal government drops the ball.

So, what's next?

Though the CRGA Act was originally introduced with strong provisions regulating data centers, negotiations with key stakeholders proved we needed more time to ensure holistic protections are legislatively mandated. What ultimately made it into the bill minimizes the air pollution impact of diesel-powered backup generators at data centers by requiring they meet at least U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Tier 4 standards for units that operate solely as an emergency or standby unit for power outages beyond 24 hours.

With more regulation of these energy-intensive data centers needed, NRDC and our partners are ready to push for a data center legislative package in the 2026 Illinois General Assembly, which runs from January through May. Our priorities will be that data centers must bring their own, new clean energy and pay for their own transmission system build-out—ensuring that associated costs aren’t on the backs of consumers and we preserve grid reliability for everyone.

LONDON, Dec 4 (Reuters) – China’s Changan will launch vehicles from its electric Avatr and Nevo brands in Europe over the next two years and is considering selling light commercial vehicles on the continent as well, the automaker’s global design chief said on Thursday.

So far Changan has focused on launching fully-electric models in Europe. But the company could also sell hybrids and plug-in hybrids under the Changan brand if there is sufficient demand, Klaus Zyciora, vice president and global head of design, told Reuters during an interview in London.

“We will test the water with consumers and see how competitive our offers can be,” Zyciora said. “But there will be a lot of products coming in the near future.”

Changan said in March it planned to start sales in 10 European markets this year. So far it has launched its Deepal S07 electric SUV, which will be joined by the smaller Deepal 05 EV early next year.

The company plans to build a European factory to support sales on the continent. If Changan produced EVs in Europe, it would avoid European Union tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars.

Chongqing-based Changan joins a growing number of Chinese automakers in Europe, including China’s No. 1 car company BYD and the country’s top exporter Chery, plus EV makers Xpeng and Zeekr.

Avatr is a premium Changan electric brand, while Nevo runs from small cars to SUVs.

Europe’s car industry and Germany’s government have urged the European Commission to allow “range extender” EVs (REEVs) – where a backup combustion engine charges the EV battery – in the transition to electric.

With the Legislature creating a sales and use tax exemption for data centers in 2024, more facilities are aiming to set up shop in Michigan.
As data centers flock to Michigan communities, what protections exist for residents?
Data centers often have gas generators on site to ensure they have enough energy, which creates air pollution, Green explained.
So they really don’t need that many employees.” In reality it’s the construction that brings economic development, not the data centers, Balch said.","Inquisitive residents packed into the Rod Bushey Performing Arts Center at Howell High School Wednesday night, as a panel of environmental, tech and infrastructure experts aimed to provide additional information on what it looks like when a data center is built within a community.

Howell Township is one of a growing number of communities in Michigan raising questions on how they will be impacted if one of these facilities is built within their community as a project reportedly backed by Meta, the parent company for Facebook and Instagram, is planned on more than 1,000 acres of farmland.

Data centers are facilities made to house information technology equipment including servers, storage systems, networking equipment and other hardware used to store and distribute data. While these facilities provide the infrastructure for the internet and web-based services, they are also used in artificial intelligence development.

With the Legislature creating a sales and use tax exemption for data centers in 2024, more facilities are aiming to set up shop in Michigan. However, the speakers at Wednesday’s community information and action night warned that these projects can herald higher energy rates, alongside a number of environmental issues.

As data centers flock to Michigan communities, what protections exist for residents?

Ben Green, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Information and the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, explained that using programs like ChatGPT or video generation platforms requires a huge amount of energy, increasing energy demand and requiring upgrades to the grid, prompting energy companies to try and recover costs by raising rates.

Oftentimes these companies are realizing they need to keep fossil fuel plants open in order to supply energy to these resource intensive facilities, Green said, which can scuttle climate goals like Michigan’s law requiring energy companies to meet a 100% clean energy standard by 2040.

Data centers often have gas generators on site to ensure they have enough energy, which creates air pollution, Green explained. Data centers can also create issues with light pollution and noise pollution, Green said.

Water use is another major concern, Green said, explaining that water is often the most effective way to cool servers and chips, which generate heat when in use.

Transparency is also a major issue surrounding these facilities, Green said.

“Data Center companies are incredibly eager to not share any information about how much electricity they use, how much water they use,” Green said. “Often they have various types of non-disclosure agreements or kind of bans on what even the public officials are allowed to say. So it can be very hard for journalists and citizens to actually learn, you know, just how much electricity are you using, how much water are you using?”

While data centers are often viewed as a major job creator, Green and Prescott Balch, a retired tech industry employee who wrote software supported by data centers, said the actual gains are significantly smaller compared to what companies promise.

“There’s a lot of construction work in these projects,” Balch said. “The construction work will employ over 1,000 people at its peak, and it will last for quite a while.”

However, the data centers themselves employ as few people as possible by design, Balch said. Both Green and Balch noted that the facilities often only have around 20 to 25 full time employees after it is built.

“It’s not, you know, what you might envision of a San Francisco office of coders and developers and program managers,” Green said. “It’s really just a bunch of a stack of computers on computers, on computers just processing data. So they really don’t need that many employees.”

In reality it’s the construction that brings economic development, not the data centers, Balch said. They do not turn communities into tech hubs, Balch said, calling them “the broom closet of technology.”

“We need them. You got to put the broom someplace,” Balch said. “They’re really important, and they’re really large. They can’t go in expensive real estate in downtown San Francisco. But they’re not sexy.”

Balch also warned that the AI boom driving investment into these facilities could go bust.

“The current data center market is $350 billion,” Balch said. “The currently proposed aggregate of all data center proposals is $2.5 trillion. There is no industry that grows that fast and lives to tell about it.”

Communities entertaining housing a data center need to ask themselves what will happen should the AI bubble burst, Balch said, with the answer varying depending on where they are in the development process.

At the very end of that process, there is a risk of obsolescence, with Balch noting there are very few data centers that are more than 25 years old.

“Technology will relentlessly innovate, and at some point a data center is too expensive to upgrade and it has to get converted to some other use,” Balch said. “We have no track record on hyper scale data centers, because they’re brand new.”

While the details will vary by state and by community, Balch also raised questions about providing these facilities with tax breaks, as they often fail to provide benefits in return.

Andrea Pierce, the policy director for the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition, and Green also noted that the tax revenue that is lost in providing these breaks could instead be used for other priorities like schools, public services or roads.

Balch also noted that many of these companies are pursuing sites in small towns with cheap land and close access to water and power. This creates an additional risk for residents, who will be left to make up for lost tax revenue if a data center dries up.

While they can drive economic development, the key is to develop a lot of them, Balch said.

If a community has the expertise and expenses to negotiate a fair deal with the company, the resources needed to manage these oversized projects and a tax base that can absorb the cost if a facility becomes obsolete, then a data center could work there, Balch said, emphasizing that there are pros and cons to every project.

When asked how members of the community can protect themselves from the financial and environmental risks of a project, Balch encouraged them to tally up those downsides, decide which ones are important to them, and to formulate a strategy from there on how those issues can be addressed.

Pierce recommended residents call their lawmakers and ask them to repeal the law creating tax breaks for data centers, and to take steps to hold their state and local officials accountable.

Green emphasized that data center developers and tech companies push for these projects to move forward as quickly as possible with as little transparency as possible, advising community members to do everything in their power to slow the process down and learn more.

“It’s imperative to figure out, like, who you know, is it the zoning board? Who is it in this community that actually has the sign off to approve or disapprove this project?” Green said. “What can you do, whether it’s a ballot initiative or something else, to put a moratorium in place, to just say we need to gather more information before a decision is made.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7275-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 13:05:26.434572

Aligns with Duke Energy's focus to reduce costs while supporting reliability and economic prosperity

Federal cost-share project will support small modular reactor deployment by Tennessee Valley Authority and GE Vernova Hitachi

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Dec. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy reaffirms its commitment to advanced nuclear development activities as part of its participation in a recently announced U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) cost-share project.

Earlier this week, the DOE announced a $400 million grant to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to continue to accelerate deployment of GE Vernova Hitachi's (GVH) BWRX-300 small modular reactor (SMR) technology. As previously announced, Duke Energy's participation in TVA's technology grant application supports the company's new nuclear strategy by joining with other utilities and technology providers to more cost effectively advance a standard technology design, while leveraging lessons learned from the industry. The collaboration aligns with Duke Energy's long-term strategy to deliver reliable, affordable, and carbon-free energy to its customers while supporting American prosperity and energy dominance.

""Public-private partnerships accelerate technology development and reduce costs and risks for customers and investors,"" said Harry Sideris, Duke Energy president and chief executive officer. ""Our work with TVA and GE Vernova Hitachi will advance the BWRX-300, paving the way for future deployment of SMRs that strengthen grid reliability and support economic growth.""

As part of Duke Energy's diverse energy mix, SMRs can play a vital role in strengthening economic prosperity while maintaining reliability at the lowest possible cost for customers. Collaboration with TVA and GVH supports the company's near-term activities to rigorously evaluate and partner with industry stakeholders to advance new nuclear generation. This includes potential SMR deployment at the Belews Creek site in North Carolina where the company plans to submit an early site permit application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by year-end.

More information about the grant and the project teams can be found on the Department of Energy website.

And it is on pace to grow plastic production by more than 50% by 2040 — twice the expected increase in waste management capacity over the same period.
The science is mounting on the potential harm from microplastics and the thousands of chemicals that are used in plastic production.
However, there is a path to a healthier and cleaner future — a path that transforms the plastic system.
Putting an end to plastic pollution is a logical choice for our environment, for our health and for our economies.","Within 15 years, a garbage truck’s worth of plastic could be entering our environment every second. Not every minute. Every second. Plastic is everywhere in modern life and has essential, lifesaving uses, but the proliferation of plastic has also made it one of the great environmental challenges of our time. Plastic pollutes our land, air and water; costs governments billions each year to manage; and is putting human health at increasing risk.

On the current trajectory, the consequences of plastic pollution are far worse than we understood even five years ago. The latest findings by the Pew Charitable Trusts are sobering, but they also chart a clear path forward using solutions that already exist.

The world already creates more plastic than can be effectively managed. And it is on pace to grow plastic production by more than 50% by 2040 — twice the expected increase in waste management capacity over the same period. This means that despite more than $32 billion in additional investment in waste management capacity, plastic production will continue to grow faster than the infrastructure being built to manage it.

And these costs come not just in dollars and cents but also through various health threats linked to plastics — including cancer, heart disease, asthma, decreased fertility and developmental issues. Microplastics have been found throughout people’s bodies, including in placentas alongside fetuses.

The science is mounting on the potential harm from microplastics and the thousands of chemicals that are used in plastic production. Currently, 6 million years of healthy life is being lost each year due to illness, disability or premature death associated with plastic production and waste. These health risks stem primarily from air pollution caused by production facilities or the burning of plastic waste in places that lack the capacity to properly manage it. By 2040, nearly 10 million years of healthy life will be lost per year — and that’s before accounting for any health impacts from the use of plastic products.

However, there is a path to a healthier and cleaner future — a path that transforms the plastic system. With the solutions available today, plastic pollution can be cut by 83% by 2040 and almost eliminated from one of its leading causes: packaging. To that end, governments and companies need to deploy solutions throughout the global plastic system. These solutions’ effectiveness depends on transforming the plastic system by reducing production, improving product and system design, enhancing waste management, and increasing the transparency of the supply chain and its impacts.

This path will require unprecedented collaboration among policymakers, businesses, innovators and communities, and the benefits will be immense. If we commit to this collaboration, in the next 15 years, health impacts will be halved, governments will save billions annually on waste management, and new business opportunities and millions of new jobs — with better pay and better working conditions — will be created as the landscape of jobs shifts from plastic production to collection, recycling and reuse and the creation of substitute materials.

The urgency is real. If we delay action another five years, even more plastic will end up in our air, land and water. This delay would result in billions more being invested in “linear economy” infrastructure — in which products are made, used and thrown away. Instead, those investments could go toward building a “circular economy” — in which materials are reused, recycled or repurposed, keeping them in use for as long as possible and reducing waste.

It’s time for New York to pass a Carbon Free and Healthy Schools Bond Act and give every student, from kindergarten through college, a safe, modern and sustainable place to learn.","Many school and university buildings are too old for the energy transition. A Carbon Free and Healthy Schools Bond Act would help districts make upgrades.

New York’s students walk into school buildings every morning with big dreams. But too many of those buildings across every region of the state are simply not built for the realities of today — or the climate of tomorrow.

If we’re serious about student health, academic success and meeting New York’s clean-energy goals, we need a statewide investment that matches the scope of the challenge. A Carbon Free and Healthy Schools Bond Act is that investment.

According to state facilities data, the average school building in New York was already over 50 years old as of 2005. Many were constructed in the 1950s through the 1970s, long before modern ventilation standards, reliable cooling or energy-efficient design. National data tells a similar story: The average U.S. instructional school building is now 49 years old, with 38% built before 1970.

When buildings are this old, they weren’t designed for the electrical loads needed for solar power, clean-energy systems or modern filtration. We are asking mid-20th-century facilities to meet 21st-century climate and learning demands. It will not work without major capital investment.

Clean air, stable temperatures and reliable heating and cooling are not luxuries; they are basic conditions for learning. A Carbon Free and Healthy Schools Bond Act would allow districts to make the kinds of long-term energy and health upgrades students and educators desperately need: modern ventilation, healthier air, updated heating and cooling, new electrical systems, solar power installations and the infrastructure required for electric school buses.

Solar is especially powerful. Schools are among the most effective sites in New York for solar energy generation, dramatically reducing operating costs and freeing up local funds for classrooms and student support.

Our public colleges face the same pressures. SUNY’s 2,800 buildings carry a deferred maintenance backlog of roughly $10 billion that is growing by $600 million to $700 million each year. A bond act that includes SUNY and CUNY recognizes that climate leadership and educational excellence are inseparable, and that New York’s higher education system cannot prepare the workforce of tomorrow in buildings built for the last century.

School districts and colleges want to modernize their buildings, cut energy use, and install solar; they just cannot shoulder these costs alone. Many lack access to the engineering, planning and technical support needed for comprehensive decarbonization plans. A Carbon Free and Healthy Schools Bond Act would provide grants, capital funding, technical assistance and expert advisers to help districts and campuses, ensuring that high-need and rural communities benefit just as much as wealthier ones.

And every clean-energy upgrade, solar installation, and bus-charging project is a jobs project. A bond act can ensure that the transition to carbon-free schools and campuses strengthens apprenticeship pathways, supports local economies and creates thousands of good union jobs across the state.

Funding for the transition to electric school buses is equally urgent. New York’s mandate for 100% zero-emission buses by 2035 was an ambitious move, but the upfront costs are enormous. A bond act would help districts purchase buses, build charging infrastructure, integrate solar-powered depots and reduce long-term transportation costs. This is about climate — but it is also about the air children breathe every morning and afternoon at the curb in front of their school.

A Carbon Free and Healthy Schools Bond Act is more than a climate measure. It is an education reform, a public-health strategy, an equity commitment and a statewide jobs program. Our students deserve schools and colleges built for their future. It’s time for New York to pass a Carbon Free and Healthy Schools Bond Act and give every student, from kindergarten through college, a safe, modern and sustainable place to learn.",https://www.nysut.org/-/media/images/nysut/news/2025/december/news_120425_cleanenergy.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 13:04:47.317419

A large landfill in a small Ohio town

Tina and Bill Higgins have lived among forested Appalachian hills in the tiny village of Amsterdam in eastern Ohio for nearly 25 years. As they waited for their dinner at Grammy’s Kitchen, Bill said that a few years after they moved in, the Apex Sanitary Landfill was built about a mile from their house.

“There’s times you just couldn’t even go out in the summertime to enjoy a cookout or anything because the smell was bad,” he said.

They joined a class action lawsuit over the smell.

When a new company, Interstate Waste Services (IWS), bought the landfill in 2020, the Higginses said the smell improved.

But the landfill continued to get bigger. This year, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency increased the amount of waste it’s allowed to receive, to double what it was a decade ago.

What’s arriving there, along with everyday trash: oil and gas drilling waste.

Between 2014 and 2022, the Amsterdam landfill accepted over 3 million tons of solid waste from the oil and gas industry, according to state records.

During that time, a total of more than 7.3 million tons were sent to eight landfills in Ohio. That waste can include the ground rock and soil, called drill cuttings, that come to the surface after a well is drilled deep into the ground. It could also have things like filter socks, sludges from the bottom of tanks, and buildup from inside pipes.

“We don’t know…,” Tina Higgins said. “Yeah, we didn’t even know about that,” Bill Higgins finished her sentence.

(Lack of) tracking of solid drilling waste

Folks here can be forgiven for not knowing the local landfill was taking frack waste. Ohio regulators aren’t tracking it anymore, either.

“Since 2023, facilities are no longer required to report shale drilling waste separately in their annual reports,” said Ohio EPA spokesperson Max Moore in an email, though “some still opt to do so.”

Moore said this reporting requirement, which started with the shale boom, was discontinued because “the data was not consistent.”

Landfills also are not required to track the origin of shale drilling waste they receive; it could be from a well pad in Ohio, Pennsylvania or elsewhere.

“This is the perpetual problem; we don’t know,” said Melissa Troutman, who wrote an analysis of Pennsylvania’s oil and gas waste policy for the non-profit group Earthworks in 2019.

In Pennsylvania, the Department of Environmental Protection requires drillers to report where they are sending their waste.

For example, Pennsylvania drillers reported sending more than 107,000 tons of oil and gas waste to the IWS landfill in Amsterdam last year, according to an analysis of DEP records by Inside Climate News. Overall, more than 130,000 tons of Pennsylvania drilling waste went to landfills in Ohio last year.

But even in Pennsylvania, it’s hard to tell where much of it is being sent, “because regulatory agencies are not tracking shale gas waste going to landfills adequately,” Troutman said.

And that worries environmental advocates.

According to the U.S. EPA, solid waste from shale formations, like the Marcellus and Utica regions of Pennsylvania and Ohio, can contain salts, heavy metals like cadmium, volatile organic compounds such as cancer-causing benzene and radioactive materials like radium.

But the U.S. EPA doesn’t regulate it as “hazardous” waste.

As early as the 1970s, the oil and gas industry lobbied for an exemption from federal hazardous waste regulations to avoid higher disposal costs. In 1980, Congress included a temporary exemption in a federal solid waste law, and in 1988, the EPA determined that designating the waste as hazardous was not warranted, a finding it repeated in 2019.

So, there’s a patchwork of state regulations when it comes to tracking and monitoring it.

In Pennsylvania, trucks carrying waste, including from the oil and gas industry, are monitored for radioactivity before entering landfills.

In Ohio, some drilling waste, such as filter socks, sludges and scale from pipes, is required to be tested for radioactivity before it can be sent to a landfill. These are considered TENORM in Ohio – waste that is “technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material.”

Tests must show radium-226 and radium-228 concentrations at less than 5 picocuries per gram above natural background levels.

Ohio exempts much solid oil and gas waste from radiological testing

But drill cuttings, which make up much of the solid waste from fracking, are not defined as TENORM in Ohio.

“Drill cuttings are considered naturally occurring radioactive material (not TENORM) and do not require radium testing for disposal in Ohio’s solid waste landfills,” said Ohio EPA spokesperson Bryant Somerville in an email.

Earthjustice attorney Megan Hunter, who has researched oil and gas waste regulations in numerous states, doesn’t think drill cuttings should be exempt from those tests, because it’s all radiation going into the landfill.

“I don’t see the distinction as particularly relevant in terms of when you’re talking about human health and risks to the environment,” she said.

How waste moves from the landfills to the waterways

One of those risks is contamination of waterways.

When it rains on a landfill, like the one in Amsterdam, water runs through all the household trash, construction debris and drilling waste.

“It’s sitting there like a tea bag, and every time it rains and things soak through, it creates this product called leachate because things are leaching,” and picking up pollutants, explained Duquesne University professor John Stolz, who has been studying the issue.

Ohio landfills collect leachate, which must be treated before being discharged into waterways.

Stolz looked over the latest leachate testing report for the Amsterdam landfill. He said if the state wants to monitor for contamination from drilling waste, landfills should measure for radium and other indicators of oil and gas waste.

“They should be measuring lithium, they should be measuring bromide and strontium,” Stolz said. If test results showed elevated levels, it would indicate that oil and gas waste was contaminating the leachate. “Why [else] would there be strontium in the leachate for a sanitary landfill? I mean, there’s not a lot of strontium in dirty diapers,” he said.

IWS said in an email that its Amsterdam landfill adheres to state regulations along with its “Waste Acceptance Plan.”

In Ohio, most leachate is sent to municipal sewage plants for treatment. IWS sends much of its leachate more than an hour’s drive north to the city of Alliance’s sewage treatment plant.

In an email, the plant operator said its biological organisms used for treatment have been consuming pollutants from Amsterdam and other landfills for decades. Last year, the sewage plant treated more than 60 million gallons of leachate from four landfills that accept oil and gas waste, according to the landfills’ annual reports.

But the sewage plant is not testing for radioactivity; it’s not required in the permit that allows it to discharge treated wastewater into a creek of the Mahoning River, a tributary of the Ohio River.

Stolz is concerned that regulators aren’t tracking or testing much of the drilling waste anywhere in the process.

“Neither the landfill or the waste treatment plant have to monitor things that we feel are important to monitor,” Stolz said. “Because they are going to be a problem downstream, literally and figuratively, over time.”

He points to one sewage plant near Pittsburgh where leachate loaded with frack waste pollutants was blamed for knocking out the treatment process. It ended up sending contaminated wastewater into the Monongahela River.

Stolz’s biggest concern is that radiation will wind up in the waterways.

A study by his team and researchers at the University of Pittsburgh backs this up. They found radioactivity in river sediments downstream of numerous sewage plants that treat leachate from landfills that accept frack waste.

“We did find a statistically significant higher amount of radioactivity downstream than upstream,” Stolz said, “and water chemistries that suggested or were indicative of discharge from oil and gas.”

A call for consistency in state regulations

This kind of evidence has prompted environmental groups and radiation safety experts to call for consistent regulation of oil and gas waste.

“It varies largely from state to state,” said William Kennedy, scientific vice president with the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements. He’s written about this issue and points out one potential problem when neighboring states have differing rules, such as when Pennsylvania requires that drill cuttings be tested for radioactivity before being landfilled, while Ohio does not.

“If you had a producer…and they found a particular regulation in one state onerous or difficult to comply with, what would keep them from shipping it to another state for disposal under a different set of regulations?” he asked.

Kennedy said he and his co-authors wanted to start a dialogue among state regulators to move past the current piecemeal approach.

“So people could think through this entire problem and come up with a regulatory scheme that made sense, that would be sort of universal, that the states could adopt,” he said.

Amy Mall, who authored a report on inconsistencies in state regulations for the Natural Resources Defense Council, wants federal rules for the disposal of frack waste, such as drill cuttings, so the government can require it to be tracked and tested.

“And if they’re not regulated, they’re exempt from regulations – they’re not doing any of those things,” Mall said. “And so the public doesn’t know where this waste is going or how dangerous it is.”

A new effort in Washington seeks to change that. Congressional Democrats introduced a series of bills in the House to regulate frack waste, including one called “Closing Loopholes and Ending Arbitrary and Needless Evasion of Regulations Act of 2025.’’ It includes a long-shot bid to define the waste as hazardous. So far, only one lawmaker from Pennsylvania and one from Ohio have signed on.

The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency this week signed off on a cleanup plan for the old U.S. Steel South Works at 8080 S. DuSable Lake Shore Drive. Developers Related Midwest and CRG are pursuing updated approvals that would clear the site as safe for redevelopment.

The Quantum Shore project will include the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park, a replacement for Advocate Trinity Hospital, single-family housing and improved access to South Chicago’s lakefront parks, officials have said. The development broke ground Sept. 30.

The site was remediated under U.S. Steel’s ownership, and it has received “no further remediation” letters in the decades since the South Works’ closure. Illinois environmental regulators issue such letters to confirm site conditions “do not present a significant risk to human health or the environment.”

Most of the property needs no further remediation, as the state previously determined, developers said last month. However, recent soil and water testing found pollutants like petroleum, heavy metals and man-made chemicals from the steel mill’s operations.

State regulators on Monday approved a plan to clean up those pollutants, which was drafted for the developers by Little Village-based Pioneer Engineering and Environmental Services.

With the conditional approval in hand, and with no further approvals needed, remediation and construction work will begin this month, the developers said.

“Leveraging our decades of experience with complex environmental projects, we remain committed to meeting all reporting requirements and regulatory standards … to address legacy contamination and to ensure the protection of human health and the environment,” Related Midwest spokesperson Matt Baker said in a statement.

A major aspect of the remediation plan would enclose contaminants within a massive barrier system. A horizontal barrier of asphalt, concrete or clean soil would cover the entire Quantum Shore site, while nearly 2 miles of “slurry walls” would prevent pollution from leaking into Lake Michigan or the Calumet River, according to the plan.

The state’s approval requires the developers to meet a series of conditions as they carry out the plan and work toward updated “no further remediation” letters. The conditions include:

Monitoring the slurry wall system’s effectiveness for at least 30 years.

Remediating groundwater near a well which showed elevated levels of vinyl chloride.

Addressing an additional soil sample which was determined to be hazardous and corrosive.

Either developing systems to mitigate the risk of vapor inhalation, or performing additional testing to determine such systems are not needed, once the specific locations of buildings on the premises are finalized.

The full report and remediation plan is available through the agency’s website.

While most of the property needs no further remediation, as the state previously determined, about 6.5 percent of the site is polluted beyond modern cleanup standards, the developers said last month.

Residents remain concerned about unearthing slag, contaminated soil and other byproducts of the steelmaking process during construction. Neighbors have also sounded the alarm about the possible effects of transporting pollution from the site during its cleanup, like heavy truck traffic and escaped dust.

Dive Brief:

The U.S. solicitor general on Monday urged the U.S. Supreme Court to deny Duke Energy’s appeal challenging a lower court’s ruling in an antitrust lawsuit brought by independent power producer NTE Energy.

In August 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit properly ruled that NTE Carolina’s antitrust suit against Duke could move ahead after it was dismissed by a lower court, according to U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer.

“This appeal arises out of a campaign by an established monopolist to stop a more efficient rival from disturbing its long-dominant hold over a regional energy market,” Sauer said. “Without ever competing with [NTE] on the merits (i.e., offering a better service), [Duke] was able to prevent [NTE] from operating its superior [generating] facility.”

Dive Insight:

In the last decade or so, the Department of Justice and private plaintiffs have been reluctant to use antitrust laws to challenge utilities, but that could change based on Sauer’s brief, according to Joshua Macey, a Yale Law School associate professor.

“At the very least, this suggests that the Trump Solicitor General’s Office thinks that antitrust should be a viable tool in electricity markets, and it may indicate that the administration is concerned with anticompetitive conduct,” Macey said in an interview Thursday.

The solicitor general’s stance in the brief makes it less likely the Supreme Court will take up Duke’s appeal, according to Macey.

The action at the Supreme Court centers on a long-running dispute between Duke’s vertically-integrated North Carolina subsidiary and NTE that led to anticompetitive claims by the power producer against the utility company.

Duke Energy Carolinas in November 2017 entered into a large generator interconnection agreement with NTE Carolinas II, which planned to build a combined-cycle gas-fired power plant in Reidsville, N.C.

Two years later, Duke Energy Carolinas sued NTE for breach of contract, alleging that the independent power producer failed to make payments required under the interconnection agreement. In June 2022, a district court dismissed NTE’s claims that Duke Energy Carolinas engaged in illegal, anticompetitive behavior.

However, the Fourth Circuit appeals court reversed the district court’s decision, finding that Duke took various steps that in combination could be considered anticompetitive, according to Sauer.

“When a monopolist engages in a coordinated campaign to squelch competition, no circuit holds that each discrete aspect of the defendant’s conduct must be analyzed in isolation,” Sauer said. “Instead, courts uniformly agree, consistent with this Court’s precedent, that a holistic analysis is appropriate in circumstances like these.”

In its petition asking the Supreme Court to review the appeals court’s decision, Duke said each action it took in relation to the planned NTE power plant was legal.

The appeals court embraced a “monopoly broth” theory that a set of legal actions can be deemed anticompetitive, according to Duke.

“If an antitrust plaintiff pleads a series of independently lawful acts, each of which does not violate this Court’s precedents, those acts cannot together add up to some nebulous antitrust violation,” Duke said in its petition.

NTE’s plans to build its power plant hinged on landing an offtake agreement with the city of Fayetteville, N.C., according to court documents. Duke undercut that option by restructuring Fayetteville’s supply contract with the utility — which had produced $100 million in annual revenue for Duke — to give it a short-term discount and lump-sum payment, Sauer said.

Duke also agreed to quadruple the price it paid for excess power from a Fayetteville power plant — a price increase worth $283 million, according to Sauer.

In total, Duke gave Fayetteville a $325 million incentive, which it intended to recoup through future price increases on Fayetteville and other customers, he said.

At the same time, Duke sought to “hobble and discredit” NTE, in part by sending two notices of default on NTE’s interconnection agreement and falsely claiming that NTE failed to pay its invoices, Sauer said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/8gYmeq4gKkxP2qNRbWaARkqCDyGBoWjHqnxCVeO_Sag/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Bc2hldmlsbGVfQ29tYmluZWRfQ3ljbGVfU3RhdGlvbl9FeHRlcmlvcl8xX2RxSk92V1ouanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-04 13:06:01.619812

What’s the news?

Data analysis by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) found that Romania’s state-owned lignite plants have reported unusually low CO₂ emissions over the past eight years.

The potential underreporting could have saved Oltenia, the company that owns and operates the plants, over 250 million euros in EU carbon taxes.

Oltenia blames its low emissions figures on Romania’s poor-quality lignite. Experts told OCCRP that this is unlikely and that low-quality lignite would likely result in higher, not lower, emissions to produce the same amount of electricity.

The company’s emissions reports are based on data analysed in a laboratory owned by the firm, raising questions about the information’s credibility and potential conflicts of interest.

Why does it matter?

Romania had agreed with the EU to phase out lignite burning in favour of gas and renewables, and received hundreds of millions of euros in EU subsidies to do so. But Romanian politicians say this is unlikely to happen any time soon.

The findings raise further questions about transparency of such funding from Brussels and the efficiency of the EU carbon trading emissions system (ETS).

Lignite, the fuel burned in Oltenia’s plants, is estimated to cause over a billion euros in health and environmental costs affecting Romania and beyond.

How was this investigated?

OCCRP reverse engineered publicly available data submitted to the EU, analysed independent reports, and conducted its own emissions and carbon trading calculations.

They presented their methodology and results to coal combustion experts and carbon policy analysts, who said the analysis was robust, and that Oltenia’s emissions appeared suspiciously low.

When pulmonologist Maria Brăcaci Gâjiu’s family visits her home in southwest Romania in the summer, they like to dine outside in the gazebo – if the air quality allows it.

“We pray: ‘Lord don’t let the wind blow,’ because if it does, we can’t eat – ash settles everywhere, that’s how thick it gets,” she said.

Brăcaci Gâjiu lives just a few kilometres from Romania’s huge Turceni coal plant.

It belongs to the state-owned Complexul Energetic Oltenia, which generates a fifth of the country’s electricity by burning almost exclusively lignite, the dirtiest type of coal.

This type of fuel is associated with higher rates of premature death, childhood asthma, and neurodevelopmental issues, as well as the degradation of local water resources.

Like all EU coal operators, Oltenia must buy emissions allowances for each tonne of CO₂ it emits under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), a cap-and-trade scheme designed to make CO₂ expensive enough to force the switch to cleaner energy.

But an analysis by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) found that Oltenia has reported emissions so improbably low that its plants suddenly appeared to be among the most efficient in Europe.

This happened as the cost of EU carbon allowances increased, suggesting that the company may have understated its emissions to avoid having to pay more under the system.

Conservative estimates by OCCRP put the company’s savings at more than 250 million euros over eight years – money that should have gone toward funding the green transition.

In response, Oltenia said OCCRP’s calculations “may contain an error” but admitted that its reported emission factors have fallen over the past seven years. It blamed Romania’s low-quality lignite, which it claimed burns inefficiently and releases less CO₂.

Multiple experts rejected this explanation: poor-quality lignite should produce higher, not lower, emissions per unit of electricity, because more fuel must be burned to generate the same power.

“From my desk in Berlin, I don’t believe these figures,” said Hauke Hermann, an energy expert and senior scientist at the Öko-Institut in Germany.

“I’d recommend having an independent lab to check them, and I’m 99 per cent sure that they would find an under-estimation.”

Who verifies the verifier?

While potentially saving 250 million euros in avoided carbon costs, debt-laden Oltenia has also received hundreds of millions of euros in EU aid to ditch coal for gas and renewables.

However, in September, Romanian Energy Minister Bogdan Ivan admitted the country cannot close its coal plants by the end of the year as originally agreed with Brussels, meaning Oltenia will keep burning and polluting.

Sam Van den Plas, policy director at the non-profit Carbon Market Watch, said the findings raise questions about the validity of Oltenia’s emissions reports and a “potential lack of checks” in the ETS.

“The Emissions Trading System has integrity loopholes at its core”

Any underreporting would not only have saved Oltenia funds, but would have also undermined the system more broadly as it would have led to “unfair competition for other power plants” in the bloc, he said.

Yet checks and balances – such as independent verification of emissions reports before they are submitted to the EU – are also not up to par in the case of Oltenia.

OCCRP found that the company owns the labs that produce and run the data, making it impossible for outsiders to assess.

“The ultimate question here is: ‘Who verifies the verifier?’,” said Van den Plas.

He urged the European Commission to “take note” and “propose improvements” to the legislation governing the cap-and-trade system.

The EU Files

What is transpiring within the European Union? What are the goals and aspirations of the EU, and how is the budget allocated?

Brice Böhmer, Transparency International’s climate and environment lead, said Oltenia’s ownership of its lab represents a potential conflict of interest that highlights how “the whole ETS system has integrity loopholes at its core”.

A Commission spokesperson said that while EU law permits power plants to use their own laboratories to analyse emissions, ETS regulations “strongly prefer the use of external, accredited laboratories,” especially for higher emitters like Oltenia.

When queried, Oltenia said that Romanian authorities did not consider its use of its own lab to be a conflict of interest.

Figures that don’t add up

Power plants calculate their annual CO₂ emissions using an emission factor that reflects the amount of greenhouse gas emitted per unit of energy in the fuel.

Smaller plants use national averages or “default values”, provided by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Large operations such as Oltenia calculate their own figures.

Although Oltenia’s raw data is not public, OCCRP estimated its implied emission factors by reverse engineering the company’s publicly reported annual data.

The result revealed the firm’s implied emission factors are far below the averages of similar plants in other EU countries, and even as much as 18 per cent below the IPCC’s “default values” for lignite.

This suggests Oltenia’s plants were unusually low emitters of CO₂, allowing them to purchase fewer ETS allowances for their annual output.

“Justifying low emissions through poor coal quality is questionable, because low-grade lignite should normally produce more emissions per unit of energy produced, not less,” said Mihai Constantin, a senior researcher at Energy Policy Group (EPG), a non-profit think tank focused on energy and climate policy in Romania.

Shedding even more doubt on Oltenia’s claims, research by Euracoal, an umbrella organisation for Europe’s coal industry, shows that there have been no changes in the composition of Romanian lignite between 2015 and 2022.

In other words, it’s still a more inefficient and polluting fuel than other types of coal.

Experts also questioned another possible explanation offered by Oltenia for its low emissions in recent years: the claim that its boilers leave much of the carbon unburned.

Such poor combustion, they said, would be wildly inefficient and would require burning more coal – and therefore producing more emissions – to generate the same electricity.

While Oltenia’s power output has declined in recent years, that’s because it burns less fuel overall; crucially, the electricity it produces per unit of lignite energy has remained roughly the same.

“It is not conceivable that more than 10 per cent of the carbon contained in the fuel leaves the fuel stack unburned,” said Hermann of the Öko-Institut.

“This cannot be in line with air pollution control, and it is also implausible that this high share of the lignite is not used to produce electricity but is simply vented.”

What goes up should go down

Oltenia has not always reported such low emissions data.

An independent study published by Babeș-Bolyai University found that in 2010, the company’s emission factors were much higher and aligned with those of other countries, when EU carbon allowances were only 14 euros per tonne.

OCCRP estimates show that between 2016 and 2023, implied emissions factors at Oltenia’s Rovinari and Turceni plants dropped 15 per cent – just as carbon allowance prices skyrocketed to nearly 90 euros per tonne.

If Oltenia had used the lowest default emission factor provided by the IPCC over the past eight years, it would have had to pay at least 250 million euros more in carbon taxes, OCCRP estimated, plus a possible 100 euro-per-tonne fine for every unreported tonne.

Van den Plas said any savings from lower carbon credit costs would have left Oltenia under“less pressure from the ETS carbon price signal to move away from burning dirty fossil fuels,” thereby undermining the effectiveness of the EU’s climate policy.

OCCRP’s findings are not the first time concerns have been raised.

Romania’s lignite sector – 99 per cent controlled by Oltenia – has long reported suspiciously low emissions.

In 2016, 2018, and 2022, U.N. observers asked for explanations of its low national lignite emission factors, which closely match the figures estimated by OCCRP.

In response to the U.N. observers, Romania cited poor-quality fuel, inefficient burning, and outdated equipment.

The experts involved in overseeing the U.N. reports, which labelled the issue as “resolved” after receiving a response, told OCCRP they were not authorised to comment.

Passing the buck

OCCRP could not identify a specific regulatory body responsible for further scrutiny of ETS data, or for following up on questionable submissions.

The European Commission spokesperson said it’s up to national authorities to “investigate and, if necessary, impose corrective measures or penalties” in cases of misreporting.

Yet Romania’s National Environmental Protection Agency (ANPM), which collects data from operators and produces annual emissions reports, said it’s not responsible for checking the data submitted by individual companies, which has already been privately reviewed.

The agency also refused to share Oltenia’s figures, as it would entail “a lot of work both physically and mentally,” and would require the operators’ permission.

It did not respond to specific questions about Oltenia’s reports.

When reached for comment, the independent verifier that has been checking Oltenia’s annual emissions reports since 2018 said it “analyses the accuracy and completeness” of submissions, including checking for the “correct application of emission factors”.

It does not, however, “have the capacity to perform laboratory analyses” or “request other laboratory analyses in addition to those provided”.

Oltenia said the ANPM did not carry out any inspections at its plants “because there were no grounds to do so”.

‘Total indifference’

While apparently paying far less than it should for its emissions, the Romanian government keeps delaying the coal phase-out. It’s previously warned that plant closures could lead to energy poverty or blackouts, particularly during winter.

But Corina Murafa, a former energy expert for the World Bank, called the failure to move away from coal a “political decision” and shed light on possible motivations.

“The problem is [the subsidies] are being granted during the implementation period of this restructuring plan [for transitioning away from coal] ... With this restructuring plan constantly being extended and renegotiated, theoretically, they’re also seeking to extend the subsidies,” she said.

Romania’s government says that moving to alternative energy sources is expensive, the healthcare costs of dirty air are also high.

Between 2012 and 2021, air pollution from power plants and industry cost the EU more than 2.7 trillion euros in health, environmental and infrastructure damage, according to the European Environment Agency (EEA).

In 2021 alone, Oltenia’s plants generated over 1.4 billion euros of that harm, according to OCCRP’s analysis of data compiled by the EEA.

Gheorghe Sanda, head of Romania’s national environmental guard in Gorj county – where two Oltenia plants are based – said that in the past decade, those facilites have been fined more than 30 times for exceeding air pollution limits and for illegal waste disposal.

“We can’t demand perfectly clean air – but we do expect demonstrable efforts to show us they are doing everything within their power to address the problem,” said Sanda.

Oltenia said it had implemented measures demanded by the national environmental guard in a timely fashion.

But Brăcaci Gâjiu, the pulmonologist, fears for her community’s health and is not impressed by the authorities’ response.

“I can tell you, I’m deeply disturbed by their indifference,” she said. “Total indifference.”",https://www.ftm.eu/uploads/media_filter/692ef8a3594ac/article_1400_nocrop/DJI_0630_square_1.jpg?v=4,N,,2025-12-05 06:00:52.632326

“Coal fired power plants nearly destroyed the Adirondack Park’s forests, lakes and ponds with acid rain,” said Adirondack Council Clean Air Specialist and Director of Communications John F.

Judge Penelope Richard of the 38th Judicial District Court, which includes Cameron Parish, suspended Commonwealth LNG’s permit last month in response to a lawsuit from the Sierra Club. She ruled the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy hadn’t considered the effects of climate change, the high density of gas export facilities already in the area and the disproportionate impact of pollution on nearby communities when it approved the permit.

The state agency then issued updated reasons Nov. 18 for approving Commonwealth’s permit, allowing the project to move forward. Officials again determined the proposed benefits of the project “outweigh the costs” of its environmental impact on Southwest Louisiana’s coast and communities.

“Economic benefit outweighing all of these things is frustrating to me,” said John Allaire, a Cameron Parish resident who lives within 30 miles of three existing LNG export facilities and six more planned or under construction. “The economic benefits of their facility outweigh flooding me out, outweigh the commercial fishing industry, outweigh the eastern black rail, outweigh protecting our cheniers … I don’t agree with that. How much is enough?”

The Department of Conservation and Energy’s new permit approval was based on an “independent analysis” of documents from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Those agencies considered the effects of climate change, environmental justice concerns and the cumulative impacts of multiple LNG facilities within a small area. All reached the same conclusion that the project’s benefits overshadow its costs.

Environmental groups staunchly disagree with the decision to reissue the permit.

The Sierra Club said in a statement through its managing attorney, Eric Huber, that the permit was approved “without any notice to the plaintiffs or the public,” who he said learned about it through the news reports. Turtle Island Restoration Network and Louisiana Bucket Brigade, also plaintiffs in the lawsuit, declined to comment.

Sierra Club attorneys are reviewing the latest permit approval to decide whether they will take further legal action. By reissuing the permit, the state Department of Conservation and Energy “continues to neglect its responsibility to protect the public health and welfare of all Louisianans,” their statement said.

In its new reasons for approving the permit, Conservation and Energy officials determined it was in the “best interest of the state” not to delay in reassessing the permit as reason for their speedy decision. This is, in part, related to the Trump administration’s “energy dominance” agenda, which calls for further expansion of industries like liquified natural gas.

The agency also justified its use of these external documents rather than doing its own research by citing the federal government’s decision to abandon its environmental justice analysis tools, following an executive order from President Donald Trump the day after he took office in January.

Benefits cited in the state’s permit approval include job creation. Commonwealth estimates it will employ an average of 800 construction workers per month, with a peak of 2,000, over the three-year period. Half of all these construction employees are expected to come from Cameron and Calcasieu parishes, according to the document.

The permit approval explanation did list downsides to the project, including the destruction of around 90 acres of coastal wetlands in Cameron Parish. State officials accounted for this, saying “these wetland impacts would be mitigated and would not have a significant cumulative impact on environmental justice communities.”

Community advocates like James Hiatt, director of nonprofit For a Better Bayou, question whether the state is acting in the best interests of its residents.

“The job is not to expedite permits and do whatever corporations want. Their job is to protect national resources, the public good, the public interest,” Hiatt said, citing ongoing issues in Cameron Parish with rapidly eroding coastal land and disproportionately high pollution levels in communities closest to the LNG export sites.

The Commonwealth LNG facility will be built 750 feet away from Allaire’s property line, he said, adding that he feels Cameron Parish won’t see enough of the economic benefit from these facilities to make up for all of the drawbacks.

“They keep saying, ‘Well, it’ll be mitigated by economic benefit to the community,’” he said. “But come on down here and see where the economic benefit to the community is. It’s not here.”",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/12/43.-LNG-tanker-Cameron-Parish-2048x1365-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 13:06:16.768059

In previous PERTE funding rounds, Spain has already disbursed over €3 billion, attracting numerous major projects.","Spain is restructuring its EV incentives around three pillars and redefining responsibilities in the process. Central to this shift is the ‘Plan Auto+’ programme, which will allocate €400 million in direct subsidies to consumers in 2026, aimed at reducing car prices. These grants will be managed by the central government, unlike the Moves III incentive scheme, which expires at the end of 2025 and was administered by the autonomous regions. ‘Plan Auto+’ will replace the Moves programme at the turn of the year.

The new 2030 plan also includes a programme called ‘Moves Corredores’, with a budget of €300 million dedicated to installing charging stations. An additional €580 million will be allocated in 2026 to the existing PERTE eMobility incentive programme, which supports projects in electric vehicle and battery production. The latter is classified as industrial subsidies.

‘Cars built here, affordable for Spaniards”

Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has emphasised that the ‘España Auto 2030’ plan is the result of a public-private partnership, supporting both supply and demand. It introduces ‘significantly more business-friendly regulations for the sector,’ accompanied by incentives to boost production and sales. During the roadmap’s presentation, Sánchez stated: “We are here today so that Spain can produce electric cars that are as competitive as our capabilities allow—and affordable for Spaniards.” He added: “The electrification of the automobile is here to stay. The goal is for everyone to benefit.”

Spain’s automotive industry contributes nearly 10% to the country’s GDP and supports almost two million direct and indirect jobs. This makes Spain the second-largest car manufacturer in Europe. However, in terms of electrification, the country has been relatively slow, as highlighted by the portal Forocoches Electricos: “Although the Moves III programme has enabled the purchase of 170,000 electric cars, with numbers set to double again in 2025, the starting point remains low. Two major obstacles persist: the limited number of charging stations and cumbersome bureaucracy, which hinders expansion.”

Previous incentive scheme had structural weaknesses

The Spanish government launched Moves III in 2021 and topped up by €400 million in December 2022, bringing its total budget to €1.2 billion. With further top-ups in 2024 (€1.55 billion) and 2025 (€400 million), the funds allocated to Moves III have grown to €1.735 billion over the years. However, the programme suffered from structural weaknesses, with some applicants waiting up to two years to receive their incentives. Disbursement was handled by the autonomous regions. The government had intended to reform the system last year but was delayed due to the country’s devastating floods.

The time for reform is finally here: Sánchez views the overhaul as a plan of national significance, aimed at ensuring ‘Spain has done its homework by the end of the decade.’ The measures are the result of closer collaboration and dialogue with the private sector. However, not all details have been finalised. For instance, it remains unclear whether the purchase grants will be paid directly at the dealership or through a central authority. No information has been provided about the amount of the grants either. Additionally, as Forocoches Electricos points out: “It is also unclear what will happen to the thousands of car owners who purchased vehicles under MOVES III but have yet to receive their funds.” These details will be clarified once the final guidelines are published.

Sánchez firmly commits to e-mobility

Madrid has made it clear that the cost of electric vehicles must decrease to make the transition to e-mobility truly attractive in Spain. “We want to produce electric cars in Spain that are affordable for our country’s middle and working classes—and ensure these groups are not excluded from the Green Deal,” Sánchez explained. Currently, purchasing an electric car represents a significant financial burden for many families. The government must thus act transparently and decisively to support this process. The Prime Minister reiterated: “Spain will not waver in its commitment to electric mobility.”

Economic interests also play a major role: Spain is the production hub for Volkswagen Group’s upcoming family of electric compact cars. Sánchez sees this as a significant opportunity for both industry and consumers: “Next year, we will see a range of electric models priced under €25,000. This is the path to the future, and the Spanish government aims to walk it together with industry.”

Proven distribution system after the floods

In 2026, the Auto+ plan will provide the aforementioned €400 million in direct purchase subsidies for electric vehicles. This annual budget aligns with previous Moves funding levels. However, by centralising programme administration, the government aims to ensure a faster and more uniform process. The goal is to ‘ensure that payments reach families when they need them,’ according to officials. The model is based on the ‘Reinicia Auto+’ plan, introduced to mitigate the impacts of the flood disaster, which, according to the government, helped ‘95% of applications from Valencia residents’ to be processed within a year of the tragedy.

The second pillar of Spain’s 2030 roadmap focuses on infrastructure. In 2026, a new programme called ‘Moves Corredores’ will launch with a budget of €300 million. It remains unclear whether this sum is intended solely for 2026 or beyond, as the duration of the programme has not been specified. The initiative will fund chargers in so-called ‘shadow zones’—road sections where necessary charging stations are still lacking, as the government has stated. Additionally, Madrid plans to ‘drastically reduce’ the licences and permits required for installing charging stations and will establish a centralised website for charging infrastructure. To date, the government has supported the expansion of charging infrastructure in Spain with a total of €600 million through various programmes (Moves III, Moves Fleets, and Moves Singulares).

Over half a billion euros in industry support

The third component of the government’s plan is another funding round under the PERTE programme—an industrial aid scheme aimed at boosting innovation and competitiveness in the e-mobility and battery sectors. An additional €580 million will be made available for 2026. “The focus is now on becoming a leader in battery manufacturing and recycling, and transforming the entire value chain: from design to large assembly plants, including SMEs that ensure component supply,” Sánchez told the industry. In previous PERTE funding rounds, Spain has already disbursed over €3 billion, attracting numerous major projects.

Sen. Christopher J. Ryan represents the 50th Senate District, which includes parts of Onondaga and Oswego counties.

When Gov. Kathy Hochul announced her directive for the New York Power Authority to develop a new, zero-emission advanced nuclear facility in Upstate New York, she issued a challenge worthy of this moment: Build the next generation of clean, reliable power right here at home.

Now, the question is: Where should it be built? The answer is clear: Oswego.

For decades, Oswego County has been the heart of New York’s nuclear energy industry. On the shores of Lake Ontario, the FitzPatrick and Nine Mile Point plants have quietly powered millions of homes with carbon-free energy. These aren’t just facilities — they are pillars of our community. They have supported families for generations, sustained small businesses and regional economic development, as well as created pathways to good-paying, union jobs.

At the center of that success is Constellation Energy, one of the nation’s leading nuclear operators. Constellation runs both Oswego plants and has set the standard for safety, innovation and reliability. Their commitment to union labor ensures that these jobs stay local, skilled and secure. When people talk about the best of American energy leadership, they’re often describing what’s already happening right here in Central New York.

That’s why this community is uniquely ready to host New York’s first advanced nuclear project. The infrastructure is in place. The transmission capacity exists. The workforce is trained, and just as importantly, the public understands and supports nuclear energy because they’ve lived with it safely for generations. There is no better example of how collaboration between industry, labor and community can deliver real results.

Advanced nuclear technology is essential to meeting New York’s ambitious clean energy goals. Wind and solar are critical, but to keep our grid stable and our economy growing, we also need zero-emission power that’s available around the clock. That’s what advanced nuclear provides and it’s what Oswego already does best.

Building this facility here would bring thousands of union construction jobs and hundreds of permanent, family-sustaining positions. It would expand opportunities for local schools, colleges and training programs, and it would strengthen the regional economy for decades to come. Just as importantly, it would reaffirm something Oswego has always known: that clean energy and good jobs go hand in hand.

This moment is about more than power generation — it’s about leadership. It’s about showing that Oswego can continue to lead the nation in clean energy innovation. With Constellation’s proven expertise, our unions’ unmatched skill, and the deep community pride that defines this region, Oswego isn’t just ready for the next era of nuclear energy — it’s built for it.

Gov. Hochul has made a call for the first new nuclear power in a generation, producing at least one gigawatt of clean energy to enhance grid reliability and meet state climate goals. Oswego is ready to answer that call and power New York’s next great energy chapter.",https://www.nysenate.gov/themes/custom/nysenate_theme/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-04 15:01:51.397066

Access to health care expanded, with 93 percent of the population covered by national health insurance in 2023.

Viet Nam achieved universal primary education in the early 2000s. In 2024, net enrollment reached 95 percent for lower-secondary and 80 percent for upper-secondary school. Viet Nam’s learning-adjusted years of schooling average 10.2 years—the second highest in ASEAN—and its human capital index is the highest among lower-middle-income countries.

By 2019, nearly all households in Viet Nam had electricity, up from just 14 percent in 1993. Rural access to clean water rose from 17 percent to 51 percent over the same period. Investments continue in sanitation, transport, and digital connectivity.

By 2045, Viet Nam aspires to become a high-income country while achieving inclusive and green growth. At the 27th Conference of Parties (COP27), held in 2022, it pledged to cut methane emissions by 30 percent and halt deforestation by 2030 and to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Looking ahead, Viet Nam faces rising challenges, including an aging population, global trade shifts, rapid automation, and climate risks. Strengthening institutions and improving policy implementation—especially in climate resilience, social protection, and digital transformation—will be key to sustaining progress and achieving the country’s long-term goals.

Here are five energy stocks that could see tremendous growth opportunities as these developments unfold on America's path to becoming the world's AI leader over the coming years.

1. Constellation Energy

One of America's largest clean energy producers, Constellation Energy (CEG +2.65%), has a capacity of over 32,400 megawatts. It powers approximately 20 million homes and businesses. It's also the country's largest nuclear power plant operator. The Genesis Mission announcement specifically referenced nuclear energy, which is clean and highly efficient, despite its tainted reputation from past incidents.

The Trump Administration has already supported Constellation Energy by supplying a $1 billion loan from the Department of Energy to restart its shuttered Three Mile Island reactor for a power purchase agreement with Microsoft. It will power the tech giant's data centers. It signals what could be the start of a revival for domestic nuclear energy generation.

2. NextEra Energy

An emphasis on U.S. energy independence bodes well for NextEra Energy (NEE 2.14%). It operates America's largest electric utility, Florida Power & Light. The company is also a global leader in renewable power generation and storage. It boasts a total capacity of 33,410 megawatts across nuclear, natural gas, wind, solar, and battery storage.

The company is investing $75 billion in infrastructure for power generation and transmission between now and 2028 to meet high demand as data centers continue to put pressure on the electric grid. NextEra Energy has already enjoyed decades of steady growth, evidenced by 30 consecutive annual dividend increases. An emphasis on domestic energy should help continue NextEra's success.

3. Dominion Energy

The proximity to the federal government, combined with the presence of deep-sea cables, makes Northern Virginia a hotspot for data centers. Dominion Energy (D 0.05%) is one of the country's largest producers of offshore wind and solar energy, and operates a utility business that delivers power throughout Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.

Dominion Energy is reportedly in contract talks with data center companies on agreements totaling 47,000 megawatts of power. All these opportunities will likely create an enormous project pipeline for growth as the company invests in expanding its capacity, and makes Dominion Energy a no-brainer as a winner in the domestic energy push moving forward.

4. EQT Corporation

Natural gas is cleaner than coal, making it a likely benefactor as domestic energy use rises. EQT Corporation (EQT 1.19%) is one of America's leading natural gas company. It primarily operates in the Marcellus Formation, a gas-rich region located in the Appalachian Basin. EQT Corporation's vertically integrated business spans exploration and midstream activities, helping keep its costs down.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, demand for U.S. natural gas production and output will set record highs. That trend will continue next year due to surging demand for exports. EQT Corporation targets a long-term break-even price (cash flow) for natural gas of just $2.00/MMBtu, positioning it as a cash cow as the American natural gas industry continues to thrive.

5. GE Vernova

Vice President & General Manager of 300mm fab in Singapore, GlobalFoundries

Every semiconductor chip begins its life in a fab. While chips are essential for powering today’s digital age and enabling advancements in AI, their production consumes significant amounts of energy and generates greenhouse gases (GHG) as a by-product.

As we work toward our Journey to Zero Carbon goals, GF remains committed to environmentally responsible manufacturing and operations, continually taking action to reduce and manage our greenhouse gas emissions.

With a mix of innovation, smart engineering and bold improvements, our teams seek to decarbonize semiconductor manufacturing to further reduce GF’s carbon footprint and deliver on our sustainability commitments to our customers.

We are currently scaling-up the full deployment of a central abatement system at our 300-mm fabrication plant in Singapore. Targeted for completion in the first quarter of 2026, this initiative is expected to significantly reduce emissions, enhance resource efficiency and optimize manufacturing processes.

Rethinking abatement

Unlike conventional point-of-use abatement systems that collect and treat exhaust gases from each wafer fabrication tool, multiple tools are connected to a single centralized abatement system that treats exhaust gases in bulk through a multi-stage process.

Here’s how it works:

First, exhaust gases pass through a pre-scrubber where water and an electrostatic precipitator remove acid gases and particles.

The gases are then heated and treated in a catalytic unit which breaks down fluorinated greenhouse gases into water-soluble by-products.

Finally, the by-products go through a post-scrubber for cleaning before being safely vented and the resulting wastewater is sent for further treatment.

Watch the video which illustrates how the system works.

Smarter, cleaner and greener

We achieved encouraging results from a successful pilot of the system, which together with other existing initiatives, has contributed to a substantial reduction in GF Singapore’s emissions.

Moreover, the central abatement system also uses 20% less space and has lower electricity consumption than if conventional point-of-use systems had been employed. It also enhances manufacturing efficiency by minimizing tool downtime and freeing up valuable fab space for production and support operations.

As we prepare to unlock the full potential of the system at the World Economic Forum Global Lighthouse Network-designated fab, our 200 mm and 300 mm facilities in Singapore are driving impactful initiatives aligned with GF’s decarbonization roadmap.

These include replacing traditional chamber-cleaning processes with cleaner, more efficient methods – achieving a 97% reduction in carbon emissions from the upgraded processes at the 200 mm fab. We use electric heat pumps instead of fossil-fuel combustion boilers in our manufacturing operations.

Looking ahead, GF Singapore plans to leverage renewable energy from Singapore’s first hydrogen-ready, energy-efficient power plant when it becomes operational.

Shaping what’s essential sustainably

Our goal is clear: to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. We are accelerating our global GHG-reduction goals, aiming for a 42% cut from 2021 levels by 2030, in alignment with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

Across GF’s operations in the U.S., Germany and Singapore, we continue to pursue energy-efficiency improvements, alternative chemistries, new green technologies and lower-carbon power sources as part of our ONEGF roadmap.

Decarbonizing a fab isn’t easy. But with innovation, collaboration and the commitment of our people, we’re proving that our essential chips can power a connected world sustainably.

Americans deserve cleaner air and less energy waste, but the Trump EPA’s Final Rule rushes us in the opposite direction.
We will vigorously fight this action in court to ensure that the public receives the full — and timely — benefit of the methane rule.""","Washington, DC - Health, environment, and community groups have filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging the Trump EPA’s rushed and unlawful final rule to delay protections against methane pollution from the oil and gas industry.

The rule would delay implementation of many of the requirements in the 2024 U.S. EPA methane standards – which keep dangerous pollution out of our air and reduce wasted energy from oil and gas leaks, venting and flaring – in spite of widespread community opposition, deep concerns about risks to human health, and a pending lawsuit challenging an Interim Final rule announced by the Trump administration earlier this year that contained identical extensions for many of the same deadlines.

Methane, the main component of natural gas, is a climate pollutant that is 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. It is responsible for almost 30% of the global warming that we have experienced so far, and it is helping drive climate change and its worsening floods, wildfires, heatwaves and other severe weather events that are harming people across the country.

The 2024 standards reduce methane pollution through commonsense steps like requiring leak detection and repairs. Those steps also reduce the emissions of other dangerous pollutants, including smog and soot-forming volatile organic compounds and toxic air pollutants that cause cancer. And, because methane is the primary ingredient of natural gas, failure to address venting, flaring, and leaks led to about $3.5 billion worth of wasted natural gas – 16 million metric tons of methane – in 2023 alone. Both large and independent producers have gone on record in support of federal methane regulation, and major oil and gas producing states including Colorado, Wyoming, Pennsylvania and New Mexico have already been implementing the standards.

In July, Administrator Zeldin announced that he would use the Interim Final Rule process to delay requirements for companies to comply with the methane standards for as long as 18 months – even though the standards had already been in place for more than a year, and even though EPA’s own fact sheet noted the delay would lead to more pollution: “The EPA estimates that the following emissions reductions will not occur from 2028-2038 as a result of the interim final rule: 3.8 million tons of methane, 960,000 tons of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and 36,000 tons of toxic air pollutant.” EPA also offered no opportunity for public input until after the Interim Final Rule delay took effect, in violation of the law.

Thirteen health, environment and community groups – Environmental Defense Fund, Center for Biological Diversity, Clean Air Council, Clean Air Task Force, Dakota Resource Council, Earthjustice, Earthworks, Environmental Law & Policy Center, Food & Water Watch, Fort Berthold Protectors of Water and Earth Rights (Fort Berthold POWER), GreenLatinos, NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council) and Sierra Club – filed a lawsuit challenging that Interim Final rule. That lawsuit is still pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

Then a week ago, late in the afternoon on the day before Thanksgiving, EPA announced its Final Rule, which also delays implementation of the methane protections by 18 months.

Yesterday, the same day the Final Rule was published in the Federal Register, the same groups filed another lawsuit in the D.C. Circuit challenging it.

Quotes from Petitioners

“In 2023 oil and gas companies wasted enough natural gas to cover all heating and cooking needs at 19 million homes. That’s the equivalent of every home in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Texas. The 2024 methane standards are already working to prevent that pointless waste of American energy – while reducing pollution, protecting people’s health, and lowering risks from weather disasters fueled by climate change. Americans deserve cleaner air and less energy waste, but the Trump EPA’s Final Rule rushes us in the opposite direction. We will vigorously oppose this unlawful action.– Rosalie Winn, Senior Director and Lead Counsel of Methane and Clean Air Policy, Environmental Defense Fund

""This illegal delay of the Methane Rule ignores not only the law but the best interests of the People. Methane emission reductions benefit the environment, public health, and even oil and gas industry's profits. Which makes EPA's decision more than arbitrary and capricious, but just plain absurd."" – Lauren E. Otero, Esq., Clean Air Council

""Now is not the time to slow down efforts to reduce pollution. We have long known that quickly and significantly reducing methane emissions is key to avoiding the worst effects of climate change, and we have the tools at our disposal to do so now – all while reducing air pollution that harms communities living and working near oil and gas facilities. Despite the significant increases in methane, VOCs, and other pollutants – and the timelines EPA determined were the best approach last year – the administration has decided to side with polluters at the expense of public health and the climate.” — Mary Sasso, attorney, Clean Air Task Force

“Methane is a climate killer and a public health menace. We’re taking the Trump administration to court because delaying efforts to rein in this super pollutant is unlawful, irresponsible and will harm both people and the planet.” – Jason Rylander, Legal Director, Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute

""The Trump Administration continues to prioritize corporate polluters' bottom lines over peoples' health. This unlawful action cannot stand."" – Alexandra Schluntz, Senior Attorney, Earthjustice

“Instead of protecting the people harmed by oil and gas pollution, the Trump EPA is once again choosing to protect polluters. Delaying methane safeguards means more toxic air, more climate-driven disasters, and more avoidable harm to families living near drilling. Communities deserve timely protections not another giveaway to the oil and gas industry."" – Lauren Pagel, Policy Director, Earthworks

“The Trump EPA’s final methane emissions rule backslides to inaction on wasted energy and toxic emissions that the oil and gas industry has the tools to control. Communities across the Midwest — particularly those near drilling and processing sites in states like Michigan and North Dakota — will face unnecessary and continued exposure to harmful air pollutants and increased health risks. EPA’s new rule is unlawful and needlessly prioritizes oil and gas interests at the expense of the health, well-being, and quality of life of our communities.” – Wendy Bloom, Senior Attorney, Environmental Law & Policy Center

“Delaying methane rules means more contaminated air, more serious health problems, and deeper harm for working class communities on the frontlines of oil and gas pollution. Protecting people requires enforcement, not delay.”- Meisei Gonzalez, Climate Justice & Clean Air Advocate, GreenLatinos

“By catering to a few rogue actors in the industry and suspending these rules, EPA is blatantly violating the law. If this is allowed to stand, the climate crisis will worsen and communities across the country will be choked in more smog.” – Meredith Hankins, federal climate legal director, NRDC

""EPA's methane rule is a critical safeguard that protects our families and communities from both unclean air and the devastating impacts of climate change. By delaying its implementation over a year and a half after it was finalized, Administrator Lee Zeldin is selling out our families and communities while giving yet another handout to the oil and gas industry. We will vigorously fight this action in court to ensure that the public receives the full — and timely — benefit of the methane rule."" – Andres Restrepo, Sierra Club Senior Attorney

Tennessee's Rise as a Nuclear Energy Leader

Anyone who took a civics class in junior high or high school heard of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), very likely in the context of the Great Depression and the New Deal. The availability of affordable power created through federal action and TVA-owned generation unquestionably expedited electrification of the Tennessee Valley and improved the standard of living for residents. It also spurred industrial development in the region, which not only benefited residents and communities through economic growth but also furthered wider American interests, as manufacturers in increasing numbers began to produce materials for the country's defense needs.

Repurposing civilian industrial capacity to meet the demands of national security may be the most dramatic manifestation of public-private partnership in Tennessee. The most famous of these industrial efforts, and the most consequential, resulted in the selection of Oak Ridge as a facility to produce material for the Manhattan Project. The presence of TVA power figured prominently in the selection of the site for the Manhattan Project – as did the presence of Tennessee Senator Kenneth McKellar on the Senate Appropriations Committee who, when reportedly asked to help mask the $2 billion project appropriation, famously replied to President Roosevelt, ""Where in Tennessee do you want me to hide it?"" The Manhattan Project was a massive effort, in money, material, and personnel, spanning multiple locations in the United States and abroad, and its success resulted from the collaboration of government, academia, and private industry.

Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is today the largest of the national laboratories, supporting research across multiple disciplines, and continues to be a magnet for public and private investment and innovation, especially in the nuclear field. Private industry has recently announced plans for nuclear fuel cycle facilities, microreactor construction, and the construction and operation of demonstration reactors.

How Government Action Influenced Tennessee's Nuclear Landscape

Senator Howard H. Baker used his position as a member of the Senate, serving on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, as well as in his capacity as minority and majority leader of the Senate, to promote nuclear energy programs. He was instrumental in the development of the Clinch River Breeder Reactor, whose site is currently planned for use in efforts by TVA to promote small modular reactors. Senator Baker modeled how Tennessee government leaders could promote nuclear energy with private partners.

Unsurprisingly, Tennessee's state government has emerged as a leader in new nuclear. Governor Lee ordered the creation of the Tennessee Nuclear Energy Advisory Council in May 2023, with members drawn from government, academia, and private industry, the Council's purpose being to make policy recommendations to the state to grow the nuclear industry in Tennessee. The Council's final report included recommendations to support specific projects, such as TVA's Clinch River project, to promote capital investment and nuclear supply chain development in the state, and to develop a nuclear workforce in connection with state higher education. Because of the state's leadership, the region's nuclear heritage, and advocacy of groups, innovative nuclear companies are striving to create a presence in the Oak Ridge area. Private companies such as Radiant Industries, BWXT Enrichment Operations, Oklo, and Kairos Power have planned investments in excess of $2 billion.

At the Federal level, the Trump administration has taken aggressive steps to accelerate new nuclear development, issuing multiple executive orders to achieve that end. The private developmental activities blossoming in Tennessee will put industry in close physical proximity to TVA and Department of Energy sites and promote closer cooperation between those federal agencies, tasked by the administration with furthering its nuclear policy objectives, and the private companies, backed by private financial investment, which can make those objectives a reality. As if to demonstrate this principle, the Department of Energy recently announced that Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in conjunction with Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), would deploy two new supercomputers to promote AI-driven research.

Looking Ahead: Tennessee's Blueprint for America's Energy Future

Since 2023, the Tennessee legislature has appropriated $70 million for the Tennessee Nuclear Fund. The Fund, administered by the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development (TNECD), is designed to promote nuclear development and manufacturing in the state through grants and other forms of assistance. As of December 2025, the fund has awarded more than $35 million to nuclear-related projects, from state workforce development programs and infrastructure improvements to private companies seeking to establish or expand their presence in Tennessee.

It is no accident that most of these projects are in the greater Knoxville/Oak Ridge area. These companies have already recognized the value of being in close physical proximity to ORNL and to TVA. Some are working directly with the Department of Energy, the TVA, or both. Kairos Power, for example, is constructing a demonstration reactor on Department of Energy land in Oak Ridge and recently announced a power purchase agreement with TVA to power data centers in the region. And TVA, the Department of Energy, and the State of Tennessee are actively seeking other arrangements with private industry to further develop the nuclear energy ecosystem in the state.

Information for Companies Interested in Nuclear Energy Programs in Tennessee

The Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development maintains the Nuclear Energy Fund grants and other incentives for companies seeking to locate or expand activities in the state.

The Tennessee Valley Authority has several additional resources, including a slate of available properties and targeted incentive programs, available for businesses.

Oak Ridge National Laboratory recently established a new grant program, the Innovation and Research for Industry Success (IRIS) program, to facilitate research and long-term investment.

Although these agencies' economic development resources are accessible on a rolling basis, some resources are subject to availability, and companies contemplating Tennessee growth should engage with these agencies early on in their planning.

In 1953, President Eisenhower delivered his ""Atoms for Peace"" speech to the United Nations General Assembly, pledging the United States would ""devote its entire heart and mind to find the way by which the miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to his death, but consecrated to his life."" With the combined efforts of government and private action, Tennessee is poised to help the country do just that. Tennessee's long history of cooperation between public and private institutions established Tennessee as a leader in nuclear energy development, serving as a lighthouse for other states aspiring to address this nation's energy needs.",https://www.bakerdonelson.com/images/_wbmanaged/screenshot2025-12-03162902_wbc_socialimage_165886.png,N,,2025-12-04 14:01:54.602229

For decades, noxious, cancer-causing gases poured from some of the nation’s largest industrial polluters, seeping invisibly from cracks in antiquated pipes or billowing out of smokestacks in plumes that choked the communities nearby.

And for decades, the Environmental Protection Agency tracked those emissions not by monitoring the air but by relying on a kind of honor system. Companies were allowed to estimate their chemical pollution using methods that even the EPA conceded were often unreliable.

In 2023, the EPA received irrefutable proof that these estimates were highly flawed. The agency had required 20 industrial facilities to temporarily install air monitors around their perimeters — known as fence-line monitoring — to see how bad the pollution actually was.

The results, compiled now for the first time by ProPublica, were shocking.

In virtually every case, the actual emissions were higher — often much higher — than the estimates, ProPublica found. At one steel industry plant near Pittsburgh, a potent carcinogen was found at levels more than 30 times higher than estimated. In Louisiana, a chemical facility recorded levels of another toxic chemical that were 156 times higher.

Despite industry opposition, the EPA took action last year. More than 130 industrial facilities would have to install permanent air monitors, starting as soon as this year. Communities surrounding some of the country’s most notorious polluters would finally get a glimpse of what they were breathing. The monitors would act as a warning system: If pollution levels were to exceed new standards set by the EPA, the facility would have to find the source of the leaks and fix them. In fact, among the 20 plants that were forced to conduct temporary monitoring, half would have violated these standards, ProPublica found.

Then, shortly after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, his administration announced it was putting a halt to the effort. Not only was Trump’s EPA going to reconsider the new requirements — the first step in rolling them back — but companies in the meantime could apply for two-year exemptions allowing them to evade the rules altogether.

In a matter of weeks, regulations that took years to enact had been sidestepped in favor of keeping the status quo.

The implications are far-reaching. More than 5 million people face an increased risk of developing cancer because they live near the type of plants that would have been subject to the new emission rules, according to the EPA. That number is almost certainly an undercount because it’s based on the companies’ flawed estimates of their emissions.

The White House referred ProPublica to the EPA, which responded to a detailed summary of our findings with an email from its press office acknowledging a “discrepancy” between the self-reported emissions and air monitoring data. “However, we have not determined the cause of the discrepancy. We will explore this as part of the reconsideration” of the rules, the email said.

For environmentalists and some of the millions living near these polluters, Trump’s reversals have been a gut punch.

“It just doesn’t make sense,” said Haley Lewis, senior attorney at the Environmental Integrity Project, an advocacy group founded by a former EPA enforcement official. If the EPA chooses to abandon fence-line monitoring, then it’s leaving “meaningful, affordable and achievable” emissions cuts on the table, Lewis said. The only reason to do that is “they don’t want their true emissions to be known.”

‘The more we learned, the more afraid we were’

Coal piles up like black sand dunes outside Clairton Coke Works just south of Pittsburgh. The largest coke-making facility in the Western Hemisphere, its ovens have been operating since 1916. Heat from the 2,000-degree ovens bake raw coal into coke, a carbon-rich material essential to converting iron ore and limestone into steel.

Benzene, an invisible gas linked to blood cancers and anemia, streams out of the plant alongside specks of particulate matter and stinking sulfur compounds. Other chemicals escape from tiny openings, seams and oven doors that don’t close tightly.

The hilly terrain of the Monongahela River valley forms the perfect trap for air pollution. During temperature inversions, when cold air gets stuck beneath a layer of warm air, residents walk around in a cloud of stagnant pollution.

Miriam Maletta, who runs a hair salon in Clairton, wonders if the prosperity U.S. Steel brought to town was worth the health toll. Despite its decline, the iconic company continues to employ more than 3,000 workers in the region and remains a source of local pride.

Maletta’s brother James worked as a driver for U.S. Steel in the 1970s, she recalled; when he blew his nose after work, his snot was black with soot. Their father died from gastric cancer in 2009 after more than 20 years of working for the coke plant. Maletta, 62, was diagnosed with lymphoma in 2016 and is now in remission, she said. Some limited data suggests a link between air pollution and the two cancers, though it’s virtually impossible to prove that exposure to chemicals caused a specific person’s illness.

Her mother has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is more commonly associated with smoking but is also linked to air pollution. Maletta said her mother never smoked.

In the last seven years, local records show, the county health department has levied fines against U.S. Steel of more than $10 million for allegedly violating federal, state and county air pollution regulations. The company often appeals the cases, settling them for smaller amounts. The dangers of the plant were underscored for residents when the coke facility caught fire in 2018, choking the valley with toxic gases. Emergency room visits for asthma spiked.

Long after the company fixed the equipment that caused the fire, Cindy Meckel, 66, said she struggled to climb the stairs while bringing in the groceries at her home more than a mile from the plant. Her husband David, 77, would nearly pass out swinging a sledgehammer. Their eyes burned after a 30-minute walk with their rottweiler, Nixon.

After Cindy was diagnosed with anemia, she wondered if benzene emissions had played a role. The iron supplements she took as treatment wreaked havoc on her stomach. “The more we knew, the more we learned, the more afraid we were,” Cindy said.

She and David provided depositions to support a lawsuit that two environmental groups filed against U.S. Steel in 2019. The lawsuit said local residents had experienced headaches, fatigue and difficulty breathing, symptoms they believe were caused by excess emissions of dangerous pollutants released after the fire. U.S. Steel disputed the accusations in court filings, saying it “lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief” about the cause of the alleged health effects. The company eventually settled the lawsuit; U.S. Steel agreed to pay nearly $20 million to upgrade the facility and another $5 million for local clean air programs.

The Meckels and Maletta joined a grassroots organization called Valley Clean Air Now, which advocated for the region’s cluster of industrial towns, including Clairton. They distributed indoor air filters and urged a crackdown on U.S. Steel at public meetings.

A critical question remained: How much pollution was pouring from the Clairton Coke Works?

Industrial companies are required to report their emissions to the EPA, but it’s not an easy task. Facility staff can take direct measurements of pollutants by sticking a scientific instrument inside a smokestack for several hours, for example. But a sprawling plant like Clairton’s has miles of pipelines and up to thousands of components like valves and fittings that could leak toxic gases. Trying to measure every potential leak would be enormously difficult.

So the EPA allows facilities to provide estimates using numbers called emission factors. Each emission factor estimates the leaks produced by a specific industrial process, such as the amount of benzene expected to be released from a “light-oil storage tank” at a coke manufacturing plant.

The EPA began compiling emission factors decades ago to help determine large-scale air pollution trends. As individual facilities started using them to estimate their emissions, the potential for errors grew. Emission factors are often based on a limited number of measurements taken in the field or in the lab. They assume that the same process always leaks at roughly the same rate, even though some are highly variable. It would be like insisting that every bundt cake should take an hour to bake, though baking times vary depending on the ingredients and the oven temperature.

Over the years, numerous studies and reports from government watchdogs, including the EPA’s Office of Inspector General, have criticized the use of emission factors and recommended changes. The EPA itself has recognized since at least 1990 that emission factors are problematic. Records show that it considers many of the coke oven emission factors “poor” or “below average” in terms of accuracy.

The EPA takes a facility’s estimated emissions and plugs the numbers into air modeling software to calculate the level of toxic chemicals leaking into the surrounding community. The software models how plumes of chemicals from different parts of a plant disperse across the property, given wind patterns and other factors.

In 2023, as the EPA weighed stricter regulations for coke plants, the agency took the Clairton benzene estimates and put them into the modeling program. The results appeared reassuring: They predicted that the maximum benzene level near the fence line was higher than what’s typically found in outdoor air but represented a low cancer risk and was well under the concentration that regulators recommend to avoid other health problems.

But when the EPA required Clairton to install temporary air monitors at its perimeter, there was a stark difference.

‘Oh good, it’s working’

Fence-line monitoring has proven a powerful tool in reducing pollution.

A decade ago under President Barack Obama, the EPA tightened requirements for oil refineries, insisting facilities install benzene monitoring equipment around their perimeters and curtail emissions when levels exceed a certain standard. Monitors revealed that refineries had often been releasing more benzene than they had estimated in reports to the government. One refinery in New Mexico measured annual average benzene that was more than 100 times the level the EPA model had predicted based on its prior reports.

Soon, benzene levels near refineries began to plummet. The amount around the New Mexico refinery fell dramatically in four years; by 2022, it complied with EPA’s refinery benzene standard.

After President Joe Biden took office, the EPA proposed similar air monitors for other industrial facilities. The Clairton facility was one of five coke plants required to set up fence-line monitors for six months. All five showed higher levels of benzene than the EPA had calculated using the facilities’ estimates.

The Clairton monitors showed that the actual benzene levels at its fence line were 37 times higher than estimated.

U.S. Steel vehemently opposed the EPA’s proposal to require permanent fence-line monitors for coke plants, arguing that the benzene standard was too stringent. Five Democratic senators, including both from Pennsylvania, told the EPA last year that the new requirements would cost too much and “pose a threat to our steel industry’s global economic competitiveness while yielding minimal environmental benefits.”

The EPA estimates that fence-line monitoring would cost coke plants about $107,000 per year. (U.S. Steel had $1.4 billion in cash at the end of 2024, financial records show.) The true costs, however, would be far greater because the company would likely have to invest heavily to patch up innumerable leaks identified with the help of the monitors.

ProPublica provided U.S. Steel with a detailed summary of our findings. “U. S. Steel is committed to working with the EPA and supports regulations that are well-grounded in law; and are based on sound science, available and proven technology, and that consider costs and other non-air quality impacts. Unfortunately, the 2024 coke rules do not meet these criteria, and we are evaluating next steps,” Andrew Fulton, a company spokesperson, said in an email. The “EPA remains open to revising the 2024 rule and we look forward to joining industry partners in continuing discussions with the agency.”

In addition to the five coke manufacturers, the EPA required temporary fence-line monitors at 11 large chemical plants and four iron and steel mills. The pattern was the same.

The monitoring at the 20 facilities yielded 37 sets of fence-line data that could be compared against the results derived from their self-reported emissions. In all but one of those cases, or 97% of the time, the monitoring revealed the facilities had underestimated their emissions.

That included a Dow Chemical facility in Plaquemine, Louisiana, where levels of vinyl chloride, a dangerous carcinogen, were in reality 156 times higher than the EPA calculated based on the plant’s estimates. Concentrations of ethylene dichloride, another carcinogen, around the facility were a whopping 1,033 times higher.

Ten of the plants were leaking dangerous chemicals at higher volumes than the EPA’s new rules would have allowed. Around one Indorama chemical manufacturing plant in Port Neches, Texas, monitors showed that concentrations of ethylene oxide, a potent carcinogen, would be seven times the standard set by the EPA. And for a Formosa plastics plant in Point Comfort, Texas, ethylene dichloride levels exceeded the EPA standard and were actually 69 times higher than had been expected based on its self-reported estimates.

“Dow will continue working closely with regulatory authorities to protect the safety of our employees and surrounding communities,” Glynna Mayers, a spokesperson for Dow, which also owns Union Carbide, said in an email. “We remain committed to operating reliably and advancing efforts to reduce emissions below their already safe levels.”

Indorama didn’t respond to a request for comment. A Formosa spokesperson said the company conducts air monitoring in the neighborhood near the facility and shares the results with Texas regulators. Formosa has also taken steps to reduce emissions of ethylene dichloride over the last decade, the spokesperson said. Companies that owned the other facilities did not respond to requests for comment.

Experts say the industrial plants most likely to underestimate their emissions are the ones with extensive networks of pipelines, valves, compressors, pumps and storage tanks. It’s nearly impossible to project emissions from so many dispersed sources, said Cary Secrest, a former EPA employee who spent 20 years inspecting industrial plants and now works at a company that measures pollution.

“I don’t think that companies are deliberately trying to underestimate emissions,” Secrest said. “I just think that it’s impossible without actual measurements.”

While there’s no comprehensive list of these types of facilities, chemical manufacturers and coke plants are vulnerable to pervasive leaks — especially if they’re badly maintained, he said. Instead of allowing polluters to rely on emission factors that are little better than a “fantasy,” he said, the agency should require more direct monitoring — even if those techniques are more expensive.

David Meckel spoke up at a public hearing in 2023 and told EPA officials that Clairton Coke Works had ruined his health. He could no longer cut his grass without resting to catch his breath, he said. “I stagger around like a fish out of water.”

The EPA’s final coke plants rule, released in May 2024 under Biden, required the facilities to conduct fence-line monitoring and keep their annual average benzene emissions below a certain level. Because benzene is often leaking alongside other pollutants, curbing benzene would also reduce overall emissions, the EPA explained.

For the Meckels, it felt like a victory. “It did sort of make you feel energized,” Cindy said, as if they could finally breathe and say, “‘Oh good, it’s working.’”

‘It’s hurting the people”

In addition to promising a new era of accountability for coke manufacturers, two new rules adopted by the EPA last year would have required more than 120 larger chemical plants, as well as a handful of steel and iron mills, to install air monitors and limit their emissions.

The communities at highest risk, like those in Louisiana’s Cancer Alley, would have benefited the most. The Dow Chemical plant that underestimated its emissions is part of a cluster of industrial facilities near the city of Plaquemine, Louisiana. The combined emissions from local polluters create a lifetime cancer risk of 100 in a million for rural residents nearby, according to the latest EPA risk map from 2020. That figure, which means that 100 people out of a million would be expected to develop cancer after a lifetime of exposure, is at the very limit of what the EPA considers acceptable — though many public health experts say that threshold is too lenient. That risk number is also likely an underestimate, since it was calculated from self-reported emissions data.

About 90,000 people living near larger chemical plants face an unacceptable risk of developing cancer, the EPA said. The agency estimated that the new limits on chemicals would have cut that number to 3,000 residents — a drop of 97%.

In March, on what the Trump administration touted as the “the greatest and most consequential day of deregulation in the history of the United States,” the EPA announced it would reconsider or roll back 31 environmental regulations and programs, including the three with fence-line monitoring requirements. That marked the start of a lengthy process that could erase or water down the rules.

Meanwhile, the president has so far given two-year exemptions from the regulations to some 50 chemical plants, including the Louisiana Dow facility and the Indorama and Formosa facilities in Texas. (Environmentalists recently sued the administration over these exemptions. The EPA press office said the agency doesn’t comment on current or pending litigation; the White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.)

Mayers, the Dow spokesperson, said the extensions for complying with the rule “are appropriate and necessary to address technical challenges and maintain the safe, efficient operation of our facilities.”

U.S. Steel applied for an exemption for its Clairton plant; Fulton, the company spokesperson, said a decision on the application is pending. In its application, which ProPublica obtained via a public records request, the company said the fence-line monitoring requirement was too stringent. The application stated that finding and fixing the root cause of excess leaks would be costly and complex given the “many miles of piping and thousands of valves and flanges at a coke facility.”

The loss of the promised monitoring has left some in its neighboring communities disillusioned. One resident wondered what was the point of talking to reporters and regulators if nothing was going to change.

Another local, Qiyam Ansari, who is also executive director of Valley Clean Air Now, said he and other residents have to look for solutions outside the federal government. The organization is working with public health researchers at the University of Pittsburgh to conduct a local health survey in hopes that the results might inspire stricter local regulations.

The work is deeply personal to the 29-year-old Ansari. He nearly died from an asthma attack as a teenager after his family moved close to a local U.S. Steel mill. He still lives nearby; every room in his house has an air purifier. Even his cat Kiki has asthma, he said, and she didn’t appreciate him shoving a feline inhaler over her face.

The environment was on his mind when Ansari voted for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris last November. A lot of his neighbors voted for Trump, whose first administration rolled back many air protections.

Among them were the Meckels. Cindy said she was worried about inflation and illegal immigration. She and David are now bitterly disappointed by Trump’s environmental policies.

“It’s hurting the people. He’s supposed to be for the people,” David said. “That’s wrong, he’s being stupid!”

This spring, the Meckels moved one county north. Cindy said the final straw was when Nixon died at age 5. He was their third dog in eight years to die after a cancer diagnosis. His death, she said, reinforced how vulnerable their own health is.

They’re not giving up, Cindy said. “We’re escaping with our lives because we gave it everything we could do and it didn’t matter.”",https://i0.wp.com/yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1125_steelplant_1600.jpg?fit=1600%2C900&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-04 11:10:06.509357

About ERM Sustainability is our business.","New research from GlobeScan and the ERM Sustainability Institute shows that climate change remains the most urgent global sustainability priority for 2025 according to sustainability professionals across the world, while concern for other critical issues such as biodiversity, diversity, and water scarcity has declined slightly. The findings also reveal a growing emphasis on renewable energy, low-carbon development, and cross-sector collaboration.

The survey of 391 expert stakeholders from business, civil society, government and academia across 57 countries, took place between 26 August and 21 October, 2025. The survey ranked the top sustainability issues, captured most important sustainability developments, and explored views of leadership in the NGO and corporate sectors.

Top sustainability issues, developments and priorities

Climate change remains the top concern (cited as urgent by 94 percent of respondents), while urgency around issues such as biodiversity, deforestation, diversity, water scarcity, and labor conditions in supply chains has weakened.

Legislation continues to be viewed as the most impactful driver of sustainability progress, though its perceived importance has declined significantly compared to 2024 (cited by 18 percent of experts in 2025 vs. 33 percent in 2024).

Emerging priorities include renewable energy and low-carbon development, biodiversity initiatives, and global/multi-stakeholder collaboration.

Expert views on corporate and NGO sustainability leadership remain steady

Patagonia retains its position as the most recognized corporate sustainability leader (cited by 36 percent of experts), with IKEA, Unilever, and Natura &Co following. Meanwhile, companies such as Schneider Electric, Microsoft, Interface, and Ørsted gain recognition in specific regions.

WWF remains by far the most recognized NGO for sustainability leadership (cited by 44 percent of respondents), followed by Greenpeace (cited by 15 percent), World Resources Institute (cited by 12 percent) and The Nature Conservancy (cited by 10 percent).

Integrating sustainability into business strategy is viewed as key to sustainability leadership

Making sustainability a core business driver is seen as the top attribute of corporate sustainability leaders (cited by 26 percent of respondents).

Demonstrating evidence of impact and actions and focusing on supply chains are also consistent drivers of recognized leadership.

Chris Coulter, CEO at GlobeScan said: “This year’s survey highlights both progress and persistent challenges. Climate change remains the defining issue, but we also see stakeholders pointing to companies and NGOs that are focused on driving more innovation and collaboration in the sustainability agenda.”

Mark Lee, Global Director of Thought Leadership at ERM, said: “Our survey findings reflect the strong belief across sectors and regions that sustainability must be embedded in business strategy and drive commercial results. These are the key factors that define sustainability leadership today, and the companies that adopt this approach will be well-positioned to benefit from enhanced resilience and value creation opportunities.”

A clear mandate for action

The 2025 Leaders Survey results set a clear mandate for organizations to act decisively. Leadership organizations in all sectors are encouraged to focus on sustainability issues that deliver measurable impact and financial value, secure clean and reliable energy, and meet rising regulatory and stakeholder expectations, even as budgets tighten. Success will depend on falling costs for renewable and low-carbon technologies, accelerating operational and value chain decarbonization, and embracing digital solutions.

At the same time, the research findings reveal both progress and stagnation, underscoring that sustained innovation and cross-sector collaboration will be essential to maintain momentum and drive meaningful change in a rapidly evolving sustainability landscape.

Notes to editors

The GlobeScan / ERM Sustainability Institute Leaders Survey is an annual study that highlights the most urgent priorities in the current global sustainable development agenda.

The 2025 survey examines private sector and civil society sustainability leadership in addition to monitoring priority issues over time and tracking notable shifts in their perceived importance. This year's survey was conducted between August and October 2025 and reflects input from almost 400 sustainability experts across nearly 60 countries.

UNC-CH Media Hub Student Correspondent

On a warm day in the spring, when you look at a bright flower and see a bee dancing around on the inside of the plant, that creature is likely just making a stop on a long journey before it returns to its home — its hive. But odds are, that hive might not be the structure in a tree you are thinking of. It very well might just be the result of someone’s hard work right in their backyard.

Apiculture — the technical term for beekeeping — is a major industry across the state of North Carolina. Many counties — over 80 out of the 100 in North Carolina — and the state as a whole, have their own beekeeping associations.

The North Carolina State Beekeeping Association has over 4,000 active members across the state, making it the largest organized association for beekeepers in the country. And North Carolina, in general, has somewhere close to 15,000 beekeepers — whether it be a person growing a new hobby, an individual understanding the science behind the craft or someone attempting to make a living out of the process — according to North Carolina State University.

Because of the multitude of motivations behind beekeeping, NCSU even has an extensive apiculture program to further the understanding of honey bee biology and to improve bee management.

Jennifer Keller, research specialist and apiculture technician at NCSU, said there are still a lot of mysteries surrounding beekeeping — like why some colonies excel in their lifespan more than others — that scientists are still trying to understand in their research. However, Keller and her colleagues see the clear necessity of honey bees in our world.

“Honey bees, as well as other native bees, are very important for pollinating to produce good crops, and even some of the crops that are not dependent on bees will have an added benefit from the pollination of bees,” she said. “If there are no honey bees around, they may still produce a crop, but with honey bees, they’ll produce more of that same crop, so that’s better for farmers. Without bees, things wouldn’t be as good — there’s some crops that are dependent on bees that just would not be able to happen as much.”

The importance of honey bees, as well as the niche interest of the craft, is part of why thousands of individuals across the state participate in beekeeping, whether as a hobby or a commercial business.

Beekeeping as a hobby

Lisa Vogel has always had a piece of bees in her life.

When she was a child growing up in the mountains of North Carolina, she remembers her dad — a self-proclaimed honey aficionado — bringing in different kinds of honey for her to try, from sour wood to whipped, all the result of a bee’s hard work.

Then, 10 years ago, out of pure curiosity, she visited the home of a friend who was a beekeeper to see her process.

“I was hooked immediately,” Vogel said. “It was like, I feel like I did this in another life or something. I mean, it was crazy. You know, when you find a hobby that you just instantly love? It was that feeling.”

Now, a decade later, Vogel cares for nine hives on the property of her home in Orange County, North Carolina. And whether she is harvesting the honey-filled frames from her hives or protecting her bees from the common risk of varroa mites, she has several tricks she has learned over the years.

Bee risk and tricks

Though a beekeeper should not constantly interfere with their hive, when the bees are at risk, the keeper might have to step in. One of the main risks facing bees right now is the presence of varroa mites, an external parasitic mite that attacks and feeds on honey bees.

While each beekeeper has a different method to protect their hive from this parasite, Vogel said that she checks for the issue once every five weeks during the warm months — which is often one of her only reasons for going into the hive at all.

After doing an inspection, if she finds a significant number of mites, Vogel will treat her hive with a mite medication or an alcohol wash. She said she learned this trick from a North Carolina beekeeper and apiary inspector, Lewis Cauble.

In addition to keeping her hive safe, Vogel has a trick for ensuring the queen bee is alive by looking for eggs on frames. Because while the whole hive is important, the queen has her title for a reason.

“If the queen dies, then the hive dies, possibly — especially if they don’t have any eggs to raise a new queen,” Vogel said. “If they don’t have a queen, they don’t have eggs, and they’re doomed.”

And if that were to occur, one would have to purchase a new queen from a beekeeping shop — like Bailey Bee Supply in Hillsborough — to maintain the integrity of a hive and reduce the risk of losing more bees. Thus, the maintenance of a hive is critical. Having the knowledge to do so is, too, which is why Justin Maness created his Durham-based company, Buddha Bee Apiary.

Maness’s business is built around the idea of him and his employees, like Claudia Roller, managing beehives in clients’ yards and educating individuals on proper practices.

“We just focus on the education and the experience of people getting the opportunity to come out and be in hives with us and see what it’s all about,” Roller said.

Roller studied chemistry at Goucher College in Maryland, and when she first started working for Maness, she had never even seen a hive in her life. But she was intrigued by the scientific aspect of apiculture, and over the past several years, she has become a beekeeper herself, inspecting hives and making sure the pollinators are cared for. She is now even interested in going to school to get a master’s degree in apiculture from somewhere like NCSU to further her knowledge and the research of beekeeping.

Buddha Bee does not sell any honey from their business, but rather focuses on that education aspect and growing the beekeeping industry, as a whole.

“We only harvest honey if the hive is able to handle us taking some,” Roller said. “And then we give it right back to the people who are hosting a hive. So if you have a hive in your backyard, you’re getting your honey right from your backyard.”

Honey production

But while Buddha Bee does not profit from its production, the sticky, sweet golden substance is a major aspect of beekeeping, and keepers like Vogel do share their hive’s product.

“I sell it at different places around Orange County,” she said. “This year I’ll be selling it mostly to friends, and I do a Holiday Market where I sell it as well.”

However, this venture is not about making money for Vogel; in fact, she said she does not make much of a profit at all, especially since she does not extract her own honey — which is a different process entirely.

Extraction is the process of separating honey from beeswax combs to harvest it for use. When Vogel needs this done, she takes her frames to an extractor in Mebane, North Carolina, before she bottles the product.

Vogel said she does not do extraction, not only because she does not have the equipment for it, but because, with her age, the process is too heavy a task for her. For Phil Crump, though, extraction is just another step in his beekeeping process as a whole.

Bees and the economy

Crump has been beekeeping for almost 50 years and, according to Vogel, is a salesman extraordinaire. He primarily sells honey at events through Plant Delights Nursery, a small business in Wake County, North Carolina, and begins the honey process from step one.

From suiting up in protective covering to having hands-on time with the buzzing creatures to harvesting the golden frames, Crump does it all. Then, when he finally reaches the extraction element, Crump has a honed-down method.

“You’re going to take your knife, and it saws, kind of, and you can see how I’m just taking those cappings off,” Crump said as he started the process. “And then I’m just going to go down, and I like to not damage the comb any more than necessary. Some people just get in there and they’ll start digging it. There’s another method that you can use that uses a hot knife and it melts the wax off. But I just think this is the least destructive method, and that’s what I like to do, is not to damage this any more than necessary, so that the bees can repair it or utilize it.”

The harvesting and extraction process allows Crump to produce a profit from selling products at events.

He said that he typically sells a bottle of honey for around $30, and while that might seem like a steep price, with the effort and time that has been put in, at the end of the day, that outcome makes sense and people will buy it.

“I can market my honey in a location where people are already coming to spend money,” Crump said. “They’re already anticipating buying something. This is a nursery that sells rare and unusual plants, so they’re not inexpensive plants. They’re not going to Lowe’s [Hardware]. So that’s a unique component. I can’t make money at the farmer’s market because people from Eastern North Carolina come and they’re selling their honey so cheap I can’t even compete.”

Crump said that the honey production business is hard, but what makes it harder is when these individuals sell their honey for a lower price than what other keepers see fit. This practice hurts people like Crump who try to support themselves through their sales. This way of selling and overharvesting can also create poor beekeeping practices.

Overharvesting occurs when beekeepers remove too much honey from a hive. This leads to colony collapse by depleting a hive’s food stores, forcing beekeepers to rely on supplemental feeding, which can add stress and is not a sustainable practice for the colony’s long-term health — which though is not especially common, it is something Crump tries to avoid entirely.

The community

But Crump said that beyond just the honey harvesting and business of beekeeping, the people make it what it is.

“My interest is honey production, but I’d say at least half of what interests me about beekeeping is the fellowship,” he said. “[I] really enjoy the people. It’s a great group of people. They’re real.”

Vogel said that many of the practices she has learned have been through personal research or from the greater beekeeping community, in general. It is this community that truly defines beekeeping in North Carolina.

And it is that community that has also grown Eva Walker’s interest in the craft, despite being a standout among her peers.

Walker is a senior at Durham Academy Upper School and has been a beekeeper for almost four years. She has a hive at her home in Durham that she maintains with her father, as well as one that she set up at her high school that she uses to help educate other students about beekeeping.

While she is not necessarily in the same age group as many other beekeepers in North Carolina, Walker has still formed various connections. She said that the community is so tight-knit across the state that everyone seems to know each other or is able to bond over this niche hobby.

“Being young, I’m sort of at an advantage, because people want to hear [about it],” she said. “There’s questions of like, ‘Wow, you’re so young, how’d you get into this?’”

So while the motivation behind beekeeping varies for each person — whether for education, a fun hobby, a profession or anything else — the root of the enjoyment of the craft lies in the community and the opportunity to protect, preserve and promote the lives of the creatures that keep nature so bright.",https://thelocalreporter.press/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cropped-local-reporter-logo-round-3-option-1-3-e1566310206658-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-04 12:01:40.660501

This electrified road is a futuristic win for EV drivers

It’s a new age dilemma: having to plan your journey around charging up your electric car – but now it seems that there could be a solution.

In Detroit, the genius invention of an electrified road has got people charged up, and it’s safe to say it could save drivers precious time.

In 2023, the road opened, which consisted of a ‘quarter-mile segment of 14th Street’, facilitated by Electreon.

The road is able to charge cars by using inductive coils that are able to charge the cars as they drive on, wirelessly.

The clever electrified road was the first of its kind to be installed in North America, with stationary charging points also included in the grand plans.

It was Sweden built the first permanent electrified road in the world in 2018 with the eRoadArlanda project near Stockholm.

But, how does wireless charging actually work?

Well, firstly, it connects the energy from the coils when an EV turns onto the electrified road.

Next, the Michigan Department of Transportation and other traffic centers collect accurate real-time information

Finally, the car in question receives the charge energy wirelessly, from the coils to the battery, allowing the car to charge up on the go.

As the saying goes: ‘nothing good comes easy’ – especially with EVs

Even though the electrified road does add charge to EVs, there is a catch with usage and eligibility.

Reportedly, only electric vehicles fitted with the right receivers that are on their base can use it, according to the BBC.

But technology is ever evolving.

“Developing electrified roadways may be the catalyst to accelerate interest and acceptance of EVs for all consumers.

“This collaboration supports a more sustainable future with fewer emissions,” Michigan Department of Transportation Director Bradley C. Wieferich said.

So, this really could be the next big EV trend. Keep an eye out for wireless charging roads near you.

“For a small site, Oak Ridge is by far the most complex site I’ve ever worked at,” Olds said.","Oak Ridge is a city sitting on a Superfund site.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designated the entire Oak Ridge Reservation an EPA Superfund site in 1989 under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.

The Oak Ridge Reservation cannot be deleted from the National Priorities List of the most serious hazardous waste sites in the United States until the EPA declares that the U.S. Department of Energy has completed appropriate cleanup actions and achieved cleanup goals with respect to radioactive and toxic chemical materials. A Superfund site can be delisted if a remedial investigation shows that the contamination poses no significant risk to human health or the environment.

The cleanup of contaminated sites on the reservation managed by DOE may not be complete until the 2050s and yet most of the managed reservation’s 33,069 acres are undisturbed or clean now, said Erik Olds, who has served as manager of the Oak Ridge Office of Environmental Management since June 2025. (Editor's note: This story on Olds' talk was written months prior to the Dec. 3 announcement that 16,377 acres on the Oak Ridge Reservation don't require cleanup and can be reused.)

He noted that he is now talking to EPA about removing hundreds of acres of clean Oak Ridge Reservation land managed by DOE from its National Priorities List. The reservation also includes more than 25,000 acres that are privately owned.

Also in 1989, DOE formed the Office of Environmental Management (EM) to lead the cleanup of contaminated DOE research and production sites nationwide. On the Oak Ridge Reservation those sites were primarily the K-25 Site (three gaseous diffusion plants for producing enriched uranium for nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants – K-25, K-29 and K-33), the Y-12 National Security Complex (where highly enriched uranium is stored and where old buildings are contaminated with uranium and mercury) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which has radioactive and chemical hazards.

In a recent talk to an Oak Ridge Institute for Continued Learning class at the new William J. Wilcox K-25 Interpretive Center in Oak Ridge, Olds called the total cleanup of the K-25 Site “monumental and incredible.” He spoke after Ray Smith, Oak Ridge city historian, presented a brief history of the gaseous diffusion plants that enriched uranium for 40 years at the K-25 Site.

The cleanup operations completed at the K-25 site included deactivating, decommissioning and demolishing buildings, as well as removing contaminated soil and remediating polluted groundwater. Deactivation, which is underway at ORNL and Y-12, means removing contaminated piping, process equipment and other nuclear and chemical hazards from each building before demolishing it, isolating slightly contaminated construction materials onsite and transporting highly contaminated material for disposal as far away as Nevada, Texas and Utah.

Olds said Oak Ridge was the first site in the world to remove a former uranium enrichment complex. Under contract to OREM, United Cleanup Oak Ridge (UCOR) removed by 2020 some 500 contaminated structures from the K-25 site, which had a footprint of about 225 football fields.

Olds called Oak Ridge a “trailblazer” in preparing for reuse by companies previously decontaminated land.

“Oak Ridge launched DOE’s first reindustrialization program in 1996 with support and input from the community,” he said. “The purpose was to help offset the loss of jobs caused by the shutdown of the enrichment plants on the K-25 Site in 1987.”

In 1997, the area embracing the K-25 Site and the two industrial parks, Horizon Center and Heritage Center, were renamed the East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP). DOE established a unique partnership with the Community Reuse Organization of East Tennessee (CROET) to make land and buildings available to the private sector.

Transferring many acres of land for other uses

Thanks to the final cleanup of the K-25 Site in 2024, including soil cleanup and major field work, the OREM vision for ETTP is to foster not only economic development, but also conservation and historic preservation.

“We have transferred 1,850 acres for economic development and hundreds more are slated for transfer over the next two years,” Olds said. “ETTP is home to 25 private businesses, and that number will continue to grow as the cleaned-up land is transferred.” He noted that nuclear companies interested in building uranium enrichment and nuclear fuel production plants and small modular reactors are buying ETTP land.

“Cleanup progress has transformed the area from a liability into a community asset that is attracting billions of dollars in new investments, primarily by nuclear companies. ETTP will be surrounded by 3,500 acres of natural areas with trails and greenways that EM will transfer for conservation, enabling residents and visitors to enjoy the beauty of East Tennessee.”

The Wilcox Interpretive Center where Olds spoke and the nearby K-25 Atomic History Center are examples of use of the former K-25 Site for historic preservation.

“I’d say over the next year EM is probably going to transfer about 4,600 acres,” he added, noting that land transfer is not easy and that EM must work very closely with EPA and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation to transfer any piece of land.

“We have to prove we’ve cleaned that land up to a level where it can be safely transferred and used later on for an industrial reuse,” he remarked.

Because the Oak Ridge Reservation has so much land that is clean, Olds hopes to convince EPA that it should not be considered part of a Superfund site and should be delisted because it poses no significant risk to human health or the environment.

Nevertheless, Oak Ridge is listed as one of the 15 DOE sites that remains “an active cleanup operation,” Olds said. Since the EM program started in 1989, DOE has cleaned up 92 of the 107 sites across the country that had initially been designated as contaminated.

Cleanup of ORNL, Y-12 under way

Olds, who has worked in EM activities in Nevada, Washington state, South Carolina and Washington, D.C., is now overseeing the environmental cleanup, decontamination and decommissioning activities at ORNL and Y-12. These campuses now are the most contaminated areas of the reservation.

UCOR is working under OREM’s leadership to remove contaminated equipment from buildings, dispose of it, demolish the decontaminated buildings and clean up the land and waterways, which represent about 50% of the land DOE manages on the reservation. Olds said the cleanup job now under way at these two sites is complicated and might take almost three decades.

“For a small site, Oak Ridge is by far the most complex site I’ve ever worked at,” Olds said. He noted that three distinct DOE offices are involved in funding work at ORNL and Y-12: EM at both; the DOE Office of Science at ORNL, and the National Nuclear Security Administration at Y-12 (NNSA is the weapons part of DOE). The three DOE programs are “working together to the benefit of not only DOE’s scientific research and production missions but also its cleanup mission, which actually helps the other missions,” he added.

Olds said that ORNL and Y-12 need land for new buildings to carry out new missions and to replace out-of-date facilities that are, in some cases, 60 to 80 years old.

“So, we’re cleaning up a lot of land, clearing out old infrastructure, and removing hazards so modern labs and other facilities can be built” for science and defense missions, he said. Unlike the case at K-25, he added, “We won’t provide any of that land to the community for redevelopment, but we will give the clean land back to DOE programs.”

He noted that the EM cleanup work at ORNL and Y-12 protects the workforce and the public because it prevents the toxic material, including uranium and transuranium elements, from being dispersed and released to the air.

Olds said that equipment and soil that are highly contaminated are transported to the federal disposal facility at the Nevada Test Site or other facilities in Texas and Utah.

“Other material that’s really not contaminated with either chemicals or radiological materials we dispose of here on site because it is basically construction waste,” he said.

Olds was asked about the fate of mercury-contaminated equipment in Y-12 buildings, where in the 1950s and 1960s mercury was used to enable the separation of lithium isotopes. The purpose was to provide the federal government with lithium-6 to help create a more explosive hydrogen bomb.

Olds said that wall material and equipment contaminated with mercury is sent off-site but other building materials not tainted with mercury are disposed of onsite. He noted that tearing down these buildings might set some mercury free.

“Once you start mobilizing mercury, it’s good to have a way to capture it,” Olds said. He added that the recently completed Mercury Treatment Plant will trap mercury and keep it from entering East Fork Poplar Creek.

Olds said when it’s time to demolish a building, continuous air monitors are placed in an array around the building to determine whether contaminant levels rise when demolition begins. If so, UCOR workers will add a stabilizing chemical called a fixative, spray more water on the building, or “stop demolition until the levels come down enough,” he added. “The whole idea is to keep from putting more pollutants in the air.”

DOE’s environmental management, or cleanup, mission is a massive, significant and long-term financial liability for the U.S. government, Olds said. But at an estimated cost of $450 billion, it is less of a burden to the federal government than are Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the national debt.

“We’re removing a legacy of the past that is also a liability,” Olds concluded. “We are cleaning up the environment not only for the people here today but also for future generations.”","https://www.oakridger.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/03/NOAK/87585153007-oak-ridge-reservation-with-sites-copy.jpg?crop=1768,994,x0,y0&width=1768&height=994&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-04 11:10:10.057097

“Sunset Terrace is just one more example of how we’re turning our sustainability goals into tangible results.","Sunset Terrace — the historic home of Oakland University President Ora Hirsch Pescovitz, M.D. — has become the first building on the university’s Rochester campus to be powered entirely by renewable green energy. The achievement marks a major step forward in OU’s ongoing commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship.

“Sustainability is one of the core values that guides our university,” said President Pescovitz. “This project demonstrates how Oakland University can lead by example — investing in clean energy solutions that reduce our carbon footprint and inspire future generations to build a more sustainable world. By blending historic preservation with cutting-edge clean energy solutions, Oakland University is showing what’s possible

when tradition meets progress.”

A Landmark Renewable Energy Project

The transformation of Sunset Terrace was made possible through the installation of a 100-kilowatt photovoltaic (PV) solar system, designed and engineered by Michigan Solar Solutions (MSS). The ground-mounted solar array generates approximately 112,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity each year — enough to supply 100% of the home’s annual energy needs, including heating and cooling through high-efficiency electric heat pumps.

During the summer months, when solar production exceeds the home’s energy consumption, surplus electricity is exported back to the grid through an electric smart meter operated by DTE Energy.

“This is an important milestone for Oakland University,” said Rafi Bayrakdarian, director of engineering and energy for OU Facilities Management. “The Sunset Terrace solar project demonstrates how renewable energy investments can deliver both environmental and financial benefits. The clean energy generated will offset approximately 80 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year — equivalent to removing 20 gasoline-powered vehicles from the road or planting more than 1,200 tree seedlings that grow for a decade.”

Smart Investment, Real Savings

The financial feasibility of the project was strengthened through the Elective Pay option in the Section 48E Energy Investment Tax Credit, part of the federal Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. This program allows tax-exempt institutions like Oakland University to benefit directly from federal clean energy incentives. Through this initiative, Oakland University is expected to receive an estimated $95,000 credit to support the project.

After the credit, the project’s total cost will be $220,000. The project is expected to generate approximately $16,000 in annual energy savings, resulting in a payback period of less than 14 years.

Honoring History While Building a Sustainable Future

Sunset Terrace, completed in 1953, was originally built as the retirement home of Oakland University’s founders and benefactors, Alfred and Matilda Wilson. Designed by architect William Kapp of Smith, Hinchman &amp; Grylls, the 11,400-square-foot residence exemplifies a prairie-style design inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright. With its curvilinear architecture, extensive glasswork, and integration with the surrounding Meadow Brook Estate, Sunset Terrace has long served as a symbol of elegance and hospitality.

Over the decades, the home has hosted notable university leaders, artists, and guests — from the university’s first chancellor, D.B. “Woody” Varner, to world-renowned pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy. Now, with the addition of state-of-the-art solar technology, Sunset Terrace’s legacy continues in a new way — as a beacon of innovation and sustainability.

A Model for Campus Sustainability

The Sunset Terrace solar installation joins a growing list of green initiatives at Oakland University, including energy-efficient building upgrades, campus recycling programs, and sustainability-focused research and coursework. OU’s Facilities Management team continues to explore additional renewable energy projects across campus, helping the university reduce its environmental impact while promoting a culture of sustainability.

“Our goal is to make every project — big or small — contribute to a cleaner, more efficient campus,” Bayrakdarian said. “Sunset Terrace is just one more example of how we’re turning our sustainability goals into tangible results. By harnessing renewable energy at Sunset Terrace, we’re demonstrating Oakland University’s commitment to innovation, environmental stewardship, and a greener future for our campus community.""",https://www.oakland.edu/media/Oakland/template-assets/Header-Footer/Images/og-logo-blk.png,N,,2025-12-04 11:10:25.306477

Arizonans rank the cost of living as the top issue the state government should address, with around 1 in 4 specifically worried about electricity costs.

The survey, conducted with the support of Lincoln Room Strategies and 270 Strategies, comes on the heels of Governor Hobbs’ announcement of the Arizona Energy Promise Task Force, which will focus on lowering energy costs, reducing regulatory burdens and identifying solutions for addressing energy demand across the state.

“Arizonans are feeling strained by rising costs and clearly want more affordable clean power as our state’s electricity needs continue to grow,” said Kevin Moran, Associate Vice President for Regional Affairs at EDF and Member of Governor Hobbs’ new Energy Promise Task Force. “Solar and wind energy offer the fastest and most affordable ways to bring more electricity supply to the grid – and they use less water than fossil fuel projects. Clean energy also creates income opportunities for landowners who lease their land to projects, and it can generate new tax revenue in communities for schools, roads and emergency services.”

The survey of 1,525 respondents was fielded October 30-November 5 and found that Arizonans want fewer restrictions on solar and wind, including bans or limitations on where these projects can be built:

The majority of Arizonans believe that state policies that restrict renewable energy discourage economic growth and end up costing Arizonans more in the long run.

A strong majority (76%), across Democrats, Republicans and Independents, agree that landowners should be able to lease some of their land to solar and wind projects for income, without lawmakers getting in the way.

“The findings underline that Governor Hobbs is rightly focused on unleashing Arizona’s energy potential,” said Moran. “State leaders should find ways to cut red tape around clean energy projects – rather than adding more – to keep electricity costs down and reliably power our homes and growing economy well into the future.”

In August, three Arizona utilities broke records for peak electricity demand – recording the highest-ever electricity usage – amid extreme heat. Arizona utilities estimate significant electricity needs over the next 15 years, largely due to the construction of data centers, with some utilities projecting a 40% increase in peak demand.

Arizona Public Service is asking state regulators to approve a 14% rate increase – about $20 per month – to pay for rising demand. Tucson Electric Power is also seeking a 14% increase, which it says would add about $16 per month.

Governor Katie Hobbs signed Executive Order 2025-13 Removing Barriers to Delivering Affordable Energy for Arizona in September, which established the Arizona Energy Promise Taskforce. The Taskforce will create plans to facilitate large-scale economic growth while identifying potential ways to prevent significant increases in Arizonans’ energy costs, expand Arizona’s clean energy economy and use state lands for energy infrastructure.

Meanwhile, building up enough gas and nuclear plants to power data centers may prove too slow and expensive.
With federal subsidies for wind and solar plants ending by 2028, some won’t pencil economically.
Officials could trip up other projects as well, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group.
When Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill gutted green energy subsidies, Wood Mackenzie lowered its projection for renewable power plants, but only by 8%.","The Trump administration is moving to fast-track the construction of power-hungry data centers as a matter of national security. At the same time, it’s adding roadblocks for new solar and wind farms.

But the two policies could be at odds: Hindering renewable energy projects risks slowing the AI boom - and could exacerbate rising electricity prices, a slew of data suggests.

“It’s an all-hands-on-deck moment right now to get the power to supply this,” said Robert Whaley, director of North American power at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consultancy. “In the next 10 years, there’s really nothing to replace renewables.”

The AI explosion - and its energy demands - is happening much faster than the pace at which utilities typically plan and build large power plants. In response, tech giants like Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have taken extreme measures to keep up, cobbling together data centers in tents and signing contracts for their own power plants.

Renewable energy so far remains the fastest and cheapest option to add power to the grid. Nearly 80% of the planned power plant capacity in the pipeline is tied to renewable sources, according to filings with federal regulators and grid operators compiled by Cleanview.co, an energy data company.

The number of applications for natural gas and nuclear facilities, the options President Donald Trump is embracing to power the AI surge, is much smaller, making up about 14% of planned capacity.

The dynamic creates a potential political challenge for Trump, whose goal of using the AI boom as an engine for the American economy risks blowback at the ballot box if voters blame the data centers he's championed for higher power bills.

AI’s voracious need for electricity is likely to keep renewables growing, but every thwarted green energy project means fewer electrons added to the grid to ease the supply crunch, analysts say.

That’s not to say natural gas, the most viable and cheapest of the president’s preferred energy sources, won’t play a role in powering AI: Unlike solar and wind, which are intermittent, gas can provide the large, around-the-clock power supply data centers require. Meta, for example, is relying on the fuel to power its hulking four million-square-foot data center complex in northeastern Louisiana.

And the glut of green power applications can be traced to subsidies afforded through the Inflation Reduction Act, which Trump administration officials argue meddled in the market and discouraged investment in gas plants.

“President Trump is expanding base load power from reliable energy sources like natural gas, coal and nuclear to support growing electricity demand from AI and data centers,” said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson. “Intermittent and unreliable energy sources like offshore wind that were propped up by the Green New Scam simply cannot generate the sustained power needed to make the United States the global leader in cutting-edge technologies like AI and quantum computing.”

But the cost to build solar and wind farms plummeted in the years before those incentives were scrapped. Meanwhile, building up enough gas and nuclear plants to power data centers may prove too slow and expensive. Gas turbines, critical equipment to turn natural gas into electricity, are in short supply, and even though Trump is moving to accelerate permitting of the next generation of small-modular nuclear reactors, the next wave of those aren't expected to be built until the end of the decade at the earliest.

A growing mismatch

In the US, power consumption from data centers is expected to nearly triple by 2035, according to BloombergNEF. The surge, along with rising demands from manufacturing and electrification, is akin to the US having to power up to 190 million new homes by 2040, according to the American Clean Power Association, a trade group.

Coal probably won’t move the needle much. At this point, power from a new coal plant would cost at least $71 per megawatt-hour of capacity, compared with around $38 for solar or wind, according to Lazard Inc. And they take far longer to build.

Meanwhile, the amount of energy that can be squeezed out of incumbent coal plants - either through increased utilization or delayed retirement - is modest, according to BloombergNEF.

Even after recent policy shifts, including a $625 million grant program to subsidize coal, Wood Mackenzie expects US megawatts from the fuel to decline every year going forward.

Natural gas is more cost competitive at the moment and quicker than coal to build. Gas is tied to 13% of capacity from planned power plants, which are proposed to come online over the next 10 years or so, according to Cleanview.co data. However, that lever can’t be pulled much farther, at least in the short term. Some 70% of the world’s gas turbines come from just three companies; their inventory is largely spoken for over the next decade and they’ve shown little appetite to add capacity.

Nuclear, which Trump is promoting by speeding up regulatory approvals and committing at least $80 billion to develop reactors, is making a comeback, albeit a tiny one.

At this point, battery storage systems, solar arrays and wind farms are faster and cheaper to build per kilowatt of capacity than anything else, according to Lazard.

Most solar, batteries and wind farms don’t require lengthy air-quality permits, and thus take less than five years to complete. Some are built within a year-and-a-half, according to BloombergNEF. The timeline for deploying natural gas plants is three-and-half to five years on average, and will likely grow longer due to supply chain backlogs, it said. Lead times for utility-scale gas-fired plants have stretched by 35%, or more than a year, since 2023, its analysis shows.

It follows that more than nine out 10 power plants in the pipeline - roughly 5,700 facilities - are tied to renewables, according to Cleanview.co.

Cleanview founder and CEO Michael Thomas notes many of those plans were drawn up during Biden’s presidency and ultimately won’t make it to completion. With federal subsidies for wind and solar plants ending by 2028, some won’t pencil economically. Others are placeholders for utilities that will decide later which fuel source to go with.

For example, the largest planned solar complex in North America - a collection of projects called Esmeralda Seven - had its environmental permit review cancelled by the US Interior Department in October. Developers will need to apply for individual approval from an administration that isn’t in favor of big solar projects on federal land.

Officials could trip up other projects as well, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group. It estimates that new solar and energy storage projects, which make up more than half of new power plant proposals, haven’t been fully permitted and are at risk.

Still, applications are a measure of intent and the feasibility of various options. Despite the rhetoric from the White House, a lot of renewable projects are likely to get the green light because AI developers are moving so quickly, Thomas said. Indeed, delays for new solar plants are in decline, according to federal data.

“There’s a lot of theater around this - what the Trump administration says and then what it does,” he added. “Things are still getting permitted and built. And people are just trying to fly under the radar.”

The head of one of the biggest renewable energy developers in the US told investors on Nov. 5 that the data center industry still wants clean energy to power its operations.

“Look, that's what can get built in this window,"" said Andres Gluski, CEO of AES Corp. ""There can be talk about nuclear or other technologies; those take years to build. So what is going to meet the majority of the demand? Well, this year it's probably going to be 90% renewables and batteries, and it very likely will be next year as well.""

The big tech companies are signing power contracts with natural gas to get round-the-clock power, but say they are still committed to their clean energy goals. As some hyperscalers sign deals to pipe in natural gas directly into their facilities, they are buying contracts for clean power projects that will result in more renewable energy hitting the grid, according to BloombergNEF analyst Nayel Brihi. In the first half of 2025, Meta, Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Google contracted for 9.6 gigawatts of clean energy, or the equivalent of 7.2 million homes, to be delivered to the US over the coming years.

Ultimately, the mismatch between the speed at which companies are building data centers and that at which electricity generation is coming online bodes well for renewable energy. When Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill gutted green energy subsidies, Wood Mackenzie lowered its projection for renewable power plants, but only by 8%. By 2034, the company expects US utilities to add another 666 gigawatts of power from solar, storage and wind, compared with just 126 gigawatts of gas-fired electricity.

Whaley, at Wood Mackenzie, doesn’t expect Trump to stop publicly opposing renewable energy. However, away from the microphones, in the thorny weeds of energy policy, he figures conservative policymakers may quietly tolerate a deeper shade of green. Indeed, this year through September, renewable sources comprised 89% of new electrical generating capacity, according to the Energy Information Administration.

“MAGA has to be MAGA; they have to keep the base fired up,” Whaley said. “But privately, I think there will be concessions, because they don’t want to lose the AI race to China.”

BlueCruise requires an active plan or trial – see ford.com/bluecruise or lincoln.com/technology/bluecruise for details.
2Based on internal Ford data on BlueCruise engagement in the United States between Jan. 1, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2024.","Hitting the open road for the holiday season is a trend that continues to grow with more folks opting to travel by car to avoid the hassles of flying.

Last year, AAA projected nearly 90% of holiday travelers would drive to their destination over the year-end holiday period from Saturday, Dec. 21 to Wednesday, Jan. 1.

Increasingly, people are using the weekend before the holidays to get to their destination, whether it’s to go on vacation or over the river and through the woods to grandmother's house.

This was evident in our BlueCruise data from the last two years.1 The Saturday ahead of the week of Dec. 25 (2024) and ahead of Thanksgiving week (2023) were the days with the most miles logged out of the entire year.

Last year, the day with the most miles and hours driven by Ford and Lincoln customers was Saturday, Dec. 21, when 610,000 hands-free highway miles were logged.1 That added up to 8,600 hours spent using BlueCruise that day alone.2

That’s an increase of over 50% from 2023’s peak, which was 400,000 hands-free miles driven on Saturday, Nov. 18, heading into Thanksgiving week.3

This data tells us customers are using the weekend to get to their destination so they can enjoy the full holiday week, and they’re traveling further distances to one destination, perhaps to maximize time with family and friends. For these folks, BlueCruise is providing enhanced comfort on long holiday hauls, helping them arrive refreshed and ready for the festivities.

To give us a glimpse into what we can expect this year, around 84% of Ford owners are planning to use BlueCruise to take a road trip over the holiday season. Of those people who have made their plans already, nearly 30% are planning to head out on Saturday, Dec. 20, according to a voluntary survey of a group of owners with BlueCruise-equipped vehicles.4

Many are traveling across the country, some for annual family gatherings and some to enjoy some quiet time in the mountains. Here are a few tales we’re hearing directly from customers.

Texas to Kansas (95% hands-free highway driving with BlueCruise)

Mike P. is traveling with his wife and yellow lab Patrick to their family’s annual Christmas spectacular, which brings together over 50 people.

“We travel to Kansas every year for the holidays, but this year we are excited to go in our new 2025 Expedition Max Ultimate and use BlueCruise to help make the 7-hour road trip easier,” he said.

Over the week, they’ll enjoy BBQ, a football game, and their annual white elephant gift exchange.

Florida to North Carolina (90%+ hands-free highway driving with BlueCruise)

Ronnie C. is a seasoned road-tripper taking advantage of the holiday break to head north with his family for some time in the mountains and snow.

“We love going on road trips, especially with the F-150 Lightning!” he said. The family takes advantage of the available Wi-Fi® hotspot so the kids can use their tablets to stay entertained on the 8+ hour drive.

“Just recently, we used BlueCruise on a trip to North Carolina to go camping, and it definitely helped relieve some of the stress during the stop-and-go traffic we had to deal with on the highway, so I am looking forward to using it again,” he said. “When we got to our camp site, we also used Pro Power Onboard to power space heaters to keep us warm, cook, and even let the kids enjoy some Xbox.”.

Virginia to Ohio (70%+ hands-free highway driving with BlueCruise)

Cecilio B. just bought a 2025 F-150 Lightning and is headed to Ohio with his wife and son for their annual trip to the family’s farm.

“We just did a quick road trip to Washington, D.C. with BlueCruise and loved it,"" he said. ""I am looking forward to using BlueCruise for the first time on our annual holiday trip since it takes around 9 hours to get there, then enjoying good food and music during the week, since I am a retired chef and my son is a music major.""

The growing demand for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) further suggests this trend isn’t going to slow down. In 2025, hands-free highway driving capability was the most wanted feature for 43% of new vehicle intenders, up 20% since 2024, according to an AutoPacific study.

With over 1 million BlueCruise-equipped vehicles on the road, we anticipate even more folks will opt to use it during the upcoming holidays.

Before we close out the year, check out the hands-free highway driving trends we saw in 2024 across the U.S. from Ford and Lincoln owners. I’m even more excited to see what this year’s data is going to tell us.

The most recent data shows that Britain has the highest industrial energy prices out of any International Energy Agency member country, with prices 46% higher than the IEA median.
For example, when used alongside a heat pump, solar thermal provides the ‘preheat’ for the heat pump.
Manufacturers do not need to wait for grid upgrades or electricity prices to fall to decarbonise.
Heat is the sleeping giant of the energy transition that gives manufacturers more on-site control and financial certainty.","It’s a tough time to be a manufacturer. Whether it’s Trump’s tariffs, supply chain issues raising costs or falling demand, the recent UK Purchasing Manager’s Index reflects the struggles that our manufacturing industry is facing. With this in mind, it’s hardly surprising that more manufacturers are looking to renewable energy to help lower costs and enhance decarbonisation in manufacturing. They’re quite right to think this way.

Natural gas prices are forecast to increase in 2025 and 2026, and the lack of progress in ceasefire negotiations between Russia and Ukraine means that the price volatility of the past four years will not cease.

The only way for manufacturers to increase their resilience to price rises is to switch to renewables. The main driver of this so far has been electrification, and the pace of its growth has been staggering. In the first half of this year, the UK produced a record 9.91 TWh through solar power, while gas fell to just 21% of electricity in June.

This will continue to drive net zero, especially for domestic usage, but for manufacturers, the situation is a little bit more complicated.

First, the power system is congested, with long connection queues and uncertain timelines. Queues and constraints are now a business risk. If your plant needs a bigger connection, you could be waiting years, and paying for the privilege.

Second, this congestion isn’t going anywhere, as demand for electricity is set to soar. The National Grid estimates it will rise by 50% by 2035, driven by the adoption of AI, EVs and electric heating systems like heat pumps.

Third, electricity prices for manufacturers are skyrocketing. The most recent data shows that Britain has the highest industrial energy prices out of any International Energy Agency member country, with prices 46% higher than the IEA median.

This is not to say that we shouldn’t continue to invest in clean power. We should – it’s delivered numerous benefits so far, and these will only get bigger.

But the current plans by the National Grid to upgrade its network across the country is set to cost up to £35bn from 2026 to 2031.

What is currently missing is a strategic focus on heat decarbonisation.

In British industry, heat makes up around 70% of total energy demand. Across the whole economy, heat accounts for 37% of the UK’s carbon emissions (17% from space heating and 14% from industrial heat). While electrification has been in focus so far, heat really is the sleeping giant of the transition.

Decarbonising heat quickly and at scale has proven to be very hard for the commercial and industrial sector. For decades they experienced a heavy reliance on natural gas and switching to a technology mix often comes with high capital costs.

In the case of electrification they are faced with the known energy infrastructure constraints, and this dilemma has only been enhanced in the past by uncertainty around policy and regulatory issues.

However, businesses can generate heat directly at the point of use with ‘grid-edge’ renewable heat technologies. These are customer-side solutions that deliver energy without the need to pull power from the grid.

Solar thermal is a good example. Rather than traditional solar PV panels, which generate electricity, solar thermal collectors convert sunlight into heat, which can be stored in hot water tanks for easy usage for industrial processes, domestic hot water as well as space heating.

This has numerous benefits. First, there is significantly less red tape involved with their installation, because they don’t need to join the queue to connect to the grid. In theory, there’s nothing to stop commercial & industrial companies installing solar thermal on their roofs to start decarbonising their heat demand tomorrow.

Second, they are complementary to the existing electrification push, as they make existing electrification efforts more efficient. A large-scale deployment of solar thermal would free up the grid significantly and ensure that precious green electricity is used in the most efficient and responsible way for example to charge EVs and meet the almost unsatisfiable demand of AI data centres.

One key strength of this technology is that it is compatible with a range of other heating technologies and makes these more efficient. For example, when used alongside a heat pump, solar thermal provides the ‘preheat’ for the heat pump. This means it improves the Coefficient of Performance of it, as the heat pump only needs to top up the pre heat to get to the target temperature, which translates to less pressures on the electricity grid.

Finally, these technologies also provide cheaper and more predictable costs. Rather than relying on volatile gas or electricity prices, there are numerous finance vehicles for grid-edge heat technology, such as heat-as-a-Service agreements, that lock in the operational costs of heat for 10 years or longer. This frees up capital which can be invested into other areas of the business.

Electrification will still be the main way of achieving net zero, but it’s becoming clear that it can’t do it alone. Manufacturers do not need to wait for grid upgrades or electricity prices to fall to decarbonise.

Heat is the sleeping giant of the energy transition that gives manufacturers more on-site control and financial certainty. The technologies are proven, the contracts exist, and the payoff is cost, carbon and competitiveness – there’s no need to wait anymore.",http://themanufacturer-cdn-1.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/03150531/TM-Blog-Header-Featured-Image-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 11:08:46.931290

Converting momentum into measurable methane reductions Brazil’s new collaboration with CATF and Carbon Mapper demonstrates real momentum toward tackling waste methane.","At COP30, the Government of Brazil announced the launch of a process to develop a first-of-its-kind national initiative to detect and mitigate methane emissions from the country’s waste sector, in collaboration with Clean Air Task Force (CATF), Carbon Mapper, and local partners. The effort will use emerging satellite and remote sensing technologies to identify high-emitting landfill and dumpsite locations and put actionable data into the hands of operators and municipal authorities.

This announcement marks a major step in Brazil’s methane leadership. It also highlights a broader opportunity. The waste sector represents one of the most cost-effective and politically actionable levers for near-term climate progress. As Brazil moves from commitment to implementation, new analysis from CATF and Instituto PNRS offers a detailed view of where policy reform, investment, and capacity building can drive further mitigation.

The waste sector has outsized climate impact and immediate mitigation potential

Methane is responsible for roughly 25 percent of Brazil’s total greenhouse gas emissions, and the waste sector contributes about 15 percent of national methane emissions, driven largely by the decomposition of organic waste in landfills and open dumps.

In 2023, Brazil generated 78 million tons of municipal solid waste, nearly half of which consisted of organic material. Yet only 36 percent of the population has access to separate collection services, and around 26 percent of collected waste continues to be sent to inadequate disposal sites. Approximately 9 percent of waste generated is not collected at all and is burned or dumped illegally.

These conditions make waste methane one of the country’s most concentrated and addressable climate challenges.

New CATF analysis identifies strategic gaps and high-impact opportunities

The Brazilian Waste Sector Methane Analysis, examines national waste generation, emissions, policy frameworks, and institutional capacity, identifying where the biggest opportunities for reduction lie. Key findings include:

Significant infrastructure gaps remain. Brazil still has roughly 2,000 inadequate disposal sites in operation and large regional disparities in access to separate collection and treatment capacity.

Limited enforcement and technical capacity hinder implementation of existing federal mandates, including the National Solid Waste Policy’s requirement to close open dumps.

Data and financial gaps restrict the ability of municipalities to plan and deploy composting, anaerobic digestion, and landfill methane capture.

Near-term mitigation technologies are established and scalable, including landfill gas capture, biocovers, improved landfill operations, and expanded organic waste treatment.

Examples across Brazil show the potential for progress. Brazil’s early experience with landfill gas recovery has already contributed to its first recorded year-over-year decline in solid-waste methane emissions. With strategic investment and implementation support, these reductions can accelerate.

A critical moment for policy reform and targeted investment

Brazil already has a strong policy foundation for waste and methane management, including the National Solid Waste Policy, PLANARES, and the Zero Dumpsites Program. But the report finds that enforcement, financing, and capacity remain uneven, particularly at the municipal level.

The development of the satellite-based initiative announced at COP30 is an important step toward building that capacity-and demonstrating that such a program is possible at the national level-but broader structural reforms will be needed to deliver sustained emissions reductions.

The report recommends several priority actions to strengthen Brazil’s broader waste methane mitigation efforts, including:

Updating and enforcing landfill regulations, including new rules for landfill operations, methane use, and waste segregation at the source

Expanding organic waste diversion and treatment, including composting, mechanical–biological treatment, and anaerobic digestion, supported through targeted policies, public awareness campaigns, and incentives for waste reduction and recycling

Supporting methane capture and energy recovery at sanitary landfills, including the adoption of biocovers and mandatory methane recovery systems where viable

Providing training and technical support for municipal authorities and waste professionals to strengthen operational practices and improve implementation of methane mitigation strategies

Improving data systems, including standardized protocols for methane measurement and systems to monitor emissions across disposal sites

Strengthening financing mechanisms, such as waste-fee systems and public–private partnerships, to help municipalities cover ongoing operational costs and invest in new infrastructure

These steps would help Brazil advance its stated climate targets, improve public health, and strengthen waste services across regions.

WasteMAP provides a foundation for long-term implementation support

The Brazilian assessment is part of a broader series of Waste Sector Methane Analysis reports for Ecuador, Mexico, and Colombia, produced as part of CATF and RMI’s Waste Methane Assessment Platform (WasteMAP). WasteMAP is an open platform that brings together waste methane emissions data with decision-support tools, supported by direct engagement with national and subnational governments, waste sector officials, and other key decision makers. The aim is to build capacity, improve data systems, and help governments accelerate methane mitigation in the waste sector.

Converting momentum into measurable methane reductions

Brazil’s new collaboration with CATF and Carbon Mapper demonstrates real momentum toward tackling waste methane. The Waste Sector Methane Analysis shows, however, that further progress will hinge on empowering municipalities, which are responsible for implementing waste policies, improving collection systems, closing dumpsites, and expanding treatment capacity. With targeted investment and continued national support, Brazil can turn better detection into measurable methane reductions and a stronger, more modern waste systems.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/03133426/cop30-brazil-wastemethane.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 14:01:30.461964

The Curtailing Litigation Excess and Abuse Reform Act of 2025, H.R. 6352 / S. 3305, also known as the CLEAR Act, would eliminate excessive litigation against energy projects while maintaining stringent environmental standards.

U.S. Rep. Troy Balderson (R-OH) sponsored H.R. 6352 while U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) led the identical S. 3305 in his chamber.

“Activist groups have long weaponized our legal system to attack promising energy projects, filing lawsuit after lawsuit to grind progress to a halt. The CLEAR Act puts an end to this serial litigation,” Balderson said. “To unleash American energy, lower costs, and strengthen our energy security, we must restore predictability and common sense to our permitting system.”

If enacted, the CLEAR Act would prevent activist groups from filing serial lawsuits to block projects they oppose ideologically, while still preserving legitimate avenues for oversight and enforcement.

The bill also would ensure that once a court has ruled on an energy project, opponents can’t drag it back into court repeatedly, according to a bill summary provided by the lawmakers.

Additionally, the measure would enable critical energy infrastructure to be built faster by limiting costly delays, helping to create certainty for investors and communities, the summary says.

Exceptions also would be maintained for certain lawsuits after a project is running, and lawmakers said the bill would support energy independence, grid reliability, and access to critical minerals needed for modern technology.

The ecological impact of climate change is no longer a distant warning, but an urgent, real-world challenge—one that calls for solutions that combine technological strength with a sense of responsibility.

Cross-sector Collaboration: Tongwei + WWF

In China’s ongoing push to achieve its dual-carbon goals through renewable energy, Tongwei has positioned itself as a company committed to both solar PV technology and ecological responsibility. The company recently entered into a strategic partnership with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), becoming:

the first private Chinese enterprise to join WWF’s Arctic conservation program, and the first PV manufacturer to enter a long-term climate and energy cooperation with WWF. This sets a new benchmark for the industry.

This groundbreaking collaboration is not only a key step in Tongwei’s global strategy to address ecological challenges, but also an important example of China’s green forces participating in international environmental governance. By integrating WWF’s ecological research expertise with Tongwei’s PV industrial capabilities, the partnership aims to explore replicable models for synergistic development between renewable energy and ecological protection.

Responsibility in Action: World-class PV Manufacturing Strength

Tongwei’s commitment to ecological protection stems from more than 40 years of deep and smart industrial expertise. On the manufacturing side, Tongwei's Meishan Cell Factory No. 4—recognized as the world’s first “Lighthouse Factory” in the PV cell sector—has established a full-process “one cell, one code” traceability system. With AI and big-data applications, the plant achieves lower lifecycle energy consumption and higher operational efficiency, providing verifiable, high-quality assurance for high-performance modules.

On the product side, Tongwei’s TNC 2.0 modules deliver outstanding performance under extreme conditions, with outdoor yields significantly higher than industry averages. The next-generation TNC 3.0 modules further achieve breakthroughs in conversion efficiency, system performance, and lifetime value—emerging as powerful “energy tools” for ecological conservation.

At the cooperation launch event, Liu Shuqi, Chairwoman and CEO of Tongwei Co., stated that advancing the deep integration of green energy and ecological protection is not only a long-term undertaking, but also a solemn commitment to the future.

From full lifecycle carbon-footprint certification to ongoing smart manufacturing innovation, Tongwei is transforming its green manufacturing strength into tangible environmental action.

Technical Validation: From the Plateau to the Arctic

Supported by robust manufacturing capabilities, Tongwei has already tested its products in extreme conditions on the Tibetan Plateau—and is now extending these efforts to the Arctic.

At altitudes over 4,500 meters, Tongwei’s off-grid PV systems have brought clean power to the “Roof of the World.” Since 2018, the company has continuously donated off-grid systems to the “Qinghai–Xizang Green Post Stations.” The TNC (TOPCon) series, with its high cold resistance and excellent reliability, supplies uninterrupted 24-hour electricity to stations such as the Sonam Dargry Protection Station in Hoh Xil and monitoring points in Sanjiangyuan, addressing the persistent issue of inadequate power supply in harsh environments.

Now, this experience is being extended to the Arctic. Tongwei’s partnership with WWF focuses on enhancing the resilience of Arctic ecosystems, jointly conducting environmental monitoring and supporting long-term research on multi-year sea ice distribution and trends. The collaboration also explores mechanisms for harmonious coexistence between humans and the Arctic ecosystem, and promotes sustainable involvement of local communities in conservation efforts.

To ensure effective implementation, the project will advance in phases: enhancing public awareness and engagement on climate issues through multi-channel communication, and leveraging Tongwei’s strong PV industrial capabilities to encourage broader stakeholder participation in systemic climate-change solutions and build societal consensus on biodiversity protection.

The Tongwei–WWF partnership is not merely a collaboration between a corporation and a global NGO—it is a demonstration of China’s PV industry contributing to global ecological governance.

For the industry, Tongwei’s Lighthouse Factory standards and advanced TNC module technologies have created a unique pathway of “technology reserves – scientific collaboration – ecological protection.” By participating deeply in Arctic scientific research, Tongwei sets an example of how PV enterprises can assume ecological responsibilities.

For the world, Tongwei—representing China’s renewable-energy leadership—is offering an actionable “Chinese approach” to international environmental cooperation through its combination of technological support and global engagement.

More importantly, Tongwei is putting into practice the concept that “lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets.” As the world confronts the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss, Tongwei is lowering the cost of green energy through technological innovation and working with partners worldwide to advance practical and effective conservation actions.",https://www.energytrend.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/通威×WWF：用光伏力量为北极续冰.png,N,,2025-12-04 11:08:53.024514

‘A make-or-break moment’

According to the letter, which was penned to Stéphane Séjourné, Executive Vice-President for Prosperity and Industrial Strategy, and Jessika Roswall, Commissioner for Environment, Water Resilience, and a Competitive Circular Economy, the European battery industry is experiencing a ‘true make-or-break moment’, which will require ‘strong policies’ to ensure investment certainty.

‘If gotten right, battery carbon footprint rules can serve as a key lever in this regard, rewarding local manufacturing,’ they state. ‘However, instead, significant delays are leading to stalled investments in Europe, where companies need visibility to take final investment decisions and scale battery factories effectively. In the meantime, blocked negotiations only serve to divide both EU member states and the industry.

‘The key objective of the battery carbon footprint should be to capitalise on the increasingly clean EU grid in order to improve the competitive position of EU battery manufacturing as a whole.’

Low-emission grid

Noting that the EU’s electricity grid is at least a fifth greener than that of China, the groups argue that the carbon footprint rules should take advantage of the emissions profile of the grid, with a methodology based on the EU-wide grid average likely to strengthen the position of domestic manufacturers.

National grid averages, however, would ‘distort the internal market’, while power purchase agreements would weaken the comparative advantage of the EU over other regions, they state.

‘With this in mind, we are calling on Member States and the European Commission to agree to a fair and ambitious compromise that can support the development of Europe’s battery value chain, as soon as possible,’ the letter reads. ‘We, the signatories, propose using the EU electricity grid average as a compromise between all sides, and in support of the wider EU cleantech industrial agenda.’ Read more here and here.",https://api.mightyshare.io/v1/MSarYrCRgtflDS1W/068f2610cc921c300d072f3a7d8fdeb055e57315811fb0fde60f7fe5e693e700/jpeg?cache=true&height=630&width=1200&template=news-1&template_values=%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22google_font%22%2C%22google_font%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo_width%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22primary_color%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%231e6000%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fsustainabilityonline.net%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2024%252F12%252Flogo-white.png%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22background%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fsustainabilityonline.net%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2025%252F12%252Feurope-5377159_1280.jpg%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22title%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22Groups%2520call%2520for%2520carbon%2520footprint%2520rules%2520for%2520EU%2527s%2520battery%2520value%2520chain%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22description%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D&page=https%3A%2F%2Fsustainabilityonline.net%2Fnews%2Fgroups-call-for-carbon-footprint-rules-for-eus-battery-value-chain,N,,2025-12-04 13:04:14.061393

Inside Clean Energy is ICN’s weekly bulletin of news and analysis about the energy transition.","Sales of new electric vehicles have plunged since federal tax credits ended on Sept. 30.

In November, EVs accounted for 5.3 percent of U.S. new-car and light-truck sales, a share that was less than half the record high in September, according to an estimate published last week by S&P Global Mobility.

The numbers were especially ugly on Tuesday when several automakers released their November figures. Ford said that unit sales of its Mustang Mach-E were down 49 percent compared to the same month in 2024. Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 was down 59 percent. I could go on.

But most industry analysts are not sounding an alarm. This is because the decline in sales was expected the moment in July that President Donald Trump signed the legislation that canceled the credit, which was up to $7,500 per vehicle. The law led to months of chaos, during which many consumers accelerated their purchasing decisions to qualify for the credit, contributing to the collapse that followed.

One of the main questions going forward is how long it will take for the market to return to some kind of normalcy. The most common answer I’m seeing is that the current shakeout will likely last well into 2026.

After that, we’ll get to the more important question: What happens next? To help figure this out, I spoke with Peter Slowik, U.S. passenger vehicles lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation, or ICCT, a research nonprofit with offices around the globe.

Researchers use different methods to calculate the total cost of ownership, making this a challenging metric to agree on. (Car and Driver published an overview this summer of the factors to watch.)

But there is little debate that the costs of EVs will continue to decrease, even with cuts to subsidies.

Automakers, who think in decade-plus time horizons, can see the way things are going. Each company is making strategic choices about how much to maintain gasoline and hybrid vehicle lineups, even as they know electric drivetrains will dominate the long-term future.

“We think this transition is inevitable, and the automakers that can [best navigate] this transition are the ones that are likely to win the race,” Slowik said. “They stand to win big, both at home, in terms of their domestic manufacturing volumes, and their sales shares relative to other automakers, but then also abroad.”

ICCT is a useful resource for understanding this moment. For starters, check out a Nov. 17 blog post that offers data-backed commentary on U.S. policy.

Any attempt to make predictions carries risk. If you’d asked me a year ago, I would not have guessed that Trump would be able to pass a repeal of the EV tax credits.

The credits largely benefited U.S.-based companies such as Tesla, Ford and General Motors, helping them gain a competitive edge over models assembled in other countries that were not eligible.

It didn’t make sense to remove the tax credits—and do so with such suddenness—except for the odd political reality of this year and the way the debate in Congress was dominated by fiscal hardliners.

But the push and pull of adding or subtracting subsidies will ultimately matter less than larger factors, such as the long-term decline in battery costs and the increase in battery efficiency.

In the meantime, the rough sales numbers are going to continue. Let’s reconvene next year at this time and we’ll have a better sense of what the recovery looks like.

“I think the automobile industry needs certainty. I think they’re tired of being a pingpong ball between administrations. The American industry needs stability,” she told POLITICO’s E&E News.

“All the stakeholders need to be at the table, and we need to not make cars more expensive for people to run. So let’s give stability to the auto industry and not help the oil industry.”

Numerous auto executives, including from Ford Motor and Stellantis, joined Trump at the White House on Wednesday to announce the proposal, including from Ford Motor and Stellantis.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, called the move one of Trump’s “regulatory gifts to his corrupt fossil fuel megadonors.”

“Trump is, yet again, choosing his billionaire buddies over the American people,” he said in a statement. “Thanks to his relentless attacks on cleaner vehicles, thousands of auto workers have lost their jobs, America has lagged back in international competition, and we’ll all be saddled with more pollution, higher costs, and worse vehicles.”

Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, similarly argued Trump is raising costs for drivers.

“The June 2024 [Corporate Average Fuel Economy] standards lowered costs for Americans at the pump, made our air cleaner and more breathable, and reduced pollution to combat climate change,” said Pallone.

Today’s announcement once again shows the Trump Administration is more concerned with lining the pockets of their polluter friends than providing relief to hardworking Americans.”

A number of Republicans attended the White House announement, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who sponsored a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to reduce automaker penalties for violating efficiency rules to $0.

“This is a victory today for consumers. This is a victory for affordability,” Cruz said. “Under Joe Biden and the Democrats, they put mandate after mandate after mandate on cars and trucks and they drove the prices up thousands and thousands of dollars.”

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, agreed.

“By making [cars] more affordable, making them more choice-driven by what families want and need, today is a great day for the American family,” she said.

“Democrats have used many different avenues, from blue state legislation to regulations at the EPA and Department of Transportation, to repeatedly attempt to force a transition to EVs that many Americans don’t want to buy,” Capito said in a statement after the White House event, adding that the standards “placed unnecessary burdens and higher prices on consumers.”

Trump invited to the event a number of lawmakers who currently own auto dealerships or used to, such as Reps. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) and Roger Williams (R-Texas), and Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio).

The latest call of the EU Innovation Fund has awarded four wind energy manufacturing projects. This is good news for Europe’s energy competitiveness and security. But the Innovation Fund is not yet giving enough support to direct electrification of industrial processes – a key pillar of the Clean Industrial Deal. A new call might change this now.

The European Commission has announced the results of its latest Innovation Fund call. 61 net-zero technology projects will receive funding. Four of them are wind manufacturing projects. They are spread across Europe with one project located in France, Denmark, Sweden and Spain, respectively.

WindEurope member BW Ideol will produce concrete floating foundations in Fos-sur-Mer, France. Two start-ups – Modvion and Voodin – will produce wind turbines more sustainably, using wooden towers and wooden rotor blades.

This is good news. The Commission continues to back wind manufacturing and secure Europe’s technological edge. The Innovation Fund must remain a tool to scale up wind manufacturing. Not only by upgrading existing facilities, but also by supporting new sites for clean technologies.

More support for electrification needed

Direct electrification of industrial processes is vital to decarbonise Europe’s industry. It is a core element of the Clean Industrial Deal. Europe is not doing enough to electrify its economy. Electrification rates have been flatlining at below 25%.

But the Innovation Fund’s general calls do not work well for electrification projects. These projects attract far less Innovation Fund support than technologies like carbon capture and storage (CCS) or hydrogen. In the last call, electrification projects got less than 3% of the available funding. This needs to change. Direct electrification is the cheapest and most efficient way to decarbonise Europe.

The Commission has now launched the Industrial Heat Auction, a new pilot mechanism with a €1bn budget for its pilot auction. It specifically targets the electrification of industrial process heat. The pilot Auction will be an important test case for the upcoming Industrial Decarbonisation Bank (IDB), expected in 2026, future funding model. The IDB is an EU financing instrument set to mobilise €100 billion for industrial decarbonisation through tools like carbon contracts and blended finance. If the pilot auction for industrial heat works, it can set the model for the Industrial Decarbonisation Bank next year. The Bank must focus on electrification.

Next calls open

The first Industrial Heat Auction and the 2025 general Innovation Fund calls – including clean tech manufacturing – are now open. Deadline for the auction is 19 February 2026. The deadline for applications for the general calls is 23 April 2026.

On 13 January 2026, WindEurope will host a members-only webinar on the general call.

Background:

The EU Innovation Fund supports innovative low-carbon technologies to help Europe reach climate neutrality by 2050. It has a €40bn budget for 2020-2030, funded with the revenues from the EU’s Emission Trading System (ETS).

Currently, LONGi possesses leading technologies in PV and hydrogen energy – with its HIBC cell efficiency reaching 27.81% and its ALK electrolyser capacity ranking first globally. This expansion into energy storage signifies the further enhancement of LONGi’s strategic layout, fully forming a closed-loop across the entire “Solar-Storage-Hydrogen” value chain.

Breaking new ground with “ultimate safety”: reshaping the logic of competition in energy storage

Energy storage is a crucial piece in the renewable energy system, and the industry is shifting from policy-driven to market-driven growth. Dennis She pointed out, “The current development stage of the energy storage industry is very similar to the early days of solar — confidence-driven rapid growth, but also bringing disorderly competition. The future dimension of competition in energy storage has evolved from ‘having the technology’ to ‘value reliability.'” He emphasised: ”Safety, reliability, and stability are the yardsticks for measuring energy storage solutions, and are also the cornerstone for winning the long-term trust of the market and customers.”

To uphold the value proposition of “Ultimate Safety”, LONGi has chosen to engage in deep collaboration with PotisEdge, an expert in energy storage safety. Adhering to a three-pillar technical architecture of “intrinsic safety, active defence, and intelligent early warning,” and through its fully self-developed “5S” energy storage system with unique BMS and iCCS designs, PotisEdge has maintained a safety record of “zero thermal runaway” incidents across more than 12GWh of cumulative energy storage and power battery systems over the past decade. This will provide solid technical support for LONGi’s energy storage solutions.

Establishing the first Solar-Storage Technology Innovation Centre in Europe

To accelerate Europe’s energy transition, LONGi officially announced the establishment of its first Solar-Storage Technology Innovation Centre (Centre of Excellence, CoE) in Europe. This centre will integrate core functions including project consulting, technical training, O&M support, and spare parts services, dedicated to providing European customers with rapid-response, full-lifecycle, localised professional services, comprehensively ensuring the safety, reliability, and long-term returns of integrated solar-storage assets.

Choosing London for this global strategy launch underscores LONGi’s high regard for the European market. “Europe’s urgent need for energy transition and its mature market mechanisms provide an ideal platform for practising integrated ‘Solar-Storage-Hydrogen’ solutions,” She said during the launch. The LONGi Energy Storage Solution will be deployed first in key markets such as the UK, Germany, Italy, and Spain, helping utilities and power companies build smarter and more efficient clean energy systems. In the future, LONGi will continue to explore viable pathways for the global zero-carbon transition through its “Solar-Storage-Hydrogen” integration strategy, working hand-in-hand with all parties towards a sustainable future powered by renewable energy.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_PR-photo.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 11:08:58.228543

Furthermore, Borkum Riffgrund 3 is the first offshore wind farm to be built by Ørsted in Germany without an offshore substation (OSS).
The project is located close to Ørsted’s existing wind farms: Borkum Riffgrund 1 and 2 and Gode Wind 1 and 2.
Operation and maintenance for all Ørsted’s German offshore wind farms is carried out from Norden-Norddeich and Emden in East Frisia.
Backed by more than 30 years of experience in offshore wind, Ørsted has 10.2 GW of installed offshore capacity and 8.1 GW under construction.","The offshore wind farm Borkum Riffgrund 3, jointly owned by Ørsted and Nuveen Infrastructure, has delivered its first power to the German grid on 3 December 2025. With an installed capacity of 913 MW, it will become by far the largest offshore wind farm in Ørsted’s German portfolio. Borkum Riffgrund 3 shows the breadth of the European offshore wind supply chain as the project has been constructed using wind turbines and foundations from Germany and Denmark, cables from Germany and France, and installation vessels from the Netherlands and Belgium.

The renewable electricity from Borkum Riffgrund 3, which has now started to flow into the German grid, will, through several long-term corporate power purchase agreements (CPPAs), help industry and technology customers decarbonise their business. The offshore wind farm is expected to be fully commissioned in Q1 2026.

Patrick Harnett, Chief Construction Officer at Ørsted, said:

“Offshore wind will play a key role in securing European energy independence and manufacturing jobs. Borkum Riffgrund 3 is a prime example of both. The project has been constructed by European companies, creating local manufacturing jobs. And, once completed, it will produce the same amount of electricity that a large city uses every year, supporting European industry with a significant amount of green energy through CPPAs. At Ørsted, we’re proud to deliver the first electrons to the grid, and we look forward to having Borkum Riffgrund 3 fully up and running.”

Jordi Francesch, Managing Director Renewable Energy Investments at Nuveen Infrastructure, said:

“The generation of the first power at Borkum Riffgrund 3 is both a significant landmark for German offshore wind and our commitment to accelerating the EU energy transition. Our partnership with Ørsted will deliver 913 MW of clean energy to German households and European corporates making this project a new benchmark for decarbonisation while also supporting long-term energy security for Germany and the EU.”

Felix Gschnell, Programme Director for Borkum Riffgrund 3, at Ørsted adds:

“With first power produced at Borkum Riffgrund 3, we’re taking a major step towards completion of this large-scale project. Our team and suppliers did a tremendous job getting us to this point, and I’m very grateful for their firm dedication and continuous motivation since we took the final investment decision. We’re now focused on commissioning all remaining wind turbines – so we can start full commercial operation in Q1 2026, thereby contributing a significant amount of additional electricity from offshore wind to the German grid.”

Borkum Riffgrund 3 is located about 72 km off the coast in the German North Sea and covers an area of approx. 75 km². A total of 83 wind turbines, each with a rated capacity of 11 MW, have been installed at the offshore wind farm. Furthermore, Borkum Riffgrund 3 is the first offshore wind farm to be built by Ørsted in Germany without an offshore substation (OSS). The new connection concept provides a direct connection between the wind turbines via a 66 kV connection to the DolWin epsilon offshore converter platform, installed and operated by the German transmission system operator, TenneT.

Powering decarbonisation efforts for corporate offtakers

Borkum Riffgrund 3 is supported by several long-term corporate power purchase agreements (CPPA), which Ørsted has signed with industrial and technology customers. Offtake agreements totalling 786 MW have been entered into with Amazon (350 MW), BASF (186 MW), Covestro (100 MW), Energie-Handels-Gesellschaft/REWE Group (100 MW), and Google (50 MW). The contracts range from 10 to 25 years in duration. The agreements create long-term price security for the project developer and for the customers.

Ørsted's strong offshore wind generation portfolio in Germany

Earlier this year, Ørsted and Nuveen Infrastructure’s other jointly owned offshore wind farm, Gode Wind 3, was fully commissioned, producing enough renewable energy to power the equivalent of 250,000 homes in Germany. The project is located close to Ørsted’s existing wind farms: Borkum Riffgrund 1 and 2 and Gode Wind 1 and 2. With these recent additions, Ørsted's installed offshore wind power capacity in Germany increases to around 2.5 GW in early 2026 – or the equivalent of 2.5 million homes powered. Ørsted is the market leader in Germany, operating over 20 % of the country’s total offshore wind capacity. Operation and maintenance for all Ørsted’s German offshore wind farms is carried out from Norden-Norddeich and Emden in East Frisia.

The Columbia River has been converted into one of the biggest power producers in the USA. The concrete structure forms the engineering dream come true that stands 550 feet over the granite bed and runs more than a mile across the Columbia River. The magnificent power-generating feature of the Grand Coulee Dam draws admiration from across the world.

Giant concrete structure captures the vast power of the Columbia River

The Grand Coulee Dam holds a mind-boggling 11,975,521 cubic yards of concrete. This makes it three times larger in terms of concrete used than the renowned Hoover Dam. The monumental dam spans 5,223 feet in length and ranges from 450-500 feet in width at the foundation and 30 feet in width at the crest. This marvel of engineering took shape in various phases from 1933 through 1975.

There are four different power plants in the dam, with 33 generators altogether working in synchronization to create power on such a vast scale. The Left Power Plant and the Right Power Plant consist of nine generators measuring 125 megawatts each in capacity, and the Third Power Plant consists of six generators with capacities from 600-805 megawatts in size.

Grand Coulee Dam’s average yearly power production is 21 billion kWh, with power distributed to Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, California, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona.

Enormous penstocks carry massive water volumes to generation units

The biggest penstocks in the Third Power Plant are 40 feet in diameter and can handle 35,000 cubic feet of water per second. The gigantic water pipes are more than twice the average annual flow rate of the Colorado River. This indicates the tremendous mass of water that needs to be processed in the system in order to produce abundant, clean electricity.

Total generating capacity reaches 6,809 megawatts, producing 21 billion kWh

The combined electricity-generating capacity of the dam stands at 6,809 megawatts. This results in the average annual generation of 21 billion kilowatt hours of electricity each year. This generation capacity makes Grand Coulee Dam one of the biggest in the world and generates 35 percent of the entire power requirements of the Pacific Northwest region.

The power distribution does not end there but extends beyond the boundaries of America. Canada gets substantial electricity through the Columbia River Treaty. The power distribution system operates in Canada in conjunction with other power-generating stations through the Columbia River system. The project belongs to and operates in conjunction with other power-generating projects under the federal system in Canada.

Distribution network

Serves 11 states, including Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and California

Provides enough electricity for two cities the size of Seattle

Operates as a baseload renewable energy source

Multiple purposes beyond power generation create comprehensive benefits

Although hydroelectric power accounts for only 79.7 percent of the Grand Coulee Dam’s power use, this project also has significant irrigation and flood control functions that benefit the overall regional economy. The Columbia Basin Project irrigates 720,000 acres of land via 330 miles of main distribution canals and 2,000 miles of lateral channels in the region.

The flood control capacity of the dam protects significant population centers such as Portland in the state of Oregon and Vancouver in the state of Washington through various strategic storage projects under this system.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that the new Trump proposed standards, which will exclude electric vehicles, will achieve an average fuel economy of 34.5 miles per gallon by model year 2031, effectively returning to what was in place during Trump’s first term.
The standards revision comes nearly a year after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy ordered the NHTSA to immediately start rulemaking around rescinding or replacing what are called the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for cars, SUVs and heavy-duty pickups and vans.
The Biden fuel economy standards set forth by the NHTSA reported the rule would save Americans more than $23 billion in fuel costs while also reducing pollution.
“The cure for pollution and high gas costs is strong fuel economy standards, not killing them as a favor to the president’s Big Oil, Big Auto and OPEC golf buddies,” Becker said.","The Trump administration unveiled a significant rollback of the Biden administration’s national fuel economy standards on Wednesday to make it easier for automakers to build and sell gas-powered cars.

The termination would undo standards put in place by then-President Joe Biden in 2022 that now require carmakers to average 50.4 miles per gallon across their passenger cars and light trucks by the 2031 model year.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that the new Trump proposed standards, which will exclude electric vehicles, will achieve an average fuel economy of 34.5 miles per gallon by model year 2031, effectively returning to what was in place during Trump’s first term.

The repeal of the Biden-era standards, which will trigger a lengthy rulemaking process, is intended to reduce production costs for American automakers and curb costs for new car customers, President Donald Trump said in the Oval Office. He was joined by executives from Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, who thanked him for proposing the repeal.

“It was ridiculous, very expensive, it put tremendous upward pressure on car prices,” Trump said Wednesday. “Today we’re taking one more step to kill the green new scam.”

But opponents of the measure say repealing fuel economy standards will raise costs for drivers and slash progress made in reducing dangerous air pollution that causes tens of thousands of premature deaths annually across the country, research shows. It’s expected that consumer advocates and transportation experts will present oral and written testimony to oppose any cuts to current standards during the proposed rulemaking’s public comment period.

Gina McCarthy, a former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator and White House national climate advisor, said rolling back these standards not only creates more pollution but will enable China to overtake the U.S. auto industry in the global car market through dominance in electric vehicle manufacturing.

“If there’s one thing you can count on, it’s that this administration will never act in the best interest of our health or the environment,” McCarthy stated on Wednesday. “The rest of the world will continue to innovate and create cleaner cars that people want to buy and drive, while we’re forced to sit in our clunkers, paying more for gas and pumping out more tailpipe emissions.”

But major U.S. automakers are grateful for the rollback. Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the company appreciated the administration’s realignment with “real world market conditions” as part of the administration’s wider vision for a growing U.S. automotive industry. Ford CEO Jim Farley said repealing the standards was the right move for a lot of reasons.

“Today is a victory for common sense and affordability,” Farley said. “We were number two last year in EV sales, we were number three in hybrids and we’re the leading brand for combustion. We believe that people should be able to make a choice.”

The rollback will allow Ford to invest in more affordable vehicles in the U.S., Farley said.

The standards revision comes nearly a year after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy ordered the NHTSA to immediately start rulemaking around rescinding or replacing what are called the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for cars, SUVs and heavy-duty pickups and vans. Federal law mandates improved gas mileage for American vehicles.

In June, the NHTSA said the prior administration wrongly considered electric vehicles when establishing future mileage requirements. Duffy said that federal law considers only combustion engines in establishing fuel standards, and that by including electric vehicles and hybrid cars, the Biden administration created a standard that combustion engine cars could not attain and required the carmakers to trade for carbon credits.

“These rules are going to allow the automakers to make vehicles that Americans want to purchase, not vehicles that Joe Biden and [former transportation secretary Pete] Buttigieg want them to build,” Duffy said.

The proposed standards would also eliminate the CAFE credit trading program starting in model year 2028, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. The agency said the credit system allowed companies with large EV lineups to generate and sell excess credits, effectively subsidizing EV manufacturers while increasing compliance costs for companies producing gas-powered vehicles.

EVs’ market share in the U.S. is expected to remain at 8 percent through 2026, the same as it was in 2024, according to a recent forecast from AutoPacific, a research firm. It’s a decrease from the firm’s estimate last year, when it predicted that the market share for EVs would reach 11 percent in 2025 and 15 percent in 2026.

The Biden fuel economy standards set forth by the NHTSA reported the rule would save Americans more than $23 billion in fuel costs while also reducing pollution.

Jason Schwartz, the legal director at the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University School of Law, said rescinding these standards will not only cost consumers at the pump, but weaken the nation’s vulnerability to gas price shocks. “NHTSA’s proposed repeal will further pinch the wallets of consumers who are already stretched thin,” Schwartz said in a statement.

The move to dismantle these requirements is the latest in a broader effort by the Trump administration to reverse Biden climate and environmental regulations and undo policies Trump said has resulted in an “EV mandate.”

Trump has also called for eliminating subsidies and other measures boosting electric vehicles, stripped federal tax credits from EV purchasers and sought to revoke California’s long-standing ability to set its own emission limits.

The administration has also proposed repealing the 2009 endangerment finding, which would rescind all greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines. The endangerment finding is a formal declaration by the EPA, later affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court, stating that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health. The finding allows for greenhouse gases to be regulated under the Clean Air Act, the country’s primary federal law to control air pollution.

If the endangerment finding is ultimately repealed, it would be the largest deregulatory action in American history, according to the EPA.

Congress first established the CAFE standards in 1975 largely in response to the 1973 OPEC oil embargo, when the average vehicle got about 13 miles to the gallon. These standards are often credited for reducing American reliance on imported oil and driving investments into domestic manufacturing of more efficient vehicle models.

Strong auto standards are the most effective way to cut pollution and oil use, said Dan Becker, the director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign. The U.S. is the world’s biggest consumer of oil—consuming 20 percent of the world’s petroleum.

“The cure for pollution and high gas costs is strong fuel economy standards, not killing them as a favor to the president’s Big Oil, Big Auto and OPEC golf buddies,” Becker said. “Trump’s action will feed America’s destructive use of oil, while hamstringing us in the green tech race against Chinese and other foreign carmakers.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2249775210-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 11:08:36.649578

The company's focus on EV components seems to be paying off, with a modest increase in revenue and a more substantial improvement in profitability.

Strategic Subsidiaries

KEL's transition is supported by two key subsidiaries:

Kinetic Watts & Volts Ltd.: Focused on electric scooters, including the revived Kinetic DX model.

Range-X: A battery manufacturing unit with an annual capacity of 60,000 units.

Market Position and Future Outlook

The company's move aligns with India's push towards electric mobility. With the auto components industry in India achieving a turnover of ₹5.4 lakh crore (US $74.1 billion) in FY24, KEL is positioning itself to capture a slice of the growing EV component market.

Kinetic Engineering's strategy appears to be a calculated risk, balancing its established expertise with the need to adapt to changing market dynamics. The success of this pivot will likely depend on the company's ability to execute its EV strategy effectively and the overall growth of the electric vehicle market in India.

Investors may want to monitor KEL's progress in scaling its EV operations and any potential impact on its financial performance in the coming quarters. The company's ability to leverage its legacy while embracing new technologies could be crucial in determining its long-term success in the evolving automotive landscape.

Conclusion

Kinetic Engineering's strategic shift represents a significant moment for both the company and the Indian EV industry. As the sector continues to evolve, KEL's journey will be an interesting case study in how traditional auto manufacturers can reinvent themselves for the electric future.

Kinetic Engineering Limited (KEL) has received a significant boost in its capital structure as the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) granted listing approval for 4,00,000 equity shares. This development marks a crucial step in the company's financial strategy and capital raising efforts.

Key Details of the Listing Approval

Aspect Details Number of Shares 4,00,000 Face Value Rs. 10 per share Premium Rs. 161 per share Issue Type Preferential basis Recipient Non-promoters Issuance Reason Warrant conversion

The listing approval allows Kinetic Engineering to list these newly issued shares on the BSE. However, it's important to note that trading approval is still pending and subject to the completion of additional regulatory requirements, including confirmation from depositories.

Regulatory Compliance

In line with regulatory requirements, Kinetic Engineering has promptly disclosed this development to the stock exchange. The company's notification adheres to Regulation 30 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements Regulations, 2015.

Implications for Investors

This listing approval represents a significant corporate action for Kinetic Engineering. The issuance of shares to non-promoters on a preferential basis, resulting from warrant conversion, could potentially impact the company's ownership structure and liquidity in the market.

Investors and market participants should note that while listing approval has been granted, actual trading of these new shares will commence only after the company receives trading approval, which is contingent on fulfilling additional regulatory prerequisites.

As the situation develops, stakeholders are advised to keep an eye on further announcements from Kinetic Engineering regarding the completion of regulatory requirements and the eventual trading approval for these newly listed shares.

“These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana’s longterm strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, costeffective power to our customers.
Recently recognized at the inaugural Louisiana Energy Awards, this collaboration between Entergy Louisiana and Meta reflects a shared commitment to innovation, sustainability, and community advancement.
Entergy Louisiana customers will benefit directly from Meta’s operations in Louisiana, through lower energy costs and enhanced system resilience.
“Entergy Louisiana’s partnership with Meta and our local leaders demonstrates how strategic energy investments can drive economic development and strengthen the communities we serve,” May said.","Entergy Louisiana broke ground in Richland Parish to mark the start of construction on a pair of new combined-cycle combustion turbine generation facilities recently approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission.

The Franklin Farms Power Station represents a significant investment in modern energy infrastructure designed to strengthen reliability, power economic expansion in north Louisiana, and deliver significant economic benefits -- including billions in capital investment, thousands of construction and technology jobs, and lasting value for local communities and Entergy customers statewide.

The project underscores Entergy Louisiana’s commitment to delivering modern, efficient and dependable energy solutions for the state’s communities, industries and digital future. Together, the two power plants will add approximately 1,500 megawatts of highly efficient natural gas generation capacity. The two plants are part of a new expedited interconnection study process to ensure Louisiana can meet the speed to market needed in a powerfirst world.

“This project reinforces what we are seeing across Louisiana: when we modernize our energy infrastructure, we unlock growth for every region of our state,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “Under Governor Landry’s leadership, we are strengthening reliability, powering innovation and creating the conditions for long-term economic opportunity. Entergy’s investment demonstrates the value of partnership and the competitive advantage Louisiana brings to a power-first economy.”

The new CCCT facilities will feature modern, highly efficient technology that uses less fuel to produce more power, resulting in lower emissions and improved system reliability. This next-generation infrastructure will help Entergy Louisiana meet growing energy demands, provide operational flexibility to integrate renewable resources, and ensure customers continue to benefit from low-cost and dependable service.

“These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana’s longterm strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, costeffective power to our customers. By investing in efficient technologies and robust infrastructure, we’re ensuring that Louisiana remains a competitive, attractive place to live, work, and do business both today and well into the future,” Entergy Louisiana President and CEO Phillip May said. “I also want to thank our partners from local and state governments, the Franklin family and our communities for coming together to ensure the success of this historic project.”

Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell called the ground breaking, “truly a bright day for northeast Louisiana.”

“I am glad to help play a small part in this economic opportunity,” Campbell said.

Meta’s new, state-ofthe- art data center is one of the largest investments in the region’s history and is expected to support over 5,000 construction jobs and 500 operational jobs (once completed) and long-term economic opportunities to the state. These new generation facilities will play a critical role in supporting this development, but also ensuring all of Entergy’s customers have access to reliable, resilient, and sustainable power.

Recently recognized at the inaugural Louisiana Energy Awards, this collaboration between Entergy Louisiana and Meta reflects a shared commitment to innovation, sustainability, and community advancement. By aligning energy infrastructure with digital growth, the partnership strengthens Louisiana’s position as a hub for datadriven industries while promoting cleaner, more efficient energy use.

Entergy Louisiana customers will benefit directly from Meta’s operations in Louisiana, through lower energy costs and enhanced system resilience. Once operational, Meta’s contributions to costs otherwise paid by all customers are expected to reduce customer bills. In particular, Meta is expected to lower customer storm charges by an average of approximately 10 percent and lower the bill impacts of resilience upgrades for customers by a similar amount. Over the 15-year agreement, Meta’s contributions toward Entergy’s system costs -- including storm recovery -- are projected to save customers approximately $650 million, helping keep bills lower across Louisiana.

Under the terms of the agreement, Meta will fund the full cost of the utility infrastructure required to interconnect and serve its Richland Parish data center. This structure, consistent with regulatory measures designed to protect consumers, prevents cost-shifting to other customers. In addition, the new generation resources being added to Entergy Louisiana’s system will be among the most efficient in the state, providing additional fuel savings and long-term reliability benefits for customers statewide.

Beyond powering Louisiana’s economic growth, these projects will deliver lasting benefits to local communities through job creation, increased tax revenues, and enhanced system reliability. Construction and long-term operation of the new facilities will generate significant economic activity in Richland Parish and surrounding areas, while improved grid performance will reduce outages and support future business expansion.

“Entergy Louisiana’s partnership with Meta and our local leaders demonstrates how strategic energy investments can drive economic development and strengthen the communities we serve,” May said. “Together, we are building the foundation for Louisiana’s energy future -- one that supports growth, innovation, and opportunity for all.”

Construction on the two Richland Parish facilities will begin immediately following the groundbreaking, with both projects expected to be completed and operational by late 2028.",https://st2.4media.com/a93/data/wysiwig/favicon-16x16.png,N,,2025-12-04 12:02:04.360051

Looking ahead, the challenges confronting the U.S. energy sector are intensifying.
These factors are expected to add 3.3 billion cubic feet per day of new natural gas demand by 2030.
They’re commonsense changes that benefit all forms of energy — natural gas, nuclear, renewables (i.e., wind, solar), and transmission alike.
Wind and solar projects face the same kinds of delays as oil and natural gas infrastructure do.","Imagine opening your power bill and seeing it going down instead of up. Imagine filling up your truck for less, heating your home without worry, and knowing your job at the factory is secure because America is building again.

Picture an America that leads the world in AI, advanced manufacturing, and military strength — powered by the country’s own abundant energy. Imagine America building power plants faster than China. This is the future that Americans want and deserve, and the single greatest obstacle standing in the way is a broken permitting system that keeps shovels idle instead of breaking ground.

Project delays have real consequences for the American people. When a proposed pipeline or transmission line gets trapped in endless reviews, families pay more at the pump and the meter because projects that otherwise meet every safety and environmental standard languish in agency review for years. Factory jobs vanish or move overseas, data centers fuel China’s tech boom instead of the United States’ and the country’s national security is undermined.

The contrast with global competitors is stark: in 2024 alone, China added 429 GW of electricity capacity — nearly nine times the U.S. total of 48.6 GW — building faster and at continental scale while America remains constrained by process. There is an alarming mismatch between soaring demand and stalled infrastructure. U.S. natural gas demand surged 56 percent from 2010 to 2022, yet pipeline capacity grew only 27 percent and storage just 12 percent over that period, driving prices higher and risking reliability.

Looking ahead, the challenges confronting the U.S. energy sector are intensifying. As highlighted in the North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s (NERC) recently released 2024-2025 Winter Reliability Assessment, multiple regions across the United States face elevated risks of energy shortfalls. This growing vulnerability underscores the urgency of the situation, with electricity demand in 2026 projected to increase 5 percent from 2024 — driven by the rapid expansion of AI data centers, a resurgence in domestic manufacturing, and ongoing residential development.

These factors are expected to add 3.3 billion cubic feet per day of new natural gas demand by 2030. Presently, power generation accounts for more than 42 percent of total U.S. natural gas consumption, and the resulting infrastructure constraints to end markets are contributing to price volatility and reliability concerns. Without accelerated infrastructure development, households and businesses will continue to face escalating costs and risks associated with these permitting bottlenecks.

Permitting reform is about your wallet, your job, your kids’ future, and the United States remaining number one. It’s how America wins the AI and technology race, powers reindustrialization, lowers energy bills, fuels the factories and supercomputers that will drive innovation and secure the nation’s defense, and show the world America is in charge of its own destiny.

Significant steps have already been taken to reinvigorate the energy industry. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is taking steps to move energy infrastructure forward, with its recent move to consider streamlining certain LNG approvals being the latest example.

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting geopolitical shocks, U.S. LNG exports became Europe’s top supplier as Russia’s gas share fell from 40 percent in 2021 to 18 percent in 2024. The U.S. could do more, but permitting delays are making it harder. Meaningful reform across all agencies is the next decisive step.

That’s the why. And recently, the National Petroleum Council (NPC) delivered the how.

“Bottleneck to Breakthrough: A Permitting Blueprint to Build,” the report requested by Secretary Chris Wright, is an actionable blueprint to fix the permitting system — grounded in our practical real-world experience.

The recommendations lay out immediate, common-sense reforms that cut red tape without cutting corners on safety or the environment.

Refocus NEPA on direct project-related effects, not speculative impacts. Curb activist lawsuits from holding approved projects hostage for years. Keep extraneous issues like climate change outside of state water quality reviews and enforce the one-year review period in federal law. Modernize FERC proceedings to green-light essential expansions quickly and enforce 90-day final decisions and create a reimagined pathway for linear infrastructure: if a qualified project meets clear standards upfront, it moves — full speed ahead, with continuous monitoring instead of redundant case-by-case reviews.

These ideas shouldn’t be political. They’re commonsense changes that benefit all forms of energy — natural gas, nuclear, renewables (i.e., wind, solar), and transmission alike. Wind and solar projects face the same kinds of delays as oil and natural gas infrastructure do. Streamlined permitting will accelerate deployment of every energy source.

Making government work better in response to rising demand should unite red states and blue, rural families and urban factories — because every form of energy needs to be built. Far from lowering standards, faster permitting accelerates genuine environmental progress by enabling cleaner, more efficient infrastructure to come online sooner, replacing aging assets with state-of-the-art systems.

The roadmap is clear. By acting decisively — building on the momentum already underway — we can lower utility bills, power American reindustrialization, win the AI and technology race against China and deliver abundant, affordable energy for generations to come. The choice is simple: keep paying more while adversaries surge ahead, or fix permitting and unleash the greatest energy comeback in history.

Now is the time to unleash American energy. Let’s build.

Cooperative federalism has been a cornerstone of Clean Water Act implementation and the agency’s proposed WOTUS rule at last fulfills that commitment to real, shared federal and state responsibility, the EPA said.","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a proposed rule revising the regulatory definition of “waters of the U.S.” intended to resolve the regulatory uncertainty regarding the scope of federal jurisdiction.

The agencies are soliciting comments on the proposed rule, which are due 45 days from the proposed rule’s publication in the Federal Register.

The proposal, released Nov. 17, aligns with the U.S. Supreme Court’s Sackett vs. EPA decision that limits Clean Water Act protections to wetlands with a continuous surface connection to navigable waters.

The agencies developed this proposed WOTUS rule using input from multiple sources, including a pre-proposal recommendations docket, information from nine public listening sessions and consultation comments from states, tribes and local governments.

Key proposed revisions include:

• Defining key terms like “relatively permanent,” “continuous surface connection” and “tributary” to appropriately delineate the scope of WOTUS consistent with the Clean Water Act and Supreme Court precedent.

• Establishing that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters either directly or through other features that provide predictable and consistent flow.

• Reaffirming that wetlands must be indistinguishable from jurisdictional waters through a continuous surface connection, which means that they must touch a jurisdictional water and hold surface water for a requisite duration year after year.

• Strengthening state and tribal decision-making authority by providing clear regulatory guidelines while recognizing their expertise in local land and water resources.

• Preserving and clarifying exclusions for certain ditches, prior converted cropland and waste treatment systems; adding a new exclusion for groundwater.

• Incorporating locally familiar terminology, such as “wet season,” to help determine whether a water body qualifies as WOTUS.

• In addition, the limitation to wetlands that have surface water at least during the wet season and abut a jurisdictional water will further limit the scope of permafrost wetlands that are considered to have a continuous surface connection under the proposed rule. These proposed changes are intended to provide clarity and consistency to the continuous surface connection definition.

“When it comes to the definition of ‘waters of the United States,’ EPA has an important responsibility to protect water resources while setting clear and practical rules of the road that accelerate economic growth and opportunity,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

“We applaud EPA and the Corps’ efforts to bring our nation’s job creators one step closer to relief from years of federal government overreach by offering a clear, durable ‘Waters of the U.S.’ rule. WAC strongly endorses the agencies’ commitment to respect the legal boundaries articulated by the Supreme Court and to restore the balance Congress intended more than 50 years ago when it enacted the Clean Water Act,” said the Waters Advocacy Coalition in a statement.

“The Waters Advocacy Coalition represents America’s job creators who deliver the services families rely on every day, from producing energy, building homes and infrastructure to growing food. These industries need regulations they can understand. We look forward to more closely analyzing the proposal and offering comments to ensure that this rule protects America’s waterways while offering certainty to landowners throughout the country.”

“Clean water is a top priority for farmers and ranchers. We depend on it. We are pleased that the new rule protects critical water sources while respecting the efforts of farmers to protect the natural resources they’ve been entrusted with,” said American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall.

“The Supreme Court clearly ruled several years ago that the government overreached in its interpretation of what fell under federal guidelines. We are still reviewing the entire rule, but we are pleased that it finally addresses those concerns and takes steps to provide much-needed clarity. We look forward to providing comments to EPA to ensure farmers can continue to safeguard the environment while growing the food America’s families rely on.”

“The agency’s proposed definition of WOTUS would fully implement the court’s direction by focusing on relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water — such as streams, oceans, rivers and lakes — and wetlands that are connected and indistinguishable from such waterbodies,” said the EPA in a news release.

“It will accelerate economic prosperity by revising, for example, exclusions for certain ditches, prior converted cropland and waste treatment systems and by adding an exclusion for groundwater. The proposal also takes into account seasonal and geographic variability by including waters that flow uninterrupted throughout the wetter months in the proposed definition of ‘relatively permanent’ waters, based on pre-proposal feedback.”

This proposal recognizes that states and tribes know their local land and water resources best, the EPA said. The proposed definition of WOTUS protects water quality by affirming federal protections where appropriate and supporting the role of states and tribes as primary regulators managing their own land and water resources.

Cooperative federalism has been a cornerstone of Clean Water Act implementation and the agency’s proposed WOTUS rule at last fulfills that commitment to real, shared federal and state responsibility, the EPA said.",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/Ij32dgxU6MdH-T9Eja92QkUYsR4=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/KVD5RX7JQZDVFK56LD55AONSLU.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 11:10:20.493309

Leaders expect the project to attract additional suppliers as Scout Motors expands its operations and more companies invest across the Midlands. The long-term economic ripple effect is likely to extend beyond the nearly 400 direct jobs created at the new facility.

Sodecia, headquartered in Portugal, and Aapico, based in Thailand, first announced the joint venture in May. Industry analysts note that the partnership allows both companies to share financial risk as new EV and extended-range platforms enter the market without federal incentives. Scout’s decision to use a ladder frame structure aligns with its heritage-inspired product strategy, positioning the vehicles directly in competition with established off-road models.

The new supplier is the latest addition to Scout’s growing component network. American Axle and Manufacturing will provide front electric drive units and rear e-Beam axles for the Traveler and Terra. Scout will also use a Volkswagen facility in Mexico to build the engine that will serve as the range extender for its extended-range electric system.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12042025-Scout-Motors-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 11:11:06.348488

However, Equinor will contribute its £1.3 billion UK ‘tax shelter’ - or credits that can be used against paying future UK taxes.
Global Witness asked Shell whether it intentionally hid from the government that tax dodging was a primary motivation for the deal.
UK tax law prohibits one company from buying another mainly for its trading losses or ‘loss buying’.","Meeting records, obtained through Freedom of Information request, reveal that the oil and gas giant kept quiet on one of the central motivations for the merger – the potential for a £1.3 billion tax dodge – despite being asked explicitly by DESNZ Secretary of State Ed Miliband about the reasons behind the deal.

Adura, the name of the new joint venture between Shell and Equinor, formally launched this week. Campaigners, however, are calling on HMRC and the Chancellor to investigate the deal over tax implications and whether it violates tax rules around ‘loss-buying’.

Recent North Sea mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity – of which Shell and Equinor’s Adura deal is just one example – were cited by the OBR as one of the main reasons why tax revenue from oil and gas is set to be £2.5 billion lower this year than the fiscal watchdog predicted in March.

Global Witness senior fossil fuel investigator Jonathan Noronha-Gant said:

“These records show Shell kept government in the dark about what it really wanted from its new North Sea oil venture, dodging £1.3 billion in tax to the public purse.

“We now need an urgent investigation into this huge oil giant tax dodge. Taxpayers should rightly question why they pay tax while a dubious deal by two mega-wealthy fossil fuel firms can escape HMRC scrutiny.

“The UK government has the authority and should investigate the deal urgently to prove that it’s not one rule for families and another for big polluters.”

Lauren MacDonald, lead campaigner at Stop Rosebank said:

“The oil and gas industry likes to complain about the amount of tax they have to pay, but the Adura deal shows how good they are at gaming the system to increase their profits.

“The creation of Adura doesn’t just tinker with the amount of tax Shell has to pay, this is serious money – money that could be invested in public services, in helping to bring down everyone’s energy bills, in helping energy workers move into clean energy jobs. Instead, it will go to Shell executives and its shareholders.

“When you hear an oil giant complain about taxes, just remember the £1.3bn tax dodge that Shell is attempting to pull off with Adura.”

Robin Wells, director of Fossil Free London said:

“Last year, Shell paid zero tax on North Sea drilling - but instead received £12.4 million back from the government.

“And for years Shell's executives have rubbed their hands over the enormous tax breaks served up by the UK government. Now, please sirs, Shell and Equinor want some more. Only Fagin and Bill Sikes could create a dodgier joint enterprise.'

Tax savings not disclosed

Meeting records that Global Witness obtained through FOI reveal that Shell held high-level discussions with DESNZ Secretary Miliband and Chancellor Rachel Reeves last year prior to externally communicating the deal.

When Miliband explicitly asked Shell why it was doing the deal, the oil giant omitted any mention of tax benefits. Instead, meeting records show the company cited aging North Sea operations, wanting to effectively “combine skills and expertise”, and that the deal was “more a strategic look at [the company’s] portfolio than anything specific”.

Shell also told Miliband it could not say which other company it was merging with – information Global Witness says may have allowed the government to determine the deal’s tax implications.

When asked by Global Witness why it could not name Equinor during its meeting with, Shell declined to comment.

DESNZ staff also raised concerns about whether the Shell merger would lead to job losses. They were assured that there was an “expectation that jobs not [would not be] impacted”. The company also said its deal was not driven by any polices of the current government.

As a result, meeting records appear to suggest DESNZ agreed to speak positively about the deal and agreed common talking points with Shell.

£1.3 billion tax shelter

Adura, which was first announced in December of last year, will merge Shell and Equinor’s UK offshore drilling operations, with each company owning 50% of the joint venture.

This includes Shell’s licences that produce large volumes of oil and gas. Equinor’s production is small and rapidly decreasing. However, Equinor will contribute its £1.3 billion UK ‘tax shelter’ - or credits that can be used against paying future UK taxes.

Global Witness asked Shell whether it intentionally hid from the government that tax dodging was a primary motivation for the deal. Again, the company provided no comment.

UK tax law prohibits one company from buying another mainly for its trading losses or ‘loss buying’. It is unclear whether these restrictions would apply to Adura. However, In November, Global Witness, Stop Rosebank, Fossil Free London, and Tax Justice UK called on HMRC to investigate whether Adura violates tax prohibitions around loss-buying and to bar them from inheriting these assets if this is the case.

This article is not simply a technical analysis of natural gas markets.
Mexico has made notable progress in expanding natural gas infrastructure, particularly in the northern region.
On the other hand, liquefied natural gas (LNG) is reshaping global gas markets, and Mexico is uniquely positioned to benefit from this transformation.
Mexico has significant renewable potential, but renewables cannot replace natural gas in the short to medium term without destabilizing the grid or undermining industrial competitiveness.","As Mexico advances toward 2026, the country finds itself standing at one of the most consequential crossroads in its modern economic and energy history. Rarely do so many transformative forces converge at the same time: institutional restructuring, geopolitical tension, global supply chain realignment, technological disruption, the accelerating pace of the energy transition and an unprecedented surge in industrial demand.

Among all these forces, one element perhaps more than any other will determine the degree to which Mexico can seize the opportunities before it or remain constrained by structural vulnerabilities: natural gas.

Natural gas is the foundation on which Mexico’s industrial base is built. It is the engine of electricity generation, the indispensable feedstock for key manufacturing sectors, the hidden pillar of nearshoring competitiveness, and the practical bridge in Mexico’s path toward a cleaner energy future. Yet it is also, paradoxically, the country’s greatest strategic weakness. Mexico imports more than 70% of its natural gas from the United States, one of the highest levels of energy import dependency anywhere in the world for an economy of Mexico’s size.

This article is not simply a technical analysis of natural gas markets. It is an invitation to reflect on Mexico’s strategic direction and its moment of decision because the next two years will determine much more than supply flows or price signals, they will define the contours of Mexico’s role within North America, the resilience of its industrial development, and the credibility of its energy governance. This is a decisive moment. And it demands clarity, urgency and leadership.

A New Era

Mexico is entering a new era of institutional restructuring. The creation of the National Energy Commission, the enactment of the new Hydrocarbons Sector Law, and the repositioning of various regulatory bodies mark an ambitious attempt to recalibrate the country’s energy architecture. The intent is to consolidate planning, standardize regulatory processes, eliminate duplicative mandates, and build a more coherent governance structure capable of responding to 21st-century energy demands.

These reforms signal an acknowledgment of a truth long recognized by industry observers: Mexico’s energy institutions had become burdened by overlapping responsibilities, inconsistent regulatory interpretation, delays in permitting, and insufficient alignment with national development priorities. The new institutional framework aims to rectify these limitations by fostering long-term planning capacity rather than reactive decision-making, regulatory coherence across agencies, certainty for private and public investment, stronger energy security mechanism, and an alignment between industrial policy and energy policy. In theory, this redesign could create the conditions for Mexico to integrate natural gas infrastructure, electricity generation, industrial expansion, and environmental objectives into a unified strategic plan, something the country has lacked for decades. But as with all structural reforms, the true impact depends on execution.

If implemented effectively, this institutional redesign could anchor the next 20 years of Mexico’s energy strategy and support the consolidation of Mexico as a North American energy leader. If implemented poorly, if captured by political fragmentation, administrative delays, or inconsistent interpretation, these reforms could entrench uncertainty, slow infrastructure deployment, and exacerbate Mexico’s existing vulnerabilities. The difference between success and failure will depend on leadership, coordination, and the capacity of institutions to rise above short-term pressures to deliver long-term national outcomes.

For instance, Mexico’s reliance on the United States for natural gas imports is one of the most defining characteristics of its energy landscape. This dependency is both a powerful competitive advantage and a source of acute vulnerability. US shale production is among the most prolific and cost-efficient in the world. The abundant supply exported through pipeline networks into Mexico has enabled low industrial energy costs, competitive electricity generation prices, expansion of manufacturing capacity, replacement of heavy fuels with cleaner natural gas, integration of Mexico into North America’s industrial and energy value chains, and a solid foundation for the nearshoring boom. This dynamic allowed Mexico to maintain one of the most competitive industrial energy cost structures in the world, attracting multinational manufacturers and enabling sectors such as automotive, steel, aerospace and electronics to flourish.

Yet, dependency is a fragile position when the supply originates beyond national borders. The lessons of February 2021’s Winter Storm remain a stark reminder of what can happen when weather, logistics, and political priorities collide. With natural gas imports concentrated primarily through the Waha hub in Texas, Mexico faces several ongoing risks:

Climate-driven supply disruptions Extreme cold snaps can interrupt or reduce cross-border flows.

Pipeline congestion: Growing US LNG exports increase competition for pipeline capacity.

Regulatory exposure: Changes in US environmental or export regulations directly affect Mexico.

Geopolitical volatility: Cross-border disputes or shifts in trade frameworks can influence flows.

Lack of diversification: Reliance on a single basin and single country is inherently risky.

Mexico has made notable progress in expanding natural gas infrastructure, particularly in the northern region. Yet, the country’s pipeline network remains uneven, storage capacity remains minimal, and connectivity gaps threaten to undermine industrial and regional development. The past decade has seen the development of cross-border and domestic pipelines that have substantially increased Mexico’s import capacity and regional interconnectivity. Projects being developed and under development have improved the country’s ability to receive volume and serve regional demand. However, the central and southern regions still lack adequate redundancy and infrastructure. Nearshoring-heavy states such as Queretaro, Guanajuato, and Puebla need expanded capacity to accommodate expected industrial growth.

Infrastructure Potential

So far, Mexico’s lack of natural gas storage is arguably the most dangerous gap in its energy security. Most countries maintain storage equivalent to 40–90 days of demand. Mexico has less than three days. It is no exaggeration to say that Mexico’s future energy security depends on building meaningful storage capacity. As well, many industrial corridors lack the last-mile pipeline connections needed to deliver gas from trunk pipelines to factories. Without last-mile solutions, even regions located near major pipelines cannot fully benefit from existing infrastructure. This gap becomes existential when multinational manufacturers evaluate whether a region can support multi-decade operations.

On the other hand, liquefied natural gas (LNG) is reshaping global gas markets, and Mexico is uniquely positioned to benefit from this transformation. Mexico’s west coast is emerging as one of the most geopolitically valuable corridors in the global LNG landscape. Pacific coast terminals have the potential to provide US-origin gas a faster route to Asian markets, bypass the Panama Canal, establish Mexico as a transpacific energy bridge, attract significant foreign investment, and develop world-class industrial ports and logistics centers. No other country holds this combination of infrastructure potential and geographic advantage.

It is important to start looking at small- and midscale LNG solutions that are becoming essential for remote mining operations, Industrial hubs without pipeline access, food processing, automotive and cement plants, power generation in isolated grids, and heavy-transport-sector fuel-switching. This model democratizes energy access across Mexico, reducing regional inequality and enabling industrial development in previously excluded regions. Incorporating LNG into Mexico’s energy system provides redundancy during pipeline outages, extreme weather, maintenance and peak demand periods.

Monumental Opportunity

The relocation of global supply chains represents the most monumental industrial opportunity for Mexico since the signing of NAFTA. Mexico is now becoming a manufacturing hub for North America, a logistics and supply chain center, a key location for advanced manufacturing, and a nearshore partner for high-value industries. States such as Nuevo Leon, Coahuila, Chihuahua, Queretaro, Puebla, Aguascalientes, and Guanajuato are experiencing levels of industrial development that strain existing energy infrastructure. Without expanded natural gas capacity, the nearshoring wave could slow, bypass or even relocate to US regions that will offer guaranteed energy availability, redundancy and storage, more predictable regulatory environments, and fully integrated energy infrastructure. That is why Mexico must align its energy planning with its industrial ambitions.

The global energy transition is accelerating, but it cannot progress without natural gas as a stabilizing force. Natural gas will remain essential through 2035 due to diverse factors, including its role in backing up intermittent renewables, lower emissions intensity, operational flexibility, contribution to cost-effective electricity generation, importance in industrial heat processes, compatibility with hydrogen blending, and its technological maturity. Mexico has significant renewable potential, but renewables cannot replace natural gas in the short to medium term without destabilizing the grid or undermining industrial competitiveness. We are at a relevant moment, and I envision these possible scenarios: (1) Mexico accomplishes effective regulatory implementation, expands infrastructure, builds storage, accelerates LNG deployment, and aligns energy strategy with industrial growth. (2) Progress occurs but is slow and uneven. Natural gas continues to fuel competitiveness, but systemic risks remain, and (3) the most pessimistic: regulatory delays, insufficient storage, and infrastructure bottlenecks constrain industrial growth (Mexico loses part of the nearshoring window). The difference between the first and second scenarios is execution, the difference between the second and third is urgency.

In conclusion, Mexico cannot afford passive strategies. It cannot wait another six years to start implementing its national strategies, it cannot afford slow implementation and to underestimate its vulnerabilities.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/pictures/2023-01/Gasoducto-de-Morelos-Gamaliel-Corral-2-MBN.jpg?h=07e30506&itok=Mvyxg1x-,N,,2025-12-04 09:02:04.003463

Those plans are now on hold after federal officials announced they would cancel the program, even though the funds were already distributed and projects were underway.

The Michigan Attorney General is right to challenge this reversal. At stake isn’t just funding, it’s fairness. The sudden halt means uncertainty for families expecting lower bills and for small businesses counting on steady work. Michigan had received $156 million to bring affordable, reliable energy to 18,000 households across the state and drive investment in the state’s clean energy workforce—all now in limbo.

With so many clean energy tax credits repealed under Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” it’s vital to protect programs like Solar for All, which ensure the benefits of the clean energy transition reach people of all income levels.

While solar adopters have grown more diverse, they still tend to be more affluent because rooftop solar is largely limited to individuals who own their own homes. Solar for All was created in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act so that low-income, rural, and disadvantaged communities could access clean, affordable, and reliable solar energy.

In Michigan, the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) has already awarded $13.9 million in grants to fund pilot programs for projects like installing solar on homes serving low-income and formerly homeless seniors in Oakland County and building rooftop solar for households with residents who rely on electric medical devices in the Upper Peninsula. All of the projects were designed to deliver at least a 20% reduction in household electricity costs for the participants while supporting local job growth by connecting solar installers and maintenance workers to new opportunities. EGLE Director Philip Roos estimated that the program would have created 700 high-quality jobs across the state.

None of this, unfortunately, is all that surprising. Sudden funding reversals have become a recurring pattern under the second Trump administration, often followed by court challenges and reinstatements. In fact, Solar for All contracts were frozen briefly before a federal judge ordered a reinstatement in April. The same happened with the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, which was eventually restored after a judge rejected the Department of Transportation’s efforts to cancel the program. In its press release unfreezing NEVI grants, the DOT acknowledged that it couldn’t withhold funding that was already approved by Congress. “We will respect Congress’ will,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement.

Solar for All seems to be following the same trajectory. It, too, was a congressionally approved program with federal funding already appropriated. But unlike previous attempts that stopped funds from going out, the Trump administration is trying to rescind money it has already disbursed. Even if Nessel’s office can get Solar for All funds reinstated, damage from the chaos, uncertainty, and paused work will have already been done.

As electricity bills continue to rise, no one disputes that we need more energy generation to keep up with demand and maintain affordability. But the way we achieve that goal matters. Halting programs that make energy cleaner and more affordable for working families is the wrong approach. Likewise, pulling the rug out from under workers and small businesses that rely on these programs will only lead to volatility in our local economies and undermine job security. We need policies that bring reliable, affordable energy to Michiganders without leaving anyone behind. And that means supporting programs like Solar for All.

Michigan has a rich history of innovation. That includes everything from manufacturing to mobility to energy. But innovation requires consistency. When programs like Solar for All are disrupted midstream, the real costs fall on families, workers, and small businesses. We need stable policies that keep energy affordable, create local jobs, and ensure that every Michigan community can share in the benefits of a cleaner, more reliable future.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/825e59_d7a79c5d435c4049a2bbb3c48a439cbbmv2_d_4000_3000_s_4_2-2048x1366-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 09:02:00.925957

These and other moving parts create an unusually large, wide-ranging and controversial application that landed before the New Mexico Public Regulatory Commission on Sept. 25.
Previously she spent four years as a policy director at the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department.
In 2020, the commission shot down a gas-fired power plant proposed by El Paso Electric, which provides electricity in parts of southern New Mexico and far West Texas.
But on the same day that the International Energy Agency released its World Energy Report, Chevron announced plans to build a natural gas power plant in Texas to power data centers.","The Southwestern Public Service Company has asked the state of New Mexico to grant exceptions to the state’s Energy Transition Act for two proposed gas-fired power plants, including one exception that would see approximately one-third of the energy produced at one plant qualify as a “zero-carbon resource” like solar panels or wind turbines.

A second exception would exempt both plants from the act’s zero-carbon requirement, “to preserve system reliability and protect customers from unreasonable bill impacts.”

The two proposed plants would be in Texas, with the larger of the two — called Gaines County Power Plant — to be built just across the border from Hobbs, New Mexico. Even though the two wouldn’t be in the state, New Mexico’s Energy Transition Act requires that all energy sold in the state by investor-owned utilities be from zero-carbon-emission sources by 2045, no matter where it is generated. The act was an early environmental win for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.

The request is part of a wide-ranging application the Southwestern Public Service Company, a subsidiary of Xcel Energy, has before the Public Regulation Commission of New Mexico for new transmission lines, extended closure dates for existing coal-fired power plants and eight new power facilities — two each of natural gas, solar, wind and battery systems. The $10 billion plan covers the company’s service area in the southeast corner of the state and parts of West Texas.

While most of the proposed plants would generate renewable energy, the two gas plants would generate 51% of the total energy in the application.

“To pretend that natural gas in some way or another is a zero carbon resource is just a bald-faced lie,” said Camilla Feibelman, director of the Sierra Club Rio Grande Chapter, and an energy watchdog. “It’s profound greenwashing.”

Southwestern Public Service Company has requested that all costs associated with two new solar projects be borne by New Mexico ratepayers.

The majority of Southwestern Public Service Company’s coverage area and energy sales are in Texas, but, according to Xcel, much of the projected increase in energy would be used in New Mexico, particularly in the state’s portion of the Permian Basin, the nation’s largest oil field. More than 50% of the company’s energy sales in New Mexico already go to oil and gas companies to power their wells and other infrastructure with grid-based electricity. Oil and gas revenues are also the state’s biggest single source of income.

According to the application, replacing the two proposed gas plants with renewable energy sources would cost New Mexico customers an additional $5.5 billion and raise residential electricity rates by more than 40%.

And the gas plants may be on the way. “We have already signed and executed contracts for the turbines,” Kaley Green, a senior media relations representative for Xcel Energy, said. “We anticipate a 40-year service life for each of the plants.”

In the application the company requests that all costs associated with the two solar projects be borne by New Mexico ratepayers because they will be built to meet New Mexico Energy Transition Act requirements, “not because they were needed for the overall system.” In addition, it asks for a speedy approval of the solar plants to secure renewable energy tax credits that were enhanced under President Joe Biden but had their timeframes dramatically curtailed under President Donald Trump.

These and other moving parts create an unusually large, wide-ranging and controversial application that landed before the New Mexico Public Regulatory Commission on Sept. 25. The commission plans to reach a decision on the Gaines Plant zero-carbon request by Dec. 10 and a decision on the full application by May 7. Green said that Southwestern Public Service Company began work on the proposal in 2022.

“It is a lot for one filing, but it’s not absurd,” said AnnaLinden Weller, senior policy adviser with Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit that fights climate change and its impacts across the western U.S. Previously she spent four years as a policy director at the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. “It’s certainly the biggest one that I’ve seen, but not by a huge amount.”

Southwestern Public Service Company cites several factors for the size and complexity of the application: It wants to close two aging coal-fired plants in Texas; it sees increased demand from oil and gas producers in the Permian Basin, data centers and other industries; and there are new requirements from the power-sharing system in which the new plants would operate, the Southwest Power Pool. Despite its name, the pool runs from southeast New Mexico north to the Canadian border, balancing production loads from utility companies in 14 states along the way.

In August 2024, the pool raised the production reserve requirements of member utilities like Xcel from an annual 15% to 16% in summer and 36% in winter. (A production reserve requirement is extra power production capacity available for unexpected peak loads.) The new winter load requirement was in part a response to the winter storms of 2021 and 2022 that created sudden, massive electrical demands from damaged energy systems across the Southwest Power Pool.

The next 20 years are critical for mitigating catastrophic future warming — but that goal may already be out of reach due to increasing oil and gas use.

The request to keep the new gas-fired plants beyond 2045, when New Mexico pledged to reach zero carbon emissions, aims for a possible loophole in the law.

“So there’s a weird thing about the Renewable Energy Act. It doesn’t prohibit fossil fuels per se,” Weller said, so long as the utility can convince the Public Regulation Commission that it will be producing zero carbon electricity for New Mexico customers by 2045 while hitting ever smaller targets along the way.

Xcel’s Green said, “We will continue to work towards compliance with the 2045 goals and adjust our grid planning as we proceed, based on technology and other factors.”

If that’s not possible, Weller said the commission has the discretion to give utilities “wiggle room” for the 2045 zero carbon requirement if the utility faces reliability or affordability issues — both of which Southwestern Public Service Company explicitly claimed in its application. No utility has tried for such an exemption before, Weller said.

In 2020, the commission shot down a gas-fired power plant proposed by El Paso Electric, which provides electricity in parts of southern New Mexico and far West Texas. That plant would have produced about 11% of the electricity that the proposed Gaines County and Tolk plants would generate together. But, “They didn’t have a plan for how it would be possible for them to comply with the Renewable Energy Act,” Weller said — such as asking for exemptions from the act.

Another loophole in the act allows a utility to claim a fossil fuel plant is a “zero carbon resource” if that plant’s use reduces methane emissions “as a result of electricity production” by a 10-to-1 ratio or better of carbon dioxide to methane emissions. Southwestern Public Service Company hired an outside economist to show how electrifying oil and gas operations in the Permian Basin could offset enough methane emitted by wells and associated facilities to qualify roughly one-third of the electricity from the Gaines County plant as “zero carbon.”

“We’re still thinking about that as a legal question,” Weller said. “A plain reading of the Renewable Energy Act [the underlying law for the Energy Transition Act] says that the generation resource has to be zero carbon, not the effects of the generation resource.”

She added, “Are there climate impacts? Yeah. The question is are they big enough or worthwhile enough given what you’re building.”

Both carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gasses that contribute to climate warming, but methane is far more potent, producing more than 80 times the warming potential as carbon dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere. The next 20 years are critical for mitigating catastrophic future warming — but that goal may already be out of reach due to increasing oil and gas use.

On Nov. 12, the International Energy Agency released its 2025 World Energy Outlook, which concluded that oil and gas demand will not peak before 2050, as previously hoped for — and needed — if the planet is to avoid increasingly frequent climate change catastrophes. The report goes on to say that with the increase in fossil fuel use, “exceeding 1.5°C is now inevitable.” Holding global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels was the stated goal of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement.

“There is some low-hanging fruit that we can get from electrifying the oil field, and ideally the infrastructure would be communicable to some future replacement industries that might help the state head in some different direction,” said Feibelman, the Sierra Club director.

“But you can’t deny the fact that it basically builds a more permanent infrastructure around oil and gas extraction,” she continued. “There’s this fantasy that we’ll be able to make oil and gas extraction something that’s sustainable in the short or long term, and that’s just not a fact.”

In 2023, Chevron touted a 20-megawatt solar field it built in southern New Mexico to power a nearby gas facility and reduce the company’s greenhouse gas emissions. For a while, the facility was a prominent focus of the company’s social media advertising in New Mexico.

But on the same day that the International Energy Agency released its World Energy Report, Chevron announced plans to build a natural gas power plant in Texas to power data centers. The plant is expected to produce 2.5 gigawatts of electricity, 125 times the amount of the solar field.

When asked about the fossil fuel power plants in the Southwestern Public Service Company application and how they mesh with the Energy Transition Act her administration championed, Gov. Lujan Grisham’s office punted.

Jodi McGinnis Porter, the governor’s deputy communications director, wrote, “Nearly half of this proposal is renewable energy. The same law that sets those aggressive renewables targets provides an exception process for utilities to protect system reliability. We’re confident the [Public Regulation Commission] can make the technical determination about whether it’s truly necessary. We’ll let that process move forward.”

If approved, Southwestern Public Service Company will build the Gaines County plant about five miles south-southeast of Hobbs, a town of about 40,000. The prevailing wind patterns would carry much of the exhaust from the new plant right over town.

“It’s not like there’s some bright-line border separating New Mexico and Texas’ pollution,” Feibelman said, and the region already suffers from bad air pollution. The American Lung Association has given both Lea and Eddy counties — the center of New Mexico’s portion of the Permian — failing grades for their ozone levels. The American Lung Association does not have ozone figures for the Texas side of the basin.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-93/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/permian_2025-01-scaled-11764782769.jpg?h=69f2b9d0&itok=qAbozNar,N,,2025-12-04 12:01:51.863961

Kiley has trotted out the familiar anti-gerrymandering slogan, “voters should choose their representatives, representatives shouldn’t choose their voters.” More generally, he has called out the partisan opportunism that has spread throughout our system and created a sense of political disempowerment.","There is something surreal about the conflict currently playing out in Indiana, where the president of the United States has turned his tweet-borne fury on a group of Republican state senators. Their offense? Not wanting to change the state’s congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterms.

In 2024, about 40 percent of Hoosiers voted for a Democrat for both U.S. senator and governor. Given that partisan split, the current U.S. House delegation of seven Republicans and two Democrats might seem more than satisfactory for Republicans. And given that mid-decade redistricting is unusual (not to say unheard of), one might think that continuing to use the map drawn in 2021, after the last census, is entirely unremarkable.

And yet, in our strange moment of gerrymander-mania, the 20 or so Republican state legislators willing to stand up for standing pat are indeed quite extraordinary. Their willingness to resist Donald Trump, who bestrides their party like a colossus, requires not only gumption but also courage; having earned the president’s ire, at least 11 of these state legislators have been the targets of “swatting” or bomb threats. Less menacingly, they are also likely to draw primary challenges.

That one of the leading senators is named “Goode” makes it tempting to see the conflict in Manichaean terms. One may wish to salute these lawmakers for their fortitude—the Washington Post’s editorial page, for example, offered its devoutly centrist “kudos” to them.

But what are they actually standing up for? What are our gerrymandering wars all about?

The president and his Republican antagonists have two very different visions of representation in our political system.

Trump’s position flows straightforwardly from his view of politics as a sorting of people into two camps: those who are with him in taking on the corrupt establishment, and those who are against him. Trump is no political theorist, of course, but he has a consistent plebiscitary instinct in making sense of political conflict. The big question for voters, of course, is who they want to be president; once they have chosen, every ensuing decision is a kind of echo referendum on whether they will affirm their commitment or renege. Trump was quick to condemn Indiana’s “RINO senators” in his way; a decade ago, “Republicans In Name Only” was applied to ideological squishes, but in Trump’s time, it is simply a term of abuse for those Republicans who (on any given day) are unprepared to reaffirm their support for the president.

Trump’s partisan allies may wish to represent aspects of their constituencies that do not figure in this grand struggle, and even today’s with-me-or-against-me politics leave room for action on lesser issues, where the president is not actively engaging. Republican Rep. Randy Feenstra of Iowa could push through a bill improving IRS-taxpayer communications without the president even bothering to comment; even Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona could move a bill requiring a study of cancer prevalence in the armed services.

But when ideas of local or interest-based representation leave legislators crosswise with the president, the conflict must be worked out quickly. Trump is not always imperious; sometimes he reverts to his deal-making, conciliatory sensibility. On the question of his tariff policies’ effects on U.S. farmers, Trump’s strategy is to use side payments to minimize objections, though it is unclear whether that will be enough to satisfy angry cattle ranchers this time around.

On pure questions of political advantage, though, it is difficult to find any middle ground. Are you for him, or against? If for, the thinking goes, then why not do everything possible (at least what is defensibly within the rules) to maximize our side’s scope for action? If our side is not willing to use its power to implement our mandate, what are we here for?

Such logic has convinced Republican legislators in Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina to redraw their congressional districts this year with an eye to maximizing their advantage; Florida may well follow. Democrats in California framed their own redistricting, put to voters in a ballot initiative, as an explicit response to Republicans’ seat grabs; if they’ll do it, then surely we should too.

Framed in these terms, the makeup of the House of Representatives really is important, but only in one sense: whether the president’s party has enough seats to help him “fulfill his mandate” or, instead, whether the opposition party has enough seats to “stop his abuses.” Midterm elections, which tend to favor the party not holding the White House, can be regarded as a benign means of registering Americans’ thermostatic preferences. But, from the president’s point of view, they can alternatively be seen as a way for bad actors to nullify the “real” decision rendered by the American people in the presidential election.

If this seems like a rather thin idea of representation, flattening out nearly all the differences between citizens from different parts of the country, its very simplicity makes it quite potent, especially when the president pursues it with the many carrots and sticks at his disposal. Gov. Mike Braun’s summation of the situation gets right to the point: “If [the Senate is] dragging its feet, and keeping Indiana from doing things that we could, especially with the relationship we have with the administration, who knows what happens with that good relationship. We can’t have a Senate that’s constantly a wet blanket.” In this view (which Braun hardly rushed to embrace), the legislator’s first and foremost duty is to stay onside with the party’s top leader.

What is the contrasting vision driving the opponents of redistricting?

First, many of the objectors are making straightforward tactical and prudential arguments that do not rise to the level of philosophical disagreements. They believe attempts to redistrict will face legal resistance that will render them useless or even counterproductive. (Notably, the Maryland Senate’s top Democrat has opposed redistricting efforts in the Old Line State for this reason, and has been harshly criticized by Democrats for not being more willing to pursue complete dominance in the blue state.) Texas Republicans’ current legal difficulties (now before the U.S. Supreme Court) suggest the merits of such concerns, however they are ultimately resolved. An aggressive Indiana redistricting would probably face a civil rights challenge (which the Indiana Black Legislative Caucus has indicated it would bring).

A more fundamental objection to redistricting, cited by many of the GOP objectors, is simply that Hoosiers do not support redrawing their lines. When the aforementioned state senator, Greg Goode, held a listening session with his constituents, not one stood up to argue for the propriety of the mid-decade redistricting, and only six of 200 who attended noted their support on a sign-in sheet. More generally, opinion polling shows that most Hoosiers are skeptical of the move. Legislators apparently feel obliged to represent the stated opinions of their constituents fairly, even when that conflicts with directives from their party’s leadership. The Indiana Senate’s president pro tempore, Rodric Bray, argues that if they are seen by their constituents as constantly manipulating the rules of the game, they will lack the trust needed to make difficult decisions stick.

Indiana Republicans also profess faith in their ability to add a GOP seat through old-fashioned contestation, without changing any boundaries. Indiana’s 1st Congressional District, centered on the city of Gary in the northwest corner of the state, has sent a Democrat to the House every cycle since 1930, but it is a genuinely competitive district today; Kamala Harris carried it with just 49.4 percent of the vote, and incumbent Rep. Frank J. Mrvan won just 53.4 percent. Republicans say they think a strong effort there could plausibly flip the district in their very red state.

Implicit in this argument is a normative defense of the continuity of representation, and it ought to be made explicit. There is a positive good being served by Indiana’s congressional districts remaining more or less steady, which gives voters a genuine sense of political self-determination. The 1st District has covered the state’s northwest corner for many decades, allowing its residents a sense that their region has a real voice in Washington. The current Mrvan’s father, Frank E. Mrvan Jr., was a state senator for decades. If the residents of Gary see fit to change direction, as they might well do, it should be on account of their own choice, not because the national GOP found a way to tactically outmaneuver Democrats.

On the national stage, the person who has best articulated this position is Rep. Kevin Kiley, a California Republican who is likely to lose his seat after his state’s redistricting and has offered a bill to prohibit mid-decade redistricting. Kiley has trotted out the familiar anti-gerrymandering slogan, “voters should choose their representatives, representatives shouldn’t choose their voters.” More generally, he has called out the partisan opportunism that has spread throughout our system and created a sense of political disempowerment. A situation of “rolling redistricting, where the ground beneath our feet is constantly shifting—and, by the way, creating a huge distraction for the entire country at a time when we have so many more important things to worry about,” ultimately leaves our republic weaker, Kiley convincingly argues.

The vision of representation shared by Kiley and the Indiana objectors is one in which voters and their representatives have a meaningful relationship that goes well beyond partisan affiliation. That vision holds to our founding ideal of self-government in a way that the plebiscitary vision does not, and it still holds real appeal for the American people, even as the us-and-them dynamic dominates media coverage of our political moment and holds sway with our most influential partisan leaders. It will be fascinating to see whether the ideal of local representation can hold its ground—and Indiana’s district boundaries—in the months ahead.",https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/favicon-32x32.png?x85095&v=69BgboyWbL,N,,2025-12-04 09:58:52.448665

Strong demand for French electric vehicles In a declining French automobile market, EVs are holding up well.
Despite the market downturn, electric cars are holding up well because they are becoming increasingly affordable.
Only the Tesla Model Y is an exception, being the only “premium” car in electric cars top sales.
Maintaining the deadlines while supporting the European electric vehicle sector will help the automobile sector overcome the risks associated with this transition.","With the aim to reduce its CO2 emissions and costly fossil-fuel imports, in 2022 the European Parliament adopted a rule that, from 2035, all new vehicles must be zero-emission, which essentially means that they must be electric. However, this rule is now being questioned, with car manufacturers requesting that it be revised to allow plug-in hybrids or vehicles that run on biofuels, among other changes. Ultimately, if these changes are permitted, this would amount to the continuation of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles being sold after 2035.

To justify their requests, the manufacturers are highlighting the crisis that the automobile sector is facing, with declining sales and some factories shutting down. Added to this are the risks of new competition from China, particularly strong in the electric vehicle (EV) segment, as highlighted in a recent parliamentary report (Senat, 2025).

Yet, on closer inspection, the sector’s crisis is less due to the rise of EVs than to manufacturers’ ill-suited strategy of focusing on larger and more expensive ICE vehicles. In a shrinking automobile market, EVs are holding up better than ICE vehicles, especially small French models. Finally, France is well-positioned to produce more EVs, justifying the significant investments made in the sector, from batteries to EV charging infrastructure.

A crisis inherited from the “premium” strategy

Over 25 years, French vehicle production (specifically passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, heavy trucks, buses and coaches) has dropped from 3.3 million to 1.4 million vehicles, leading to factory closures and many job losses (DGE, 2024). This long-standing crisis, which began well before the rise of EVs, is explained by an automobile market that has increasingly focused on “premium” vehicles—more powerful, heavier, larger, and, above all, more expensive. This is a domain where German brands excel, while French brands, specialising in small vehicles, have failed to establish themselves: between 2001 and 2023, Renault, Citroën and Peugeot lost market share, dropping from 25% to 15% of the EU market (Pardi, 2025). Furthermore, to remain competitive in the low-cost small vehicles market, French automobile groups have offshored a large part of their production: in 2023, French car manufacturers produced 23% of their light vehicles in France compared to 53% in 2005 (Banque de France, 2025).

This strategy accelerated after the Covid crisis. Between 2020 and 2024, vehicle prices in France increased by 24% and sales fell by 22%. According to a detailed analysis of prices by segment, researchers from the Institute Mobility in Transition found that half of the price increase is due to manufacturers’ market power, through upselling and pricing power (IMT, 2025). Beyond excluding much of the middle class from the new-car market, this strategy leads to a 22% drop in sales. This trend has intensified in 2025: based on data available to date, the market is expected to reach 1.71 million registrations by year-end, compared to 1.76 million in 2024 and 1.82 million in 2023.

Strong demand for French electric vehicles

In a declining French automobile market, EVs are holding up well. In 2025, sales of electric cars have already surpassed those of 2024 for the same period. According to data available at the end of September, and factoring in France’s most recent round of its social leasing programme (launched on 30th September),1 electric cars should reach about 20% of the market for new cars in France for the whole of 2025 (see the chart below).

Source: SDES, “New light vehicle engines – CO2 emissions and ecological bonus” – September 2025.

Despite the market downturn, electric cars are holding up well because they are becoming increasingly affordable. Their operating cost is much lower than that of ICE vehicles, but their purchase price has long been the main barrier. Nowadays, however, more affordable models are becoming available, such as the Renault 5 e-Tech or the Citroën ë-C3 launched at the end of 2024, both under €25,000. In addition, subsidies, previously in the form of an ecological bonus and now via an energy savings certificate (a “Certificat d’Economie d’Energie”, CEE) premium, help reduce the extra purchase cost compared to an ICE car.

Above all, affordable small models are successful in France. The latest round of the social leasing programme, with EVs available at between €100 and €200 per month, is in high demand among low-income households. In the rest of the market, small electric cars are also popular: the Renault 5, ë-C3 and Peugeot e-208—three city cars at moderate prices—are three of the four best-selling models. Only the Tesla Model Y is an exception, being the only “premium” car in electric cars top sales.

Measures to support the European automobile industry

Currently, about 75% of the value chain of an EV sold in Europe is also located in Europe. While this is a high share, it is lower than that of an ICE vehicle produced in Europe, at 90%. This difference is mainly due to the battery, which is often made in China, with key components also produced there. As things stand, the transition to EVs would expose car manufacturers in Europe to supply risks. This is why support for the restructuring of the sector is being provided at both the French and the EU level, with subsidies from the French government for the creation of battery gigafactories, or the implementation of the “RESourceEU” plan2 to develop the entire supply chain in Europe, including sourcing rare earths.

Competition from Chinese EVs, often cheaper than European ones, is also presented as an obstacle to the automobile sector becoming 100% electric. However, to limit the impact of this competition, which is considered not to be on a level playing field, measures have been put in place, such as taxes on imports of EVs made in China. The application of these taxes has not only limited imports of Chinese vehicles but also encouraged manufacturers to produce in Europe. Financial incentives for buying or leasing EVs also help, with the environmental score in the French eco-bonus3 or the European Commission super-bonus for vehicles whose battery is made in Europe. Thus, in 2024, imports of EVs fell by a quarter, reducing France’s trade deficit in this market segment (Les Échos, 14th August 2025).

Reversing the 2035 zero-emissions target puts investments and activities at risk

With state support, automobile manufacturers and energy providers have joined forces to organise the production of EVs in France, especially battery manufacturing, by creating gigafactories. Building these large-scale plants required significant investment, some of which was state-subsidised. Developing production capacity provides security of supply for the automobile sector and better cost control, but to succeed against cheaper Chinese batteries, these plants need outlets in the national and European markets.

Downstream, in order to overcome what has often been a barrier to EV adoption, vehicle charging infrastructure providers have made significant investments and increased the number of available charging stations. They now need to see their infrastructure being used in order to make their investments profitable.

The transition to EVs is accelerating, due to their advantages in combating climate change and reducing air pollution, their lower operating cost, and their contribution to energy security. Revising the targets would delay the sector’s transformation and put at risk the investments made in the EV production chain in France. Moreover, revising the rule, and including plug-in hybrids or biofuels vehicles, would not provide any immediate outlet for currently unsold ICE vehicles. Maintaining the deadlines while supporting the European electric vehicle sector will help the automobile sector overcome the risks associated with this transition.",https://www.i4ce.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Maia_a-la-une.png,N,,2025-12-04 11:08:42.243466

As written under the current version of the bill, ratepayers would pay those subsidies in perpetuity.
Nuclear plant cost overruns aren’t unheard of, and they can be significant.
Two nuclear units completed in Georgia in 2023 saw their cost balloon from a projected $14 billion to a realized $31 billion.
Some detractors warned against imposing additional costs on ratepayers before the state studies what types of energy generation best fit its needs.","An unusual coalition that includes business groups, environmental activists, and New Jersey’s ratepayer advocate is urging lawmakers to reject a legislative proposal that would see residents pay for the construction of a new nuclear power plant years before it begins sending energy to the grid.

The bill, introduced last month during the final weeks of the Legislature’s current session, would add a mandatory charge on every ratepayer’s electricity bill to cover 5% of the projected construction costs of a to-be-constructed nuclear plant generating at least 1,100 megawatts of electricity.

The measure’s opponents warn that the bill, sponsored by Sens. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex) and John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester), would shift risk from the plant’s developers to residents who could ill-afford further rate increases after a steep hike this summer that will be followed by another price spike next June.

“There are going to be people after this bill who aren’t going to be able to afford their electric bill,” Brian Lipman, director of the state’s rate counsel division, which advocates for utility customers before the state’s energy regulators, told the Senate’s energy committee Monday.

The advanced nuclear development charge would add between $22 and $55 to residential ratepayers’ monthly bills, Lipman said, and consumers would likely pay that charge for at least a decade before a nuclear plant actually comes online. Lipman called that framework unprecedented.

The plan would lead some to pay as much as $6,600 over the next decade for a plant that will not have produced any electricity.

As written under the current version of the bill, ratepayers would pay those subsidies in perpetuity.

“I don’t think any of us intend that this credit is something that’s going to be paid by our grandchildren for, say, the 80-year expected life of the facility,” said Abe Silverman, an energy research scholar at Johns Hopkins University.

The committee advanced the bill in a 4-1 vote. Sen. Parker Space (R-Sussex) voted no.

Though New Jersey’s ratepayers fund utilities’ infrastructure investments through their utility bills, utilities are only permitted to recoup the cost of their investments after projects go into service.

Industrial and commercial customers who use large amounts of power and almost exclusively procure their electricity from off-grid third-party suppliers would face far steeper costs, said Steven Goldenberg, counsel for the New Jersey Large Energy Users Coalition.

“When Brian says that the average residential ratepayer will see the rates increase $55 a month, that is huge,” Goldenberg said. “But when it gets translated to my people, we’re talking five figures every month.”

Board of Public Utilities President Christine Guhl-Sadovy, the only person to speak in favor of the bill during Monday’s committee hearing, argued that private firms need subsidies to secure U.S. Department of Energy loans that could cover as much as 80% of a nuclear project’s costs.

Energy markets could not support private investment in new nuclear plants despite recent and looming price rises, she said, at least not without ratepayer support.

“Even conservative estimates for load growth make a strong case for building new nuclear generation. We have a responsibility at the BPU to ensure reliable and affordable utility service. If the state does not invest in new generation, electricity will continue on the path of being unaffordable,” she said.

Opponents said the risk to ratepayers is too great.

Provisions in the bill would allow developers to seek and obtain, as-of-right, ratepayer dollars to help pay for cost overruns not exceeding 20% of a project’s forecasted costs, and developers are permitted to seek ratepayer funds for larger increases with approval from the Board of Public Utilities.

The state would be hard-pressed to deny requests for larger cost overruns, especially those that come years into a project’s development, Silverman said. Those requests would put regulators in a difficult position: Pay more, or kill a project for which ratepayers have already supported with hundreds of millions — or even billions — of dollars.

Nuclear plant cost overruns aren’t unheard of, and they can be significant. Two nuclear units completed in Georgia in 2023 saw their cost balloon from a projected $14 billion to a realized $31 billion. Some estimates peg the cost as high as $37 billion. The units went online more than six years behind schedule.

The Georgia plants’ construction was the first the country saw in decades. Guhl-Sadovy argued the lessons learned there would prevent similar overruns in New Jersey.

“A lot of mistakes, I think, were made and recognized, and changes have been made,” she said. “We would not anticipate those kinds of cost overruns.”

The bill would not require developers of a project completed on time to fully return the ratepayers’ investment. Though the bill mandates developers return at least some revenue to ratepayers, it would allow the Board of Public Utilities to negotiate how much.

Some detractors warned against imposing additional costs on ratepayers before the state studies what types of energy generation best fit its needs.

Others warned New Jersey wouldn’t see the full benefits of cost reduction from subsidized new generation because that power would be sold on PJM Interconnection’s 13-state grid, spreading its benefit to states outside of New Jersey.

There’s no guarantee that subsidized nuclear plants could even participate in PJM. The U.S. Supreme Court found a 2011 New Jersey program that sought to underwrite the construction of new gas plants by guaranteeing they earn a set amount in energy markets unconstitutionally infringed on federal regulatory authority.

“This bill does almost the same thing,” Lipman said in written testimony provided to the committee.

Others cautioned the bill should not move before Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill takes office.

Energy policy was a major focus of her campaign, and adding $55 in fixed monthly costs could doom her pledge to freeze energy rates once she’s inaugurated on Jan. 20.

“I don’t think that we should be working, moving forward on comprehensive reform or any kind of major investment in new generation in front of Mikie Sherrill taking her seat,” said Dena Mottola Jaborska, associated director of New Jersey Citizen Action. “She did make this a signature issue in her campaign, and I do feel like six weeks is not enough time.”

It’s not clear whether the bill will reach Gov. Phil Murphy’s desk before he leaves office, or if he would sign it if it does.

The bill had no Assembly companion as of Wednesday, and the Senate version did not appear on the agenda for the Senate Budget Committee’s Monday meeting.

Sen. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex), the bill’s prime sponsor, appeared to suggest the measure could see changes.

“Is this a controversial bill? Yes. Do we have any solutions for the future of New Jersey? Not really. Has the discussion started? Yes, it has,” he said.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-92/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/power-plant-scaled-1-1024x6861764849538.jpg?h=e7c891e8&itok=e3qo4Soc,N,,2025-12-04 09:02:17.803930

But high natural gas prices and growing demand for electricity are playing a bigger role in stoking demand for coal.
Last year, natural gas prices averaged $2.20 per million British thermal units, while this year they are on track to average $3.50 per MMBtu.
American LNG shipments are expected to increase 25 percent this year, putting upward pressure on domestic natural gas prices.
But hitting those numbers will be hard for coal plants given large seasonal jumps in renewable production, he said.","Electricity markets used to be predictable. In 2025, they’re anything but.

Coal is enjoying a revival, natural gas generation is down, and renewables are forging ahead despite political headwinds. Some of that is driven by annual idiosyncrasies like weather, which increased electricity demand this year, and President Donald Trump’s dismantling of environmental regulations and the Inflation Reduction Act.

But most of the market’s upheaval is due to wider economic trends that burst into full view this year — namely, the growth in U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas and rising electricity demand from data centers.

“I feel like we’re at the edge of the storm,” said Ric O’Connell, the executive director of the consulting firm GridLab. “The storm is the load growth that is showing up in the next couple of years. The IRA is going away, and gas prices are potentially going to spike. The next couple of years could be messy.”

The trends mark a fundamental shift from the previous decade, which was defined by stagnant power demand, low natural gas prices, coal plant retirements and a wave of renewable installations.

Firing up coal

Coal generation was up 13 percent through the end of September compared with the same time last year, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. Part of the increase is due to a cold winter and hot summer, said Andy Blumenfeld, an analyst who tracks coal markets at the consulting company McCloskey by OPIS.

But high natural gas prices and growing demand for electricity are playing a bigger role in stoking demand for coal. Last year, natural gas prices averaged $2.20 per million British thermal units, while this year they are on track to average $3.50 per MMBtu. Next year, gas prices are expected to increase to an average $4 per MMBtu, according to EIA.

When utilities see gas prices like that, they tend to fire up coal.

Coal has enjoyed mini-revivals before, most recently in 2022. What makes this year different is that coal’s rebound is playing out at a time when the U.S. is shipping more gas abroad while demand for power grows at home.

American LNG shipments are expected to increase 25 percent this year, putting upward pressure on domestic natural gas prices.

“LNG is tying us more to global markets that pay more than we do for gas,” said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas, Austin. “That has to put more upward pressure on gas.”

Power-hungry AI

At the same time, technology companies and data center developers are hoovering up all the megawatts they can find.

Analysts predict the artificial intelligence boom will need 106 gigawatts of power by 2035, drastically driving up U.S. energy demand. Electricity demand nationwide was up 2 percent through the first nine months of the year, according to EIA data.

All that is a recipe for generating electricity from coal plants that once sat idle. In 2023 and 2024, coal plants ran at 42 percent of their capacity. This year, they are running at almost half capacity.

Growing electricity demand has been “good news” for coal plant operators, Blumenfeld said.

“Coal is low-hanging fruit,” he said, noting it is easy for utilities to fire up existing plants.

Even so, there are limits to how much coal can grow. In the fuel’s heyday, coal plants typically operated around 60 percent of their capacity, Blumenfeld said. That gives coal plants some more room to grow production. But hitting those numbers will be hard for coal plants given large seasonal jumps in renewable production, he said.

Indeed, wind and solar generated 646 terawatt-hours of electricity in the U.S. through September, eclipsing the 561 TWh produced by coal. Gas, meanwhile, was down 4 percent to almost 1,384 TWh.

The strong renewable numbers stem in large part from another strong year for solar installations. But GridLab’s O’Connell expects those numbers to fall starting in 2027 because of Trump’s moves to end clean energy tax credits and make it more difficult to build wind and solar projects.

O’Connell’s chief concern is that the U.S. will find itself in a position where it is more exposed to global fluctuations in gas prices at the same time power demand is rising and renewable installations slow.

“Those are going to be felt in five years when projects that should have come online don’t come online,” he said. “This is perfect storm. We took away support for clean energy when we needed it most and we needed to get it online quickly.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/17/6b/f3a429104614a4a6461595f012a9/election-2024-war-on-coal-42153.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 07:59:07.311870

Storage market twists and turns Though the storage industry pioneers somehow nailed the 35-gigawatt goal, market growth defied their expectations in several important ways.
California, Texas, and Arizona alone hold roughly 80% of all U.S. battery storage capacity.
In 2017 the storage industry was intently focused on getting batteries installed, not so much on where they came from.
“By the end of next year, we anticipate reaching the milestone of producing as many domestic energy storage battery cells as we need for demand,” Roberts said.","In 2017, the early leaders in energy storage made an audacious bet: 35 gigawatts of the new grid technology would be installed in the United States by 2025.

That goal sounded improbable even to some who believed that storage was on a growth trajectory. A smattering of independent developers and utilities had managed to install just 500 megawatts of batteries nationwide, equivalent to one good-size gas-fired power plant. Building 35 gigawatts would entail a 70-fold growth in just eight years.

The number didn’t come out of thin air, though. The Energy Storage Association worked with Navigant Research to model scenarios based on a range of assumptions, recalled Praveen Kathpal, then chair of the ESA board of directors. The association decided to run with the most aggressive of the defensible scenarios in its November 2017 report.

In 2021, ESA agreed to merge with the American Clean Power Association and ceased to exist. But, somehow, its boast proved not self-aggrandizing but prophetic.

The U.S. crossed the threshold of 35 gigawatts of battery installations this July and then passed 40 gigawatts in the third quarter, according to data from the American Clean Power Association. The group of vendors, developers, and installers who just eight years ago stood at the margins of the power industry is now second only to solar developers in gigawatts built per year. Storage capacity outnumbers gas power in the queues for future grid additions by a factor of 6.5, according to data compiled by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

“Storage has become the dominant form of new power addition,” Kathpal said. ​“I think it’s fair to say that batteries are how America does capacity.”

Getting from basically no grid batteries to 35 gigawatts

Back in 2017, I was covering the young storage industry for an outlet called Greentech Media, a beat that was complicated by how little was happening. There was much to write about the ​“enormous potential” of energy storage to make the grid more reliable and affordable, but it required caveats like ​“if states change their grid regulations to allow this new technology to compete fairly on its merits, yada yada yada.”

Those batteries that did get built in 2017 look tiny by today’s standards. The locally owned utility cooperative in Kauai built a trailblazing 13-megawatt/52-megawatt-hour battery, the first such utility-scale system designed to sit alongside a solar power plant. And 2017 saw the tail end of the Aliso Canyon procurement, a foundational trial for the storage industry in which developers built a series of batteries in Southern California in just a handful of months to shore up the grid after a record-busting gas leak — adding up to about 100 megawatts.

“You saw green shoots of a lot of where the industry has gone,” said Kathpal.

California passed a law creating a storage mandate in 2010, then found a pressing need for the technology to neutralize the threat of summertime power shortages. Kauai’s small island grid quickly hit a saturation point with daytime solar, so the utility wanted a battery to shift that clean power into the nighttime. These installations weren’t research projects; they were solving real grid problems. But they were few and far in between.

Kathpal recalled one moment that encapsulated the storage industry’s early lean era. At the time, he was developing storage projects for the independent power producer AES. One night around midnight, he parked a rented Camry off a dirt road and pointed a flashlight through a sheet of rain. It was his last stop on a trip to evaluate potential lease sites for grid storage ahead of a utility procurement — looking at available space, proximity to the grid, and stormwater characteristics. But once the utility saw the bids, it decided not to install any batteries after all.

“The storage market is built not only from Navigant reports but also from moments like that,” he said. ​“We had to lose a lot of projects before we started winning.”

Now that same utility is putting out a call for storage near its substations — exactly the kind of setting Kathpal had toured in the rain all those years ago.

Indeed, many of the projects connected to the grid this year started with developers anticipating future grid needs and putting money on the line for storage back around the time ESA was formulating its big goal, said Aaron Zubaty, CEO of early storage developer Eolian.

“Eolian began developing projects around major metro areas in the western U.S. starting in 2016 and putting the queue positions in that then became operational in 2025,” Zubaty said. The 200-megawatt Seaside battery site at a substation in Portland, Oregon, is one example.

Storage market twists and turns

Though the storage industry pioneers somehow nailed the 35-gigawatt goal, market growth defied their expectations in several important ways.

ESA had expected more of a steady ramp to the 35 gigawatts, said Kelly Speakes-Backman, who served as its chief executive officer from 2017 to 2021. But the storage market ran into plenty of false starts, such as when states passed mandates to install batteries but never enforced them, and when federal regulators ordered wholesale markets to incorporate storage but regional implementation dragged on for years.

“Once it hit, it really hit,” Speakes-Backman said.

The regional breakdown of storage growth didn’t play out as ESA expected, either. The analysis anticipated that the Northeast would install more than 10 gigawatts, nearly as much as the Southwest (including California and Hawaii); after all, it noted, New England states had passed ​“aggressive greenhouse gas reduction policies.”

In fact, the Northeast has done exceedingly little to build large-scale storage. (Zubaty told me that ​“largely dysfunctional power markets combined with utilities that have excessive regulatory capture” thwarted many good battery projects there.)

But other regions surpassed ESA’s expectations. California, Texas, and Arizona alone hold roughly 80% of all U.S. battery storage capacity. This lopsided concentration of storage could be seen as a weakness of the industry. Noah Roberts, executive director of the recently formed Energy Storage Coalition, which advocates for storage in federal arenas, said the pattern reflects how storage has sprung up in spots that suffer acute grid stress.

“Where energy storage has been deployed to date, it is and has been concentrated in areas that have had the greatest reliability need,” he said. ​“That is Texas and California, where in the early 2020s there were blackouts or brownouts that were quite significant.”

Now, Roberts said, other regions can look at California and Texas for empirical data on how the storage influx has helped reliability while lowering grid costs, for instance by avoiding power scarcity during heat waves and pushing down peak prices. ​“We’re really seeing the broadening of the geographic footprint of energy storage deployment,” he said, to regions like the Midwest and the mid-Atlantic, which are grappling with unanticipated load growth.

Indeed, the ESA did not foresee the artificial intelligence boom sending power demand through the roof. Instead, its report predicted, ​“Electrified transportation will likely provide the largest source of new system load.” Now the storage industry has emerged as the biggest player in constructing firm, on-demand power plants, at the exact time that rapid power construction has become the key limiting factor in the AI arms race.

The storage market outdid expectations in one other major way. In 2017 the storage industry was intently focused on getting batteries installed, not so much on where they came from. Since then, bipartisan sentiment has shifted from unfettered global trade to a distinct preference for American manufacturing. The U.S. has made batteries for electric vehicles for years now, but the lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries favored for grid storage have come almost exclusively from China. Now manufacturers are opening domestic cell production for grid storage, just in time for new rules that constrain federal tax credits for battery projects with too much material from China.

LG Energy Solution opened a factory to produce battery cells for grid storage in Michigan this summer that is capable of producing up to 16.5 gigawatt-hours at full capacity; the company expects to raise that capacity to 40 gigawatt-hours by the end of 2026. ​“All of our projects integrated before 2022 combined are smaller than some of our newer individual projects,” noted Tristan Doherty, chief product officer of LG Energy Solution subsidiary Vertech, which focuses on grid batteries.

Tesla is opening domestic LFP battery fabrication in 2026. Fluence announced the first shipment of its ​“domestically manufactured energy storage system” in September. Newcomers with novel chemistries for longer-duration storage are joining the fray, such as Form Energy and Eos Energy, both of which operate factories outside Pittsburgh.

Turkey has imported 5.2 million tons of LNG so far this year, according to data compiled by BloombergNEF.","Turkey is exploring investments in US oil and gas fields as it accelerates a sweeping overhaul of its energy portfolio that’s so far been built around American LNG.

Turkish Petroleum Corp. is in talks with Chevron Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp. and other US majors to take positions in upstream assets, as part of Turkey’s plan to expand from its growing exposure to liquefied natural gas, the country’s Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar said Wednesday on the sidelines of the World LNG summit in Istanbul. Announcements might come as early as next month, he said.

The plan adds a new layer to Turkey’s expanding relationship with the US, which has become a major source of long-term gas supply to Ankara. While Turkey is looking to secure access to fuels that are key to power the energy-hungry $1.4 trillion economy and diversify sources away from Russia and Azerbaijan, it’s also a way for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to boost influence and build economic relationships.

The country has done LNG deals with companies including Mercuria Energy Group and Woodside Energy Group Ltd. for LNG supply, mainly from plants in the US. This week, it agreed 10-year contracts with Eni SpA and Germany’s SEFE.

Turkey has signed 150 billion cubic meters of long-term LNG agreements since late 2024, with much of the supply starting between 2027 and 2030. Bayraktar said US LNG has become “more competitive” than pipeline gas from Russia and Iran.

Turkey has imported 5.2 million tons of LNG so far this year, according to data compiled by BloombergNEF. That compares with 3.98 million tons for all of 2024. Additional supply also gives Turkish companies the option to boost gas trading to maximize profits.

Bayraktar said the country expects to take about 1,500 LNG cargoes over the next 10–15 years, with most indexed to Henry Hub gas pricing in the US.

To accommodate rising imports, Turkey plans to add two new floating storage and regasification units, expanding its fleet to five. Ankara plans to send one of these units to Egypt for the summer months to help cover Cairo’s seasonal gas shortages and is in talks with other countries, including Morocco, for similar arrangements.

Bayraktar also said Turkey could double annual gas transfer capacity to Bulgaria to as much as 7–10 billion cubic meters, pending minor upgrades on the Bulgarian side. That could unlock additional volumes for Southeast Europe and potentially for Ukraine.

Judge Penelope Richard of the 38th Judicial District Court, which includes Cameron Parish, suspended Commonwealth LNG’s permit last month in response to a lawsuit from the Sierra Club. She ruled the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy hadn’t considered the effects of climate change, the high density of gas export facilities already in the area and the disproportionate impact of pollution on nearby communities when it approved the permit.

The state agency then issued updated reasons Nov. 18 for approving Commonwealth’s permit, allowing the project to move forward. Officials again determined the proposed benefits of the project “outweigh the costs” of its environmental impact on Southwest Louisiana’s coast and communities.

“Economic benefit outweighing all of these things is frustrating to me,” said John Allaire, a Cameron Parish resident who lives within 30 miles of three existing LNG export facilities and six more planned or under construction. “The economic benefits of their facility outweigh flooding me out, outweigh the commercial fishing industry, outweigh the eastern black rail, outweigh protecting our cheniers … I don’t agree with that. How much is enough?”

The Department of Conservation and Energy’s new permit approval was based on an “independent analysis” of documents from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Those agencies considered the effects of climate change, environmental justice concerns and the cumulative impacts of multiple LNG facilities within a small area. All reached the same conclusion that the project’s benefits overshadow its costs.

Environmental groups staunchly disagree with the decision to reissue the permit.

The Sierra Club said in a statement through its managing attorney, Eric Huber, that the permit was approved “without any notice to the plaintiffs or the public,” who he said learned about it through the news reports. Turtle Island Restoration Network and Louisiana Bucket Brigade, also plaintiffs in the lawsuit, declined to comment.

Sierra Club attorneys are reviewing the latest permit approval to decide whether they will take further legal action. By reissuing the permit, the state Department of Conservation and Energy “continues to neglect its responsibility to protect the public health and welfare of all Louisianans,” their statement said.

In its new reasons for approving the permit, Conservation and Energy officials determined it was in the “best interest of the state” not to delay in reassessing the permit as reason for their speedy decision. This is, in part, related to the Trump administration’s “energy dominance” agenda, which calls for further expansion of industries like liquified natural gas.

The agency also justified its use of these external documents rather than doing its own research by citing the federal government’s decision to abandon its environmental justice analysis tools, following an executive order from President Donald Trump the day after he took office in January.

Benefits cited in the state’s permit approval include job creation. Commonwealth estimates it will employ an average of 800 construction workers per month, with a peak of 2,000, over the three-year period. Half of all these construction employees are expected to come from Cameron and Calcasieu parishes, according to the document.

The permit approval explanation did list downsides to the project, including the destruction of around 90 acres of coastal wetlands in Cameron Parish. State officials accounted for this, saying “these wetland impacts would be mitigated and would not have a significant cumulative impact on environmental justice communities.”

Community advocates like James Hiatt, director of nonprofit For a Better Bayou, question whether the state is acting in the best interests of its residents.

“The job is not to expedite permits and do whatever corporations want. Their job is to protect national resources, the public good, the public interest,” Hiatt said, citing ongoing issues in Cameron Parish with rapidly eroding coastal land and disproportionately high pollution levels in communities closest to the LNG export sites.

The Commonwealth LNG facility will be built 750 feet away from Allaire’s property line, he said, adding that he feels Cameron Parish won’t see enough of the economic benefit from these facilities to make up for all of the drawbacks.

“They keep saying, ‘Well, it’ll be mitigated by economic benefit to the community,’” he said. “But come on down here and see where the economic benefit to the community is. It’s not here.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/LNG-tanker-Cameron-Parish-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 06:59:59.750299

On Monday, Wolfspeed announced it received nearly $700 million in tax refunds through a provision of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act that subsidizes investments associated with qualifying U.S. semiconductor manufacturing projects. Wolfspeed has sought this 25% tax rebate after spending billions on a materials plant near Siler City.

The company anticipates seeing around $1 billion total through this subsidy, which is administered by the IRS and is separate from the $750 million CHIPS grant the government awarded Wolfspeed last year — money the chipmaker has not yet received.

Wolfspeed started production furnaces at its Siler City factory last year but has fallen far short of the 1,800 workers it had initially projected to hire there.

The company produces a unique semiconductor made from silicon carbide that is used in electric vehicles and other applications. Facing mounting debt and a slower-than-expected EV market, Wolfspeed began mass layoffs in the summer of 2024, which affected nearly one-third of its 5,000 employees, before the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy this June. It exited bankruptcy court in late September under a restructuring agreement that erased 70% of what it owed creditors.

In a statement Monday, Wolfspeed said it now has roughly $1.5 billion in cash reserves as it looks to extend its focus beyond electric vehicles to include more data centers, energy and defense applications.

“This substantial cash infusion further strengthens our liquidity position at a critical phase in Wolfspeed’s strategic evolution,” the company’s chief financial officer, Gregor Van Issum, wrote.

Founded in 1987, Wolfspeed remains one of the Triangle’s biggest and oldest tech employers.

Through the CHIPS tax rebate, it says it will continue to transition away from 150-millimeter substrates, or wafers, and toward larger 200-millimeter substrates that offer greater yields and potential cost-savings. The chipmaker plans to shut its 150-millimeter wafer factory in Durham by the end of this month.

Wolfspeed also fabricates chips at its plant in New York State’s Mohawk Valley.

Out of bankruptcy, the company still faces challenges due to the size of its factories. Demand for its silicon carbide chips continues to lag its facility space, the company reported in October, resulting in $47 million in underutilization costs at its New York State and Siler City plants.

Essentially, AI is a race that America doesn't want to lose. Of course, AI consumes a significant amount of energy, to the point that data center power consumption has become an increasingly contentious issue.

U.S. energy dominance is a key pillar of the Genesis Mission, which aims to power AI, modernize the power grid, and provide Americans with affordable and reliable energy.

Here are five energy stocks that could see tremendous growth opportunities as these developments unfold on America's path to becoming the world's AI leader over the coming years.

1. Constellation Energy

One of America's largest clean energy producers, Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG), has a capacity of over 32,400 megawatts. It powers approximately 20 million homes and businesses. It's also the country's largest nuclear power plant operator. The Genesis Mission announcement specifically referenced nuclear energy, which is clean and highly efficient, despite its tainted reputation from past incidents.

The Trump Administration has already supported Constellation Energy by supplying a $1 billion loan from the Department of Energy to restart its shuttered Three Mile Island reactor for a power purchase agreement with Microsoft. It will power the tech giant's data centers. It signals what could be the start of a revival for domestic nuclear energy generation.

2. NextEra Energy

An emphasis on U.S. energy independence bodes well for NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE). It operates America's largest electric utility, Florida Power & Light. The company is also a global leader in renewable power generation and storage. It boasts a total capacity of 33,410 megawatts across nuclear, natural gas, wind, solar, and battery storage.

The company is investing $75 billion in infrastructure for power generation and transmission between now and 2028 to meet high demand as data centers continue to put pressure on the electric grid. NextEra Energy has already enjoyed decades of steady growth, evidenced by 30 consecutive annual dividend increases. An emphasis on domestic energy should help continue NextEra's success.

3. Dominion Energy

The proximity to the federal government, combined with the presence of deep-sea cables, makes Northern Virginia a hotspot for data centers. Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) is one of the country's largest producers of offshore wind and solar energy, and operates a utility business that delivers power throughout Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.

Dominion Energy is reportedly in contract talks with data center companies on agreements totaling 47,000 megawatts of power. All these opportunities will likely create an enormous project pipeline for growth as the company invests in expanding its capacity, and makes Dominion Energy a no-brainer as a winner in the domestic energy push moving forward.

4. EQT Corporation

Natural gas is cleaner than coal, making it a likely benefactor as domestic energy use rises. EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT) is one of America's leading natural gas company. It primarily operates in the Marcellus Formation, a gas-rich region located in the Appalachian Basin. EQT Corporation's vertically integrated business spans exploration and midstream activities, helping keep its costs down.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, demand for U.S. natural gas production and output will set record highs. That trend will continue next year due to surging demand for exports. EQT Corporation targets a long-term break-even price (cash flow) for natural gas of just $2.00/MMBtu, positioning it as a cash cow as the American natural gas industry continues to thrive.

5. GE Vernova

Once part of a massive conglomerate, GE Vernova (NYSE: GEV) now stands independently as an energy giant. The company specializes in power generation equipment across wind, gas, and nuclear power generation, as well as the services to maintain it. Collectively, GE Vernova's customer base generates roughly a quarter of the world's electricity today.

Despite the turbulence, industry leaders said they see a bright future for hydrogen in Ohio.

“We’re building businesses in this state regardless of that federal funding,” said Bill Whittenberger, executive director of the Ohio Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Coalition, at the group’s 2025 symposium, held Oct. 27 and 28 at the Honda Heritage Center in Marysville, Ohio. In his view, federal funding ​“makes things go a little faster, [but] there’s a strong business case for all the things we’re doing here.”

Today, however, few industries use the fuel at a meaningful scale — and very little low-carbon hydrogen is available.

Still, conference attendees emphasized, some hydrogen projects are moving forward in Ohio.

There’s the plan from American Electric Power’s Ohio utility to power data centers with fuel cells, for example. It’s part of a broader AEP partnership with Bloom Energy to acquire up to 1 gigawatt of fuel cells to help the giant computing facilities get online faster.

“Speed to power trumps all other things,” said Amy Koscielak, a senior business development leader for AEP.

Earlier this year, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio green-lit plans for AEP’s Ohio utility to provide the systems’ output exclusively to those customers, although appeals are pending.

Ohio also has a few projects looking to harness electrolysis — a process that uses electricity to separate water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. If the electricity that feeds into electrolysis is clean, the resulting hydrogen is clean too.

Rather, the source would be an industrial waste stream from the INEOS KOH plant in Ashtabula, Ohio. The plant makes potassium hydroxide and other chemicals, and releases a waste stream that is almost all hydrogen.

“Those data centers are going to use a tremendous amount of water in their processes,” plant manager Chris Rogers said.
Neighbors among clients The Garyville plant was built in 1970 by Nalco Water, which became a subsidiary of Minnesota-based publicly traded Ecolab in 2011.
“When you prevent that, it allows for less electricity to be used to circulate and re-cool that cooling water,” Rogers said.
Cooling systems require make-up water to replace what escapes through evaporation and exhaust, and chemicals produced at the Garyville plant reduce the amount of replacement water needed.","Every month, up to 20 railcars, 500 tanker trucks and 2,000 freight shipments are loaded up with chemical products produced at Ecolab's 58-acre plant in St. John the Baptist Parish.

Headed to destinations ranging from nearby chemical plants to international clients, the Minnesota-based company ships about 227 million pounds of finished products from the Garyville facility.

Some 800 in all, those products are used for water treatment, industrial chemical processes and the systems used in cool power plants and AI data centers, as well as in more familiar settings like the hospitality industry.

Ecolab is the biggest U.S.-based player spanning the cleaning, sanitation and water management business. Analysts estimate it controls nearly 10% of a $165 billion global market. And about 10% of its products are only made in Louisiana.

The petrochemical giant and its subsidiaries have faced criticism from environmentalists and paid out more than $2 million in fines to environmental regulators for violations in other states, though it has a maintained relatively clean record at its Garyville plant.

Now, amid the rush to build massive data centers to support the AI industry, Ecolab is positioned to profit from the growing demand for its specialized treatments for cooling water — both at the centers themselves and the power plants being built to electrify them.

“Those data centers are going to use a tremendous amount of water in their processes,” plant manager Chris Rogers said. “So the chemicals that we use allow for water to be used much more efficiently and effectively — and in environmentally friendly ways.”

How it's made

Chemicals manufactured at the Garyville facility include polymers used in wastewater treatment to help clump and remove solids, in paper processing to make more absorbent paper towels or stronger cardboard and to keep contaminants and corrosion from building up in machinery.

The plant also produces biocides — chemicals used to kill bacteria and fungi — and salt-based chemicals.

Water-oil blends, used to improve fuel quality and refinery efficiency, comprise about 40% of the Garyville plant’s output. Another 35% is made up of latex polymers and solution polymers for use in industrial wastewater treatment.

Raw materials arrive at the plant in bulk on railcars, though some arrive in smaller containers on box trucks, Rogers said.

“The types of materials that we use are everything from monomer backbones that go into making polymers, to some polymers that are pre-produced that we blend and mix with our polymers,” he said. “There are other salts and additive chemicals that we use to perfect our product.”

Depending on the type of product being made, those raw materials are taken to either reactors or blenders, which can be as small as a couple hundred gallons or as large as several thousand gallons.

Some of its products are manufactured through a continuous reaction process, which involves constantly feeding materials into the reactor as products flow out, Rogers explained.

“As long as we want to run it, as long as we have a need for that material, we could run for days, weeks, even months straight, where you're putting raw materials into the process and taking finished goods out,” he said.

Other products made at the plant are produced in batches, which can take anywhere from minutes to three days.

Neighbors among clients

The Garyville plant was built in 1970 by Nalco Water, which became a subsidiary of Minnesota-based publicly traded Ecolab in 2011. The following year, the new owners expanded the facility with a 300,000-square-foot polymer production facility.

Today, Ecolab has 110 manufacturing centers, 48,000 employees and operates across 170 countries and 40 different industries. In 2024, the publicly traded company earned $2.1 billion in profits on $15.7 billion in sales.

Of its 1,400 customers, more than half are based between Alabama and Texas, with nearly 300 in Louisiana.

“We've got another facility next door to us that we do business with,” Rogers said. “We've got facilities down the road that we do business with.”

The plant’s location along the Mississippi River affords it a huge advantage, he added.

“We pull the industrial water we use out of the Mississippi River, clean that water for usage within our facility. And then, once we use it in our facility, we clean it again before we put it back into the Mississippi,” he said.

Since 2018, the Garyville facility has maintained certification from the Alliance for Water Stewardship, an independent nonprofit made up of businesses, governmental, environmental and academic institutions. The certification means the plant has met standards for sustainable water management — reducing water use, ensuring water quality and protecting local watersheds.

Cooling the boom

The rapid pace of growth in the AI data center sector — with $46 billion in construction spending projected for the year — means more potential customers for Ecolab’s products that prevent scale and other residue from building up on the cooling equipment.

“When you prevent that, it allows for less electricity to be used to circulate and re-cool that cooling water,” Rogers said. “It also allows for that water to be used more efficiently itself.”

Large data centers can go through several millions of gallons of water every day, and the massive Meta facility being built in Richland Parish is projected to use even more, raising concerns among environmentalists about the impact on the area's water supply.

Cooling systems require make-up water to replace what escapes through evaporation and exhaust, and chemicals produced at the Garyville plant reduce the amount of replacement water needed.

Looking to the future, Ecolab officials expect the AI boom will continue to be big business for the company. This month, they announced plans to sell an integrated “cooling as a service” program that continuously checks the health and temperature of cooling liquid in real time.

“Data centers are at the heart of an AI-driven future, and their cooling needs are becoming increasingly complex,” Josh Magnuson, executive vice president and general manager for Ecolab’s Global Water Solutions sector, said in a statement. “Cooling as a Service is not just a platform but will be a dynamic hub that integrates cooling and power infrastructure to provide data center operators with the insights to achieve best-in-class performance.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/08/40894f89-cd6f-5b00-8fea-411d8188875c/691b9f908a972.image.jpg?crop=1690%2C887%2C0%2C169&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-04 07:59:27.579849

Claims have been made that “hundreds” of residents support Project YaREN.

Patrick A. Nye is a licensed Texas professional geoscientist and co-founder of the Ingleside on the Bay Coastal Watch Association.","The Coastal Bend is a special region, defined by its natural beauty and generations of families who have built their lives between the bays and the brush country. My parents bought a small bay house on Mother’s Day 58 years ago, where my brothers and I learned to fish and explore the spoil islands. Having grown up in Ingleside on the Bay, my wife and I wanted our children and grandchildren to experience the same beauty and freedom we did.But over the years, we’ve watched our bay suffer from one industrial project after another. That’s why we helped found the Coastal Watch Association — to give our community a voice. Like our neighbors, we want safe schools, clean air, good jobs and a strong local economy.

Yet Project YaREN, a proposed ammonia export facility, threatens to undo everything that makes this region worth protecting. Proponents of the project claim it will be “clean” and represents “progress,” but the facts tell a different story.The reality is that living near an industrial ammonia facility is inherently dangerous. Ammonia is a toxic chemical that can cause burns, respiratory failure and death even at low concentrations. A single leak can form dense, ground-level clouds that travel long distances, endangering entire neighborhoods. According to a national watchdog analysis published in 2013, nearly 1,000 accidents had occurred at U.S. anhydrous-ammonia facilities over the prior 15 years. Schools, homes and first responders within a few miles of ammonia facilities face heightened risks of exposure and evacuation events. When a plant like Project YaREN is sited less than 2 miles from an elementary school, that danger is not theoretical; it’s personal.

Claims have been made that “hundreds” of residents support Project YaREN. In reality, CWA’s petition opposing the plant has gathered more than 500 signatures from people living nearby (within a 2-mile radius of the proposed site, over 1,900 residents — including the students and staff of Ingleside Primary School — would be directly affected). And nearly 200 residents have filed as affected parties in the state’s contested case hearing opposing the project’s air permit, where they’ll have the chance to speak to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality about their concerns.Project YaREN says it will capture 95% of the 3.3 million tons of carbon dioxide it produces and store it underground. If that happens, the companies behind the plant, Yara and Enbridge, would receive $247 million in U.S. taxpayer subsidies. That’s right: Nearly a quarter-billion dollars from American taxpayers would go to two foreign corporations so they can pollute our air and water, export their product overseas and pocket the profits. Meanwhile, our community pays the price with higher health risks and a diminished quality of life.Some insist that “TCEQ will ensure our safety.” But TCEQ is in the business of approving air or water permits, no matter how polluting. And history tells us not to rely on corporate promises. Yara’s ammonia plant in Trinidad polluted Lisas Bay so badly that local seafood developed cancerous lesions and deformities. Enbridge, meanwhile, is responsible for the largest inland oil spill in U.S. history.

Even without an accident, daily operations of Project YaREN would expose Ingleside and surrounding communities to toxic air emissions — over 18,000 million pounds of new pollutants every day, according to their permit applications. Our area already struggles with high levels of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) — a pollutant linked to asthma, heart disease and cancer.

Because TCEQ has no air monitors in San Patricio County, CWA launched a “citizen science” initiative with the University of Texas at Arlington to fill the gap. These community monitors regularly detect pollution spikes from existing industrial sites. Yet when CWA asked Enbridge to share its own fence-line data during a TCEQ public hearing, they refused. If this is their idea of transparency, how can residents trust anything they say?The choice we face on Project YaREN is not between jobs or the environment. It’s between a future where foreign corporations receive massive tax subsidies to profit from our coastline, or one where the Coastal Bend remains a safe, livable place for generations to come. Clean air and water are not luxuries — they are the foundation of a healthy economy and community. Project YaREN jeopardizes both.

For decades, families like mine have invested our lives in this region — not for short-term gain but for the promise of a future built on beauty, balance and belonging. That promise is worth defending.

The rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford, officials said.
The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles.
Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules.
Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks.

The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford, officials said. The administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year.

The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

“From day one I’ve been taking action to make buying a car more affordable.” Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from the three largest U.S. automakers.

The rule reverses a Biden-era policy that “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,” Trump said.

Rule change will save money, Trump says

The action is expected to save consumers about $1,000 off the price of a new car, Trump said. New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October. according to Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers applauded the planned changes. They had complained that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense.”

“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” Farley said.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the standards “with real world market conditions.”

Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

Environmentalists decried the rollback in mileage standards.

“In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.

“Gutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,” said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program.

Polluting cars to stay on road

“This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly,” she said.

Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety agency was empowered to update the requirements.

Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles per gallon today. The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of gasoline from being burned by 2050, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s 2024 calculations. Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tons a year of deadly soot particles and more 4,870 tons a year of smog components nitrogen oxide volatile organic carbons going into the air in coming years.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.",https://imengine.public.prod.bte.navigacloud.com/?uuid=b5829816-40bc-5968-be47-5a60de45b749&function=cover&type=preview&source=false&width=1600&height=1085,N,,2025-12-04 09:02:26.954257
