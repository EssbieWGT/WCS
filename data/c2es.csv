The new round follows an earlier $700 million Series C financing round completed by X-energy earlier this year, led by Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, alongside an agreement with Amazon to bring more than 5 GW of projects online across the U.S. by 2039.

Kam Ghaffarian, Ph.D., Founder and Executive Chairman of X-energy, said:

“When I founded X-energy, I envisioned a company that could redefine how to make advanced nuclear energy accessible, affordable, and essential to an energy abundant future. With the support of our investors, both new and existing, we are closer to realizing that vision.”

Founded in 2009, Rockville, Maryland-based X-Energy is a developer of nuclear reactor and fuel technology. The company’s TRISO-X fuel seals uranium particles in a protective coating, which can withstand high temperatures without melting, making it highly resistant to fuel failure and release of radioactive materials, eliminating the need for massive containment facilities. The company’s SMR reactor, Xe-100 is a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor operates at temperatures higher than 750°C, and contains more than 200,000 TRISO-X-based fuel pebbles, which are gravity-fed in continuous rotation through the core, allowing the reactor to run without fuel interruption for 60 years. Helium is circulated through the core, absorbing immense heat, and is used to boil water into steam to turn a turbine for the production of carbon-free energy.

The company said that the new financing comes as it has already built an orderbook of more than 11 GW, representing approximately 144 advanced small modular reactors. X-energy’s initial proposed four-unit Xe-100 plant is planned for Dow’s Inc.’s UCC Seadrift chemical manufacturing site on the Texas Gulf Coast, supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program. In addition to its 5 GW partnership with Amazon, X-energy is partnered with British multinational energy and services company Centrica to deploy 6 GW in the UK.

X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell, said:

“We are highly focused on building a world-class project and technology delivery platform to accelerate the commercialization of our Xe-100 reactor and TRISO-X fuel. The success of this financing round allows us to deepen partnerships with critical deployment partners and invest in a robust and reliable supply chain to successfully deliver projects with our customers.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/X-Energy2.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 15:01:59.380209

“Recent events have cast serious doubt on New York City’s commitment to the very principles that make America great—free markets, business development, and prosperity through innovation and investment,” said Commissioner Miller. “The same can be said for Chicago, where political hostility toward business has reached a fever pitch. The time has come for both Exchanges to consider a new venue consistent with their mission and the free-market spirit that built this country. There’s no better home for business than right here in the great State of Texas.”

Miller emphasized that Texas stands apart from states that burden success and chase away opportunity.

“In Texas, we don’t punish success, we celebrate it,” Miller said. “We don’t look down on job creators or investors; we thank them for fueling prosperity. While other states pile on taxes and red tape, Texas stands firm on freedom, opportunity, and common sense. We believe in keeping government limited and money in the pockets of the hard-working folks who earned it.”

As Commissioner of Agriculture, Miller highlighted Texas’ central role in the markets these exchanges serve every day.

“From cattle to cotton, grain to energy, Texas feeds and fuels the world,” Miller said. “The traders who keep those markets moving ought to be closer to the people and products that drive the American economy. That’s why I’m inviting the NYSE and CME to pack up their pits and trading floors and bring their operations to Texas, the home of enterprise, energy, and economic freedom.”

Miller stressed that his invitation complements the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE), which is already positioning itself as a cornerstone of the nation’s financial future.

“Together, NYSE, CME, and TXSE could create a powerhouse of American finance, stretching from across the nation, connecting capital to commerce and investment to innovation,” he said. “That’s how we build an economy that strengthens farmers, ranchers, energy producers, and every American who believes in honest work and free enterprise.”

He closed with a message that underscored both pride and principle:

“Here in Texas, we don’t just trade commodities—we grow them, we ship them, and we make them better,” Miller said. “Come to a state that matches your values, your volume, and your vision. If you’re tired of being villainized for creating opportunity, come to Texas. Let’s make history together, not just in the markets, but in the marketplace of ideas that defines our great nation.”

But fully funding and staffing permitting agencies is also key to progress approvals, especially as increased energy demand presses for more projects to provide needed infrastructure.
“Durable, bipartisan permitting reforms that provide project certainty and speed up energy infrastructure build-out will help keep the lights on and reduce electricity costs,” he said.","Legislation aimed to hasten federal permitting for projects is advancing through Congress as the House Natural Resources Committee voted Nov. 20 to forward an amended version of the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development, or SPEED Act, for a full vote. But even with some bipartisan support for permit reform, opponents say the measure goes too far to weaken the National Environmental Policy Act by reducing transparency and limiting the ability of those impacted by a project to provide input or challenge it.

The bill brought by committee Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), approved 25-18, emphasizes that NEPA is “procedural” and does not mandate a particular result when agencies consider project environmental impacts. During the committee markup hearing, he said the legislation is “project-neutral” and “would tackle a number of problems at the heart of NEPA dysfunction that is present today.”

The SPEED Act would codify the U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year in the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition case, in which justices unanimously ruled against environmental advocates who argued the proposed $1.4-billion Uinta Basin Railway in Utah would have detrimental impacts on communities in Louisiana near where oil transported on the railroad would be refined. The legislation states that agencies performing NEPA reviews may only consider “those effects that share a reasonably close causal relationship to, and are proximately caused by, the immediate project or action under consideration.”

The bill would place additional limits on what agencies can consider in their environmental reviews, directing them to rely more on past assessments for similar projects. It would also remove a requirement that a project receiving federal funding—including a grant, loan, loan guarantee or other assistance—would mandate an environmental review.

Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), ranking committee member, questioned how many projects might be waived from requiring environmental review as a result, pointing to U.S. Dept. of Transportation-funded highway projects as an example. The bill would have “wide-ranging and detrimental ripple effects,” he said.

The SPEED Act would also set deadlines for agencies performing NEPA reviews to complete various pieces of the process, direct any cooperating ones to carry out assessments concurrently and prevent them from rescinding previously issued permits.

The bill would also limit challenges to permits and projects following reviews. Opponents would have just 150 days after a permitting approval to file a legal challenge. A courts hearing a case would also have limits, required to “afford substantial deference to the agency” and prevented from “subsitit[ing] its judgment for that of the agency regarding the environmental effects.”

Bipartisan Interest, But Questions Emerge

Republicans have sought to promote the SPEED Act as bipartisan, and committee Democrats expressed a desire to implement permit reform. Seven have signed on to co-sponsor the SPEED Act but only two voted to advance the bill in its current form, with others criticizing its far-ranging potential impacts.

“In our meetings, we heard a real hunger for bipartisan permitting reform. This bill is not it,” Huffman said. “This bill is so extreme that there’s simply nothing left, in a meaningful way, of NEPA if this were to become law.”

The bill has generally received a favorable response from the construction industry. In a letter to lawmakers in September, Alex Etchen of the Associated General Contractors of America highlighted the industry’s need to clarify and streamline various aspects of NEPA.

“Project delays caused by prolonged NEPA reviews, permitting, and litigation increase costs and harm the construction workforce by delaying job creation, disrupting hiring and reducing economic activity,” he wrote. “The delays increase labor and material costs, forcing contractors to reprice projects and potentially leading to cost overruns.”

Bill opponents raised concerns that Trump administration actions have slowed project approvals. The White House has moved to claw back billions of dollars in project funding since Donald Trump took office in January, and to fire thousands of federal workers—potentially leaving permitting agencies under-resourced to conduct efficient and thorough reviews.

“Adequate staffing and resources delivered improvements in permitting timelines last year, and yet this bill does nothing to stop the indiscriminate firings of career civil servants or disregard for congressional direction on funding,” Matthew Davis, vice president of federal policy at the League of Conservation Voters, said in a statement.

Ray Long, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy, said in a statement that the group applauds lawmakers for advancing the SPEED Act, calling for project-neutral permitting and removal of roadblocks to fully permitted projects. But fully funding and staffing permitting agencies is also key to progress approvals, especially as increased energy demand presses for more projects to provide needed infrastructure.

“Durable, bipartisan permitting reforms that provide project certainty and speed up energy infrastructure build-out will help keep the lights on and reduce electricity costs,” he said. “With less than four years to add the equivalent of 15 New York Citys worth of electricity to the grid, it is critical that energy infrastructure projects can move forward quickly.”",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/11/24/Rep_Westerman_ENRweb.jpg?height=635&t=1764006601&width=1200,N,,2025-11-24 15:01:40.863647

WASHINGTON – The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management today announced a Proposed Notice of Sale for the second offshore oil and gas lease sale under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The proposed lease sale, known as Big Beautiful Gulf, or BBG2, is scheduled to take place on March 11, 2026.

This sale is the second of thirty Gulf of America oil and gas lease sales required by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. By committing to a predictable sale schedule, the Department is delivering on President Trump’s promise to expand American energy production and strengthen U.S. energy dominance.

“Lease Sale BBG2 marks another major milestone in advancing a robust and forward-looking offshore oil and gas program in the Gulf of America,” said BOEM Acting Director Matt Giacona. “Building on the momentum of BBG1, this proposed sale reinforces BOEM’s commitment to restoring certainty and long-term investment in the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf. By offering leases under a competitive 12.5% royalty rate, BBG2 sends a clear signal that the era of regulatory uncertainty is behind us, and a new phase of responsible energy leadership has begun.”

Lease Sale BBG2 proposes to offer approximately 15,000 unleased blocks covering about 80 million acres on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of America. The blocks, located 3 to 231 miles offshore, span water depths from 9 feet to more than 11,100 feet.

The Gulf of America Outer Continental Shelf spans approximately 160 million acres and is estimated to contain 29.59 billion barrels of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and 54.84 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Certain areas will be excluded from the sale, including blocks subject to the September 8, 2020, presidential withdrawal; blocks adjacent to or beyond the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone in the Eastern Gap; and blocks within the boundaries of the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary.

Economic & Strategic Benefits

Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas activities generate billions of dollars from lease sales, rental fees and royalties. The funds are distributed to the U.S. Treasury, as well as states through several different revenue sharing programs that fund coastal restoration and hurricane protection projects. The largest portion goes to the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury, which benefits all U.S. citizens through funding of daily operations of the federal government. Offshore development fuels state and federal revenues, helping fund infrastructure, education and public services.

Energy independence is a cornerstone of U.S. economic strength, national security and global stability, boosting American energy dominance and reducing reliance on unstable foreign producers. By continuing to expand offshore capabilities, the United States ensures affordable energy for consumers, strengthens domestic industry and reinforces its role as an energy superpower.

Next Steps

The Proposed Notice of Sale will be published in the Federal Register on Nov. 20, 2025, initiating a 60-day comment period for affected state governors and local governments. Following the review of governor input, BOEM will publish a final notice of sale in the Federal Register at least 30 days prior to the scheduled lease sale date on March 11, 2026. More information, including the PNOS package and a detailed map of the proposed lease sale area, is available on BOEM’s website.

“It’s hard to go into an EV and then back to a (gas-powered) vehicle,"" says Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe, posing for a portrait outside of AJC offices on Monday, Nov. 17, 2025. (Natrice Miller/AJC)

RJ Scaringe didn’t build Rivian to make just 50,000 electric vehicles per year.

It’s a company designed to build many times more, the CEO of the upstart EV maker told the editorial board of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week. To get there, Rivian is banking on its newest vehicle, the R2, a two-row crossover, to be a big hit.

Initial manufacturing of the R2 will start in Illinois, but Scaringe said production will expand to its future factory an hour east of Atlanta when it opens, albeit years later than initially expected, in 2028. Future models, including the smaller R3 and R3X, are expected to follow.

“The more people that experience an EV, it’s like a one-way door,” Scaringe said. “It’s hard to go into an EV and then back to a (gas-powered) vehicle.”

He said Rivian will start customer deliveries of R2 early next year, and soon start vertical construction of the Georgia plant after a ceremonial groundbreaking in September. In a wide-ranging interview with the AJC, Scaringe went into detail about the company’s future, why Georgia is crucial to that success and the future of the auto industry.

Scaringe likes to say that software is as important to modern cars as the nuts and bolts of assembly.

Rivian is designed to do both. That strategy entranced investors while creating its own challenges and setbacks when the pandemic struck, but Scaringe argues it’s a framework made to support more than just a niche automaker.

The need to ramp up production is why Georgia is such a critical cog in Rivian’s machine aimed at rivaling Tesla as a leader of America’s new school of automaking.

“This is an investment you don’t make for one product cycle,” Scaringe said of his company’s planned $5 billion factory an hour east of Atlanta. “You make the investment for many product cycles. It’s a multidecade, multi-billion dollar investment.”

Next year is a vital one for California-based Rivian, which plans to launch R2 at a starting price of $45,000 to target a mass market. The forthcoming Georgia plant is poised to multiply the number of R2s rolling off assembly lines.

Confident it will succeed, Scaringe said the R2 and its iterations will provide the same boost to Rivian that Tesla found with its mid-priced Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover.

Those two Tesla models make up more than 40% of all EV sales this year through September, according to Cox Automotive data. Cox Enterprises, the owner of the AJC, also owns Cox Automotive and a 3% stake in Rivian.

“In something like clothing or cars or goods that reflect your own personality, you tend to see many winners,” Scaringe said. “So having a single player with nearly 50% market share is not a reflection of a healthy market — it’s a reflection of a highly underserved market.”

September was a new high-water mark for EV sales, but it’s expected to be a temporary peak. Federal tax credits worth up to $7,500 for qualifying new EV purchases were revoked at the end of that month, creating a fleeting window of opportunity for the EV curious.

“The training wheels are coming off,” said Stephanie Valdez-Streaty, director of operations management at Cox Automotive. “This shift will test whether the electric vehicle market is mature enough to thrive on its own fundamentals or still needs support to expand further.”

For Rivian, Scaringe said the startup’s history until now has been about learning and growing. He said Rivian’s Georgia investments will show the company is ready for the expanded spotlight.

“We’re a much, much more mature business,” he said. “And we’ve built processes to handle some of these unexpected externalities.”

Learning curve

The path for Rivian hasn’t been smooth.

The company’s 2021 initial public offering was among the largest in U.S. history. The company’s valuation peaked at more than $100 billion, briefly surpassing juggernauts like Ford, an early Rivian investor, and General Motors.

Rivian also courted other deep-pocked investors including Amazon, inking a $1 billion deal to supply the e-commerce giant with 100,000 EV vans.

But Wall Street’s stratospheric expectations soon came back to Earth amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a supply chain that buckled under the pressure and Rivian’s struggles to meet production demands. Scaringe said it was a tough time for his company, which has yet to turn a profit.

Among the challenges Rivian faced were getting components because it didn’t have the deep manufacturing history of traditional automakers.

“It was a combination of learning for the first time, launching multiple products, dealing with a global pandemic and then being last in line to get parts from suppliers,” he said.

Those scars have informed Rivian’s R2 strategy, reframing Georgia’s role in the company’s long-term plans.

When unveiling the prototype R2 in March 2024, Scaringe sent shock waves through the Peach State by pausing the Georgia plant’s development. The decision was cited as a temporary cost-cutting measure and an effort to focus on launching R2 more quickly from the company’s existing Illinois factory.

Within 24 hours of the R2 reveal, Rivian announced it had nearly 70,000 preorders. Scaringe declined to provide any updates to that figure but said “the excitement hasn’t waned.”

“We didn’t design the business to be selling 50,000 cars a year,” says Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe (center), during an interview with the AJC editorial board at its offices. “We have a cost structure, particularly on the R&D side, that was set up to be a much, much bigger business.” (Natrice Miller/AJC)

Rivian later announced it would resume construction of the Georgia factory in 2026, and will create 7,000 promised jobs.

State and local leaders also provided an estimated $1.5 billion incentive package to recruit Rivian to Georgia. Most of those benefits materialize only if the company meets its job and investment figures by 2030. Rivian will also receive support from a $6.6 billion federal loan.

In recent days, Rivian opened its East Coast headquarters along the Atlanta Beltline, which the company said will employ 500 workers by the end of next year. The back-end research and development work, Scaringe said, is just as vital to Rivian’s success as its mechanical chops.

“We didn’t design the business to be selling 50,000 cars a year,” he said, citing the company’s current production output. “We have a cost structure, particularly on the R & D side, that was set up to be a much, much bigger business.”

Creating leverage

Unlike traditional automakers, Rivian and electrified peers like Tesla have developed a new technology backbone for their vehicles.

Most conventional cars have more than 100 small computers called electronic control units to handle small tasks.

One ECU handles seat adjustments. Another is in charge of side mirror controls. Yet another is tasked with injecting fuel into the engine. Those ECUs are developed by separate part suppliers and often include a mishmash of operating systems.

“It’s a very, very messy architecture,” Scaringe said. “It’s precisely the opposite of what you’d want to have.”

Rivian, along with Tesla, have a handful of more powerful computers called domain control units that handle several tasks. Scaringe said that decision reduces assembly complexity, saves thousands of dollars on computer chips and will pay off once the company reaches a certain scale.

“We have more computer engineers and software engineers at Rivian than we have mechanical engineers by a pretty significant degree,” he said.

For automakers to succeed in the future, Scaringe said, they will have to have a software backbone like Rivian and Tesla. They’ll get there one of two ways — developing it themselves or finding a technology partner.

The company’s technology platform caught the attention of the world’s second-largest automaker, Volkswagen Group.

In June 2024, Rivian and VW announced a joint software partnership worth an estimated $5.8 billion. Rivian agreed to contribute technology to the German auto giant’s fleet of new EVs, while VW’s financial contributions would support Rivian as it ramped up production.

Scaringe said that partnership also gives Rivian newfound leverage when negotiating with suppliers and preparing to launch R2 — both in Illinois and in Georgia.

“(Suppliers) are super excited to work with us because the choice we make in Rivian vehicles is also the choice that goes into Volkswagen vehicles, which is Porsche, Audi, VW, Bentley and a whole host of brands,” Scaringe said. “It’s a complete flip of the nature of that relationship.”

With the groundwork laid — and ground literally about to break east of Atlanta — Scaringe said Rivian’s next chapter is filled with potential.

“Now it’s about execution,” Scaringe said.",https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/YB4POWDQZFBL7FLMLI4LIMVTJA.JPG?auth=3bb53f48c873a9ca346a972ab8d5269786e62c049e8a79be60ed1fe61e406afe&width=1200&height=630&smart=true,N,,2025-11-24 15:01:18.751763

Electric vehicles (EVs) continue to gain market share worldwide, despite policy reversals in the US.

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) account for most EV sales globally. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have seen significant increases recently, especially in China, shifting from a defensive tool for legacy automakers to a technology that can strengthen China’s global influence.

While long-range PHEVs and extended-range EVs can play a transitional role in US automaking, securing resilient industrial leadership will ultimately depend on advancing BEVs and reducing risks of overdependence in battery value chains.

The global automotive industry is undergoing a historic transformation. Electric vehicles (EVs)—including battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)—are rapidly gaining market share worldwide. China has experienced the deepest transformation, followed by Europe—despite considerable heterogeneity within it—and by the US.

BEVs account for most EV sales globally, but PHEVs have experienced particularly dynamic growth in recent years.[i] Once viewed as a transitional technology favored by legacy automakers, PHEVs have now become central to China’s domestic EV market growth and to its industrial strategy. Chinese automakers embraced PHEVs and extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) as a way to complement BEVs to expand their global reach, effectively leveraging the advantages offered by a deeply rooted and competitive battery supply chain.

The overall global shift to EVs raises a critical question for US automakers and policymakers: Should EVs be defended, ignored, or strategically supported, and if so, which ones?

Because of the scale and pervasiveness of this technological transition, accelerating the shift to EVs would strengthen the resilience of the US auto sector. Instead of policies that focus solely on incremental improvements to internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), those that support PHEVs, which retain an internal combustion engine, can play a transitional role to fully battery-powered cars. However, securing resilient industrial leadership will ultimately depend on advancing BEVs and reducing the risks of overdependence on concentrated battery value chains.

BEVs, PHEVs, and Diverging Global Paths

In many regions of the world, the car market has developed in markedly new directions in recent years (see Figure 1). In 2024 plug-in vehicles—both BEVs and PHEVs—accounted for roughly one in five new cars sold worldwide.[ii] Estimates for 2025 point toward increasing market share and a total of roughly 20 million electric cars sold.[iii] Yet beneath this aggregate figure lies striking regional differences in both technology choice and adoption speed.

Note: “e” indicates that the value is an estimate based on partial-year data and is therefore forward-looking.

China

China has experienced the deepest transformation. In 2024 it represented about 60 percent of global EV sales, with BEVs making up the bulk of EV deliveries but PHEVs growing rapidly (see Figure 1). BYD, an automobile manufacturing company headquartered in China, led in total EV sales globally and outsold Tesla on BEVs alone in late 2024.[v] China’s grip on battery manufacturing—from raw material processing to cell production[vi]—enables low costs and high volumes across both BEVs and PHEVs.

Europe

Europe is the second key pole of electrification globally in terms of sales and domestic manufacturing, though with marked heterogeneity among countries and with remaining reliance on China in its battery value chain.[vii] Nordic countries such as Norway, Sweden, and Denmark are at the forefront of the electrification of the car fleet in the EU, with EVs, and in particular BEVs, already having high market shares.[viii] In contrast, several countries in southern and eastern Europe—including Cyprus, Greece, Italy, and much of central and eastern Europe—lag behind, constrained by lower incomes, higher sensitivity to vehicle purchase prices, and, in the case of Italy, high electricity prices.[ix] Within the EU’s regulatory framework, PHEVs have played a transitional role between ICEVs and BEVs. However, as regulatory signals and tax incentives evolve and charging expands, consumer demand is favoring BEVs.

US

The United States presents a different picture. EVs accounted for 10 percent of its car sales in 2024. BEVs are clearly ahead of PHEVs in terms of new car registrations, representing about 80 percent of total electric car sales that year.[x] This aligns with the outsize role of Tesla in shaping consumer preferences, brand perception, and charging infrastructure.[xi]

While some legacy automakers continue to offer PHEVs, US demand for PHEVs versus ICEVs is structurally constrained by relatively low gasoline prices, resulting in limited space for cost savings from PHEVs. The US capital market also tends to place a significantly higher premium (in terms of market capitalization per unit of vehicle sold) on companies that focus on BEVs rather than PHEVs (and other combustion-based technologies).

Other Markets

The Korean car market has seen EVs rise to nearly 15 percent in 2024 and 2025, with 2025 developments pointing toward an increased focus on BEVs and a stagnation of PHEV sales.[xii] Japan has a technology mix in its domestic market that remained strongly centered on ICEVs and hybrids,[xiii] in line with the focus of its main automakers and concerns about limitations in access to battery material supplies. It recorded limited EV market demand compared with other major developed economies.

From Southeast Asia to parts of Latin America and Africa, there has been a rapid acceleration in EV adoption.[xiv] Much of this expansion is directly or indirectly linked to Chinese investment, both in vehicles (via exports or local assembly) and infrastructure (including charging and battery plants). In markets such as Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, and parts of Africa, Chinese EVs are gaining market share, while Western automakers are subject to a competitive disadvantage because they focus more on premium segments (which are less affordable) and have lower EV sales volumes overall compared with Chinese competitors.[xv] In other cases, such as Vietnam, the growth in EV market shares was paired with the rise of domestic EV manufacturers. However, they still rely, at least in part, on Chinese battery suppliers.[xvi]

In short, while EV sales are increasing globally, the global EV map remains uneven. China is leading in sales of both BEVs and PHEVs, whereas Europe has a high share of BEV purchases within its electric car market, especially in the North, with a patchier picture elsewhere. The US is BEV-heavy but has a relatively narrow overall EV share. Korea tracks EU developments, with some lag, while Japan maintains a focus on hybrids. Emerging markets are entering the race largely on the back of Chinese industrial and financial support.

Three Drivers of the Transition

The EV transition is not only about technology but also about economics, geopolitics, and climate commitments.

Industrial and Economic Competitiveness

For China, EVs are part of a broader attempt to dominate a future-defining industry.[xvii] For Europe, they are a necessity to preserve automotive leadership while meeting climate obligations.[xviii] For the US, they represent a challenge to the legacy automotive manufacturing and oil sectors—long central to its industrial base—while at the same time offering a pathway to offset risks of net industrial capacity losses, which becomes essential if the US market also shifts toward electrification. Investments in batteries and related supply chains are not just about cars; they are also about commanding value-added industries of the future and industrial production that matters for national security and defense.

Energy and Resource Security

For net oil importers, EVs are a strategic hedge against oil dependence. China, the EU, India, and many African, Latin American, and Southeast Asian countries rely heavily on imported crude and refined products. Reducing oil dependence through electrification—as well as the associated energy efficiency improvements of EVs, which consume about one quarter of the final energy needed by a comparable combustion car[xix]—is therefore an economic and security imperative for countries in these circumstances.

Building a competitive battery value chain also offers resource security if it can leverage—as in the case of oil supplies—a reliable network of global partners. And contrary to oil, battery materials will become increasingly available in economies using BEVs once the vehicles reach the end of their useful life through recycling.

Climate Policies

EV adoption is also propelled by emissions regulations, climate targets, and clean air priorities—such as China’s “new energy vehicle” mandates and the EU’s CO₂ emission standards—as EVs have lower life-cycle emissions than alternative technologies.[xx] The US corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standard, state-level “zero emission vehicle” (ZEV) standards developed in California and other states, and other instruments supporting EV demand and infrastructure development were also driven by climate policy goals, though these are now the object of major revisions by the Trump administration.

Importantly, the strength of these three drivers varies: Concerns about energy security and industrial goals tend to reinforce each other in China and the EU, resulting in policies that have supported the EV transition. In the EU, additional synergies came from a strong determination to act on climate. In the US, abundant domestic oil has blunted the energy security case, and while climate was a clear driver of prior policy action on EVs, the current administration does not support policies addressing climate change.[xxi] Despite such headwinds, industrial competitiveness and the promotion of innovation have long been a focus of US policy, and recent trade policy decisions seem to suggest that interest remains in supporting domestically produced EVs and achieving greater diversification of battery supply chains.[xxii] However, this interest comes with a reduced pace and scale for the EV transition, and hence also with delays in emission reductions.

PHEVs: From Defensive Play to China-Centered Growth

The role of PHEVs has evolved markedly over the past decade. In a first phase, they were mainly part of a defensive strategy by legacy original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) In a second phase, growing pressures from BEVs and increasing evidence about the limits of PHEVs to promote energy diversification and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions challenged the effectiveness of this initial strategy. A third, more recent phase is a Chinese offensive strategy to leverage its competitive advantage in batteries and gain global market share.

Initially, PHEVs were developed largely by incumbent automakers as a hedge against BEVs. Legacy manufacturers, heavily invested in ICEV platforms, saw PHEVs as a way to meet regulatory targets without committing to the cost and risk of full battery electrification. In Europe, policy incentives also encouraged this strategy.

PHEVs lost traction and policy support, however, as BEV sales grew (fueled by Tesla and Chinese pure-play EV makers) and critiques pointed to low energy diversification and climate benefits of PHEVs, which run much less than initially expected in all-electric mode. These critiques were backed by strong evidence[xxiii] and confirmed by official data collection,[xxiv] which led to policy revisions in the EU[xxv] and the US.[xxvi]

Since 2022, however, PHEVs have experienced a resurgence, especially in China. Unlike the earlier defensive stance by legacy OEMs in Europe, China’s recent PHEV surge reflects a more offensive strategy. With world-leading battery production, Chinese OEMs such as BYD have launched PHEVs with large batteries and long electric ranges—including in the form of EREVs—ensuring more frequent all-electric operation. Domestic demand soared because of total cost of ownership advantages compared with ICEV, partial eligibility for preferential licensing in Chinese cities,[xxvii] improvements in battery technologies needed in PHEVs,[xxviii] and the introduction of new models with larger batteries and fast-charging capabilities.[xxix] Lower upfront prices for PHEVs compared with BEVs in a few market segments[xxx] may also have played a role. Consumer interest in the flexibility that PHEVs offer compared with BEVs may also have supported demand growth, especially where there is limited cost-effective charging infrastructure.[xxxi] Importantly, exports of PHEVs and EREVs can also provide an avenue to bypass tariffs or countervailing duties, as those tend to focus on BEVs.

By now the fulcrum of PHEV market development has shifted decisively to China. What was once a transitional technology favored by legacy Western OEMs is now being redefined by Chinese firms as a competitive instrument, integrated with global trade strategy and industrial policy.

The Outlook for Electric Vehicles: The US and Beyond

In the US, the structural outlook for PHEVs is limited, while the outlook for BEVs is also weaker than it was before recent policy reversals. Factors that influence market developments include the following:

Reduced compliance value. Policy frameworks (e.g., CAFE standards, ZEV programs) still allow BEVs, EREVs, and PHEVs to generate compliance value, but recent policy reversals are weakening this effect.

Low gasoline prices. By global standards, US fuel prices are low. This reduces the operating-cost savings of driving on electricity, weakening the economic rationale for EVs. However, heterogeneity in fuel prices, state-level regulations, and fiscal incentives can still sustain demand for BEVs and PHEVs in sizable portions of the US. They could also sustain demand for EREVs, but model availability is still limited.

Weak domestic battery base. Compared with China, US battery manufacturing lags in scale and cost competitiveness, limiting the ability of US OEMs to offer low-cost, long-range EVs. Tariffs applicable to long-standing US trade partners exacerbate these challenges.

Battery supply chain challenges. Limited access to battery materials and cells and slower scale-up of domestic battery manufacturing capacity—due to a contraction of the BEV market versus expectations and the negative impacts of tariffs following the recent policy shifts—may delay cost reductions and lower the volumes of domestically manufactured EV batteries. Such a development could result in an increased value proposition for PHEVs and EREVs compared with BEVs, reversing the historically limited demand for PHEVs in the US electric car market.

Battery cost declines. Continued reductions in EV battery costs in other markets may still help tilt the market toward BEVs rather than PHEVs or EREVs. Once purchase prices converge, BEVs’ lower operating costs and better performance make them the predominant choice. The PHEV value proposition—cheaper up front if more expensive over time—erodes in these conditions, especially for legacy configurations.

Charging infrastructure developments. Consumers without reliable charging infrastructure may also prefer PHEVs or EREVs, even in an environment where BEVs become more competitive pricewise.

China

In China, structural drivers behind increased electrification remain strong, despite challenges emerging from increased competition and significant overcapacity. BEVs are therefore bound to continue to account for millions of units sold, as they have in the recent past. PHEV and EREV shares may continue to expand over the next 5 to 10 years, thanks to the same drivers that favored their recent increase, both in terms of domestic demand and utility in circumventing trade barriers when supply is geared toward exports (if the focus of trade barriers on BEVs does not change). The new generation of Chinese PHEVs—including EREVs equipped with larger batteries—is also particularly well suited to meeting requirements regarding all-electric driving shares, which are now also being tightened domestically.[xxxii]

Europe

BEVs are bound to see continued market share increases in Europe. This is driven by policy, particularly the regulation requiring zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2035. It is also driven by economics, including EV technology cost reductions, high oil import dependency, high fuel taxation, the introduction of carbon pricing, and the use of differentiated taxation based on the environmental performance of vehicles, which favors BEVs.

PHEVs have faced declining incentives, especially for models with low all-electric range, because of tightened regulatory requirements.[xxxiii] They are also subject to equity-related challenges, as they have solely been deployed in premium segments, steering incentives meant to support demand creation for EVs toward wealthier people.[xxxiv]

Future policy action will remain focused on road transport electrification, as indicated by the announced proposals regarding corporate fleets,[xxxv] even if revisions to existing regulations are also being considered. Recent announcements regarding smaller, more affordable EVs will help diversify the offer of BEVs and are not likely to favor PHEVs, given their focus on larger and heavier cars.[xxxvi] However, revising the 2035 emission reduction requirements toward greater technological neutrality[xxxvii] could offer opportunities for a greater share of PHEVs in the European EV market than in the current policy framework.

Other Markets

In emerging markets, Chinese EVs are likely going to continue to be cheaper than those from other suppliers, especially for BEVs.[xxxviii] PHEVs may see growing demand where charging infrastructure is limited and where policy requirements for larger battery capacities and higher all-electric driving shares are not yet adopted (while Chinese EREVs can gain interest in cases where this tightening is already in place).

The outlook for Korea points toward an overall EV market share increase that remains less dynamic than in the EU, but with a strengthened focus on BEVs.[xxxix] Japan is expected to continue facing challenges in stimulating domestic EV demand.[xl] However, the export-oriented nature of Korean and Japanese automotive industries and the risks of market share losses in Asia are likely to strengthen the case for greater diversification of their power train offerings toward EVs.

Overall, and especially as batteries get cheaper and charging more widespread, BEVs are more likely to capture the bulk of the EV market growth. However, PHEVs can gain relevance as a strategy for navigating trade-related barriers and in markets that still have limited charging infrastructure. Versions with larger battery capacities are likely to gain more ground as batteries keep improving, costs decline, and policies require growing all-electric ranges.

Policy Recommendations for the US

The current US administration rolled back or paused major federal targets, programs, incentives, and infrastructure deployment investments aimed at accelerating EV adoption.[xli] It rescinded the waiver that allowed California and other states to set EV-related requirements[xlii] and proposed to remove the foundation of what allows the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate GHG emission standards for vehicles.[xliii] This pullback places a greater focus on protecting traditional internal combustion manufacturing than on leading new technology developments, even as interest remains for diversifying EV battery supply chains. These policy decisions are exacerbated by tariffs applied to US allies, making the competitive challenge from China and other global automakers that are not subject to the same policy reversal (despite the risk of some degree of rollback induced by US policy shifts, especially in Europe) more acute for the US.

Recognizing the scale of the global transformation that is profoundly reshaping the automotive industry—driven by economics and energy/resource security in addition to environmental considerations—is a key prerequisite to improve the competitiveness of US OEMs in this shifting landscape. Doing so is crucial to leverage existing capacity in the automotive sector and support investments in new industrial assets. To do so, US policymakers could enact policies that accomplish the following:

Preserve and strengthen regulatory requirements on EVs, including the EPA’s ability to regulate GHG emission standards for vehicles, maintain CAFE standards, and allow California and other states to set EV-related requirements. These policies drive investment and innovation that are critical in this phase of global competition for the creation of new industrial capacity.

Reinstate EV purchase incentives while also integrating equity-related considerations, such as focusing the incentives toward low-income households and businesses and using vehicle price caps for the applicability of the incentives. If budgetary implications are a concern, incentives could integrate provisions that enable them to be budget neutral, evolving from the exclusive use of credits toward a combination of incentives for EVs and fees for ICEVs. Specific conditions for the applicability of incentives can also support the diversification of EV battery supply chains; for example, they could use emission intensity thresholds for the manufacturing of batteries equipping EVs.

Use public procurement toward EVs when beneficial to the government and industry. Instruct federal institutions—including the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, the General Services Administration, and any other relevant federal departments and agencies—to support an anticipated industry shift toward EVs. Public procurement mechanisms can also integrate the use of specific conditions regarding the attributes of batteries equipping EVs, setting minimum thresholds to support the diversification of EV battery supply chains. They can also coordinate with policies of the DOE’s Office of Energy Dominance Financing (formerly the Loan Programs Office) to include specific provisions supporting innovation on mineral extraction and processing technologies (such as direct lithium extraction) to support the diversification of battery supply chains).[xliv]

Support the deployment of EV charging infrastructure, stimulating private investments. Re-staff and revitalize the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation (JOET). Focus its public spending on cases that are economically more challenging but strategically relevant to secure affordable access to EV chargers across the US to make the EV transition coherent and not just inevitable. Leverage public service contracts tied to affordability conditions regarding charging prices. Allocate specific support to the installation and maintenance of EV chargers in underserved communities. If budgetary implications are a concern, leverage a moderate carbon price on emission-intensive fuels used in road transport to address it.

Stimulate investments in cell manufacturing, recycling, and critical minerals processing in the US and in friendly or allied nations. This is crucial not only for cost parity but also for energy security and industrial resilience. Long-term, predictable regulations need to enable more clarity for demand prospects. Other instruments that can support domestic production include financing structures that reduce investment risks; targeted government interventions such as direct subsidies, grants, or tax credits; and friendshoring.[xlv] China’s EV offensive is possible because of its strength across the battery supply chain; further US delays in domestic production will be detrimental to the US and its allies. If the cost of policies aimed to support investments in new industrial capacity concerns is seen as a key challenge, carbon pricing can help raise revenues to mitigate their impacts.

Phase out incentives and public procurement support for PHEVs with limited all-electric range. Without clear sunset clauses, policy decisions could amplify asset-stranding risks and slow the realignment of industrial capabilities toward automotive technologies that will continue to define global competitiveness in the coming decades. Policies that continue to favor PHEVs rather than BEVs risk exacerbating the greater EV competitive disadvantage for the US automotive industry.

Price Performance Last month, Dominion Energy’s shares have gained 1.1% against NextEra Energy’s decline of 3%.","Dominion Energy D and NextEra Energy NEE are among the top-tier utility companies in the United States. Both companies are investing heavily to upgrade their infrastructure and expand their renewable energy portfolios. NextEra Energy and Dominion Energy’s ongoing efforts to modernize their systems are boosting grid resilience and helping maintain reliable power delivery during severe weather conditions. In addition, each company is pursuing strategic acquisitions to broaden its renewable footprint and strengthen market presence. By advancing cleaner power generation and reducing emissions, NEE and D are contributing meaningfully to the transformation of the U.S. energy sector.

NextEra Energy stands out as a leading U.S. utility with a strong reputation for renewable energy leadership and sustainable expansion. With substantial investments in wind, solar, battery storage and grid modernization, the company is at the forefront of the clean energy transition. As the parent of Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy Resources, NEE oversees one of the world’s largest wind and solar portfolios. Supported by solid financial performance and a long history of innovation, the company provides investors with both stability and long-term growth potential aligned with the accelerating shift toward green energy.

Dominion Energy remains committed to running its current nuclear fleet while also exploring the promise of next-generation nuclear technologies. In 2024, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Amazon to evaluate innovative development approaches that could support potential Small Modular Reactor projects in Virginia. Dominion Energy has a well-chalked-out long-term capital expenditure plan to strengthen and expand its infrastructure. The company is experiencing commercial load growth driven by data center demand. Attractive customer growth across the Virginia and South Carolina areas is also boosting demand for its services.

Amid the ongoing transition in the United States utilities space and increasing focus on the generation of clean electricity, let us focus on the two stocks' fundamentals to find out which one is a better investment pick at present.

D & NEE’s Earnings Estimates

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dominion Energy’s earnings per share for 2025 and 2026 increased 0.29% and 0.28%, respectively, in the past 60 days. Long-term (three to five years) earnings growth per share is pegged at 10.26%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NextEra Energy’s earnings per share in 2025 and 2026 has remained unchanged in the past 60 days. Long-term earnings growth per share is pegged at 8.08%.

D and NEE’s Return on Equity

Return on equity (“ROE”) measures how efficiently the company is utilizing its shareholders’ funds to generate profits. NextEra Energy’s current ROE is 12.42% compared with Dominion Energy’s 9.6%.

NEE & D’s Dividend Yield

Utility companies generally distribute dividends and increase shareholders’ value. Currently, the dividend yield for NextEra Energy is 2.71% compared with the Zacks S&P 500 composite’s average of 1.52%, and the same for Dominion Energy is 4.34%.

NEE & D’s Long-Term Strategic Investment Plans

Capital expenditure is critical in the sector, as it drives infrastructure development, system reliability and long-term growth. Utilities must consistently invest in power generation, transmission and distribution networks to meet rising demand, integrate renewable energy sources and comply with evolving regulatory standards. The current interest rate in the range of 3.75% to 4% will also assist the capital-intensive utilities.

NextEra Energy plans to invest nearly $74.6 billion in the 2025-2029 period to strengthen its infrastructure and add more clean electricity generation assets. Dominion Energy plans to invest $50 billion in the 2025-2029 period to further strengthen its renewable operations.

Valuation

NextEra Energy currently appears to be trading at a premium compared with Dominion Energy on a Price/Earnings Forward 12-month basis. (P/E- F12M).

NEE is currently trading at 21.19X, while D is trading at 17.17X compared with the industry’s 15.16X.

According to our latest Short-Term Energy Outlook, Alaskan crude output will climb to 477,000 barrels a day, the highest since 2018.
American energy isn’t just back—it’s breaking records and setting the stage for a whole new era.
And what is big could be the potential deal for peace as Ukraine is talking, but it also could be weather.","Oil prices have gone into hibernation, and the diesel crack spread has come back down as peace hopes and LNG exports from the US to Europe are rising. US Energy policy is playing a part in the peace process and raising hopes that parts of Europe won/t freeze this winter. There has been a modest shift toward risk off mode in oil, gold, and silver markets following reports that US and Ukrainian negotiators have developed an “updated and refined peace framework.”

The parties announced on Sunday their intention to continue advancing the peace plan in the coming days. According to a joint statement, discussions related to the US-backed plan in Geneva, which are now believed to have concluded, were described as “highly productive.”

We also had OIL price report that we have seen the European benchmark natural gas prices slipped below the key threshold of 30 euros per megawatt-hour (MWh) on Monday, for the first time in a year and a half, amid strong LNG flows, milder temperatures, and negotiations about the end of the war in Ukraine.

The move lower of the past week has been accelerated by the discussions about the U.S. peace plan for Ukraine, forecasts of milder temperatures in northwest Europe in the weeks ahead and continued strong LNG flows into Europe amid tepid demand in Asia. Also, record-breaking US LNG Exports are playing a part in easing market concerns.

US Energy Policy is having a major impact and the Energy Information Administration ( ) reports the US South is experiencing a natural gas pipeline boom with as many as 12 projects to install new pipelines or expand existing ones on pace to be completed next year in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma.

The new systems will carry enough gas to supply all of Canada and will increase the region’s capacity to ship gas by 13%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from US Energy Information Administration estimates.

The pipelines will mostly feed the wave of LNG terminals scheduled to start operating in 2027 and beyond, driven by soaring demand for gas around the globe and the US being the world’s largest producer and exporter of fuel.

The biggest natural gas pipeline boom in nearly 20 years is unfolding in the US South as companies build systems to feed massive export terminals rising along the Gulf of Mexico.

As many as 12 projects to install new pipelines or expand existing ones are on pace to be completed next year in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma, increasing the region’s capacity to ship gas by 13%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from US Energy Information Administration estimates. It will mark the biggest one-year expansion for Gulf Coast pipelines since the height of the shale-gas boom in 2008.

And let’s not forget Alaska—it’s making American oil great again! For the first time in nearly 40 years, the Last Frontier is set for a real oil revival, with production expected to jump by 55,000 barrels a day in 2026. That’s a 13% surge, more of a plateau than a full-blown turnaround, but still worth tossing your hard hat in the air. According to our latest Short-Term Energy Outlook, Alaskan crude output will climb to 477,000 barrels a day, the highest since 2018. After years of decline, this is the biggest annual increase since the Reagan era.

So, what’s fueling this comeback? It’s all about two game-changers up on Alaska’s North Slope. First, the Nuna project from stormed onto the scene in December 2024, and it’s gunning for a peak of 20,000 barrels a day. In August 2025, Nuna delivered 7,000 barrels daily, holding the line against the usual production slip. Then there’s Pikka Phase 1, the blockbuster partnership between and Repsol. Production kicks off in early 2026 and aims to hit a whopping 80,000 barrels per day by mid-year—that’s nearly 20% of Alaska’s total 2025 output!

These new wells aren’t just good—they’re outclassing most of their Alaskan cousins. Fresh numbers from the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission show these wells pumping out about 480 barrels of oil equivalent per day, while nearly 80% of other wells in the state lagged below 400 BOE/d last year. The forecast for 2026 keeps getting brighter, thanks to Santos’s fast-tracked ramp-up plans and promising well tests that just won’t quit.

And it’s not just Alaska making headlines. Down south, a massive pipeline buildout is sweeping across Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. It’s the biggest Gulf Coast natural gas expansion since the shale revolution of 2008, according to Bloomberg. American energy isn’t just back—it’s breaking records and setting the stage for a whole new era.

As many as a dozen projects are slated for completion next year, enough to boost the region’s gas-shipping capacity by 13%, or about the equivalent of Canada’s total consumption, according to US Energy Information Administration data.

“This is the most activity I’ve seen in my 20 years in the industry,” said Jack Weixel of East Daley Analytics. Bloomberg Reports that Oil extended after the biggest weekly loss since early October, as traders weighed the prospect of a Ukraine-Russia peace deal that could increase crude flows into an already well-supplied market.

traded above $62 a barrel after slumping almost 3% last week, while West Texas Intermediate was below $58. European leaders and other allies have told the US the plan needed more work to try and restrain a Trump administration looking to give concessions to Russia and impose terms by Thanksgiving. Following US-Ukrainian talks on Sunday in Geneva, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that President Donald Trump’s proposed Nov. 27 deadline to secure Ukraine’s support for the plan could drift into the following week.

You know, I think when it comes to Thanksgiving week, traditionally and historically we’ve seen some incredible moves out of the blue. It’s kind of disturbing that the market is so quiet, because we expect something big to happen at any moment. And what is big could be the potential deal for peace as Ukraine is talking, but it also could be weather. Be on guard for big moves, but right now the market’s very quiet. I think natural gas gaped down a little bit earlier overnight, but it should start rebounding here as we get forecasts for wickedly cold weather over the Thanksgiving Day holiday.

Fox Weather reports that heavy rain and severe storms are causing flooding in Texas, affecting record-breaking Thanksgiving travel.

Foolish Take

Gemmstock Limited, a London-based investment manager, recently bought more than $18 million worth of Gulfport Energy stock, bringing its holdings to over $34 million as of September 30, 2025. Here's what average investors need to know.

For starters, Gulfport is relatively small energy production company, which is highly-leveraged to natural gas production in the U.S. Therefore, Gemmstock's acquisition is a bullish bet on US energy production. Moreover, as energy producers are highly affected by the price of the commodities they bring to the surface, Gemmstock is also taking a stance on natural gas prices as we head into the winter in the northern hemisphere.

As for performance, Gulfport has solidly outperformed key benchmarks over the last three years. Since 2022, the stock has generated a total return of 151%, equating to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36%. That beats the S&P 500, which has generated a total return of 71% over the same period, with a CAGR of 19.7%.

What's more, Gulfport has also bested the performance of key exchange-traded funds (ETFs) within the energy sector, such as the State Street SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Expl & Prod ETF (XOP) and the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE). Those funds have produced total returns of -9% and 7%, with CAGRs of -3.3% and 2.4%, respectively.

In summary, investors who are seeking exposure to the energy sector may want to consider Gulfport, due to this recent large institutional purchase, in addition to the stock's solid performance history versus market and industry benchmarks.

Following the longest government shutdown in history, Congress remains at an impasse over whether to extend enhanced premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). With the 2026 open enrollment period now in full swing, millions of marketplace enrollees—from entrepreneurs and small business owners to small business employees, caregivers, and parents—are experiencing significant premium shock. Skyrocketing premiums come at a time when millions are already struggling with the high cost of living, forcing consumers to make difficult choices about their health insurance and ultimately their health care.

Meanwhile, debate barrels on in Congress with no clear path to extending the enhanced premium tax credits. With a Senate vote looming and reports of an impending White House proposal, this article discusses what has transpired in the past two months, the current state of the debate, and what might come next. This continued fight over enhanced premium tax credits is happening as millions of families are left watching and waiting for relief from higher health care costs for 2026.

Background On Premium Tax Credits

The ACA has included premium tax credits to help improve affordability and expand access to coverage in the individual market since the law was enacted in 2010. Beginning in 2014, individuals with an annual income between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) could qualify for premium tax credits that were available on a sliding-scale basis. An individual with an annual income between 100 and 133 percent FPL had to contribute about 2 percent of their income towards premiums, while an individual with an annual income between 300 and 400 percent FPL had to contribute up to 9.78 percent of their income towards premiums.

Under the law, consumers can opt to receive premium tax credits in advance. If a consumer chooses this option, the amount of premiums that they owe to their insurer is automatically reduced each month; the consumer pays only the “discounted” portion of the premium that is not otherwise covered by the premium tax credit. This reduction occurs because the Department of Health and Human Services makes a direct payment to their insurer on the consumer’s behalf. Consumers are not required to choose this option and can instead pay the full premium to their insurer each month. Those who choose this option receive the full amount of premium tax credits at tax time.

Take a consumer whose premiums are, say, $500 per month. If she qualifies for premium tax credits of $450 per month based on her income, she could (1) choose to have this tax credit sent to her insurer in advance so that she pays only $50 per month to her insurer; or (2) choose to forego the advance tax credit so that she pays the entire $500 per month to her insurer and then receives the full $450 per month as part of her tax refund the following year. Most consumers choose the advance premium tax credit option because few can afford to pay the full premium each month and wait for tax time.

Enhanced Premium Tax Credits First Adopted In 2021

Democrats in Congress built on the ACA’s existing subsidies beginning with the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The American Rescue Plan Act increased marketplace access and affordability by (1) eliminating the ACA subsidy cliff for people whose income is more than 400 percent FPL; and (2) increasing ACA subsidies for lower-income people. These enhancements were initially in place only for 2021 and 2022. In 2022, Democrats in Congress extended these premium tax credits through the end of 2025 in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Eliminating The Subsidy Cliff

First, the American Rescue Plan Act eliminated the subsidy cliff at 400 percent FPL. Individuals and families above this income level were not previously eligible for PTCs, leaving many middle-income people—especially those who are older and live in rural areas—with extraordinarily high premiums. To address this cliff, the American Rescue Plan Act made those whose income exceeds 400 percent FPL newly eligible for premium tax credits if the cost of premiums exceeds 8.5 percent of their household income. While some higher-income people can conceivably qualify for premium tax credits, this provision does not subsidize the wealthiest people because the vast majority of wealthy people do not face a premium burden that exceeds this income threshold.

Increasing Existing Subsidies

Second, the American Rescue Plan Act bolstered existing subsidies for those who already qualified under the ACA (i.e., those whose income is between 100 and 400 percent FPL). As noted above, those whose income was 100 percent FPL had to contribute about 2 percent of their annual income towards premiums while those whose income was above 300 percent FPL had to contribute nearly 10 percent of their annual income towards premiums.

The American Rescue Plan Act maintained the sliding-scale nature of premium tax credits but reduced the premium percentage at all income levels (above 100 percent FPL). Those with incomes from 100 to 150 percent FPL became eligible for no-premium coverage (i.e., they contribute no income towards premiums for a silver benchmark plan). The premium contribution increases as income increases but was ultimately capped at no more than 8.5 percent of income for those with higher incomes. This change increased the generosity of premium tax credits because the federal government paid a greater proportion of consumer premiums relative to the ACA as originally enacted in 2010.

The Impact Of Enhanced Premium Tax Credits

From nearly five years, the enhanced premium tax credits have helped ensure that more low- and middle-income families can afford health insurance in the individual market. Under current law, lower-income people can enroll in free or nearly-free silver plans, and middle-income people who purchase their own health insurance have their out-of-pocket premiums capped (meaning they cannot be forced to pay more than 8.5 percent of their income towards premiums alone).

The enhanced premium tax credits have led to significant coverage gains: marketplace enrollment doubled from about 12 million people for 2021 to more than 24 million people for 2025. The biggest enrollment gains were seen in states such as Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas. Enrollees have seen significant savings: in 2023, nearly 15 million people saw an average of $800 in annual premium savings thanks to the enhanced premium tax credits, and projections of annual household spending on premiums and out-of-pocket costs fell in 2025 across all income groups.

Without an extension, millions of consumers will face higher health care costs. An estimated 22 million people will see their premium liability increase, with premium payments more than doubling for 2026. Those that cannot afford these higher premiums will drop their coverage, leading to more than 4 million more uninsured people by 2034. Still others may turn to non-comprehensive options that, as many consumers learn only too late, have lower premiums but do not cover preexisting conditions or comprehensive benefits. These impacts will be felt beyond marketplace enrollees alone: as research from the Commonwealth Fund has shown, the loss of enhanced premium tax credits will lead to job losses, lower state and local tax revenues, and lower rural hospital revenue.

Enhanced Premium Tax Credits And The 2025 Government Shutdown

Much of this year’s health care debate centered not on the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits but on the sweeping changes that were considered and ultimately enacted in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This legislation was signed into law by President Trump on July 4, 2025 and includes significant changes to the ACA, Medicaid, and more. (Republicans in Congress could have extended, or otherwise altered, the enhanced premium tax credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which makes several changes to marketplace rules and premium tax credit eligibility. But Republicans did not take on the subsidy structure in the legislation.)

The multi-month fight over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act left less room to educate or warn the public about the looming expiration of enhanced premium tax credits. But this concern came to a head in September 2025 when Democrats in Congress seized on an extension as one of their primary demands in continuing to fund the federal government ahead of an October 1 deadline.

As Democrats prioritized enhanced premium tax credits, Republicans in Congress and President Trump declined to negotiate, insisting that any negotiations occur only after the government was funded. On September 19, the US House of Representatives advanced a continuing resolution on largely a party-line vote before going on recess for nearly two months. The Senate held several votes on this funding measure, but all failed. Even with the support of a few Democratic senators and one Independent senator, the bill did not have the 60 votes needed to advance.

That remained true until November 10 when the Senate passed a new continuing resolution by a vote of 60 to 40. Seven Democratic senators and one Independent senator joined with all but one Republican to advance the bill. These eight senators voted in favor of the new funding measure after securing (1) funding for most of the federal government through January 30; (2) the promise of a Senate vote on the extension of enhanced premium tax credits in mid-December; (3) the inclusion of a bipartisan three-bill appropriations package with full-year appropriations for SNAP, WIC, and the Department of Veterans Affairs; and (4) a reversal of the mass layoffs of federal workers that occurred during the shutdown and a ban on further mass layoffs through late January. The House of Representatives approved this legislation by a vote of 222 to 209, and President Trump signed the continuing resolution into law on November 12 to end the record 43-day government shutdown.

(ACA historians know that this is the second time that the government has been shut down over an ACA-related dispute. In 2013, the federal government was shut down for 16 days after some Republicans declined to join with Democrats in Congress to fund the government unless the bill also delayed or repealed parts of the ACA. This shutdown coincided with the bumpy rollout of HealthCare.gov in October 2013.)

Where Things Stand On Enhanced Premium Tax Credits

As of November 21, there is not a clear path to extending the enhanced premium tax credits. Senate leadership committed to a mid-December vote on legislation to extend the enhanced premium tax credits. But it is not clear when this vote will occur, the process that will be used, whether both parties will put forward dueling legislative proposals, or whether there will be bipartisan support for an extension. Further complicating this path, House leadership has not committed to holding a vote. And President Trump has resumed criticizing the ACA and has opposed any deal that does not restructure the premium tax credit. Even in the face of such uncertainty, this section describes some of the most recent and prominent policy proposals related to the enhanced premium tax credits.

Bipartisan Proposals

There have been several bipartisan proposals to extend the enhanced premium tax credits in the House. In September 2025, Reps. Jennifer Kiggans (R-VA) and Tom Suozzi (D-NY), among others, introduced a “clean” one-year extension of the tax credits. The extension is “clean” because the bill would make no additional changes beyond extending the expiration date through the end of 2026.

This was followed by a mid-November bipartisan effort led by Reps. Sam Liccardo (D-CA) and Kevin Kiley (R-CA). According to the sponsors, this bill would extend the enhanced premium tax credits for two years but cap eligibility at 600 percent FPL; incorporate the Insurance Fraud Accountability Act to stop fraud by agents and brokers; and leverage savings from the No UPCODE Act to address upcoding by Medicare Advantage insurers.

Even more recently, a bipartisan group of House members introduced a bill to extend the enhanced premium tax credits for two years while (1) capping eligibility to those whose income is up to 935 percent FPL; and (2) setting higher contribution limits for those whose income is between 600 and 935 percent FPL (ranging from 8.5 percent to 9.35 percent of annual income towards premiums). The bill would also improve federal oversight of agents and brokers through new transparency requirements, new civil and criminal penalties, and an extensive enrollment verification process for those enrolled through HealthCare.gov by an agent or broker. Marketplaces would also have to conduct more regular audits to prevent the enrollment of deceased individuals, notify consumers of their advance premium tax credit before enrollment, and extend the 2026 open enrollment period through May 15, 2026.

These bipartisan proposals have been introduced in the House with no companions in the Senate. While there appear to be bipartisan discussions in the Senate, these efforts remain informal, making it difficult to assess whether there is a bipartisan path forward. Indeed, a recent Senate Finance Committee hearing on health care costs was largely partisan, with Republicans focused on criticizing the ACA and Democrats focused on the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits.

Democratic Proposals

Democrats in Congress have long fought to extend the enhanced premium tax credits, including by introducing a permanent, clean extension in January 2025. More recently, Senate and House Democrats put forward a bill to permanently extend the enhanced premium tax credits and repeal the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s cuts to Medicaid and the ACA. Neither effort was taken up in the Republican-controlled House or Senate.

Just ahead of the deal to end the government shutdown, Senate Democrats proposed a one-year extension of the enhanced premium tax credits, a package of three bipartisan appropriations bills, and creation of a bipartisan committee to negotiate any additional changes to the ACA. This offer was rejected. And House Democrats filed a discharge petition to try to force a vote on legislation to extend the enhanced premium tax credits for three years. This effort did not attract Republican support and thus has not garnered the 218 votes needed to proceed.

Beyond the subsidies themselves, Democrats have proposed legislation that could be relevant to a bipartisan deal. One example is the Insurance Fraud Accountability Act, which is referenced above in one of the bipartisan efforts and would tamp down on fraudulent activities by agents and brokers.

Republican Proposals

To my knowledge, Republicans have yet to coalesce behind a legislative proposal and have largely just begun discussing policy options. These discussions have been described as “in the very nascent stages of negotiation” even as millions of consumers face premium shock beginning in 2026. And while some Republicans are open to extending the enhanced premium tax credits, many remain staunchly opposed to the ACA—even reigniting calls to repeal the law.

It is difficult to predict where the Republican party as a whole and President Trump might land—and we still lack details to be able to parse any proposals. But some Republicans appear to support:

Changes To Income Eligibility Levels

There could be support for once again capping premium tax credit eligibility at, say, 400 percent FPL—or at a higher income such as 600 percent FPL. Republicans have raised concerns about the current income-eligibility structure even though very few higher-income people qualify for premium tax credits. If Congress creates a new subsidy cliff, some middle-income families could find themselves without any help with their premiums.

Changes To Subsidy Levels

There could be support for raising out-of-pocket premiums by increasing the amount that consumers must contribute towards premiums. Citing concerns about alleged fraud, Republicans may push to amend the subsidy levels to require all consumers, including very low-income consumers, to contribute some amount towards their monthly premiums. This would eliminate access to no-premium silver benchmark plans and make it harder for lower-income people to afford coverage and care.

Changes To The Subsidy Structure

There could be support for dramatic changes to the way that consumers currently receive and use premium tax credits. To date, House and Senate Republicans have proposed to eliminate the ACA’s enhanced premium tax credits to fund health savings accounts (HSAs). The framework proposed by Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, would eliminate enhanced premium tax credits and use those funds for HSAs so consumers in bronze marketplace coverage could pay for out-of-pocket costs (but not premiums). While this could benefit a narrow set of consumers, it would do little for those who can no longer afford their premiums without the enhanced premium tax credits—or those who are enrolled in a silver or gold plan. And the ACCESS Act, which was introduced by House Republicans in early 2025, would appropriate funds for cost-sharing reductions and use the resulting savings to fund HSAs for use with high-deductible marketplace plans.

Sen. Tim Scott’s (R-SC) proposal would go even further by allowing states to convert the entirety of the ACA’s premium tax credits into HSA-style accounts that could be used to purchase any type of health insurance plan. This bill would allow federal funds to be used for non-ACA options that discriminate against people with preexisting conditions and do not cover comprehensive benefits—and would likely lead to adverse selection in the marketplaces, leading to higher premiums.

Changes To Abortion Coverage

There could be support for new nationwide restrictions on abortion coverage through marketplace plans. The ACA has long deferred to state decisions on abortion coverage. Where abortion is covered, insurers are prohibited from using federal funds to pay for abortion services that fall outside the Hyde Amendment’s narrow exceptions and must also comply with a wide range of other restrictions. New restrictions on abortion would make it impossible for marketplace plans to cover abortion services while still receiving federal funds, leading insurers to drop this care and forcing women to go without the coverage they need in the 25 states and DC where abortion coverage is currently allowed or required.

It remains to be seen if Democrats will support these or similar ideas, each of which would lead to higher out-of-pocket health care costs for consumers and significant disruption—especially for 2026. The potential for disruption is among the reasons why stakeholders and several members of Congress, both Democrat and Republican, have pushed for a straightforward extension of the enhanced premium tax credits for 2026 with more lead time to implement any broader policy changes.

Looking Ahead

With mid-December rapidly approaching, time is of the essence if Congress wants to stave off severe premium hikes for millions of consumers. As Congress continues to try to negotiate across the aisle, President Trump remains a wild card. To date, President Trump’s involvement in the negotiations has been quite limited. I believe he’s met only once with Democratic leadership and has recently criticized the ACA and health insurers. But Senate Republicans have reportedly been urging President Trump to support a short-term extension of the enhanced premium tax credits to buy time for a longer-term negotiation and other changes to the ACA. If President Trump voices support for such an option, at least some congressional Republicans would presumably back him.

Meanwhile, open enrollment continues for 2026. Given consumer concern and confusion about rising premiums, enrollment data from HealthCare.gov and the state-based marketplaces will be especially important to understand how the expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits is contributing to enrollment (or lack thereof) across the country. The first big deadline will be December 15, 2025 for those who want coverage in effect for January 1, 2026. But that will not be the end of open enrollment for 2026, which ends on January 15, 2026 for HealthCare.gov. This final deadline will fall just ahead of the January 30, 2026 deadline to, once again, fund much of the government.",https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/forefront.20251124.459113/full/media/crossroads_forefront.png,N,,2025-11-24 15:01:51.208941

After six long weeks, the federal government reopened with the passage of the Republican spending package in Congress. This was Congressional Democrats’ one real opportunity to win changes to improve people’s lives — and eight Senators blew it.

The package required some Democratic votes in the Senate to reach the 60-vote threshold to stop the filibuster and pass. Senate Democrats worked to leverage this limited power to protect healthcare for millions and rein in Trump’s dangerous dismantling of our government. Trump and Congressional Republicans balked at these protections. They refused to negotiate and drove the country into the longest government shutdown in history.

In the end, eight Senators in the Democratic Caucus caved and joined Republicans to pass a spending package with little to show for it. They paved the way for even more dangerous Trump cuts, while failing to secure any meaningful commitments from Congressional Republicans on more affordable healthcare.

This shutdown only emphasized the cruelty of Trump and his allies. And the spending fight to protect clean water funding will continue into 2026. Here’s what you need to know:

Trump’s Shutdown Is Historic for its Length and its Cruelty

This was no ordinary government shutdown. At 43 days, it was the longest federal shutdown in history, surpassing the record Trump set during his last term. In another unusual and shameful move, Speaker Mike Johnson put the House on a paid vacation throughout it all and longer.

Beyond the expected dangers of a federal shutdown, Trump’s shutdown was staggering in its cruelty. The Trump administration sought to inflict maximum pain on its political opponents, with regular people suffering the consequences. Trump announced plans to target what he called “Democrat agencies” with mass firings of some 4,000 federal workers. His administration cut or froze nearly $28 billion in infrastructure projects in Democratic jurisdictions.

And for the first time ever, the federal government paused support for SNAP food assistance. The Trump administration refused to use nearly $5 billion in a contingency fund set aside for emergencies. Instead, it illegally withheld SNAP benefits for November.

After two federal court orders mandated that the administration release the funding, the Trump administration appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to take food away from struggling families.

The decision to freeze SNAP food assistance used low-income families as pawns. Trump was willing to allow millions to starve to get his way. Hunger was a policy choice Trump and Congressional Republicans made.

The Spending Package Greenlights Trump’s Dangerous Cuts

So what was included in the deal? The spending package that passed earlier this month included a “continuing resolution,” which extends current funding levels for most of the federal government for just a few months, to January 30, 2026. This includes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the main source of federal funding for safe and clean water.

Senate Democrats added some protections for federal workers from mass layoffs, undoing Trump’s illegal firings during the shutdown and extending those layoff protections through January 30, 2026. The package also includes full-year bills that fund about 10% of the federal government through September 30, 2026.

However, the bill doesn’t include the sought-for extension of Affordable Care Act healthcare subsidies, without which many people’s insurance costs will skyrocket; some by hundreds of dollars. The Senate Democrats who voted for this spending package secured only the mere promise of a vote on the extension in December from Republican leadership; House leadership made no such promise.

Alarmingly, the legislation also contained no protections from Trump’s dangerous rescissions, which are cuts to Congressionally-approved funding that bypass any negotiation with Democrats. Food & Water Watch led a letter from more than 200 groups asking Senate Democratic leadership to use the spending bill to block partisan rescissions.

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, who is the top Democrat appropriator in the House, fought to add such “No Kings” provisions to the full-year spending bills, but she was cut out of negotiations at the last minute. Now, without these protections, Trump and his allies remain empowered to eliminate programs that communities rely on, with little opportunity for Democrats to fight back.

Good News and Bad News on Food

The full-year bills in the spending package included funding for the Department of Agriculture, many of whose programs channel important funds to families and farmers.

The agriculture bill funds SNAP food assistance for the rest of the fiscal year through September 30, 2026. But that news is less of a relief when the bill does nothing to change the massive cuts to SNAP in Trump’s Big Ugly Bill, which took food assistance away from 4 million people.

The agriculture spending bill, however, cuts funding for funds that farmers and rural communities rely on, including $100 million from Conservation Technical Assistance and $32.6 million from rural water grants.

It also includes a major giveaway to large industrial farms, allowing corporate ag giants to grab funds meant for conservation through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Conservation Stewardship Program.

The good news: The spending bill fully funds the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). This is a testament to our work calling attention to the threats to WIC and our members pressuring lawmakers to protect it; the original House spending bill would have underfunded this program by about $600 million over the course of the year.

Additionally, the deal extends many remaining pieces of the Farm Bill for a year, including funding for research on sustainable and organic agriculture. And fortunately, our advocacy stopped Congress from including a proposal to federally block state and local animal welfare laws, called the EATS Act, in this round of bills.

The Battle Isn’t Over — Join Our Fight to Fund Safe, Lead-Free Water!

The Congressional spending battle isn’t over. Much of the federal government, including the EPA and its clean water programs, are only funded until January 30, 2026. Over the next two months, Congress will debate legislation to fund these programs for a full year. Clean water funds may end up on the chopping block.

House Republicans want to eliminate $662 million from the State Revolving Fund programs, which are the main source of federal funding for safe and clean water. The House’s spending bill (H.R.4754) would cut these funds to the lowest level since 2008. This would mean fewer essential infrastructure improvements that make our water clean, safe, and affordable.

Meanwhile, the Senate has proposed to eliminate $250 million from funding already provided to replace toxic lead water pipes. The Senate spending bill (S.2431) cuts funding for lead pipe replacements passed in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021. These funds were set to go out the door. This is the last year of funding provided by that law, and communities must get every cent.

These proposed cuts make lawmakers’ agenda clear: dirty, toxic water. As Congress debates these cuts over the next few months, we’ll be working to make sure they change course and defend clean water funding. Our leaders must do better and protect safe, lead-free water for everyone.",https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Congress-Evergreen-Featured-Image-1024x427.png,N,,2025-11-24 14:01:19.099260

OECD The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) was established to help bridge emerging clean energy technologies from research and development to commercial-scale deployment.","The U.S. Department of Energy has released a new organizational chart that has removed groups focused on energy efficiency, renewable energy, and reducing carbon emissions.

A new hierarchical chart posted on the DOE website shows that the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management and the Grid Deployment Office are no longer listed as part of the organization. The organizations are now expected to be absorbed by the Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation.

“Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, the Energy Department is aligning its operations to restore commonsense to energy policy, lower costs for American families and businesses, and ensure the responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright in a press statement. “These changes will help us better execute the DOE mission of delivering affordable, reliable and secure American energy for the American people.”

EERE

The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) was a driving force supporting clean energy advancement by driving down consumer costs and supporting research, development, and deployment.

EERE impact reports said utility-scale solar costs fell by 73%, onshore wind by 41%, and electric vehicle (EV) battery costs dropped by 79% over a decade under its cost-reduction support. The organization estimated it saved Americans an estimated $800 billion in energy costs since 1980.

EERE investments helped support a $2 trillion clean energy market in the U.S. and resulted in nearly 1,000 patents. The organization’s programs helped launch 154 energy innovation companies, creating thousands of jobs and raising billions in private capital, according to a 2024 investment report from the Environmental and Energy Study Institute.

The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) was instrumental in advancing clean energy, driving down costs for wind and solar power, and supporting innovation in building efficiency and sustainable transportation, while simultaneously bolstering U.S. grid resilience and workforce development.

OECD

The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) was established to help bridge emerging clean energy technologies from research and development to commercial-scale deployment. It was originally established with a total portfolio of over $25 billion in federal funds allocated through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act.

OCED selected 113 projects across 42 states, which were designed to unlock billions of dollars in private investment by sharing the initial financial and technical risks associated with new technologies. However, under the Trump administration, DOE announced widespread cancellations of funding, including cutting over $3 billion in May 2025 and over $7 billion in October 2025.

The federal funds were intended to catalyze a much larger amount of private investment. For example, over $14 billion in private capital was tied to the $6 billion federal investment in the Industrial Demonstrations Program alone, much of which has now been lost to Trump administration project cancellations.

Other organizations

Also removed from DOE’s hierarchy is the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM), which was tasked with pioneering carbon management systems, including carbon capture and storage, reducing methane emissions, securing critical minerals, and supporting energy and national security measures.

The organization obligated nearly $1.4 billion to fund 654 research and development projects between 2018 to 2023 for projects at industrial facilities and power plants that focused on permanent carbon storage or conversion into valuable products.

FECM also collaborated with the EPA on an $850 million program to help oil and gas operators monitor, measure, and reduce methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas.

Also removed from the organization is the Grid Deployment Office (GDO). GDO managed over $14.5 billion in funding and grants to strengthen the U.S. power grid. These included the $10.5 billion Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) Program and $2.3 billion in formula grants to states and tribes. The programs were planning to add enough transmission lines to support 67 GW of new capacity by 2031.

The office also ran the Coordinated Interagency Transmission Authorizations and Permits (CITAP) program, which aimed to cut federal transmission permitting times in half. The GDO’s federal investments catalyzed more than $36.9 billion in combined public and private investment, according to a DOE factsheet.

Future funding

Upon the reorganization and funding cuts, non-profit climate policy organization Clean Tomorrow has launched a campaign called Re-Energizing America, a creating a roadmap to address the innovation cliff that will occur when substantial federal funding expires in 2026. The roadmap calls for $25 billion in DOE funding to research, development and deployment programs by 2030. Find the roadmap here.

,Clean Energy ,2025-11-24 17:11:10+00:00,The Colorado Sun,Xcel Energy asks for $356M rate increase. Home rates could will rise $10.,"Mark Jaffe, Mark Jaffe Freelance journalist",,,,,https://coloradosun.com/2025/11/24/xcel-energy-electricity-rate-hike-energy-assistance-fee/,"It has been three years since Xcel Energy increased its basic charge for electricity.
Soaring electricity rates were a major issue in the New Jersey and Virginia governors races this month.
Xcel is not alone in its rate increase requests In its rate filing Xcel Energy noted that its request is just one of 57 rate increases being sought by utilities this year nationwide, and in Colorado, United Power, Colorado Springs Utilities and the CORE Electric Cooperative have announced rate increases.
Xcel Energy makes the bulk of its money building infrastructure and adding it to its rate base boosting charges to customers.
Xcel Energy is putting $5 million in corporate money toward the programs (and another $5 million toward helping with gas bills), but the major source of funding will be other Xcel customers as the company proposes doubling the energy assistance charge on bills to about $2.","Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electricity provider with 1.6 million customers, is seeking a 9% increase in rates — about $10 on the average monthly residential bill — even as state regulators voice concerns about affordability.

The utility filed the rate request on Nov. 21 with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, seeking to raise $356 million in additional revenue to recover infrastructure investments, operating costs and lost revenue sources.

It has been three years since Xcel Energy increased its basic charge for electricity.

During that time the company has spent nearly $300 million upgrading the distribution system that serves homes and businesses.

“These investments are aligned with state policy, with our customers, needs and wants and with our own desires to reduce climate change,” said Robert Kenney, the CEO of Xcel Energy’s Colorado subsidiary.

“Every affordability metric that we use will remain below the national and Colorado averages, which has been the case for the last 10 years,” Kenney said.

The company, Kenney said, is also going to expand programs to help low-income and seniors pay their bills.

The proposed rate hike, however, comes at a time that state regulators and consumer advocates are increasingly concerned about the impact of rising electricity rates on household affordability.

“We’re seeing no easing from the pressures in the economy, and yet the company continues to act in a manner that none of these outside forces seem to play into the equation,” said Joseph Pereira, deputy director of the Colorado Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate.

“Bringing these rate cases largely has to do with the returns and dividends it is looking to meet at the corporate level,” Pereira said. The UCA represents residential and small commercial customers in rate cases.

In analysis of Xcel Energy’s plans to invest $22 billion in Colorado over the next five years, PUC Chairperson Eric Blank said rates could rise as much as 72% and that Xcel Energy’s Colorado earnings could rise to $1.6 billion from $700 million in 2020.

The fact that rates remain below the national average — which includes states with very high electricity prices such as Hawaii and California — is of little solace, Blank said.

“Having heard from hundreds or thousands of customers over the course of many rate cases,” Blank said, “my sense is that customers care mainly about what their bills are now and what they’re going to be. So for me, in thinking about and defining affordability, I suppose that we look mainly at growth in average residential rates and bills from today’s level.”

“We may need to explore ways to manage capital spending and rate impact, including in the upcoming rate cases ,” Blank said in remarks at the commissioner’s weekly meeting, two days before Xcel Energy filed for the rate increase.

Mounting electricity prices have been an issue across the country with electricity rates rising twice as fast as inflation since 2022 leaving 1 in 6 families behind on their utility bills, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.

Soaring electricity rates were a major issue in the New Jersey and Virginia governors races this month.

“We recognize it’s a highly political issue,” Xcel Energy’s Kenney said.

Xcel is not alone in its rate increase requests

In its rate filing Xcel Energy noted that its request is just one of 57 rate increases being sought by utilities this year nationwide, and in Colorado, United Power, Colorado Springs Utilities and the CORE Electric Cooperative have announced rate increases.

“These filings reflect the same underlying realities that we face — aging systems, rising costs for labor and materials, and evolving reliability and sustainability expectations,” Steven Berman, the utility’s regional vice president of regulatory and pricing, said in PUC testimony.

There are multiple reasons for the surge in rates: the need to update the power grid, the transition from old coal-fired power plants to renewable generation, the growth of natural gas generation and the volatile price of its fuel, and wildfire related costs.

Another spur to rates is the growing demand for electricity from data centers, according to a Bank of America study.

“The pressure on peak electricity demand capacity will likely persist, potentially meaning unyielding pressure on customer utility bills,” the bank study said. “This impacts lower-income households disproportionately and is another headwind at a time of weakening wage growth.”

Driving rates in Colorado are Xcel Energy’s multi-billion plans to expand its system to meet state greenhouse gas reduction goals, deal with wildfire risks and address emerging data center demand.

By the estimate of the PUC’s Blank the 13.82 cent per kilowatt-hour charge in 2024 will rise a minimum of 55% and as much as 72% by 2029. “I’m concerned that we’re fundamentally not on track to maintain affordability,” he said.

The $294 million Xcel is seeking to recoup in investments to the distribution system are part of a five-year, $5 billion plan to overhaul the network that connects homes and business to the grid.

This included replacing nearly 18,000 wooden poles and 18,000 transformers, 775 megawatts of new generation interconnections, 406 new circuit transmission miles and five new substations.

Xcel Energy makes the bulk of its money building infrastructure and adding it to its rate base boosting charges to customers.

“The company’s spending on infrastructure is unchecked and likely not the most efficient or targeted approach,” the UCA’s Pereira said.

Commissioner Megan Gilman said that while the upgrades to the electric system must be made, they have to be optimized and that Xcel Energy’s projections on load growth (how much electricity it needs) and plans to meet have fallen short.

“They have missed the mark in providing load curves and kind of a vision of the grid of the future that really gets to the optimization that is necessary to keep this affordable for customers,” Gilman said.

Rates proposed to increase almost 10%

The proposed rate increase would boost residential bills 9.9% with the average monthly bill for 601 kilowatt-hours rising to $110.04 from $100. In 2022, the average bill was $81.86.

The average small commercial bill would rise about 9.5% to $164.22 from $150 for 1,041 kilowatt-hours. Large commercial and industrial users would see rate increases of 7.3% to 9.3% depending on the amount of electricity consumed.

Even with the rate increase Kenney said that electricity’s share of total spending for a Colorado household would be about 1%, less than half the national average.

“Recognizing the costs can be a challenge for some of our customers, we will expand our electric and gas assistance programs, expanding the number of customers that are eligible to enroll in those programs,” Kenney said.

There are about 60,000 income-qualified customers in the utility’s program, which limits bills to 1.5% of income. The goal is to double the number of participating households, Kenney said. The customers will also avoid involuntary shut offs.

A program for income-qualified seniors could provide a bill credit of up to $20 a month. “So the whole goal with this whole menu of programs is to avoid energy crises,” Kenney said.

Xcel Energy is putting $5 million in corporate money toward the programs (and another $5 million toward helping with gas bills), but the major source of funding will be other Xcel customers as the company proposes doubling the energy assistance charge on bills to about $2.

About half of the average bill is for charges, called riders, above the base rate for things such as clean energy, transmission construction, energy efficiency and wildfire mitigation programs.",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/xcel_power_pathways_platteville-JS___0005.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 15:01:30.543311
,Congress,2025-11-24 17:03:02+00:00,Colorado Public Radio,Freshmen Rep. Jeff Hurd steps into a high-wire policy push with bill to extend ACA tax credit,"Caitlyn Kim, The Associated Press, Colorado Public Radio Staff, Ishan Thakore, Elaine Tassy",,,,,https://www.cpr.org/2025/11/24/hurd-bipartisan-aca-health-insurance-tax-credit-bill/,"GOP Rep. Jeff Hurd is part of a bipartisan quartet of lawmakers trying to extend a tax credit that helps people buy health insurance on the state marketplace.
Hurd said the cost of health care and health insurance premiums is not a Republican or a Democratic issue.
He noted that Republican Senate leaders have promised a vote on an ACA tax credit extension bill by mid-December.
However, the first-term Hurd was a new face when they gathered on the Capitol’s East Steps to unveil the bill last week.
Suozzi, however, is optimistic that the Bipartisan HOPE Act could help pave the way to a solution — especially if lawmakers start hearing from their constituents about it.","GOP Rep. Jeff Hurd is part of a bipartisan quartet of lawmakers trying to extend a tax credit that helps people buy health insurance on the state marketplace. Their proposal focuses on an issue that was at the heart of this fall’s government shutdown.

Hurd said the cost of health care and health insurance premiums is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. “I don’t care how red or blue your district is, this is something that your constituents care about.”

The Bipartisan Healthcare Optimization Protection Extension (HOPE) Act extends the enhanced premium tax credit for two years. It includes a lower income cap for enrollees, about $200,000 for a family of four, and phases out for those making above that (currently the subsidy is capped based on what percent of a family’s income it spends on health care). The bill would also try to crack down on fraud.

Backers describe the bill as a needed stopgap measure.

“We don't want to see premiums skyrocket, but we probably need a deeper plan for the longer term to deal with the high cost of healthcare,” said Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, the other GOP lead on the bill. “What we're proposing is a bridge. Let's help keep people's premiums down — that's important — and it’ll give us time to work on it, maybe something better over the next year or two.”

“People are freaking out. I mean, I get phone calls from people about seeing their premiums go up by a thousand dollars a month.,” said Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York, one of the Democratic leads.

He noted that Republican Senate leaders have promised a vote on an ACA tax credit extension bill by mid-December. But that’s not guaranteed in the House. “That's why we felt it was very important for us to get together as a bipartisan team to say, let's work together and let's force something to happen here that we can try and build consensus on.”

All four sponsors of the Bipartisan HOPE Act are also co-sponsors of a separate bill that would extend the credit for one year in its current form. They said their bill was developed from other lawmakers’’ response to that effort.

“Some of the feedback that we got from that was, listen, it's not long enough. There are some reforms that we need to be making,” Hurd explained, adding that this new bill “addresses those concerns that we've heard from our colleagues on both sides of the aisle.”

Hurd enters the ACA fray

It’s not unusual for Bacon, Suozzi or the Bipartisan HOPE Act’s fourth sponsor, Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer, to be found standing in front of a half dozen cameras at the U.S. Capitol. These three have been in Congress since 2019 and as members of the Problem Solvers Caucus have been part of other bipartisan policy plans enacted into law.

However, the first-term Hurd was a new face when they gathered on the Capitol’s East Steps to unveil the bill last week.

Bacon introduced Hurd to the crowd of reporters personally. “He’s a great new freshman doing wonderful things for our House.”

Suozzi praised Hurd, also a member of the Problem Solvers, as the “new guy in Congress from Colorado who just really wants to do the right thing and is stepping out along with everyone else here to say we’re planting this flag. We’re trying to get something done.”

There is some potential risk for Hurd here; he’s advocating for a bill that President Donald Trump does not currently support. Even House leadership has been skeptical of extending the credit.

Still, there is a strong incentive for Hurd to act. His district is seeing some of the highest increases in ACA premiums across the state.

According to a new survey from the Colorado Polling Institute, 3 out 4 Coloradans think Congress should extend the enhanced tax credit and a majority of those polled believe the cost of health insurance in Colorado is a crisis or a major problem.

But there are also limits to how far out on a limb the Western Slope Republican will go. Hurd said he would not support a discharge petition to get the bill to the floor. If it gets enough signatures, a discharge petition allows lawmakers to bypass leadership and bring a bill that has a majority of support in the full chamber to a vote.

The unusual procedure recently succeeded in forcing a vote on releasing the Epstein files.

“I think regular order is the right way to do this,” said Hurd. “We’re giving Congress and our colleagues in the Senate a serious, incredible proposal. I think it's really good and I think it reflects a consensus that is sound public policy.”

Some lawmakers are willing to consider it.

“I’m always willing to have a conversation about what a bipartisan path forward could look like,” said Democratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen, who said she’s looking into the details of the Bipartisan HOPE Act and is also in the Problem Solvers Caucus. “Doing something to address the skyrocketing costs is significantly better than what is currently happening to Americans.”

Still this bill faces an uphill climb in Congress.

GOP Rep. Gabe Evans said people in his district are worried about the affordability of healthcare, but is concerned the income cap is too generous.

“I've talked to folks that have said, ‘why should I, as somebody that's making $50, $60, $70,000 a year, have to subsidize somebody who's making $200,000 a year, $300,000 a year?” he said.

Evans, who is also in the Problem Solvers, said talking about income caps and dealing with waste and abuse in the system are conversations that need to happen.

Suozzi, however, is optimistic that the Bipartisan HOPE Act could help pave the way to a solution — especially if lawmakers start hearing from their constituents about it.

“One of the best ways to move things in this town is to have a lot of public support for it, and to have a lot of political support for it. And we're trying to just lay the groundwork for something to build support for. And that's how you get something done.”",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/250812-COLORADO-CHAMBER-BIENNIAL-CONGRESSIONAL-LUNCHEON-DENVER-ART-MUSEUM-COPOLITICS-KEVINJBEATY-40.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 13:01:43.038843

The United States won’t have much to offer officially — the Trump administration had said it wouldn’t send any high-level delegates. And with President Trump pulling the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement earlier this year, the country is far from a climate leader these days.

But all is not lost. Local level climate work continues in the United States, with accomplishments worth cheering — and replicating. For the last few years, I’ve tracked one of the most overlooked: the removal of harmful and obsolete dams. The United States has been leading the global charge on dam removals. In just the last 25 years nearly 2,000 dams have been blasted and backhoed from our rivers and streams.

Dam removals, like the four-dam effort completed last year on the Klamath River, are often celebrated for helping imperiled fish, like salmon. But they also offer two important benefits for the climate.

The first is reducing emissions. A growing body of scientific research dating back to the 1990s has found that reservoirs from dams can produce greenhouse gas emissions, some on par with thermal power plants. The biggest culprit is methane, a potent greenhouse gas that traps 80 times more heat as carbon dioxide over 20 years. As organic material breaks down in a reservoir, methane is diffused from the water into the air.

As we take stock of our greenhouse gas emissions, an honest accounting of the input from dams could help us make reductions where dams are unneeded, unsafe, or doing more harm than good. In some states there are thousands of “deadbeat” dams, which serve no purpose at all anymore, and should be put on the chopping block. And if you’re wondering if it makes sense to remove infrastructure that can produce “clean” energy, know that the vast majority of large U.S. dams — upwards of 97 percent — don’t produce power.

The second is strengthening resilience. Many dams are outdated, dilapidated, or not designed to handle the onslaught of water that comes with climate-amplified storms. Some have already failed, risking lives and costing millions. After Hurricane Helene slammed North Carolina last year, 40 dams were damaged or destroyed. Expect to see more of that. A recent report from researchers at Utah State University found that incidents of dam failures or interventions needed to prevent failures are skyrocketing. From 1990 to 1999 we averaged two such incidents a year. That number jumped to an average of 50 a year from 2020 to 2023.

After two years of dangerous floods, Vermont has gotten the message. Last year the state passed a law to identify dams that worsen flooding and create a fund to remove them. Other states are also assessing dam removal to boost climate resilience. Removing damaging dams and helping rivers reconnect with their floodplains can help protect communities from severe weather and save money.

Dam removals offer other climate resilience benefits. Dams hold back water, but they also block the movement of sediment, which depletes coastal beaches and speeds erosion. One of the most notorious examples is the Matilija Dam near Ojai, California, a now-defunct dam that has corralled nearly 9 million cubic yards of sediment. Removing Matilija would reinvigorate downstream beaches in Ventura. As rising seas eat away at ocean beaches, upstream dam removals can help protect coastal communities.

Dams also change the temperature of rivers. As climate change pushes up the mercury, some reservoirs are becoming more like bathtubs. Higher water temperatures can foster toxic algal blooms that threaten human health and kill wildlife. Dam removals can flip the script, helping to restore more natural stream temperatures and flows, improving water quality in rivers that millions of Americans rely on for drinking water. It can also support biodiversity by enabling aquatic animals to find cooler upstream waters to better weather our changing climate.

Dam removals aren’t a climate cure-all, but the magnitude of the crisis we face will require all the tools we can muster — and master. Several decades of dam removals across the U.S. has proved they work to restore rivers better and faster than anything else. Now let’s put them to use for climate action, too.

As plans for natural gas pipeline expansions in southwest Virginia are rapidly taking shape, proposals from two major energy firms to transport gas through the Appalachian regions of Virginia and North Carolina are fueling community concern.

Critics are disturbed by the route of the two proposed pipelines, now under review amid a surge of applications to build massive data centers in the region. Among their concerns: the lines, and compressor stations related to gas distribution, will be laid within hundreds of feet of each other in some locations in a North Carolina county and potentially disrupt rural lifestyles and landscapes.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and Virginia environmental regulators are reviewing long-running requests from Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC and the Williams Companies Inc. for billion-dollar extensions that would link to pivotal and existing crosscountry networks.

Mountain Valley Pipeline is seeking to build 31 miles of pipeline from Virginia into North Carolina, extending a 303-mile network that now cuts from the Marcellus and Utica shale along the Pennsylvania border through West Virginia to southern Virginia. MVP’s proposal, called the Southgate Extension, has been reviewed and revised since 2020. Mountain Valley is also requesting to add compressor stations along its main line: three in West Virginia and one in Montgomery County, Virginia, about 70 miles near where Southgate would begin.

The Williams Companies is requesting approval to build 55 new miles of pipeline to bolster its Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line, better known as Transco, that transports fracked gas from the Texas Gulf Coast across about a dozen states. The Williams Companies calls its proposal the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project, or the SSEP, a pipeline that will expand capacity for Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia and other states.

A FERC decision is expected for Mountain Valley Pipeline, which is operated by EQT Corp., by the end of the year. FERC is expected to review the proposal by The Williams Companies, based in Oklahoma, by February.

The Williams Companies also recently submitted a separate proposal for a pipeline expansion in Virginia, a plan that emerged in May during a quarterly earnings call. The Williams Companies said it was aiming to run pipe from Southern Virginia to “serve the power-hungry Virginia market” with a northern extension, dubbed the Power Express, and later told the Cardinal News website that the project was “in the early development stage.”

The rush for more reliance on gas is likely to gain pace.

The Virginia Department of Energy announced just weeks ago a partnership with the Williams Companies as well as Red Post Energy LLC, whose parent company is based in Australia, and Enbridge Inc., headquartered in Canada. The initiative will study new natural gas infrastructure proposals for “locations between Roanoke and Bristol,” according to a department release on Oct. 9.

The study “will evaluate site suitability, environmental considerations, interconnection requirements, and economic benefits including job creation, tax revenue, and regional development opportunities,” the department said. The release offered no deadline for the study’s completion.

All these proposals would thread miles more natural gas pipeline in a state that is seen as a hot property for companies seeking data centers as part of their growth strategy.

Those proposals are being considered as Virginia oversees other new operations coming on line. TC Energy, formerly known as TransCanada, is set this month to launch a pipeline, nearly 49 miles in length, near the Tidewater region. The Virginia Natural Gas local distribution company is also seeking by October 2027 to expand a compressor station in the city of Chesapeake, in southeastern Virginia, to boost smaller intrastate pipelines.

But some communities are raising concerns about the speed and breadth of many of these proposals—and they are complaining that towns and residents are having a difficult time sorting through the construction requests and possible risks.

Community advocates, in both states, said they want to know how regulators and towns are supposed to assess cumulative impacts and allow for proper public involvement in the process.

“How confusing and complicated,” Jessica Sims, Virginia field coordinator with Appalachian Voices, an environmental nonprofit advocacy group based in North Carolina, said about the pipeline proposals and FERC’s analysis of the projects.

Data center proposals, tied to artificial intelligence work sought by technology and financial companies, are changing the landscape of some swaths of rural America. Virginia alone could see electricity demands triple by 2040 because of data center growth. The state, home to several federal agencies, has been keen to accommodate business interests tied to AI.

The Virginia General Assembly’s policy research unit has estimated that a new 1.5 gigawatt gas plant, enough to power about 375,000 homes, would need to be built every 18 months for 15 consecutive years as part of the energy mix needed if all the data center proposals become reality.

The expansion of natural gas is among the priorities of the Trump administration. President Donald Trump is a proponent of fossil fuels and early in his second term he issued an executive order “Unleashing American Energy.” Trump declared a widely disputed national energy emergency, which some companies such as Mountain Valley Pipeline have used to support pipeline expansion proposals.

Mountain Valley spokesperson Shawn Day said the company’s main line, a 303-mile project running from Northwest West Virginia into Pittsylvania County completed in 2024, ensured reliability. Day pointed to an April 2025 report by FERC and the nonprofit North American Electric Reliability Corporation, another regulatory group, that “credited MVP with helping to avoid” gas shortages “during extreme weather and periods of record demand early this year.”

“Opponents of the MVP Mainline claimed for years that the (main line) project wasn’t needed, and yet barely six months after it entered operation, the project was operating at its full capacity, providing a critical supply of natural gas for residential and business use and electricity generation,” Day said in an email. The Southgate extension will prove to be as useful if not critical for the region, MVP contends in its proposal.

The Williams Companies also focused on rising needs in its application for expansion. In an email to Inside Climate News, it described the SSEP as a “$1.2 billion investment that will strengthen energy reliability and deliver meaningful economic benefits across the region.”

SSEP “will meet or exceed all safety and environmental standards, while supporting climate and energy goals,” the Williams Companies statement said. “Assertions to the contrary misrepresent both the facts and our record of responsible development.”

That is not how some community groups—critical of coal mining in the region and fearful of the rapid demand of pipelines across the countryside—view the energy companies’ ambitions and regard for local residents. They fear that the development will harm their way of life.

“It all comes down to there has not been any transparency, any real data showing a need for all of this coming through here,” said Tiffany Haworth, executive director of the nonprofit Dan River Basin Association, who also questioned whether all the data centers will be built. There is a risk that energy companies are predicting and producing for a market that may not exist—and communities may suffer, she said.

“People want to turn their lights on. … We get that. But we already have a pipeline going through there,” Haworth said. “We as an organization don’t feel that the harm that it is going to cause to our waterways and our recreational outdoor recreational economy—over a million people get their drinking water from these rivers—makes sense.”

Kasey Kinsella, associate director of 7 Directions of Service, an Indigenous advocacy group that opposes the pipelines, said the companies’ plans, if completed, would destroy any chance of natural harmony.

“All of this is just so absurd,” Kinsella said.

Southgate in Virginia

Big energy companies and their related businesses have been eager to provide services in some of the fastest-growing states. Mountain Valley Pipeline and the Williams Companies have both focused on a North Carolina location—Rockingham County, population 91,000—as the choice for their expansion ambitions.

Mountain Valley Pipeline, operating in Virginia since 2014, first proposed the Southgate Extension in 2018 as a pipeline to extend from its main line, starting in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, and running 31 miles deep into north central North Carolina. That extension was approved in 2020 by FERC—but on the condition that the main line received its necessary approvals.

The main line construction faced several legal disputes for nearly a decade. In 2023, MVP benefited from congressional pressure orchestrated by Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Manchin pushed its permit through during the federal budget process then. By June 2024, the main line was operating.

The Southgate proposal, too, has faced some trouble from regulators. The Virginia Air Pollution Control Board in 2021 reviewed and rejected MVP’s permit request for Southgate based on health concerns. The board found the pipeline path would cause potentially disproportionate harm to Black residential areas.

In late 2023, months after the main line approval, MVP revised its Southgate plan with some major changes.

MVP’s proposed new Southgate would traverse 31 miles rather than 75 miles–and ends at a different place. MVP’s previous Southgate proposal had terminated in Alamance County in North Carolina; the new plan will end in nearby Rockingham County.

FERC in 2024 released an environmental assessment, that the amended project “would result in fewer environmental effects than the” original MVP plan. It “would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment” although there would be some impacts to prime farmland, forested areas and wetlands, FERC said.

FERC notably found that the Southgate proposal would not be likely to “adversely affect” federally endangered animals in the area, including the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat. The project, FERC also said, would “not result in significant effects,” on state-listed species, including the bigeye jumprock, which the Virginia Department of Wildlife has designated as having “high conservation need.”

FERC also found that MVP’s proposed method of horizontal directional drilling, or boring that goes under streams instead of digging ditches across them, would avoid environmental harm. Horizontal drilling “greatly reduces potential effects on surface waterbodies, particularly compared to open-cut crossings. In general, typical pipeline effects on waterbodies are avoided with trenchless methods,” FERC said in its 2024 assessment.

Williams Companies’s Plan

The Williams Companies’s SSEP is also proposed to run from Pittsylvania County in Virginia and end in Rockingham County. The Williams Companies aims to build two loops of pipeline–a 31-mile section crossing the Virginia and North Carolina border is called the “Eden Loop” and a 24.2-mile stretch in North Carolina is dubbed the “Salem Loop.” Both would link to its pipeline running from Texas.

In an environmental assessment report in 2024, FERC reviewed Williams Companies’s plan and found no “significant impact” to the “quality of human environment. The effect on “vegetation would be minor and mostly temporary to short term,” and “effects on wildlife from construction and operation of the Project would not be significant,” according to the FERC report.

FERC also assessed the cumulative impacts of both MVP’s Southgate and The Williams Companies’s SSEP proposal based on a myriad of aspects, including wetlands. MVP’s proposal would affect 18.2 acres of wetlands during construction, it said, and the Williams Companies’ Eden Loop would affect 27.5 acres of wetlands.

Because of the overlapping construction area and timetable of the projects, “cumulative effects on surface water quality may occur,” FERC said. It noted that “The magnitude of effects would depend on the specific timeframe of crossing the same waterbodies.”

Sims of Appalachian Voices said FERC did not go far enough in looking at the double whammy of two pipeline projects—with trucks, traffic and construction—converging on Rockingham County. “I’m not sure how anyone could look at that much information and come to that conclusion,” Sims said of FERC’s report.

Sims said having the two projects, which could be as close as within 200 feet of each other in some areas of the criss-crossing routes, could be problematic if there were structural failures in either network. She questioned how regulators would track which company was responsible for erosion and sediment problems that could choke flora and fauna.

“If you have projects that are so closely routed with construction at the same time, the blame–if there are sedimentation problems–it’s even more complicated,” Sims said.

Broader Community Concerns

Haworth of The Dan River Basin Association, based in North Carolina, said she and others are concerned that MVP’s and the Williams Companies’s projects will upend years of work to protect the environment and the river that flows through eight counties in Virginia and North Carolina.

The river basin, a 3,300 square mile watershed, is fed by the Smith, Mayo, Banister, Hayco and Sandy rivers. The waterways have weathered troubling industrial demands before, she said, and residents across state borders have some vivid memories of a time when textiles dominated the economic and environmental landscape.

The dye from a factory in Martinsville, Virginia, would flow into the Smith River and change the color of the stream ”running down all the way down into North Carolina,” Haworth said. In 2014, one of Duke Energy Corp.’s steam stations in Eden, North Carolina, sprung a leak, leading the U.S. Department of Interior to find that approximately 39,000 tons of ash and 27 million gallons of ash pond water” were released and resulted in a threat to endangered species and migratory birds.

“We’ve worked really hard for two decades, working with municipalities and state government, to make sure that these natural resources remain protected, preserved for future generations, and pipelines do not quite fit into that,” Haworth said.

Haworth wondered how FERC could find “no significant impact” on the quality of life for people who will live near miles of heavy construction. “When they say minimal impact, no amount of impact is worth hurting people. A million people’s drinking water,” she said.

Kinsella of the advocacy group 7 Directions of Service said she is concerned about every part of the expansion. No one should overlook, she said, the impact of compressors along the pipeline trail. They too will add noise and stress, she said, particularly so to neighborhoods that have historically been burdened with industrial pressures.

The energy companies may try to monetarily compensate the residents with onetime financial checks but that won’t really address how their lives will be changed, she said.

“What will the cost be when there are health impacts from an expanded compressor station?” Kinsella said. “My heart goes out to these working class folks along the main line route who, their land, their water, their livelihood, psychologically, has been just so beat up over the past 10 years in this fight.”

FERC is expected to make a decision on Southgate by the end of the year. The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) also is undergoing a water protection permit process that will assess streams and wetland impacts. A public hearing for the permit is scheduled Thursday night and a decision is expected Dec. 8.

Melanie Davenport, director of DEQ’s cross-media programs, said the agency has requested erosion and sediment stormwater protection plans, which would prevent loose dirt from washing into waterways.

FERC is expected to decide SSEP by February. Virginia DEQ’s also is reviewing and will have to approve two water quality permits for the project.

On behalf of Clean Wisconsin and the Natural Resources Defense Council, nonprofit environmental law firm Earthjustice filed a lawsuit against federal energy regulators on Tuesday. The Sierra Club is representing itself in the case.

In their petition for review, the groups asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to review a pair of orders that federal regulators issued earlier this year.

One order approved a plan by the Midwest grid operator — the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO — to expedite connecting new power plants to the Midwest grid. The other denied a rehearing on the plan.

When it was approved by federal regulators, MISO said the Expedited Resource Addition Study, or ERAS, process was designed to bring urgently needed generation resources online quickly in the face of “unprecedented” demand growth and increasing reliability challenges.

A spokesperson for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, declined to comment, saying the agency cannot discuss court proceedings.

In a statement, a spokesperson for MISO said the grid operator is aware of the suit and will continue to monitor court proceedings.

Environmental groups argue MISO’s fast-tracking process prioritizes fossil fuels over clean energy projects.

In a statement, Earthjustice attorney Ada Statler said federal regulators are letting grid operators, like MISO, “rewrite the rule book to the benefit of fossil fuel and data center companies.”

“FERC is sidelining cheaper clean energy projects, and allowing utilities to pass on the higher costs of methane gas to other customers, despite its legal mandate to ensure just and reasonable rates,” Statler stated.

Ciaran Gallagher, energy and air manager at Clean Wisconsin, said some clean energy projects have been waiting five years to be studied for connection by the grid operator, while the projects selected for the fast-track program get to essentially “skip the line.”

In September, MISO announced the first 10 projects selected for the ERAS program, which will eventually have a total of 68 projects. They included five natural gas plants, three solar projects, one wind and one battery project, accounting for 5.3 gigawatts.

Although the first round was evenly split between gas and renewable projects, Gallagher said natural gas will contribute far more megawatts to the grid than renewables.

The five renewable projects would account for about 974 megawatts. The natural gas projects accounted for about 4,300 megawatts, or about 4.3 gigawatts. For context, 1 gigawatt is enough to power 100 million LED lightbulbs, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

“At the end of the day, there is going to be considerably more gas added to our grid because of this process,” Gallagher said.

Utilities have said natural gas is critical for meeting spiking energy demand from data centers and other industrial development.

One of the first 10 projects selected is the Red Oak Ridge Energy Center, a more than 1-gigawatt natural gas plant proposed in the town of Paris in Kenosha County.

The developer behind the project is seeking approval from the state Public Service Commission to build the plant. Earlier this year, the developer said MISO’s fast-tracked interconnection process would not affect the timeline for state-level approval.

We Energies, the state’s largest electric utility, also applied for state approval to purchase the project from developer Invenergy, as part of a plan to add nearly 3 gigawatts of capacity to the grid in response to rising energy demand from data centers. That plan also included seven solar projects.

Gallagher said utilities are “doubling down” on natural gas instead of focusing on energy sources that don’t produce carbon emissions.

“MISO and utilities are stuck in an old mindset of how to operate the electricity system,” she said. “We are adding storage to our grid. We could add storage to our grid faster if MISO processed their normal queue and focused on that rather than creating a whole separate process.”",https://wislawjournal.com/files/2025/02/Scales-Depositphotos_6077491_XL-w.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 14:01:29.678370

I’m ready to work across the aisle to pass reforms that maintain essential safety and environmental protections while bringing predictability and speed to the process.

Federal and state agencies often conduct parallel reviews covering the same issues, generating thousands of pages while adding little new information.
We could establish a single coordinated review process led by one federal agency rather than forcing projects through redundant, parallel tracks.","A sentiment I consistently hear from constituents is that they no longer believe in government’s ability to do big things — not just to stake out bold ideas but to implement and deliver on them. On the major issues we face, from housing to energy production, there is growing consensus that we lack the ability to move quickly and at the scale needed to address the problems before us. They are not wrong.

In my district in California’s Central Valley, we see the need for massive investments in new water infrastructure to meet the needs of our growers and disadvantaged communities, yet we seem incapable of moving beyond the endless planning and discussion phases.

This was not always the case. The Central Valley as it exists today was built on a series of ambitious federal and state infrastructure projects that transformed the way water is transported throughout the state. Take, for instance, the C.W. Bill Jones Pumping Plant — a cornerstone of the Central Valley Project — which lifts water into the Delta-Mendota Canal and delivers roughly 3 million acre-feet of water each year to 32 water districts through a 117-mile aqueduct. Planning and construction for both the canal and the pumping plant began in 1947, and the system was operational just four years later.

A project like that today would struggle even to enter its initial planning phase within four years. A clear example is the Los Banos Creek Detention Project in western Merced County, a proposal to modernize an existing reservoir in my district that was originally built in the 1960s for flood control. The effort would expand its use to include active water storage, groundwater recharge, and conveyance — strengthening water reliability for farms, wildlife refuges, and disadvantaged communities while reducing flood risk. Supported by local water districts and federal partners alike, it is exactly the kind of practical, multi-benefit investment we should be able to deliver quickly.

But instead of being fast-tracked, the project, first proposed in 2012, has since wound its way through separate approval processes at the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, California Department of Water Resources and State Water Resources Control Board. This was in addition to rounds of state and federal conceptual, environmental, operational, and design reviews, as well as countless public hearings and other procedural hurdles.

All of this is required, even though the project simply improves operations at an existing facility. I am encouraged that construction has now started — but a non-controversial project that will take only six months to build shouldn’t require more than ten years of paperwork and red tape just to get shovels into the ground.

When I talk to colleagues in Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, I hear the same stories about infrastructure projects in their districts that are desperately needed but cannot seem to move forward. This is a problem of our own making, and it is within our capacity to fix it.

There are market forces at play, such as high interest rates and rising construction costs, but there are also countless ways government has made it harder to get projects approved and easier for them to get delayed or stuck in an endless cycle of review. These delays not only create uncertainty and lengthen the time it takes for projects to get built, but also add significant costs that make them either unnecessarily expensive or so prohibitively costly that they never get built.

I’m ready to work across the aisle to pass reforms that maintain essential safety and environmental protections while bringing predictability and speed to the process. The stakes are not theoretical for my constituents. California’s climate is delivering longer dry spells, bigger storms and earlier snowmelt.

Increased regulations are reducing water allocations and creating uncertainty for growers and communities alike. That volatility demands smarter conveyance, more groundwater recharge, and modernized storage. Instead, projects spend decade after decade in paperwork purgatory while families, farms, wildlife, and communities pay the price for inaction.

The core problem is process, not protection. Federal and state agencies often conduct parallel reviews covering the same issues, generating thousands of pages while adding little new information. Timelines stretch, costs soar, and opponents learn to “litigate the clock,” betting that delay will kill the project. Meanwhile, the environment doesn’t get healthier, and communities don’t get water security.

We can do better. A bipartisan effort to modernize our permitting system could restore both efficiency and trust. We could set clear, enforceable timelines for environmental review and permits — measured in months, not decades. We could establish a single coordinated review process led by one federal agency rather than forcing projects through redundant, parallel tracks. We could maintain strong oversight while placing reasonable limits on the timeframes and scope of legal challenges, so delay is no longer a tool for obstruction. And we could invest in the people and technology agencies need to meet these goals — digital permitting systems, expanded staff capacity, and modern tools that improve transparency and accountability.

Americans are losing faith in their government’s ability to take on big challenges and deliver real results, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Reforming how we build is one of the few areas where both parties already agree on the problem and the solution. By working together to fix our processes, we can save taxpayer dollars, strengthen our economy, and once again show that America can build great things for its people.

Trump, who has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and a “con job” has come to embody the opposition to progress on dealing with dangerous global heating.

Stiell said: “I’m not saying we’re winning the climate fight. But we are undeniably still in it, and we are fighting back. Here in Belém, nations chose unity, science and economic common sense. This year there has been a lot of attention on one country stepping back. But amid the gale-force political headwinds, 194 countries stood firm in solidarity – rock solid in support of climate cooperation.”

He pointed to one section of the Cop30 agreement: “The global transition towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development is irreversible and the trend of the future.” He argued: “This is a political and market signal that cannot be ignored.”

The summit began more than a fortnight ago with the leaders’ summit. The Brazilian hosts promised with early sunny optimism that it would finish on time, but as the negotiations went on the confusion and obvious divisions between parties grew, and the process looked close to collapse on Friday.

Overnight negotiations and compromise on all sides meant a deal could be agreed on Saturday. The summit produced decisions on dozens of issues, including a promise to triple adaptation funding to protect communities against climate impacts, an agreement for a just transition mechanism (JTM) and recognition of the rights of Indigenous people.

However, proposals to start planning roadmaps to transition away from fossil fuels and end deforestation were not agreed and were hived off to processes outside the UN to be pushed forward by coalitions of willing nations. The impacts of the food system – such as cattle in cleared tracts in the Amazon – were largely ignored.

The overall package was largely seen as incremental at best and far less than is needed to tackle the accelerating climate crisis. Jasper Inventor, a deputy programme director at Greenpeace International, said: “Cop30 started with a bang of ambition but ended with a whimper of disappointment. This was the moment to move from negotiations to implementation – and it slipped.”

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said progress was made but warned it was becoming more difficult to secure agreements. “Cops are consensus-based – and in a period of geopolitical divides, consensus is ever harder to reach,” he said. “I cannot pretend that Cop30 has delivered everything that is needed. The gap between where we are and what science demands remains dangerously wide.”

The EU commissioner for the environment, Wopke Hoekstra, echoed the sense of relief. “It is not perfect, but it is a huge step in the right direction. The EU stood united, fighting for ambition on climate action,” he posted on X, even though that unity was sorely tested.

Anna Åberg, of the thinktank Chatham House, said just reaching a deal was positive. “A ‘Cop collapse’ would have been a big and harmful blow at the end of a year already marked by serious challenges for international climate cooperation and multilateralism more broadly,” she said. “It is positive that a deal was reached in Belém, even if many will – legitimately – be disappointed with the level of ambition.”

But there was also deep frustration that although adaptation finance had been promised, the deadline had been pushed back to 2035. Mamadou Ndong Toure, the thematic lead for climate and resilience at Practical Action in Senegal, said: “Adaptation cannot be built on shrinking commitments; people on the frontline need predictable, accountable support and a clear path to act.”

Similarly, although Brazil styled Cop30 as the “Indigenous Cop” and the deal recognised for the first time Indigenous people’s land rights and knowledge as a fundamental climate solution, there were still concerns that participation was limited. “Despite being referred to as an Indigenous Cop … it became clear that Indigenous peoples continue to be excluded from the negotiations,” said Emil Gualinga, of the Kichwa Peoples of Sarayaku, Ecuador.

And there was frustration that the final text did not refer directly to fossil fuels. James Dyke, a climate scientist at the University of Exeter, said: “Despite the host’s best efforts, Cop30 will not even be able to get nations to agree to fossil fuel phase-out. This shameful outcome is the result of narrow self-interest and cynical politicking.”

After several years of these annual UN climate gatherings being held in authoritarian-led countries, there were bursts of colourful protest in Belém as civil society returned in force. A march with tens of thousands of protesters lit up the middle Saturday of the summit and activists made their voices heard in an otherwise, grey, sterile conference centre.

“From Indigenous-led demonstrations at the venue to the more than 70,000 people who marched in the streets, there was a palpable sense of momentum that I haven’t felt for years,” said Jamie Henn, the director of Fossil Free Media.

At least a path ahead remains, watchers concluded. Prof Michael Grubb, of University College London, said: “The damp squib of an outcome from Cop30 has underlined that a focus on the negative – phasing out of fossil fuels – is fraught with political obstacles. For the road to Cop31, the focus must be balanced by equal attention to the positive – the huge economic potential of accelerating the energy transition, and ways to help countries around the world benefit from renewables and electrification.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b66352c368f7781afabd57a57e70f6a73fbe8c8d/819_0_4221_3377/master/4221.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=583bbbdf7dd4fa51edca3492063de7b3",N,,2025-11-24 15:01:55.427276

Overturning the Endangerment Finding and the motor vehicle standards would put millions of people in harm’s way.","You may have seen the new study by the National Bureau of Economic Research – or, more likely, the New York Times story about it – that shows American homeowners are facing substantial and rapidly-rising home insurance premiums due to harms from climate-fueled extreme weather events.

The New York Times story, which includes state-by-state analysis, finds that rising premiums are placing severe financial burdens on Americans – doubling home insurance costs in some areas over the last several years, lowering home values by tens of thousands of dollars, and making it impossible for some Americans to purchase insurance at all.

This new reporting adds to a large and growing body of evidence showing that climate change is straining insurance, housing, and banking systems, and in turn posing financial risks to communities across the country.

At the same time Americans are facing these extensive and rising costs, the Trump administration has proposed to rescind EPA’s foundational Endangerment Finding – the bedrock determination that climate pollution harms public health and welfare – along with all of the climate pollution standards for motor vehicles that EPA has ever adopted. These reckless and deeply damaging actions will mean more pollution that is fueling extreme weather events, and thus even higher costs for Americans who are already facing runaway increases in home insurance premiums.

More pollution, more harm, higher costs

EDF’s analysis found that the Trump EPA’s proposed repeal of the Endangerment Finding and motor vehicle standards would result in as much as 18 billion more tons of climate-altering pollution as the cumulative emissions released mount over time. That’s the equivalent of three times the annual U.S. emissions today and would impose up to $3.9 trillion in climate harms on society.

Hundreds of thousands of Americans filed comments with EPA expressing strong opposition to the administration’s proposal to rescind the Endangerment Finding and the motor vehicle standards. Many of those comments underscored how it would only worsen the already high costs they are now suffering — including by raising insurance premiums.

Local, state, and federal elected representatives echoed their constituents’ concerns:

The S. Conference of Mayors and National League of Cities described how the extreme weather events are pushing up insurance premiums and contributing to falling home values.

The Mayor of Tacoma, Washington stated, “[the administration’s proposal] would lead to higher property and health insurance premiums that endanger the financial stability and health of families working day in and day out to achieve better outcomes.”

Eight members of Florida’s Congressional delegation similarly stated, “Thousands of Florida homeowners have seen their premiums double or triple in recent years. Climate risk is driving insurance companies to raise rates or withdraw from the state entirely – seven Florida insurers became insolvent between January 2022 and February 2023, disproportionately harming homeowners who are already struggling to make ends meet.”

The administration’s proposal will impose other significant costs on Americans

Rising insurance premiums and other extensive costs from climate-fueled extreme weather events are just one of the ways the administration’s proposal will make life more expensive for Americans.

It will also:

Raise gas prices – The Trump administration’s own analysis shows that the proposal will make gas more expensive, increasing gas prices by 25 cents per gallon in 2035 and 76 cents per gallon in 2050. The proposal will force Americans to spend up to $1.7 trillion more on gas.

Result in job losses: The administration’s Annual Energy Outlook analysis shows that repealing the Endangerment Finding and vehicle standards will cost 450,000 jobs across the nation by 2035. Those job losses have already begun to materialize as the administration has increased its attacks on clean energy and clean vehicles. EDF released a report last week documenting $25 billion in cancelled clean energy manufacturing investments thus far in 2025, with a loss of more than 34,000 anticipated jobs. In October alone, $3.9 billion in clean energy manufacturing projects were canceled and 6,700 anticipated jobs were lost.

Increase air pollution, harming health: The administration’s proposal would increase smog and soot-forming pollution that would lead to as many as 77,000 early deaths and 52 million more asthma attacks — health harms that would cost the nation as much as $260 billion.

If Trump EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin moves forward with this dangerous action, it would put more deadly pollution in our air and hit Americans in their pocketbooks with higher insurance, gas and healthcare costs. Overturning the Endangerment Finding and the motor vehicle standards would put millions of people in harm’s way.",https://blogs.edf.org/climate411/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2023/01/edf-logo-600-square.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 13:01:10.661008

RELATED: Megabill’s elimination of tax credits for clean energy projects could cost WA $8.7 billion","The group was charged with balancing Washington’s sustainability and economic growth goals. On Dec. 1, the workgroup will send its recommendations to Ferguson’s office, with one omission that has some conservationists concerned.

Data centers in Washington use sales-and-use tax breaks designed to incentivize companies to build in communities that could use an economic boost. Some on the workgroup wanted to make those requirements contingent on data center companies coming up with their own sources of clean power. The recommendation would also extend the tax break to data centers built across all of Washington.

The workgroup will not include the clean energy recommendation in its final report, a development first reported by Columbia Insight and confirmed by group member Zachariah Baker, policy director for NW Energy Coalition.

It’s the only one of the nine draft recommendations that won’t make the final cut. Baker wanted to see the clean energy generation requirement included in the final report, but ultimately voted against the recommendation because it is coupled with extending the tax breaks statewide.

RELATED: Washington's hydropower has created a data center boom. Some are concerned about its future

“Our perspective is that if there are going to be tax incentives, then there should be more requirements to try to move the data centers to a higher standard — encourage them to move towards a gold standard that would both protect the environment and protect communities,” Baker said.

That doesn’t mean data centers will have carte blanche to run on carbon power sources. The workgroup is still recommending data centers comply with Washington’s environmental laws, including one that requires all electricity generation in Washington state to be free of greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. But many are concerned those goals are unrealistic given the current pace of data center construction, and the massive energy it takes to run the facilities.

State law is also less clear on whether data centers can run on fossil fuels if they build their own plants instead of getting power from the grid. Some data center companies have signaled an interest in building their own natural gas plants. The NW Energy Coalition wants the state to clarify the rules.

RELATED: Data centers are booming. But there are big energy and environmental risks

“That was really important to us because of the energy demand that these data centers require,” Baker said. “They require massive amounts of energy, and if they're not using clean energy from the start and as soon as possible, that can threaten our ability to be able to meet our state's climate and clean energy goals if they're relying on fossil fuels instead of clean energy.”

Data centers and chip fabrication — both essential to AI — are expected to add anywhere from 2,200 to 4,800 average megawatts of electricity load across the Pacific Northwest by 2030, according to a report to the Washington Department of Revenue. Electric cars and home appliances are expected to add additional strain on the grid, too.

“ Just to put those numbers in context the city of Seattle uses about a thousand average megawatts to power Seattle,” Baker said. “So you're talking about two to four new potential Seattles by 2030.”

Baker hopes the recommendations will inform rule making and legislation as the state seeks to manage the data center boom. He’s still holding out hope for a policy solution that requires data center companies to generate their own clean power.

30%: Ford Suppliers Go To Court After Delayed EV Truck

Ford F-150 Lightning Concept Art

Nexteer and Swoboda Inc. aren't household names the way Ford Motor is, but they ""make"" your car just as much as any automaker does. They're two supplier companies, Chinese and German, respectively, who had a role in making Ford's upcoming full-size electric truck—the one thought to be an F-150 Lightning successor.

But like other aspects of Ford's EV plan, that truck has been pushed back until at least 2028. While Ford was an early mover in the modern EV space as it attempted to chase Tesla's lead with products like the Mustang Mach-E and Lightning, the Blue Oval brand has consistently struggled with EV profitability. Now, many of its original plans have been canceled or delayed, and it's largely resting its electric future on a new affordable EV platform that will yield a $30,000 pickup truck.

As a result, Swoboda is suing Nexteer in an attempt to recoup costs from the delayed truck project.

Here's more on the supplier fight from Crain's Detroit Business:

Swoboda Inc., a German supplier with a base 157 miles West of Detroit in the Grand Rapids suburb of Kentwood, sued its tier-one customer in August, seeking to recoup $3 million it said it incurred before Nexteer “suddenly and unilaterally” canceled the agreement.

Swoboda tooled up to supply Nexteer with cylindrical headers to be used in Ford’s P800 TE1 program, according to the lawsuit filed in Oakland County Circuit Court. The program codename refers to the Dearborn-based automaker’s next-gen full-size electric pickup truck, which was delayed until at least 2028.

Swoboda entered the supply deal in July 2023 and paid for $1.4 million of tooling and $1.2 million of machinery to make the components, according to the complaint, which said that Nexteer has not reimbursed the company.

Put more simply, Nexteer, the larger supplier company, is being sued by the smaller supplier company, Swoboda, which it contracted to make parts for that electric Ford. But with the truck being pushed back, Swoboda aims to get the money back that it spent getting ready for production.

While a fight between two supplier companies isn't the most exciting news around, it speaks volumes about how tricky it is for the entire industry to plan for EV demand, profitability and successful sales. More from that story:

Large tier-one suppliers can withstand program cancellations and delays, but not so for smaller parts makers, said Steven Wybo, senior managing director at Birmingham-based Riveron Consulting LLC.

“The next level of suppliers, under a billion dollars in revenue, those guys are desperate right now because if you had 10-15 percent of business tied up in BEV, and now it’s not launching, or is a fraction of the quoted volumes, you don’t have the luxury of the capital markets or a bunch of cash sitting around to weather it, so you’re getting aggressive,” Wybo said.

A few other supplier lawsuits have been filed for similar reasons, including when Stellantis axed its all-electric Ram truck. The point is, this is a precarious moment, and the fallout is widespread.

60%: Inside Mercedes-Benz's U.S. 'Product Offensive'

Mercedes-AMG GT XX concept smashes several distance records for EVs

I do have to hand it to Mercedes-Benz. While it's retrenching from the tepid reception to its original generation of EQ electric cars, it still has some impressive battery-powered options coming our way soon. And in the meantime, it's also paying the bills with stuff its customers want (more V8 engines) and fewer things they don't want (inexplicable four-cylinder plug-in hybrid AMGs that nobody asked for.)

Best of all, these new EV options aren't expected to be priced too differently from their gas counterparts. More on Mercedes' reset in the U.S. from Automotive News:

After seeing little return from its significant investment in an electric-only model line, Mercedes has moved to a powertrain-agnostic strategy. Starting with the next-generation CLA arriving in December, future models will be available with battery-only and hybrid powertrains.

“It’s not either-or; it’s both,” Chamberlain said, adding that Mercedes will price its EVs in the “same zip code” as their gasoline-powered counterparts. While pricing for the CLA EV has not been disclosed, Mercedes told retailers it will start at more than $48,000 with shipping.

[...] The highlight of the product presentation was a pair of battery-powered AMG models. The AMG GT, a four-door electric sports car riding on the AMG.EA platform, is scheduled to reach dealerships in late 2026.

According to retailers, the AMG GT is a performance beast, with more than 1,000 hp and a 0-to-60 time of 2.3 seconds. It will be powered by three axial flux e-motors that have about four times the power density of conventional radial motors.

“The car is going to be absolutely screaming,” one dealer said.

Supercars are great and all, but I'm rather excited for the new electric CLA-Class and GLC-Class.

90%: Geely Scores A Win As China's EV Market Hits An Inflection Point

China's advanced EV market will soon deal with the situation everyone saw coming: a slowdown after years of exponential growth, a consolidation among a glut of car brands and an end to government subsidies. There are over 100 Chinese car brands, but soon, we'll see who the long-term winners really are.

And the Geely Group—owner of Volvo, Polestar, Zeekr, Geely, Lynk & Co. and others—is netting out pretty well, even if some of those individual brands have their struggles right now. This is especially true of Zeekr, it would seem from the Wall Street Journal:

Geely Automobile delivered a strong third quarter despite stiff competition in its home market of China, with both net profit and revenue rising sharply, supported by effective cost controls and robust sales.

Net profit jumped 59% from a year earlier to 3.82 billion yuan, equivalent to $538.1 million, as revenue climbed 27% to 89.19 billion yuan, the Hangzhou-based automaker said Monday. Geely sold a total of 761,000 vehicles during the quarter, up 43% from the previous year.

The solid set of results comes as Geely has been gaining market share with its strong product offerings. The Chinese automaker has enjoyed rapid growth in sales volume this year, thanks to its wide product range and competitive pricing. The strong momentum prompted the company to raise its annual sales target by about 11% to 3 million vehicles.

Zeekr on Monday posted strong third-quarter sales, with total deliveries rising 12.5% to 140,195 units. Its revenue rose 9.1% to 31.56 billion yuan, and its gross margin improved to 19.2%.

In my experience, the Zeekr and Lynk & Co. EVs and hybrids are better cars than what we've seen from the brands Geely sells in the United States. Both brands are growing fast in Europe, too.

Ford promises that a lot of newer and better EV options are coming, but not until 2027 and 2028—barring any future delays. Given how fast the industry shifts these days, that's both very soon and eons away. Until then, the Lightning and Mach-E will have to carry the day, it seems. Was that the right move, or should Ford have kept some new options coming until then, like most of its competitors?

This review brings together the latest research to evaluate whether sodium-ion batteries can genuinely support or replace lithium-ion batteries in the EV sector.","Sodium-ion batteries are quickly gaining attention as a more affordable and eco-friendly alternative to lithium-ion batteries especially for personal electric vehicles. This overview breaks down the latest progress in sodium-ion technology, covering everything from electrode materials to electrolyte systems, safety improvements, and real-world performance.

Sodium is far more abundant and geographically widespread than lithium, making it cheaper, easier to source, and more environmentally sustainable. On top of that, sodium-ion batteries offer better thermal safety and perform reliably across a wide temperature range.

Still, they're not perfect. Lower energy density, shorter cycle life, and underdeveloped supply chains remain challenges. But ongoing innovations—like high-voltage cathodes, hard carbon anodes, and advanced polymer electrolytes—are steadily improving performance.

This review explores whether sodium-ion batteries can realistically replace, or at least complement, lithium-ion batteries in EVs. By comparing both technologies, we uncover how sodium-ion advancements could help meet future energy storage demands while reducing dependence on scarce lithium resources.

Introduction

Electric vehicles (EVs) are a major step toward reducing global emissions, and their performance largely depends on the batteries powering them. Today, lithium-ion batteries dominate the EV landscape because they deliver high energy density and have been commercially optimized for years.

But lithium-ion technology isn't without issues. Lithium mining raises ethical and environmental concerns, and the global lithium supply chain is vulnerable to price fluctuations and geopolitical tensions. This has sparked interest in alternatives—and sodium-ion batteries are one of the most promising candidates.

Sodium is far more abundant, evenly distributed, and stable than lithium. Plus, sodium-ion batteries share similar electrochemistry with lithium-ion batteries, making them compatible with existing battery manufacturing processes. Their lower energy density is still a drawback, but sodium-ion technology can complement lithium-ion batteries or even replace them in certain EV segments, especially where cost and safety are priorities.

This review brings together the latest research to evaluate whether sodium-ion batteries can genuinely support or replace lithium-ion batteries in the EV sector.

Sodium vs. Lithium: How Do They Stack Up?

Lithium-ion batteries have decades of development behind them, with billions invested in research, factories, and supply chains. But the world's growing demand for lithium, combined with geopolitical instability, is prompting companies to explore alternatives.

Lithium-Ion: The Current Standard

Lithium-ion batteries are popular for good reasons:

High energy density: 250-300 Wh/kg

Long cycle life: 500-1000 cycles

Low self-discharge

These strengths make them ideal for smartphones, laptops, and EVs. However, there are downsides:

Safety issues: They use flammable electrolytes that can cause thermal runaway

Capacity fade: Cathodes degrade over time, causing 12-24% loss

Geopolitical risks: A large share of lithium comes from regions like Chile, where policy changes can impact global supply and pricing

Lithium carbonates have seen extreme price swings—from $6,000 per ton (2020) to $70,000+ (2022)—before stabilizing between $10,000-$25,000 in 2024.

Sodium-Ion: The Rising Contender

Sodium-ion batteries offer several advantages:

Elemental abundance: Sodium is ~1,000 times more common than lithium

Lower cost: Sodium-ion cells currently cost $80-$110 per kWh, cheaper than lithium-ion

Better thermal stability: More resistant to overheating

Wider temperature range: Works from -30°C to 60°C

On the flip side, sodium-ion batteries still struggle with:

Lower energy density: 100-160 Wh/kg

Shorter cycle life

Immature recycling and supply chains

Companies like CATL and Faradion are driving large-scale development, but sodium-ion capacity remains far behind lithium.

Cathode Innovations: Boosting Sodium-Ion Performance

Cathodes play a huge role in determining a battery's energy density and stability. Researchers are exploring several promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries:

High-Voltage Fluorophosphates (A₂MPO₄F)

These materials deliver:

300 mAh/g capacity

Over 1,000 Wh/kg energy density

Operating voltage ≥5V

They are considered next-generation cathode candidates, though synthesis processes are still being optimized.

Sodium Vanadium Phosphate (Na₃V₂(PO₄)₃)

Strengths:

Stable structure

Fast sodium diffusion

Weakness:

Poor conductivity (improved through carbon coating, doping, and porous structures)

Sulfate-Based Cathodes (Na₂Fe₂(SO₄)₃)

These offer high voltage and use abundant elements—making them low-cost and sustainable.

Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs)

PBAs are one of the hottest areas of research thanks to:

Open frameworks for fast Na⁺ movement

Good cycling capability

Low cost

However, they face challenges like:

Structural instability

Water content issues

Vacancy formation

Scientists are addressing these issues using coatings, defect engineering, and doping (e.g., K⁺, Ni, Co, Cu, Cr).

Anode Advancements: Making Sodium Storage More Efficient

Anodes determine how much charge a battery can store and how long it lasts. Sodium-ion anode research focuses on improving cycle life, capacity, and structural stability.

Transition Metal Sulfides (e.g., WS₂)

Pros:

Very high theoretical capacity

Cons:

Large volume expansion during cycling

Low conductivity

Solutions include nanostructuring and carbon-based composites.

Phosphorus-Based Anodes (e.g., Black Phosphorus)

Pros:

Very high capacity

Cons:

Severe volume changes

Researchers are testing nanoscale designs and carbon hybrids to stabilize them.

Carbon-Based Anodes (Hard & Soft Carbon)

These are currently the most commercially viable sodium-ion anodes.

Hard Carbon

Capacity: 250-400 mAh/g

Stores sodium through adsorption, interlayer intercalation, and nanopore filling

Flexible structure helps keep cycling performance stable

Soft Carbon

Lower capacity (150-250 mAh/g)

Can be enhanced through nitrogen doping or conductive additives

Graphite, commonly used in lithium-ion batteries, doesn't work well for sodium because its interlayer spacing is too small.

Electrolytes: Ensuring Smooth Sodium Transport

Electrolytes allow sodium ions to move between electrodes. Several types exist, each with benefits and limitations.

Liquid Electrolytes

Pros:

High ionic conductivity

Fast charging

Excellent electrode compatibility

Example: NaPF₆

Cons:

Flammable organic solvents

Higher risk of thermal runaway

Solid-State Electrolytes

Pros:

Non-flammable

Safe and stable

No leakage

Typical conductivity: 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻³ S/cm (lower than liquids)

Newer ceramics and sulfides are improving conductivity and stability.

Polymer Electrolytes

Pros:

Lightweight, flexible, easy to process

No leakage

Good safety profile

Cons:

Lower room-temperature conductivity

Gels (GPEs) and solid polymer systems (SPEs) are being enhanced with nanofillers like SiO₂ and TiO₂.

Composite Electrolytes

Hybrid systems combining polymers + ceramics offer the best of both:

High ionic conductivity

Good flexibility

Better thermal stability

These are emerging as a strong candidate for future sodium-ion EV batteries.",https://www.altenergymag.com/images/facebooknews.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 13:01:07.505729

Surging electricity demand — fueled by manufacturing growth, artificial intelligence data centers and population shifts — threatens grid reliability.

The average U.S. household spent about $142 a month on electricity in 2024, with some states paying far more.

The Energy Department said in July that 100 times as many blackouts could darken communities by 2030 if the country keeps shutting down power plants without building new ones.

The administration has taken several steps to deliver on Trump's campaign promise to strengthen the grid.

What the administration has done

In April, Trump signed an executive order directing the Energy Department to protect the electric grid by:

Using emergency powers faster and more often. The order directs the department to streamline orders under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act. That means the department should issue emergency orders faster when the power grid is at risk — to keep certain power plants running during extreme weather, for example.

Finding where the grid is weakest. The department must create a uniform method to figure out which parts of the country face the highest risk of outages or blackouts.

Speeding up construction and approvals. The order tells federal agencies to accelerate permitting for energy projects, such as new transmission lines or power plant upgrades.

The order also requires the department to ""systemize and expedite"" emergency orders and to measure how close each region is to running out of power. In July, the department issued Section 202(c) orders in some states to keep certain oil- and coal-fired units operating through seasonal peaks.

The White House said the order is necessary to shore up reliability.

Pushback and legal challenges

The Energy Department's use of emergency power has triggered legal challenges. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, petitioned the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to review an Energy Department order that forced the J.H. Campbell coal plant in the state to stay open past its planned retirement. Nessel said ratepayers will bear heavy costs as a result.

A 17-state coalition also sued the administration over energy-policy actions it says favor fossil fuels over renewables, arguing that the federal government is undermining state autonomy.

Both cases are pending.

Some energy-efficiency advocates also see a contradiction between the administration's rhetoric about modernizing the grid and rolling back conservation standards.

Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, a group that advocates for energy-efficiency standards, said one of the best ways to protect the grid is to use conservation policies that reduce energy waste.

""The administration has proposed to weaken those standards for more than a dozen products,"" deLaski said, ""and that takes us in precisely the wrong direction.""

Our ruling

Trump promised to modernize U.S. electric grid systems to improve reliability and reduce costs. His April 8 executive order and the Energy Department's follow-up mark the first major steps toward that goal, expanding federal emergency powers and launching grid assessments.

But large-scale construction and permanent modernization funding have yet to materialize. We will revisit this promise as the administration's grid program develops. For now, this promise remains In the Works.",https://static.politifact.com/CACHE/images/politifact/photos/AP18226660099611/6b6307ee2341223e86ec5d0f5d9848a1.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 11:04:09.519608

Pradera represents an important innovation in Colombia’s energy transition through the integration of a battery energy storage system (BESS).
By enabling more stable and predictable power output, Pradera will enhance grid reliability and support greater penetration of solar energy in Colombia’s national electricity system.","Climate Fund Managers (CFM), a climate-focused blended finance investment manager operating in emerging markets across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and Erco Energía, a leading Colombian renewable energy developer, with support from the EU, has announced the inauguration of the Pétalo del Norte I solar power plant in northern Colombia and development funding for the neighbouring Pradera solar-plus-storage plant.

The milestones mark continued progress in the partners’ long-term collaboration to develop a portfolio of solar projects that will expand and diversify Colombia’s renewable energy capacity, supporting the country’s transition to a cleaner, more resilient power system. The innovative character of this initiative also lies in how the support of EU public funding serves to de-risk and unlock an exponentially larger volume of private investment.

Pétalo del Norte I, located between Cesar and Norte de Santander, is CFM’s first project to reach commercial operations in Latin America. Developed in partnership with Erco Energía and implemented by Andina Solar, the 26.4 MWdc (19.9 MWac) fixed-tilt solar PV facility generates more than 45 GWh of clean energy annually, avoiding an estimated 13 276 tpy of CO2 emissions and serving approximately 32 600 people. Interconnection is through a 1.2 km aerial line at 34.5 kV. The project created 270 jobs, 64% of which were filled by local workers, with women repre-senting 30% of the workforce.

CFM invested close to US$20 million in both development capital and construction funding through its EU-supported renewable energy infrastructure fund, Climate Investor One (CIO). The project benefits from a 15-year power purchase agreement with an independent energy trader, providing long-term revenue stability.

Through its US$125 000 Community Development Programme, Pétalo del Norte I is delivering targeted social investments across four neighbouring communities – La Pedregosa, La Fragua, La Raya, and Palmichal. Developed in partnership with local leaders, the programme supports education, access to clean water, women’s empowerment, and rural enterprise development. Initiatives include upgrading community infrastructure, promoting youth development through sport, and strengthening local leadership and business skills, benefiting an estimated 2400 people.

CFM has invested US$1.5 million in development funding from Climate Investor One to support the development of a second solar facility in the region. Located on adjacent land, the Pradera solar-plus-storage plant will add 40 MWac of solar capacity and 18 MWh of battery storage, making it the largest installation of its kind in Colombia. Once operational, Pradera will generate over 95.8 GWh/y of clean energy, avoiding approximately 129 000 t of CO2 emissions and supplying power to approximately 71 000 people. The project is expected to create approximately 380 jobs during construction and 29 permanent positions in operation. A dedicated Community Development Programme will be implemented in consultation with local stakeholders to support neighbouring communities.

Pradera represents an important innovation in Colombia’s energy transition through the integration of a battery energy storage system (BESS). Designed to smooth short-term fluctuations in solar generation, the BESS will help manage grid imbalances and limit exposure to the country’s high-cost spot market during dry periods, including El Niño events. By enabling more stable and predictable power output, Pradera will enhance grid reliability and support greater penetration of solar energy in Colombia’s national electricity system.

Both projects were enabled by CFM’s blended finance model, which combines public and private capital to balance risk, lower financing costs and accelerate project delivery. CFM invests across the project lifecycle, from development to construction and operation, avoiding the complexity and long timelines associated with traditional project finance.

Juan Paez, Head of Latin America at Climate Fund Managers, said: “Access to capital for climate infrastructure remains one of the main barriers to achieving Colombia’s 2050 net zero ambition. Our partnership with Erco Energía, supported by the EU, shows how blended finance can help bridge that gap – unlocking investment for projects that strengthen energy security and accelerate the clean energy transition. With Pétalo del Norte now operational and Pradera in development, we are building a solar platform that will deliver sustainable growth across the country.”

Alberto Menghini, Head of Cooperation at the EU Delegation in Colombia, added: “The EU is Colombia’s main energy transition partner, not only through Foreign Direct Investments, but also through financial mechanisms such as CFM’s Climate Investor One Fund. Under the Global Gateway, CFM´s blended finance model strategically leverages funding from public institutions like the EU and other European partners to de-risk projects and mobilise private capital. This approach enables transformative initiatives such as Pétalo del Norte I and Pradera, which strengthen and diversify Colombia’s energy mix while creating local jobs and opportunities. At scale, such partnerships can make a significant contribution to regional development and global climate goals.”

Juan Camilo López, CEO and Co-Founder of Erco Energía, commented: “Expanding solar generation is essential to strengthen Colombia’s energy security and resilience. Together with CFM, we are demonstrating how partnerships that combine local expertise with international investment and experience can accelerate that shift – delivering reliable, affordable energy while creating lasting economic and social value for nearby communities.”

EVERYONE LOVES TO HATE: A shared enemy is always a great way to make friends. Both President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani agreed in their surprising congenial appearance that Con Edison, the utility that serves electric and gas customers in the city, should lower its costs. The company reacted defensively as its stock dropped after hours — regulatory risk is a major concern for investors.

“Con Edison powers the economic engine of our country by delivering the most reliable energy to more than 9 million people who live, work, and travel through New York City every day,” Con Ed spokesperson Anne Marie Corbalis said in a statement. “We recognize affordability is a critical issue and work every day to balance the investments needed for resilience and reliability with customer costs.”

Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has bashed Con Ed in the past. The DSA generally supports public takeovers of utilities — something other Democrats have flirted with in the past, including former Mayor Bill de Blasio. Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo threatened to revoke Con Ed’s franchise after high-profile outages and Gov. Kathy Hochul slammed the utility’s latest rate hike proposal.

Con Ed’s rates are regulated by the state Public Service Commission, which is considering another rate increase for the utility’s customers. It’s a more modest revenue increase —roughly 3 percent each year for electric and 2 percent for gas each year for three years — than Con Ed initially sought.

Mamdani’s campaign didn’t respond to questions about his position on that rate plan when it was announced.

One major lever Mamdani has that could influence Con Ed’s rates? The $3 billion in property taxes the company expects to pay in 2026. The utility has long sought to address that cost, which it passes along to customers. As Con Ed invests more in its infrastructure to address electrification and growing demand, those assets add to the company’s tax bill from the city.

Mamdani didn’t have any specifics on how he’d tackle utility costs when asked on Sunday. — Marie J. French

What you may have missed

DEMS’ CLIMATE DIVIDE — POLITICO’s Marie J. French and Mona Zhang: A dividing line is forming over New York’s ambitious climate goals and Gov. Kathy Hochul’s affordability push. And state Democrats are starting to take sides.

Hochul signaled that she’s open to changing the state’s landmark 2019 law requiring massive emissions cuts after a judge ruled her administration must issue regulations to achieve its targets. She has steered the state toward an “all of the above” energy policy as she focuses on affordability and reliability concerns ahead of a tough reelection next year.

And her latest actions — approving a pipeline and a gas power plant permit, plus delaying a mandate to electrify new buildings — have raised the ire of environmental advocates and progressive lawmakers, who warn years of progress are at risk.

CROSS-BRONX MOVES FORWARD: New York State Department of Transportation released its environmental assessment for a project to rehabilitate the Cross-Bronx Expressway, which has drawn concern from community advocates.

The department “is committed to working with the community and our local partners to reimagine the entire Cross Bronx Expressway corridor and this project is an important step toward that goal,” NYSDOT Commissioner Marie Therese Dominguez said in a statement. — Mona Zhang

ALL PROPOSALS REJECTED: Members of PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator that covers more than a dozen Eastern states including New Jersey, on Wednesday rejected 12 proposals on how to handle its interconnection process for data centers.

The PJM member committee voted as part of the regional grid operator’s Critical Issue Fast Path process for addressing urgent issues. In August, the PJM Board of Managers initiated the CIFP process to respond to increasing demand driven by data centers.

While the member committee vote is advisory, it is supposed to guide decision-making at the PJM Board of Managers, which will have a final say on rules for large load interconnections.

The vote “should tell us a lot about how PJM members are feeling the mounting pressure from governors and consumer advocates in the public,” said Seth Nelson, a spokesperson for Evergreen Action, which supports three proposals that would have strong ratepayer protections. “None of them really wanted to be on the record, potentially voting for a plan that could ultimately raise bills significantly for millions of households.”

The details: The member committee considered a wide range of proposals on Wednesday, including ones from consumer advocates and state lawmakers to a data center trade group and energy companies.

It’s unclear when the board will make a decision on the matter, but it has stated that it wants to decide on rules to submit to FERC next month in hopes of having them in place for the June 2026 capacity auction. — Mona Zhang

PLUG POWER PLAY — POLITICO’s Marie J. French: An unprofitable Latham, N.Y.-based hydrogen company has a potentially valuable electric substation on its balance sheet that it’s looking to unload.

Plug Power has abandoned plans for a green hydrogen plant in upstate New York that were announced in 2021. But the company sees an opportunity to recover some of its roughly $100 million investment thanks to the latest hot energy trend: data centers for artificial intelligence workloads.

“We kind of came to the conclusion that the better value for us was selling the electricity rights,” said Andy Marsh, Plug Power’s outgoing CEO

ADVOCATES SUE OVER NESE PERMITS — POLITICO’s Mona Zhang: A coalition of environmental advocates filed lawsuits Tuesday over New Jersey and New York’s decisions to grant water quality permits for Williams Transco’s Northeast Supply Enhancement pipeline.

The project still poses the same risks to the environment as it did in prior years when both the New York Department of Environmental Conservation and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection denied water quality permits for the pipeline, advocates argue.

MAYORS FOR CLIMATE SUPERFUND: A bipartisan group of more than 100 New Jersey mayors and elected officials — including Newark’s Democratic Mayor Ras Baraka, Madison’s Republican Mayor Robert Conley and Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill, a Democrat who is also running for Congress — is pushing state lawmakers to pass a “climate superfund” bill to collect billions of dollars from coal, gas and oil companies to pay for climate change-related damage.

The bill has cleared a committee apiece in the Assembly and Senate. A similar law in New York is being challenged in court.

“As a bipartisan group of local elected officials, we all know the adage: ‘There is no Republican or Democratic pothole,’” the elected officials wrote. “Today, we write to say there are no blue or red floods or heat waves. Every community in New Jersey is experiencing the growing costs of climate impacts, from increased flooding and heat waves.”

One of the mayors who signed the letter, Hoboken’s Ravi Bhalla, will hold a related press conference with other officials, including state Sen. John McKeon, who sponsored the bill, at 11 a.m. Wednesday at the Atlantic City Convention Center during the New Jersey League of Municipalities Annual Conference. — Ry Rivard

BYOG: HOCHUL FAVORS DATA CENTERS BRINGING NEW ENERGY — Gov. Kathy Hochul prefers data centers bring their own new clean source of energy to hook up to New York’s grid, she indicated at a press conference last Monday. She also floated the idea of new large data centers supporting small nuclear reactors.

A surge in large energy requests, primarily linked to data centers, has led to a forecasted potential energy shortfall in the coming decade, according to the independent grid operator. Hochul has embraced artificial intelligence as a potential economic development driver and generally prioritized meeting the energy needs of industries coming to New York. She’s expressed more openness to natural gas power and new nuclear, alongside renewables and storage, to increase the electricity supply.

“They are drains on the grid, so I am open to [data] centers that can demonstrate their own independent source,” Hochul said after being asked about the impacts of data centers. “Some are building near plants that have been shut down and they’ll generate clean energy from them — that gets my attention more.”

It’s akin to a concept dubbed “bring your own generation.” The Trump administration has also expressed support for having data centers build their own power supply. Policymakers in New York and across the country are concerned that the surging demand from AI could increase electricity prices for consumers. A bill proposed in New York would require data centers to get some of their power from renewables. — Marie J. French

SENATE REPUBLICANS CALL FOR REPEAL OF BUILDINGS MANDATE: Fresh off a victory as Gov. Kathy Hochul delayed the state’s all-electric building mandate, Senate Republicans are now calling for a special legislative session to repeal the measure altogether. Hochul this month paused implementation of the prohibition on gas stoves and furnaces for new single-family homes and other small buildings.

“Governor Hochul must move farther than the pause to protect New Yorkers by fully repealing this mandate,” said Republican Sen. Mario Mattera, ranking member on the Energy Committee. “Short of that, this could seemingly be undone like the bait-and-switch she foisted on the residents with congestion pricing and that is unacceptable.”

The requirement was part of the state’s building code set to go into effect in January. Her spokesperson said the delay — for at least 120 days after a decision on the appeal of a lawsuit challenging the measure — would provide more certainty for homebuilders. The state had won the initial court case defending the law in a lower federal court and fought an injunction in court filings just weeks earlier.

Senate Republicans called for a delay on the all-electric building requirement in early October. Shortly after, Assembly Democrats started circulating a letter asking the governor to delay and Hochul said she was considering it. — Marie J. French

$1+ TRILLION IN PROFITS: Frustrated with Gov. Kathy Hochul’s shift on climate and energy policy, advocates and lawmakers are pushing the governor to consider ending taxpayer subsidies for oil companies.

A new analysis of eight oil companies, including Saudi Aramco, ExxonMobil and Shell, found that the major oil companies have raked in $1.2 trillion since 2021, according to the nonprofit research organization New York Public Interest Research Group.

Lawmakers and climate advocates are pushing Hochul to support legislation to repeal some oil industry tax subsidies.

“We’re talking about affordability all the time now,” environmental advocate Bill McKibben told reporters last week. “How on earth can a strapped New York state be giving handouts to the richest companies on the face of the planet?”

A bill sponsored by state Sen. Liz Krueger and Assemblymember Jo Anne Simon, would repeal about $350 million of $1.8 billion in oil subsidies. — Mona Zhang

Six proposed exemptions would narrow reporting obligations for many manufacturers

Shrinking the reporting window could create timing pressures

The EPA is seeking input on de minimis levels, reporting thresholds, and study submission requirement

On November 13, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed revisions to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) PFAS Reporting Rule that would substantially narrow reporting obligations and significantly accelerate the timeline for data submissions. The proposal introduces six exemptions, shortens the submission period to three months, advances the start date, and provides several technical corrections and clarifications. The EPA maintains that the changes—particularly the exemptions—will reduce industry costs and avoid duplicative reporting requirements. Businesses should assess how the proposal impacts their reporting obligations and consider submitting comments before the December 29, 2025 deadline.

TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule

Promulgated in October 2023, the TSCA PFAS reporting rule requires manufacturers, including importers and small manufacturers, to electronically report per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) data for any year from 2011 through 2022, including information on use, production volumes, disposal, exposures, and hazards.

Previous Delays and Public Comments

The EPA has twice delayed the reporting deadline.

When announcing the interim final rule in May 2025, the EPA also stated that it may reopen certain aspects of the rule to public comment, citing concerns about overburdening small businesses and article importers. In response, stakeholders requested exemptions—for example, for article importers and for de minimis PFAS concentrations—and sought clarification on the “known or reasonably ascertainable” due diligence standard and concerns about the Central Data Exchange (CDX) data submission platform.

On August 29, 2025, the EPA sent a proposed revision to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review. The proposal was expected to be published in December 2025, with a final rule anticipated in June 2026.

Proposed Exemptions and Other Changes

In the proposed rule, the EPA introduced six exemptions:

PFAS manufactured or imported in mixtures or articles at concentrations below 0.1% (de minimis exemption).

PFAS imported as part of an “article” (defined in 40 C.F.R. 704.3).

PFAS solely manufactured as “byproducts” (as described in 40 C.F.R. 720.30(h)) and not used commercially.

PFAS present as an “impurity” (defined in 40 C.F.R. 704.3).

Non-isolated intermediates.

PFAS manufactured or imported in small quantities solely for research and development (R&D).

The EPA stated that these exemptions are intended to align with the TSCA Chemical Data Reporting Rule (40 C.F.R. 711), with the addition of the de minimis exemption, which would apply regardless of total production volume of the mixture or article. The EPA also indicated it may consider future data requests for R&D chemicals if necessary.

The EPA also proposed adjustments to the reporting schedule. Under the proposal, the submission period will begin 60 days after the effective date of the final rule and last for three months. Because of the proposed exemption for article importers, the EPA would remove the later deadline for small manufacturers reporting exclusively as article importers. The agency explained that given the time that has passed since the 2023 rule was issued, reporting entities have had “adequate time” to prepare.

Additionally, the EPA proposed a few technical corrections to clarify what must be reported in certain fields, including clarifications on the scope of environmental and health effects information and updates to product category names.

Reasons for the Proposed Changes

The EPA stated that the main reasons for the proposed changes are to reduce compliance costs and burdens on industry and avoid unnecessary or duplicative reporting. The agency emphasized that the proposed exemptions are the “primary purpose” of the proposed rule. The EPA’s goal is to exempt “reporting on activities about which manufacturers are least likely to know or reasonably ascertain” and to apply reporting obligations to only those persons likely to have information relevant to the effective implementation of the TSCA. The EPA estimates cost savings of $786 million – $843 million, based on a reduction of 10 million – 11 million hours. The EPA also reasoned that it may defer collecting certain information until there is “a clear role” for that information to support an agency mission.

What Did Not Change

The proposed rule would not disturb several other key elements of the existing rule, including:

The lookback period (January 1, 2011 – December 31, 2022).

The definition of PFAS.

The specific data required to be reported.

The “known or reasonably ascertainable” due diligence standard.

EPA’s Request for Public Comment

The 45-day comment period is open through December 29, 2025.

The EPA requested public comment on certain issues, including:

Whether the de minimis exemption should be 1.0% rather than the proposed 0.1%, or another appropriate level.

Potential ways to consolidate the proposed exemptions while providing relief.

Whether to continue requiring full study reports under 40 C.F.R. 705.15(f) or to allow “robust study summaries” with full study reports available upon EPA request.

Whether reportable chemicals should be limited to PFAS with a Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CASRN), TSCA Accession Number, or Low-Volume Exemption Number.

Whether to add a production volume threshold below which reporting on a given PFAS would not be required (e.g., 2,500 lbs.) and what threshold would be appropriate.

Whether any assumptions or cost savings calculations in the EPA’s economic analysis should be revised.

Impact on Industry

The proposed exemptions heed long-standing industry requests to ease burdens and would minimize compliance costs for certain PFAS in imported articles; in de minimis concentrations; as impurities, byproducts, and non-isolated intermediates; and for R&D uses.

At the same time, the accelerated submission period would introduce a near-term compliance burden. Instead of a six-month reporting period beginning April 13, 2026, companies would have only three months, starting 60 days after the final rule’s effective date, likely mid-2026. Although the EPA maintains that businesses have had “adequate time” to prepare, the proposed changes will require businesses to act quickly in preparing their data for submission. The condensed reporting schedule also raises concerns about whether the CDX platform is prepared to receive large amounts of data from many reporting entities in a short period.

The EPA also signaled a willingness to consider and potentially incorporate stakeholder input. Five of the six proposed exemptions were included in a May 2, 2025 petition by a coalition of chemical companies submitted to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. That letter also suggested several changes the EPA specifically sought further public comment on, such as the production volume threshold and the option to provide robust study summaries in lieu of full study reports. Although the agency decided not to propose a production volume threshold as suggested in stakeholder feedback, the EPA indicated that it was still “amenable” to comments on the potential benefits and drawbacks of providing one.

Businesses should consider submitting public comments in an effort to help shape the final rule, including on the proposed exemptions, the adjusted data submission period, or the technical clarifications. Stakeholders may also find it beneficial to focus on the issues the EPA specifically sought input on, such as the appropriate de minimis level and whether alternatives to full study reports should be allowed.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15546_5043.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 11:03:48.088760

A highlight of the ACEF session was the presentation by Changzhou Power Supply Company of the State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Co., Ltd., which unveiled its ""Electric-Steam Cube"" solution. Designed to address the industrial dilemma of securing steam power that is sufficient, low-cost, and low-carbon, the technology offers a powerful engine for industrial green transformation.

The ""Electric-Steam Cube"" innovatively integrates three energy sources: photovoltaics (PV), off-peak electricity, and industrial waste heat. Utilizing electrode boilers and high-temperature heat pumps, the system produces steam at temperatures between 120 and 160 degrees Celsius.

To overcome the challenge of energy intermittency, the company developed large-scale thermal storage tanks. These tanks use high pressure to condense steam into water for storage; when needed, the pressure is released to revert the water to steam. The system achieves an energy conversion efficiency of over 95 percent, ensuring a continuous, stable, and flexible supply of clean steam.

Beyond the technology, the company introduced a collaborative business model combining ""technology licensing and construction investment."" By uniting energy service companies, equipment manufacturers, and energy consumers, the model has accelerated the large-scale adoption of clean energy technology.

To date, 118 of these models have been deployed across eight provinces in China, generating direct economic benefits of 830 million RMB. Environmental metrics are equally impressive: the system reduces carbon dioxide emissions in the steam production process by over two-thirds and completely eliminates sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.

Furthermore, the cost of the system is only one-sixth that of electrochemical energy storage. It functions as a flexible composite resource capable of responding within 30 seconds to absorb fluctuating PV power, thereby enhancing the stability of new power systems.

Second, when it comes to new data centers, Michigan’s major utilities and the MPSC have yet to give clean energy requirements the attention they deserve.","It’s been a busy few weeks for the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC). Late on Halloween, electric utility DTE filed an application seeking expedited, ex parte approval of a contract with a data center requesting 1.4 gigawatt (GW) of electricity, in a deal which had been announced by Governor Whitmer’s office the day before. This electricity demand, equivalent to over a million homes, would increase the utility’s load by 25%. With its ex parte filing, DTE is seeking direct approval from the commission without an opportunity for advocates like UCS to intervene.

Less than a week later, the MPSC issued an order in a docket filed by another major utility, Consumers Energy, seeking changes to the terms and conditions which apply to data centers and other large loads. As I discussed in my last blog, UCS intervened in the case with a coalition of clean energy organizations that recommended several ways that data centers could support Michigan’s efforts to provide reliable, clean, and affordable electricity.

While the MPSC agreed broadly with our analysis and showed progress on cost protections, major gaps remain to ensure grid reliability and meeting clean energy requirements. Nevertheless, the details in the MPSC’s order give UCS and other advocates several potential avenues to pursue in future cases, including the current DTE filing.

In this blog, I’ll pull out some key points from both cases and share some next steps we’ll be working on as we continue to fight for reliable, clean, and affordable electricity for all Michiganders.

Case 1: Consumers Energy sought basic financial protections

In February, Consumers Energy filed an application to establish new requirements for data centers, including:

Significant load changes must be coordinated with the utility.

Contracts must be at least 15 years and include minimum billing amounts.

Large loads must pay for any infrastructure upgrades they trigger.

Upfront fees will be charged to increase transparency and discourage speculative projects.

While these measures support affordability for all utility customers, they also benefit the company’s bottom line. Consumers Energy is an investor-owned, for-profit utility that earns a guaranteed profit on capital investments, so the company is highly motivated to attract data centers which will require spending on new infrastructure. And the proposed requirements protect shareholder profits, in addition to protecting other customers.

UCS argued for clean energy and reliability

In testimony and briefs, our Michigan coalition argued that these terms did not go far enough, advocating for three additional measures to support affordability, reliability, and emissions reductions:

Data centers should bring their own clean energy.

The interconnection process should be reformed to prioritize data centers that provide load flexibility and on-site clean energy.

Utilities should regularly report on whether data centers are fulfilling the above requirements.

For more details on our recommendations and the rationale behind each, check out my last blog on Michigan’s data center debate.

The commission’s order did not go far enough

After considering testimony, exhibits, cross-examination, and briefs from over a dozen parties to the case, the MPSC issued a final order on November 6.

The order generally approved Consumers Energy’s requested terms, with some added reporting requirements based in part on our recommendations. Affordability was handled through new requirements addressing cost allocation in future filings. In a major disappointment, the commission failed to take up clean energy requirements or interconnection reform.

Affordability protections were strengthened

Cost allocation determines whether the specific rate that data centers pay for electricity covers all their costs, or if some of those costs will be shifted to other customers. The order explains: “A core tenet of ratemaking is that customers are responsible for the costs they impose on the system and the costs required to serve them. Residential, commercial, and other industrial customers should not have to pay for investments driven solely by large load additions.”

After describing a business-as-usual scenario where data center costs are shifted to residential customers, the commission succinctly summarizes: “This is unacceptable.”

To address this, the MPSC ruled that cost allocation be handled in a traditional rate case, with new requirements added for large loads like data centers. Specifically, Consumers Energy will need to include six different proposed rate structures ranging from keeping the status quo to establishing new rates specific to large loads. This will allow intervenors and the commission to evaluate the impact of data centers on all customers, with the requirement that Consumers “provide a summary exhibit comparing the impacts of these six cost allocation and rate design proposals on all customer classes on a side-by-side basis.”

Then, before each data center is connected, Consumers Energy must file a detailed application demonstrating that “costs caused by the interconnecting large load customer to be served under this tariff are not being paid for by other customers.” Any special contracts addressing specific generation and interconnection needs must also be filed with the commission and supported with the same level of detail.

Together, these requirements are directly relevant to DTE’s filing, as I will explain below.

Action on clean energy requirements and load flexibility deferred

While acknowledging that a hypothetical large load customer “is potentially orders of magnitude larger than any customer currently taking service,” the MPSC’s order does not recognize the paradigm-shifting impact this will have on the utility’s ability to meet its renewable energy obligations. Instead, the order simply noted that several future proceedings may be relevant: clean energy plans, renewable energy plans, integrated resource plans, voluntary green pricing tariff cases, and rate cases.

While it deferred decisions on cost allocation to future proceedings, the MPSC did provide detailed guidance on how to handle it. Without similar details on how utilities should manage their clean energy requirements, there is a risk that this critical issue will never be adequately addressed. If utilities and the commission continually punt on clean energy requirements, it will eventually be too late to build enough renewables, resulting in missed targets, increased costs (as federal incentives for renewables expire, among other factors), and stalled progress on addressing climate change.

Finally, the commissioners ruled that while they support load flexibility, they don’t see a need to reform the interconnection process to prioritize flexible or clean-energy-backed loads. They pointed to the April 2023 interconnection rule update as “recent,” overlooking that it predated the surge in hyperscale data centers. UCS and our partners in Michigan are developing a strategy for raising this issue with the MPSC again, especially as others around the US are evaluating interconnection reform which would account for load flexibility and on-site energy.

Case 2: DTE’s Stargate proposal

Now the big question—what does all of this mean for the proposed 1.4 GW data center in DTE’s territory? First, a quick summary of what DTE is asking for: Oracle is seeking to build a 1.4 GW data center to be used by OpenAI (the maker of ChatGPT) as part of its Stargate project. The new data center would be connected to DTE’s system in December 2026, with the full 1.4 GW online within one year.

This single facility would increase DTE’s load by roughly 25 percent, causing the utility to fall short of resource adequacy requirements. To address that shortfall, DTE proposes building 1.4 GW of batteries, paid for by Oracle. The batteries would be spread around the utility’s service territory, mostly at existing solar and wind energy sites.

First things first: the MPSC should deny ex parte approval

The first decision the commission will need to make in this case is whether to grant ex parte approval. In an ex parte proceeding, the MPSC would consider only the information filed by the utility in making a ruling, which Michigan law allows when utilities make changes that will not increase the cost of service to other customers. Consumers Energy had sought the same type of approval for its filing, but the commission ultimately ordered a contested case after a petition by UCS and others, finding that “the electric load of new data centers presents unique and significant cost implications, and the development of an evidentiary record […] is prudent and reasonable.” We believe the same is true here.

Another concern with DTE’s application is the breakneck pace: the heavily redacted contract stipulates that the MPSC approve the application by December 5, just 35 days after filing. That is not nearly enough time for the commission to evaluate the full impacts of DTE’s application, which involves hundreds of millions in investment and the addition of the largest single customer to ever connect to the grid in Michigan.

As we’ve petitioned, the MPSC should convert DTE’s proceeding to a contested case, just like Consumers Energy’s case, and establish a more reasonable schedule, giving time to fully examine the potential impacts to cost, reliability, and clean energy obligations.

DTE doesn’t give enough detail to verify cost protections

In proposing contract terms similar to Consumers Energy, DTE asserts that other customers would be protected from covering any costs related to the data center. But connecting the facility to the grid is expected to cost $500 million in infrastructure upgrades—most of which will be spread across all ratepayers. DTE claims its contract terms will offset this by diluting other costs.

Thanks to the MPSC’s ruling in the Consumers Energy case, we know that this cost protection is necessary and exactly what information is needed to confirm it. Yet DTE’s application provides nowhere near the level of detail needed to make that determination.

DTE is silent on clean energy and load flexibility

While DTE gives some details of how the batteries would address a capacity shortfall caused by the data center, there is no discussion of where the energy will come from. Similar to the MPSC’s order in the Consumers’ case, DTE seeks to defer the issue to a future proceeding: “The resources necessary to meet the Company’s long-term energy and capacity needs will be determined in the Company’s 2026 IRP filing.” In other words: we’ll figure that out later.

This includes clean energy requirements: DTE doesn’t anticipate this project causing a shortfall until 2033, so doesn’t intend to update its renewable energy plan until it’s required to do so next December. But these plans take close to a year for approval, meaning that DTE wouldn’t have an updated renewable plan until late 2027 when the Stargate project is nearly complete, leaving less than five years to bring new solar and wind projects online prior to the projected shortfall. Given that the wait to get new generators connected to the grid is three to four years (as we pointed out in the Consumers Energy case), this is cutting it close. Adding further urgency, DTE is in “advanced discussions” with another 3 GW new data center load.

When it comes to flexibility, DTE’s proposal to use batteries might indicate support for this tool for integrating data centers with the grid, but the details tell a different story: there’s no discussion of load flexibility, non-wires alternatives, or virtual power plants—which can all be used to leverage and increase the value of batteries. Further, the batteries won’t be installed near the data center where they could be used to balance its demand on the local grid, reducing costs; instead, they’ll be spread throughout DTE’s territory, wherever they can be interconnected for the lowest cost.

This approach is penny-wise and pound-foolish: with careful planning, some portion of the hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on batteries could reduce the $500 million in costs other ratepayers will bear to interconnect the data center. Further, other options, such as using the batteries in a virtual power plant arrangement, could address the inevitable energy shortfalls and reliability challenges from the massive new load. None of these solutions were considered in DTE’s application.

What comes next?

The immediate next step in the DTE case is a public hearing on December 3, where the MPSC will seek input directly from the public about the data center proposal. UCS is asking our Michigan-based members to participate and request that the commission convert this important proceeding to a contested case where it can be given the proper scrutiny. Those who are not able to attend the hearing can comment directly on the docket.

As we look to the future, there are several other conclusions we can draw from these two cases. First, the MPSC is rightfully concerned about the risk of cost shifting and seeks abundant detail from utilities on how it will be prevented; details which are lacking in DTE’s application.

Second, when it comes to new data centers, Michigan’s major utilities and the MPSC have yet to give clean energy requirements the attention they deserve. Guidance is needed from the MPSC that confronts the scale and urgency of the challenge. Similar to how it is addressing cost shifting, the MPSC should issue detailed requirements for assessing the impacts of large loads on clean energy obligations in utilities’ integrated resource and renewable energy plans. Further requirements should ensure that the utilities include specific details of how each new data center will comply as it seeks interconnection approval.

Finally, the MPSC must recognize the need to reform the load interconnection process to account for load flexibility and its potential to support grid reliability and affordability.

Hyperscale data centers are forcing a step-change in how the grid is planned and operated, and Michigan’s utility regulators are right to be concerned about cost shifting. But the same care and concern must also be applied to clean energy requirements and interconnection reform to ensure that data centers support a clean, reliable, and affordable grid for all Michiganders.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Blog-Thumbnail-pylons-in-red.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 11:03:12.692710

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule.
“This is more than just a manufacturing facility.
“This is, beyond doubt, one of the most advanced solar manufacturing facilities in the world and it represents the very best of American manufacturing innovation,” said Kuntal Kumar Verma, chief manufacturing officer, First Solar.
Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company.","First Solar – an American company that manufactures and sells photovoltaic solar power systems, modules, and energy storage solutions – has inaugurated its new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana.

The $1.1 billion facility, which spans approximately 2.4 million square feet and is about 11 times the size of the New Orleans Superdome, currently employs over 700 people and is expected to have 826 employees by the end of the year.

Once fully ramped, the Iberia Parish facility is expected to add 3.5 gigawatts (GW) of annual nameplate capacity, taking First Solar’s American manufacturing footprint to 14 GW in 2026, and 17.7 GW in 2027, when a recently announced production facility in South Carolina is expected to be fully ramped.

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule.

The accelerated timeline was driven by the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Trump administration’s trade policies, both of which catalyzed demand for American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance.

The facility, which has no dependencies on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains, produces First Solar’s Series 7 modules using American materials including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

“First Solar’s investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses,” said Louisiana Governor, Jeff Landry.

“This is exactly how we advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we’re strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.”

According to an economic impact analysis conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority (IEDA) the new facility is forecast to grow Iberia Parish’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 4.4 percent in its first full year of operations at capacity.

Manufacturing roles at the facility offer an average compensation package of $90,000 per year, more than three times the per capita income in Iberia Parish.

“This is more than just a manufacturing facility. It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar.

“By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we’re demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn’t just a thesis, it’s an operating reality.”

The high-tech factory is enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), using computer vision and deep learning to automatically detect defects in solar panels during production, while technicians and operators leverage AI-powered tools to make operating adjustments and guide decision making.

“This is, beyond doubt, one of the most advanced solar manufacturing facilities in the world and it represents the very best of American manufacturing innovation,” said Kuntal Kumar Verma, chief manufacturing officer, First Solar.

“Along with its sister facilities in Ohio and Alabama, this factory demonstrates how AI can be harnessed to help American factory workers reach their full potential. Our fleet offers proof that AI can help realize productivity gains that allow us to out-innovate the competition and run our operations smarter, better, and faster.”

The Louisiana facility is part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one in Alabama, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California.

Last week, the company announced an investment in a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 modules initiated by its international fleet.

Altogether, the company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company.

It is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.",https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/first-solar-iberia-parish-louisiana-1.png,N,,2025-11-24 11:04:56.769851

So, on the one hand, you have the COP30 not mentioning fossil fuels.
You know, we need all the initiatives we can get to phase out fossil fuels and, I might add, to stop deforestation.
We subsidize fossil fuels to the tune of tens of billions of dollars.","AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman.

Global negotiations at the U.N. climate summit ended Saturday in Belém, Brazil, with a watered-down agreement that doesn’t include a roadmap to phase out fossil fuels, oil, gas and coal — doesn’t even mention fossil fuels, the world’s largest contributors to the climate crisis. The final agreement went into overtime after two weeks of contentious negotiations in Belém, the gateway to the Amazon.

A coalition of more than 80 nations, from Latin America, Asia, Africa, the Pacific, Europe and U.K., had supported a just transition away from fossil fuels, but the efforts were derailed by petrostates, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Russia, as well as the more than 1,600 fossil fuel lobbyists who were granted access to the climate talks this year. A fossil fuel phaseout was also a key demand by the thousands of Indigenous leaders who attended COP30.

This is Colombia’s environment minister, Irene Vélez Torres.

IRENE VÉLEZ TORRES: Particularly the oil-producing countries are only trying to focus on adaptation. But adaptation is an empty bag if mitigation doesn’t come next to adaptation. Adaptation alone and the finances for adaptation are not sufficient if we don’t deal with the problem.

The root cause of this problem is fossil fuels. How are we dealing with that? How are we going to come out from this COP to say and to tell the people that we deny the most basic scientific truth, which is that the fossil fuels are the cause of more than 80% of the emissions that are generating climate change? We cannot look at the people in the future generations if we don’t do something now. And we cannot accept a text that is not dealing with the real problems.

AMY GOODMAN: While in Belém, the governments of Colombia and the Netherlands announced they’d be co-hosting the first international conference on the just transition away from fossil fuels next year in Colombia. The landmark gathering will take place in the Colombian port city of Santa Marta in April.

The COP30 agreement also makes no new commitments to halt deforestation and doesn’t address global meat consumption, another major driver of global heating. More than 300 agribusiness lobbyists attended the climate talks in Belém as the expansion of industrial agriculture, including the production of soy, has led to worsening air pollution and deforestation in the Amazon.

This all comes as the Trump administration boycotted COP30 after the White House withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement for the second time when Trump returned to office.

We’re now joined by two guests. In Belém, Brazil, Jonathan Watts is with us, The Guardian’s global environment writer, usually based in Altamira, Brazil. And in Washington, D.C., Brandon Wu is the director of policy and campaigns at ActionAid USA, just returned from COP30 in Belém.

We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Jonathan, let’s begin with you. You’re right there in the gateway to the Amazon. You had a major piece with other Guardian writers summarizing what happened. Why don’t you do it for us here? What took place over these last two weeks? What agreement did it lead to? What didn’t it agree to? Would you call it a total failure or an incremental, very slow transition away — though they wouldn’t talk about transition away — from what some call the F-word, fossil fuels?

JONATHAN WATTS: The first thing I would say is that it’s not as bad as I expected. I had the lowest of expectations, which were almost realized. This COP conference came perilously close to breaking down. And if this had broken down, then the whole Paris Agreement, that’s put in place 10 years ago, could have collapsed. So this was a very dangerous moment.

And I don’t think we can understand what happened in Belém without looking at the terrible, terrible geopolitical situation. The absence of the United States was critical. The United States, of course, is the world’s biggest historical emitter and the richest country, the one that in past conferences has leaned on countries like Saudi Arabia to be a bit more giving. It wasn’t there, and President Donald Trump has been openly hostile to the whole multilateral, global environmental governance system. Then you have the wars. Then you have the fact that Europe is rearming. So, in this context, I think it’s amazing that anything came out of this.

Your summary is excellent, that this conference didn’t go — get anywhere near close enough to where we need to be going to keep global warming to a reasonably safe level of 1.5 C. All the scientists I talked to here — and that was something new about this conference, bringing in more scientists, as well as more Indigenous people — all the scientists here were incredibly alarmed. We’re approaching a number of tipping points with regards to the Amazon rainforest, with regards to Atlantic currents and so forth. So, yes, that’s frustrating, but that’s not new. Last year was a very similar outcome. This year, what I think there was — it’s really disappointing there was no mention of fossil fuels. But Saudi Arabia just said really clearly, if you talk about a roadmap and transition, these talks are going to collapse. So, it just wasn’t on the table.

But what we did see was the start of a new just transition mechanism, a tripling of funds, adaptation funds, for developing countries, and, more than anything else, a kind of a radicalism that’s come into the talks that wasn’t there before. It was there on the streets. For the first time in four years, civil society was out in force, amazing color, dynamism, flotillas in the bay, tens of thousands of people in the streets, more Indigenous people in the conference than ever before. That was incredibly encouraging. So was the fact that, as you mentioned, Colombia and a group of other high ambition nations have decided to go it alone and create a parallel series of conferences for a just transition away from fossil fuels. That’s really going on the offensive.

And then, finally, kind of in the background of all of this was China and what’s happening in China with its fossil fuel shift away — sorry, a shift away from fossil fuels, incredibly, incredible ramp up of wind, solar, electric cars, that is transforming the world. Despite what the talks do achieve or don’t achieve, it’s absolutely incredible how fast things are moving in that area. So, it seems, from where I’m sitting, that the United States under Donald Trump is trying to go backwards to the 20th century in a fossil fuel era, whereas a huge part of the rest of the world wants to move forward into something else. So, yes, I wish there was much, much more on the table here, but given everything that’s happening in the world right now, the whole process lives to fight another day.

AMY GOODMAN: You talk about the role of China. I want to bring in Brandon Wu. China and the United States. You’ve just returned from Belém, flew in to Washington, D.C. If you can talk about the significance of the U.S.? So, you don’t say the U.S. and Saudi Arabia and UAE and other countries blocked the final declaration mentioning fossil fuels, but that’s only because the U.S. boycotted. So, the significance of this? And did you expect that China would more fill the vacuum, as it becomes a leader in the production of renewable energy technology?

BRANDON WU: Yeah, China’s role in this, in all this, is extremely interesting. You know, let’s talk about that.

I actually want to back up a moment and say I’m extremely angry, right? I’m angry at a really weak outcome. I’m angry at the fossil fuel lobbyists roaming the venue freely, while the Indigenous activists, that both of you have mentioned, were actually met with militarized repression. I’m angry at all the governments that aren’t standing up for their people.

But I have a special level of incandescent outrage at a particular set of countries, and it’s actually a slightly different set than the one that we’re naming so far, and that is the rich, developed countries of the Global North, who come in to these conferences, and they act like they’re the heroes, when, in fact, what they’re doing is shifting the burden of a crisis that they caused onto the backs of the poor.

So, you have — of course, you have the United States, but also the European Union, which was part of this so-called high ambition coalition pushing a fossil fuel roadmap. They are not on track in any way to phase out fossil fuels themselves. At this point, 10 years after the Paris Agreement, the countries of the Global North should be pretty close to near-zero emissions. None of them are anywhere close to that. And so, to come in and to push a fossil fuel roadmap, you know, it strikes as a little bit hypocritical. Of course, we need a fossil fuel phaseout. We need it as fast as possible. But it has to start in the Global North, and the Global North has to provide the finance to the Global South to enable that to happen.

That is part of what China is doing, frankly. China is also doing some unhelpful stuff, you know, continuing investment in coal, but they are also investing in renewables in a way that the Global North just isn’t doing at scale, and that’s what’s undermining trust in the agreement. That’s why countries, like most of Africa, not just Saudi Arabia and Russia, were opposed to the fossil fuel roadmap in Belém, because they had no assurance that the Global North would be moving first or would be providing support for them to have a transition.

AMY GOODMAN: Brandon Wu, when you talk about adaptation, it’s become a buzzword. Everyone understands it at the U.N. climate summit, but outside of that, I don’t think people really get it. Explain what you mean by funding adaptation.

BRANDON WU: So, adaptation is really just supporting communities to be resilient to climate impacts. Climate impacts are not — you know, we all know climate impacts are not something that’s going to happen in the future. It’s happening now. It’s been happening for decades, particularly in the most vulnerable countries in the Global South. Many of those communities had zero contribution to the climate crisis, but they’re the ones that are feeling the brunt of its harmful effects. And they need to be supported with resources to be able to adapt to those impacts. That’s what we’re talking about when we talk about adaptation finance.

And again, it’s the wealthy countries of the Global North, that have caused this crisis, that are responsible for providing that support. We did get a tripling, in theory, of adaptation finance at this COP. But if you look at the actual text, it’s really ambiguous. So, the developed countries, led by the EU, they took out the baseline. It was supposed to be adaptation tripling from 2025 levels by 2030. They took out the baseline, so now it doesn’t reference 2025 levels, so we’re not sure what we’re tripling from. And they pushed the deadline from 2030 to 2035, 10 years from now. That’s like an interminable amount of time for communities that are facing the brunt of the impacts right now.

AMY GOODMAN: Are you calling for a ban on fossil fuel lobbyists —

BRANDON WU: Yes, absolutely.

AMY GOODMAN: — at the U.N. climate summit?

BRANDON WU: Absolutely. You know, we can criticize this process in any number of different ways. It’s been 30 years. It hasn’t delivered what we need. A big part of that is the presence, as you say, of fossil fuel lobbyists at this talk. So, it’s fossil fuel lobbyists. It’s intransigent Global North governments. And part of the reason that they’re so intransigent is those fossil fuel lobbyists that have their ears. So, yes, absolutely, they do not belong at talks that are designed to solve the climate crisis, which means getting rid of fossil fuels altogether.

AMY GOODMAN: If you can talk — if you can talk, Brandon, about the Belém Declaration? I want to get Jonathan’s view on this, as well. So, on the one hand, you have the COP30 not mentioning fossil fuels. But I think what Lula will focus on, the Brazilian president, as he did as he headed to G20 and was there this weekend, was what’s called the Belém Declaration. Explain that.

BRANDON WU: So, the Belém Declaration is, essentially, a coalition of countries that want to, or at least say they want to, move on fossil fuels and are frustrated with the U.N. climate negotiations, because it is a consensus-based process, and so you can have individual countries blocking progress. And so, they want to take something outside of this process and move forward on phasing out fossil fuels with a sort of coalition of the willing, if I can use that term. And so, this is a genuinely exciting development. This is the kind of energy that we need. You know, we need all the initiatives we can get to phase out fossil fuels and, I might add, to stop deforestation. That’s sort of the second part of this, that you have, thankfully, mentioned, but that a lot of people forget about — phase out fossil fuels and stop deforestation. And we need all the initiatives they can get — we can get. And so, the fact that they’ve started something outside the COP, you know, that is an exciting development.

I’m glad also that Jonathan mentioned the exciting development also that came within the COP process, which is the conversation on just transition. This is about how do we actually have a transition from a fossil fuel-based economy that doesn’t leave communities and workers and ordinary people behind. We did have some incremental progress on that at this COP, which mitigates an otherwise very bad outcome. And I don’t think we would have gotten that outcome if the U.S. had been there.

AMY GOODMAN: Jonathan Watts, you mentioned the large presence of Indigenous people. I think nearly a thousand were accredited. Thousands more were outside, though there was serious repression of those that tried to go from the outside in. Last Friday, the Indigenous leaders actually shut down the COP for a few hours. But I want to talk about the dangers Indigenous people and their allies face, who are land defenders, who are water defenders. You are an editor of the book — and I went to a bookstore in Belém last week, where you, as well as others, spoke — How to Save the Amazon, a book by Dom Phillips, The Guardian reporter. At one point, I think, he was a Guardian reporter, who was murdered, together with the Brazilian Bruno Pereira, when they were investigating what was happening in the Amazon. If you can talk about the dangers people face? And then I’d like to make my way into what’s happening with Bolsonaro right now and how he enabled so much of this, a man who’s about to go to prison, who President Trump has defended, the former president of Brazil. But start with the dangers people face.

JONATHAN WATTS: Sure. Something like 200 environmental land defenders are killed around the world every year. It’s an incredible toll. It’s the toll of a war. And this is a war against nature.

Dom Phillips, who worked for The Guardian, but he was a freelancer also for The Washington Post and many other organizations, he wanted to write a book where he asked as many people as possible how to save the Amazon, so from a position of great humility, to try to understand. He found out just how dangerous it was, when he was traveling with an Indigenous expert called Bruno Pereira, who is Brazilian, who had worked for the government, worked with Indigenous people for a long time, and he was targeted and killed. Dom witnessed it and paid the price. This case got a lot of attention because Dom had a lot of journalist friends, because — frankly, because he was from the Global North. But these kind of cases are happening all the time. It’s often unreported. Very often it’s Indigenous people who are killed.

And going back to the conference a little, there was this kind of contradiction. There were more Indigenous people inside than ever before, including Brazil has for the first time got an Indigenous minister, and many senior Indigenous leaders were in the Blue Zone, the main negotiating area. But they weren’t there for the final talks. And that’s something that really needs to change, so that the people on the frontline, the people who know the forest best and other biomes best, are represented and their voices are heard when these kinds of decisions are made.

AMY GOODMAN: And we’re going to do another show on How to Save the Amazon, this book that has just come out. But I wanted to ask Brandon Wu, as you come back from Belém, where you think global movements to deal with the climate catastrophe are headed. And the significance of this Colombia meeting that’s happening in just months from now, the leadership of Petro, the president of Colombia? They’re going to be doing it in conjunction with, sponsoring it, of a country of the North, of the Netherlands. Talk about the signficance of that.

BRANDON WU: I think this is really important. I think Colombia’s initiative, President Petro’s initiative, on this has been really admirable. And I also think that none of this is going to happen unless there is more ambition and more finance coming from the big Global North countries, including the United States. Obviously, the political situation is difficult. Politics are difficult everywhere.

But here in the United States, you know, I think what Trump has done over the past year has really shown that the line we’ve heard from the U.S. and other rich countries over the past 30 years in these negotiations, which is that we don’t have the money to give to the Global South to enable a worldwide transition away from fossil fuels, that’s just a lie. Right? We have been fighting tooth and nail for $100 billion a year, which was the original goal for climate money flowing from Global North to Global South. It’s now $300 billion, is the new goal. It’s still far too little. But, you know, the response from the U.S. and the EU has been “We just don’t have the money.” But this year, we saw the Trump administration just sort of magic up $200 billion for ICE and CBP, right? We have consistently magicked up lots of money for Israel. Our military budget is nearing a trillion dollars. We subsidize fossil fuels to the tune of tens of billions of dollars. It’s just not true that the money isn’t there. And I think it’s actually quite useful that this administration is showing how muth of a lie that is.

And so, in answer to your response about the role of movements, you know, I think our movements, especially in those wealthy developed countries, really have to lean on our governments to show how the money is there. It’s just the political will that’s not, and it’s up to us to change that.

AMY GOODMAN: And I want to end by asking about former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Jonathan. He was just arrested this weekend after there was evidence that he tampered with his ankle monitor while under house arrest, the arrest ordered by the Brazilian Supreme Court Justice de Moraes over fears that he would, Bolsonaro would, attempt to escape his compound days before he was headed to a 27-year prison term, back in September sentenced to that for plotting a military coup and assassination against Brazil’s current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Can you talk about the significance of what happened? His son was calling for Brazilians to rally at the compound and to fight. It was feared, in the chaos, he might escape to, what, the U.S. Embassy there or the Argentine Embassy there. Why don’t you summarize the significance of this moment, even in terms of climate change?

JONATHAN WATTS: This is hugely, hugely important. We are — we are in a battle around the world between those who want to keep the world habitable and those who want to just exploit it until there’s nothing left. And Brazil is one of the frontline states. The Global South is bearing the brunt of this. The Global North absolutely has more responsibility and should be doing a lot more. And it’s politicians on the far right, of which Bolsonaro, Jair Bolsonaro, is one of the figureheads, at least in Latin America, that are pushing forward this extractivist agenda, come what may. This leads them, very often, towards authoritarianism. And we’re now seeing that, of course, in the United States, as well.

And so, I think it’s hugely significant that the Brazilian courts stepped up, intervened and have put Jair Bolsonaro behind bars. And what’s really important is it’s not just Jair Bolsonaro. Several of Brazil’s top military generals have also been sentenced. And this is so historical. It was only — it was up until 1985, Brazil had a military dictatorship. And after that, there was a kind of an amnesty, let’s not [inaudible] —

AMY GOODMAN: Thirty seconds.

JONATHAN WATTS: Sorry?

AMY GOODMAN: We have 30 seconds.

JONATHAN WATTS: Oh, OK. Just look, it’s really important that when people break the rules, they’re punished for it, and that someone like Jair Bolsonaro, who, while he was president, oversaw the greatest destruction of the Amazon in any recent presidency, it’s great that he’s not above the law, that there isn’t impunity.

The Rogan reveal: A Roadster built to defy gravity

On Halloween, Musk told Joe Rogan that Tesla is “getting close to demonstrating the prototype,” adding with his usual flair:

“This will be one thing I can guarantee: this product demo will be unforgettable.”

Rogan, always the skeptic, pushed for details. Wings? Hovering? Musk smirked:

“I can’t do the unveil before the unveil. But it has a shot at being the most memorable product unveil ever.”

He even invoked his friend and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who once said, “We were promised flying cars, and all we got was 140 characters.” Musk’s response: “If Peter wants a flying car, he should be able to buy one.”

That’s classic Elon—part visionary, part showman. But underneath the bravado lies serious engineering. Musk hinted at SpaceX technology powering the car: “rockety stuff” using cold-gas thrusters for short bursts or hovering capability. Think less “wings and propellers,” more “controlled rocket push.”

The demonstration, now scheduled for April 1, 2026 (yes, April Fools’ Day), is meant to prove the impossible. Production could start by 2027 or 2028, but given Tesla’s history of optimistic timelines, it may be longer before any of us see a flying Roadster on the road—or in the air.

Why now? Tesla needs a headline

Tesla’s timing isn’t accidental. The company’s Q3 2025 profits fell short due to tariffs, R&D spending, and the loss of federal EV tax credits. With electric vehicle demand cooling, Musk knows how to recapture attention: promise something audacious.

Remember the Cybertruck’s “unbreakable” windows? The demo didn’t go as planned—but it worked as a publicity move. A flying Tesla Roadster could do the same, turning investor eyes (and wallets) back toward Tesla’s most thrilling frontier.

The tech behind the hype

So, can a Tesla actually fly? Musk’s “SpaceX package” may use cold-gas thrusters—essentially small rocket nozzles that expel compressed air for brief, powerful thrusts. The result could be hovering, extreme acceleration, or even short hops over obstacles.

There’s also talk of “fan car” technology, inspired by 1970s race cars that used vacuum fans to suck the car to the track for impossible cornering speeds. Combine that with Tesla’s AI-driven Full Self-Driving systems and new battery packs designed for over 600 miles of range, and the idea starts to sound just plausible enough.

The challenge? Energy density. Vertical flight consumes enormous power, and even Tesla’s advanced 4680 cells may struggle to deliver it without sacrificing range. And if the Roadster truly hovers, it’ll need reinforced suspension, stability controls, and noise-dampening tech to keep your driveway from turning into a launchpad.

The flying car dream: A century in the making

Musk isn’t the first to chase this dream. The “flying car” has tempted inventors since the 1910s—and disappointed them nearly as long.

In the optimistic 1950s, Ford’s Advanced Design Studio built the Volante Tri-Athodyne, a ducted-fan prototype that looked ready for takeoff but never left the ground. The Moulton Taylor Aerocar actually flew, cruising at 120 mph and folding its wings for the highway—but only five were ever built.

Even the military tried. The U.S. and Canadian armies funded the Avrocar, a flying saucer-style VTOL craft that could hover but not climb more than six feet. Every generation since has produced new attempts—from the AVE Mizar (a flying Ford Pinto that ended in tragedy) to today’s eVTOL startups like Joby and Alef Aeronautics, the latter already FAA-certified for testing.

The dream keeps coming back because it represents freedom — freedom from traffic, limits, and gravity itself.

The FAA factor: Can you even fly it?

Here’s where reality checks in. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) now classifies eVTOLs (electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft) under a new category requiring both airplane and helicopter training. You’d need a pilot’s license, medical exams, and specialized instruction to legally take off.

Insurance? Astronomical. Airspace? Restricted. Maintenance? Complex. In short, this won’t replace your daily driver anytime soon. Even if the Roadster hovers, the FAA isn’t handing out flight permits for your morning commute.

Safety first—Or it should be

Flying cars sound thrilling until you consider what happens when one malfunctions. A blown tire is one thing; a blown thruster at 200 feet is another. Tesla’s autonomy might help mitigate pilot error, but weather, visibility, and battery reliability all pose major challenges.

NASA and the FAA are developing new air traffic systems to handle “urban air mobility,” but even best-case scenarios involve strict flight corridors, automated control, and years of testing.

In short: we’re closer than ever to a flying car—but not that close.

Genius or gimmick?

So, will the Tesla Roadster really fly? Probably—at least for a few seconds. Will it transform personal transportation? Not yet.

But here’s the thing: Musk doesn’t have to deliver a mass-market flying car. He just has to prove it’s possible. And that may be enough to reignite public imagination and investor faith at a time when both are fading for the EV industry.

If the April 2026 demo delivers even a glimpse of flight, it’ll cement Tesla’s image as the company that still dares to dream big. If it flops, it’ll join the long list of “flying car” fantasies that fell back to Earth.

Either way, we’ll be watching—because when Elon Musk says he’s going to make a car fly, the world can’t help but look up.

The Georgia Department of Transportation announced that the State Transportation Board approved a $24.4 million grant for the project. The funding is part of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Program, a $5 billion initiative under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to expand EV charging networks nationwide, FOX 5 Atlanta reported.

The expansion will serve both urban and rural communities, targeting gaps identified in earlier efforts. GDOT has partnered with six private companies to design, install, finance, operate, and maintain the new stations, which will include Direct Current Fast Charging (DCFC) ports for at least five years, allowing faster vehicle charging. Governor Brian P. Kemp noted that Georgia’s infrastructure network supports business, travel, and reliable transportation for residents.

The new charging stations will each include four DCFC ports that can operate at the same time and will be available 24/7. Charging times will vary by vehicle, with some able to fully recharge in as little as 20 minutes. The stations will be built in counties across Georgia, from Atkinson to Worth, expanding the state’s EV charging network and supporting greater electric vehicle adoption.

The initiative aims to improve access for electric vehicle drivers and aligns with Georgia’s plans to strengthen its position in innovation and infrastructure. Georgia DOT Commissioner Russell R. McMurry told the Cobb County Courier that the state is investing in infrastructure to enhance the transportation network, support economic development, and improve the experience for EV drivers.

GDOT has not provided a detailed timeline for the new charging stations, which are part of ongoing efforts to expand EV infrastructure in the state.

These awards recognize the value being created today but also honor the individuals and projects that are actively building a blueprint for tomorrow’s energy grid and establishing new standards for future innovation.

Presented at DTECH Northeast on November 19th, 2025, the 2025 Grid Changers Awards ceremony recognized this year’s top innovators. The following is a transcript from the event featuring the opening remarks and details about the recipients.

Everyone in this room understands the incredible expectations and challenges that define this entire sector. Keeping the lights on while simultaneously navigating an energy transition unlike any we’ve ever seen is no small task, but it’s one that all of you have embraced in ways that are literally powering the world. No matter how big or small, just about everything in front of us as a society and civilization needs to be powered, which arguably makes this industry more critical than any other.

Every day, you’re battling evolving challenges, which include ever-increasing demand shifts and sorting out what grid resilience needs to look like in the face of extreme weather. This work needs to be about more than incremental improvements and instead serve as a fundamental shift in how we approach transmission and distribution.

Today, we’re here to celebrate the people and projects who are doing exactly that. These are innovators who aren’t just talking about the “grid of the future” but are deploying the practical solutions that are driving tangible value. By spotlighting these efforts, we’re creating essential blueprints for the entire utility sector. These projects will become case studies that accelerate adoption and enable stakeholders to share best practices, ensuring that today’s breakthrough becomes tomorrow’s standard operating procedures.

Additionally, in an age where public trust is paramount, we need to spread the word about all of the efforts we’re making to positively impact affordability issues that are top of mind for customers across the nation. Highlighting such achievements with awards like this is how we communicate to ratepayers and the communities being served that their utilities are making smart and strategic investments to ensure those lights stay on, no matter what.

These are people who are making a difference. These are projects that are defining a path forward for the entire sector. These are the DTECH Grid Changers.

For our Grid Pioneer of the Year, we’re excited to recognize the visionary leadership that is essential for modernizing the backbone of our system. The greatest threat to reliability often lies in managing nearly century-old infrastructure, which is why we’re thrilled to award this honor to Ryan Hawthorne, Vice President of Engineering at Central Hudson Gas & Electric.

Ryan’s team spearheaded the H&SB Transmission Project, which is a multi-phase rebuild of a 23.6-mile electric transmission line that was originally commissioned in 1928. This was more than simple maintenance, as it represents a complete transformation of the system and infrastructure. By replacing the old lattice towers and wires with steel poles while also significantly increasing the line’s voltage capacity, the project delivered an incredible increase in electric service reliability and storm hardening for the whole region.

As we heard during our panel, strategic foresight can be the difference between a good idea and real project that creates value. Ryan’s thinking and leadership helped the team and organization overcome the technical, regulatory, and logistical inertia associated with large-scale capital projects, which enabled his team to provide a critical and durable upgrade to the grid. His forward-thinking approach is one that countless others can learn from, as it has compelled necessary changes to aging assets that simultaneously future-proof the entire system.

Please join us in congratulating Ryan Hawthorne!

For our Grid Project of the Year, foundational work that is de-risking and accelerating the deployment of the next generation of Grid Enhancing Technologies caught the attention of our judges and community. The winner is the Advanced Grid Innovation Laboratory for Energy, or AGILe.

AGILe is a state-of-the-art power systems laboratory that provides an essential tool for the entire utility industry and has essentially created a “digital twin” of New York’s electric grid. It’s actually more than that though, as it’s not a simulation but is instead a high-fidelity, real-time operating environment that allows engineers to test and rigorously model the integration of new technologies, complex control schemes, and software updates in a virtual, real-time environment. That they’re able to do all of this without ever risking the stability of the live grid makes all the difference to stakeholders and to customers across the region.

By providing a safe, accelerated sandbox for innovation, AGILe drastically shortens R&D cycles for technologies like distributed energy resource management (DERMS), microgrids, and advanced protection systems. This project is a foundational asset that allows utilities to rapidly de-risk the implementation of advanced solutions, moving innovation from the drawing board to the control room faster than ever before.

Oregonians have just more than a month to take advantage of federal tax credits meant to reduce by thousands of dollars the costs of buying and installing new energy efficient heating and cooling pumps, insulation, windows and solar panels.

Paired with incentives from the nonprofit, state-partnered Energy Trust of Oregon, the savings can cover half to nearly all costs, depending on the purchase. People who have made home energy efficiency upgrades this year, or who can complete upgrades by Dec. 31, can claim the federal tax credits.

To claim federal tax credits:

Keep receipts from your purchase and submit an IRS form 5695 (Residential Energy Credits form) when you file your federal taxes for 2025. For more info go here.

Most of the federal credits passed in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act enacted under former President Joe Biden and were meant to expire in 2032, giving Americans a decade to take advantage of subsidies meant to spur investments in home weatherizing and clean energy upgrades. But congressional Republicans phased the credits out early in the tax and spending law they passed this summer.

Julianne Thacher, a spokesperson for the Energy Trust, said the organization wants to encourage Oregonians to take advantage of those credits now and to remind them that when they go away, there will still be state-level incentives they should not overlook.

“Energy Trust incentives will be here after the tax credits. We won’t be affected. We were here before the tax credits, and had very successful programs with folks installing energy-efficient equipment, so we expect that will continue,” Thacher said.

The Oregon Department of Energy also offers solar and heat pump cash incentives and grants that can be used towards the costs of equipment and installation after federal, Energy Trust and any other incentives are applied.

The Oregon Energy Trust was established by the state Public Utilities Commission in 2002. Although it’s an independent nonprofit, the commission oversees the trust’s performance measures, budget and planning.

Ratepayers of five of Oregon’s six investor-owned gas and electric utilities — all except Idaho Power — fund the trust. As part of utilities’ energy load planning, they send a percentage of ratepayer dollars to the trust, which is tasked with ensuring investment in activities that lower overall load demand and help meet state climate targets.

Part of that is standing up cash incentive programs to help businesses and everyday Oregonians afford equipment and infrastructure to lower their own energy consumption. The trust offers higher incentives for families with lower incomes and collaborates with 60 community organizations statewide.

Energy Trust incentives are available to all customers of Portland General Electric, or PGE, Pacific Power, NW Natural, Cascade Natural Gas and Avista. Customers can go to a store and choose equipment prequalified for Energy Trust incentives, and that will deduct the credit from receipt at the point of purchase.

Customers can also work with contractors who have agreements with Energy Trust, and who will purchase and install the equipment and deduct the tax credits from the bill. Customers can also apply online at the Energy Trust’s website for specific credits after purchase, and receive a refund for the credit amount in the mail.

The mix of state, federal and private and nonprofit subsidies for solar panels have led to major growth in residential solar in the last decade, and today about 25,000 homeowners in Oregon are generating solar energy, according to Energy Trust. This has ramped up as the federal credits are set to expire.

“The solar contractors we work with are very busy right now, and we’ve actually gone ahead and launched our new incentives for 2026 early, because folks who are looking to do a solar project starting now, they’re highly unlikely to complete that by year’s end. That’ll be a 2026 project.”

Focusing on efficiency in businesses and homes in Oregon, and setting climate targets that incorporate more solar, heat and cooling pumps and building upgrades, has made a big dent in Oregon’s gas and electricity use. Demand for gas would today be 9% higher and demand for electricity 16% higher if policies had not been enacted over the last two decades, the Trust found.

“Energy efficiency is the most effective, affordable way to meet climate goals, while also offering a ton of other benefits for customers and communities,” Thacher said.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/oregon_capital_chronicle_articles_871/407aa7564133829691250d54a9af8c03,N,,2025-11-24 11:03:56.834583

This has ramped up as the federal credits are set to expire.","Oregonians have just more than a month to take advantage of federal tax credits meant to reduce by thousands of dollars the costs of buying and installing new energy efficient heating and cooling pumps, insulation, windows and solar panels.

Paired with incentives from the nonprofit, state-partnered Energy Trust of Oregon, the savings can cover half to nearly all costs, depending on the purchase. People who have made home energy efficiency upgrades this year, or who can complete upgrades by Dec. 31, can claim the federal tax credits.

Most of the federal credits passed in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act enacted under former President Joe Biden and were meant to expire in 2032, giving Americans a decade to take advantage of subsidies meant to spur investments in home weatherizing and clean energy upgrades. But congressional Republicans phased the credits out early in the tax and spending law they passed this summer.

Julianne Thacher, a spokesperson for the Energy Trust, said the organization wants to encourage Oregonians to take advantage of those credits now and to remind them that when they go away, there will still be state-level incentives they should not overlook.

“Energy Trust incentives will be here after the tax credits. We won’t be affected. We were here before the tax credits, and had very successful programs with folks installing energy-efficient equipment, so we expect that will continue,” Thacher said.

The Oregon Department of Energy also offers solar and heat pump cash incentives and grants that can be used towards the costs of equipment and installation after federal, Energy Trust and any other incentives are applied.

The Oregon Energy Trust was established by the state Public Utilities Commission in 2002. Although it’s an independent nonprofit, the commission oversees the trust’s performance measures, budget and planning.

Ratepayers of five of Oregon’s six investor-owned gas and electric utilities — all except Idaho Power — fund the trust. As part of utilities’ energy load planning, they send a percentage of ratepayer dollars to the trust, which is tasked with ensuring investment in activities that lower overall load demand and help meet state climate targets.

Part of that is standing up cash incentive programs to help businesses and everyday Oregonians afford equipment and infrastructure to lower their own energy consumption. The trust offers higher incentives for families with lower incomes and collaborates with 60 community organizations statewide.

Energy Trust incentives are available to all customers of Portland General Electric, or PGE, Pacific Power, NW Natural, Cascade Natural Gas and Avista. Customers can go to a store and choose equipment prequalified for Energy Trust incentives, and that will deduct the credit from receipt at the point of purchase.

Customers can also work with contractors who have agreements with Energy Trust, and who will purchase and install the equipment and deduct the tax credits from the bill. Customers can also apply online at the Energy Trust’s website for specific credits after purchase, and receive a refund for the credit amount in the mail.

The mix of state, federal and private and nonprofit subsidies for solar panels have led to major growth in residential solar in the last decade, and today about 25,000 homeowners in Oregon are generating solar energy, according to Energy Trust. This has ramped up as the federal credits are set to expire.

“The solar contractors we work with are very busy right now, and we’ve actually gone ahead and launched our new incentives for 2026 early, because folks who are looking to do a solar project starting now, they’re highly unlikely to complete that by year’s end. That’ll be a 2026 project.”

Focusing on efficiency in businesses and homes in Oregon, and setting climate targets that incorporate more solar, heat and cooling pumps and building upgrades, has made a big dent in Oregon’s gas and electricity use. Demand for gas would today be 9% higher and demand for electricity 16% higher if policies had not been enacted over the last two decades, the Trust found.

“Energy efficiency is the most effective, affordable way to meet climate goals, while also offering a ton of other benefits for customers and communities,” Thacher said.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SolarInstallJBHouse1-2048x1536.jpeg,N,,2025-11-24 13:02:29.254729

This shift introduces alternative fuels, including liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquid petroleum gas (LPG), methanol, ammonia, hydrogen, biofuels, and electric, wind, and nuclear power—each presenting unique advantages, disadvantages, challenges and risks for spill and safety hazards. On September 16, 2025, NOAA’s Mid-Atlantic Scientific Support Coordinator participated in an alternative fuels tabletop exercise hosted by the U.S. Coast Guard Sector Delaware Bay in Clarksboro, NJ. The goal of the exercise was to serve as an introduction to the various alternative fuels; identify response and training priorities; discuss recommendations for engaging with the maritime industry’s “safety by design” process; and develop tactical response plans. Unlike traditional oil, these fuels require specialized emergency protocols. For example, LNG and hydrogen are both cryogenic and pose risks of fire and explosion, cryogenic burns, and asphyxiation from rapid evaporation. Methanol is water-soluble and highly flammable, meaning it cannot be contained by traditional booming methods. Ammonia is toxic to humans and marine life; a major release risk is the formation of a harmful vapor cloud. Battery fires are difficult to extinguish, and leaks can release flammable vapors. The exercise included presentations by NOAA OR&R on the current status of alternative fuels, technology readiness, bunkering safety, and operational risks. James E. Elliott, a retired Coast Guard expert and current leader in worldwide marine salvage and emergency response operations, provided an overview of the U.S. National Contingency Plan, the Marine Salvage Regulatory Framework, and policy recommendations. Participants included numerous federal agencies (Coast Guard, NOAA, Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, Environmental Protection Agency, Army Corps of Engineers); state representatives from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland; maritime industries; and non-governmental organizations. This interagency effort successfully identified a unified set of critical needs and goals, establishing a clear framework for action centered on stabilizing incidents and swiftly initiating defensive measures to protect life and the environment.

The NOAA Southeast and Caribbean Regional Collaboration Team (SECART) has released an updated “Guide to Integrated NOAA Disaster Resilience in the Southeast and Caribbean,” commonly known as the “Disaster Guide.” The original guide, published in 2022, was created following feedback from disaster-themed workshops SECART hosted between 2017 and 2019. Participants consistently noted the need for a resource summarizing NOAA’s roles, responsibilities, and resources for disaster preparation, response, recovery and mitigation in the region. The Guide’s purpose is to improve communication and coordination among NOAA offices and partners in disaster management in the Southeast and Caribbean region. Based on user feedback, Version 2 features several improvements: updated contact information for key NOAA personnel involved in disaster preparedness, response, and recovery; a more streamlined presentation of NOAA contacts and resources supporting disaster resilience efforts, and a Spanish-language version to better serve partners and communities.

The funds they’re referencing are part of the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, a program that helps finance infrastructure projects that allow states to stay in compliance with federal water quality regulations.
“Cities and towns have prepared bids, identified contractors, and engaged residents, yet cannot move forward until the EPA finalizes state allotments.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that passed in 2021 included $15 billion over five years to help replace lead pipes.
Since 2022, the state has allocated more than $102 million in grants to help municipalities replace lead water service lines.","LET IT FLOW — A grant program that would help cities and towns in Massachusetts replace lead pipes is still on pause. Sen. Ed Markey is trying to get the funding flowing again.

“It’s long past time for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to get the lead out — both literally and figuratively — when it comes to water service lines,” Markey and members of the state’s congressional delegation wrote in a letter they’re sending this morning to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

The funds they’re referencing are part of the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, a program that helps finance infrastructure projects that allow states to stay in compliance with federal water quality regulations. Massachusetts pressed pause on distributing funds from the program in October, after the EPA delayed announcing the grants.

The wait “has real consequences, particularly in states such as Massachusetts that have some of the oldest water infrastructure in the nation,” reads the letter, which all 11 members of the delegation signed onto.

“Cities and towns have prepared bids, identified contractors, and engaged residents, yet cannot move forward until the EPA finalizes state allotments. Timely release of these funds will allow states to maintain construction momentum, protect public health, and adhere to the statutory mandate in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,” the letter says.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that passed in 2021 included $15 billion over five years to help replace lead pipes. In past years, the money has been divided among states and distributed in the spring, but even as funding for other water projects has been delivered, Massachusetts is still waiting to see these funds start flowing.

The program in the past has meant grants for 160 cities and towns in the state, Gov. Maura Healey’s office said in October. Since 2022, the state has allocated more than $102 million in grants to help municipalities replace lead water service lines.

— Massachusetts agencies never followed a 2017 rule to cut emissions from state vehicles, court documents show by Jordan Wolman, CommonWealth Beacon: “No agency submitted reports to comply with a 2017 rule requiring cuts to the emissions produced by state-owned vehicles — and environmental regulators didn’t aggressively enforce the rule, either, according to new court documents filed last week. Massachusetts agencies that own or lease at least 30 passenger vehicles, from the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs to the Department of Transportation, are compelled to reduce the pollution stemming from that vehicle fleet each year by specific amounts and submit reports to the Department of Environmental Protection in order to show compliance.”

Wu joined Ma to perform ‘Ave Maria,’ an 1853 piece by French composer Charles Gounod based upon German composer Johann Sebastian Bach’s ‘Prelude No. 1.’ Ma’s concert, which consisted of six unaccompanied cello suites inspired by Bach, was held as part of the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s Celebrity Series.”

— Video shows BPS bus driver’s eyes were off the road when Hyde Park kindergartner was struck and killed in April crash by John Hilliard, The Boston Globe: “The driver of a Boston Public Schools bus that struck and killed a Hyde Park kindergartner in April was seemingly not looking straight ahead at the road when the vehicle ran over the boy, according to a video recording viewed by the Globe. That recording shows the driver did not appear to be watching the boy, 5-year-old Lens Arthur Joseph, and his 11-year-old cousin after they disembarked from the bus the afternoon of April 28. He also does not appear to watch where they were going as the pair crossed in front of the vehicle to reach their family’s home.”

FROM HARVARD YARD

— Student petition urges Harvard to revoke Larry Summers’ tenure by Spencer Buell, The Boston Globe: “Amid new scrutiny of the relationship former Harvard University president Larry Summers had with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, some students are calling on the institution to do something it rarely does: revoke Summers’ tenure. Summers last week said he was immediately stepping back from teaching duties at the university while it investigates his ties to the late Epstein. That probe comes after the release by a congressional committee of emails that showed the two men shared messages until Epstein’s arrest in 2019. Summers has said he regrets the correspondence. Now, some on campus are saying the university should do more to keep him away from students permanently.”

ON THE STUMP

FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — State Rep. Hannah Kane is endorsing former Housing and Economic Development Secretary Mike Kennealy in the race for governor, per Kennealy’s campaign.

“I came to know Mike during his service in the Baker-Polito administration, and I know he is the only one in the Republican primary that can win a general election,” Kane, a Shrewsbury Republican, said in a statement. “We must nominate Mike, with his track record of delivering for the people of Massachusetts, to win in 2026 and put Massachusetts on a better path forward—rooted in common sense, fiscal responsibility, and results-driven leadership.”

ALSO FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — The Professional Fire Fighters of Massachusetts is endorsing Sen. Ed Markey for reelection, according to his campaign.

Markey has “a long history of standing with firefighters and working families,” PFFM President Rich MacKinnon Jr. said in a statement shared by Markey’s campaign. “From leading the fight to repeal the unfair WEP provision, to holding chemical companies accountable for putting cancer-causing PFAS in our gear, to calling out venture capital firms driving up the cost and wait times of fire apparatus, he’s never been afraid to take on the tough fights.”

DAY IN COURT

— Federal judge asked to strike down firearm age restrictions by Christian M. Wade, The Eagle-Tribune: “A coalition of gun rights groups are asking a federal judge to strike down Massachusetts’ ban on the sale of handguns to anyone age 18 to 20 in response to a federal appeals court ruling that overturned a federal ban. In a filing in U.S. District Court, the Las Vegas-based Firearms Policy Coalition and other groups ask the judge to grant an injunction blocking the state’s age-based prohibitions from being enforced. The groups argue that the 18-20 age group is protected by the Second Amendment and that there is “historical tradition” supporting the states restrictions.”

FROM THE 413

— ‘There will be more encampments’: Trump’s HUD guts $91M for supportive housing across Mass., U.S. by Jim Kinney, The Springfield Republican: “The Trump administration, in a major policy shift in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, is capping the money that grant recipients around the country can spend ‘housing first’ programs, like permanent supportive housing, and instead emphasizing shelters. In housing first sites, sobriety is not a prerequisite, as advocates say shelter is needed before recovery, job hunting and mental health treatment. Here, the shift endangers $9 million in federal funding for the Springfield-Hampden County Continuum of Care, said Geraldine McCafferty, director of housing for the city of Springfield.”

— Berkshire renters confront rent increases with no state limits in place by Nate Harrington, The Berkshire Eagle: “After a law was passed in preventing rent control in 1994, there have been no protections against rent hikes in Massachusetts. This has resulted in tenants having to leave apartments they’ve stayed in for decades, but lawmakers say there might be a change coming.”

THE LOCAL ANGLE

— By razor thin margin Taunton Council votes not to discipline McCaul by Emma Rindlisbacher, Taunton Daily Gazette: “The Taunton City Council ultimately voted in a close 5-4 vote not to take any disciplinary action against Councilor John McCaul — other than asking him to apologize to an election worker — in the wake of allegations from Elections Director Mark Pacheco that McCaul ‘singlehandedly delayed results for the City’s entire election’ during the Sept. 23 preliminary election.”

— Recount results end in same council race lineup with Bergman winner over Kamara by Toni Caushi, Telegram & Gazette: “Days of recounting every single ballot cast at the Nov. 4 election ended with one dull snap of City Clerk Nikolin Vangjeli’s stamp around 5 p.m., Sunday, Nov. 23 inside the North High School gym. The results saw the council race lineup remain the same, with Jermoh Kamara – the candidate who asked for the recount after trailing by 23 votes – again finishing seventh, thus missing out on a seat on the council. Incumbent Councilor-at-Large Morris A. Bergman was the sixth-place finisher, staying on the council for another term.”

— Possible last talks of 2025 end in stalemate for Haverhill teachers and committee by Jonah Frangiosa, The Eagle-Tribune: “Little progress was made Wednesday night in what may be the final contract negotiation of 2025 between the Haverhill Education Association (HEA) and the current members of the Haverhill School Committee. Months of stalled talks over salary structure and safety concerns continue with no common ground reached. The teachers have operated on the same, 14-step salary structure from their last contract, which expired on June 30. Discussions for a new contract sprouted in March, but there’s still a significant gap between the two teams’ proposals — disputes centered on pay and safety.”

— Even before the SNAP freeze, Massachusetts families were already going hungry by Will Katcher, MassLive: “Even before the sudden cutoff of SNAP benefits early this month, pantries were already stretched to their limits, more so than the public may understand. The number of families struggling to find enough to eat spiked during the Covid-19 pandemic — and has remained persistently high ever since. From the Berkshires to Cape Cod, Massachusetts’ network of independent food pantries was thrown into chaos at the beginning of November when the Trump administration paused SNAP assistance as the federal government shutdown dragged on.”

BELÉM, Brazil, Nov. 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- EcoFlow, a global leader in renewable energy solutions, participated in COP30 with a clear conviction: clean, reliable, and smart energy should be accessible to everyone - every household, every community, everywhere.

At an event traditionally dominated by governments, utilities, and global organizations, EcoFlow brings a different voice: climate goals will not be achieved by policy discussions alone, they require solutions that reach real people, real homes, and daily life.

Why EcoFlow Chose to Be at COP30

EcoFlow's presence at COP30 reflects the company's belief that global climate goals cannot be achieved through policy commitments alone—they require practical, scalable solutions that reach households and communities. This year's COP marks the tenth anniversary of the Paris Agreement, and the discussions once again highlight the urgency for real-world adoption of clean energy.

Echoing CEO Bruce Wang's vision, the company stresses that clean energy must be democratized, meaning accessible, reliable, and affordable for everyone, not just institutions or developed markets. Bruce has consistently advocated that innovation only creates meaningful impact when it becomes part of people's daily lives, especially in regions facing climate vulnerability or grid instability.

Energy Independence: From Households to Communities

EcoFlow sees energy independence as the foundation of a resilient clean energy future. What started as portable power for individuals has evolved into a comprehensive home energy ecosystem—covering power generation, storage, distribution, and intelligent energy management. This transformation enables households not only to secure backup energy but also to actively manage consumption, reduce costs, and participate in cleaner lifestyles.

Bruce's core message during COP30 emphasizes that energy independence is not about isolation, but empowerment. When households have the ability to generate and control their own power, they contribute to broader grid resilience and help accelerate global decarbonization. EcoFlow aims to make this autonomy universal, especially in regions where electricity is unstable, expensive, or carbon-intensive.

Driving a Smarter, More Resilient Energy Future

EcoFlow envisions a future where millions of connected homes form a dynamic clean energy network. Through smart systems, demand forecasting, and distributed storage, households can support the grid during peak periods, reduce strain during extreme weather, and even share energy with their communities. This model aligns with global priorities at COP30, where resilience and climate adaptation are key themes.

In line with Bruce's long-term viewpoint, the company believes that the next decade of climate progress will depend on intelligent, interconnected home energy systems. EcoFlow will continue advancing technologies that allow families to monitor, optimize, and share their energy, turning clean power from a personal asset into a collective resource.

Long-Term Commitment to Sustainability

Beyond its strategic presence at COP30, EcoFlow has long been committed to climate action and community resilience through its ""Power for All"" initiatives. In the United States alone, the company donated over $120,000 worth of portable power stations and solar panels to frontline relief organizations and disaster-impacted communities in 2025.

EcoFlow is also expanding access to clean, reliable, and affordable energy in underserved regions worldwide. In South America and Indonesia, the company partnered with local governments and community groups to help residents maintain safe and uninterrupted living and learning conditions during frequent power outages.

Through its collaboration with the Million Forests initiative, EcoFlow has supported desert reforestation efforts—turning every product purchase into a step toward restoring degraded land. In 2024, EcoFlow's solar panels helped reduce over 5,600 tons of CO₂ emissions, the equivalent of planting more than 175,000 trees.

Across Africa, South America, and beyond, EcoFlow remains committed to delivering practical clean energy solutions that strengthen community resilience and bring dependable power to more families around the world, helping power a new world grounded in sustainability and shared progress.

Products using Research Frontiers’ smart glass technology are being used in tens of thousands of cars, aircraft, yachts, trains, homes, offices, museums and other buildings.
Note: From time to time Research Frontiers may issue forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties.","WOODBURY, NY, Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Research Frontiers Inc. (Nasdaq: REFR) highlighted the strong industry interest in SPD-SmartGlass at last week’s ECV Automotive Glazing Summit in Detroit, where Research Frontiers President & CEO Joseph M. Harary served as Chairman of the event and delivered the keynote address.

The summit brought together automakers, Tier-1 suppliers, glass manufacturers, and technology innovators to discuss next-generation automotive glazing and its role in vehicle comfort, safety, and energy efficiency. Across multiple sessions, attendees emphasized that variable-tint glazing has moved from an emerging concept to an essential feature for modern vehicle programs, with benefits for both internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric vehicles (EVs).

In addition to OEM and Tier-1 participation, the summit also included key contributions from Gauzy Ltd. (Nasdaq: GAUZ), a licensee of Research Frontiers and manufacturer of SPD light-control film. Gauzy attended the conference and participated in the panel discussion moderated by Mr. Harary, offering insights into film production capabilities, global scaling, and integration within next-generation vehicle programs.

Industry Momentum and Real-World Adoption

During the summit, Mr. Harary highlighted the growing number of OEM programs evaluating or actively using SPD-SmartGlass—from premium vehicles to next-generation EV platforms. Attendees responded positively to SPD’s real-world performance in production models such as the Ferrari Purosangue, Cadillac Celestiq, and a number of car models from McLaren and Mercedes.

“Automakers are no longer looking for future-concept technologies—they are asking for dynamic glazing solutions that are proven and production-ready today,” said Harary. “SPD-SmartGlass offers immediate, real-time tint response at large scale, giving OEMs design freedom, energy savings, and the elevated customer experience that drivers expect. It has been successfully used in tens of thousands of vehicles since 2011 when it went into serial production.”

Accelerating Collaboration Across the Supply Chain

The Detroit summit also underscored the importance of collaboration among film developers, glass processors, laminators, electronics suppliers, and OEM engineering teams. Research Frontiers participated in multiple working discussions and moderated panel discussions that focused on integrating dynamic glazing into vehicle platforms, addressing cost targets, and optimizing system performance.

Critics have said banning gas appliances will drive up homebuilding costs, and those increased costs will get passed along to consumers.
Even if a whole new stove isn't feasible right now, you can still take advantage of induction cooking.","A New York developer is getting ahead of an upcoming state ban by making his latest housing project all-electric.

Starting in January, new gas hookups will be banned in New York, WSYR reported, forcing homebuilders to find electric alternatives.

But in Syracuse, Eldan Homes President Dan Barnaba isn't waiting. His current development features no gas appliances.

""This will be the first community that I'm aware of in Central New York that's all-electric,"" Barnaba told WSYR. ""Heating the home, the cooking appliances, the fireplace, and the hot water heater will all be electric appliances.""

Critics have said banning gas appliances will drive up homebuilding costs, and those increased costs will get passed along to consumers. But advocates say that not only will the ban create environmental benefits, but homebuyers will also save money in the long run by using more electric appliances.

""I'm prepared to build homes,"" Barnaba told WSYR. ""The better question is the consumer prepared?""

A good example of this is the kitchen, where gas stoves can be easily replaced with induction cooktops.

Instead of burning gas, which can increase the risk of asthma, induction cooktops generate a magnetic field that transfers heat to pots and pans. This energy-efficient heating method allows you to boil water more quickly and keep more consistent cooking temperatures, without creating any toxic fumes.

Federal incentives can also knock $840 off the purchase price of a new induction stove. Unlike the expiring tax credits on solar panels and electric vehicles, the appliance rebate for induction stoves appears to be sticking around for a while. Still, it may be worth acting quickly to guarantee those savings don't go away.

Even if a whole new stove isn't feasible right now, you can still take advantage of induction cooking. Plug-in burners are a great option that can easily fit on a countertop, all for an affordable price — as low as $50.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/gas-stove-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 12:02:33.564165

Driving the news: Curtis, along with Ken Calvert (California) and Thomas Massie (Kentucky), voted this summer against solar tax credits that provided thousands of dollars toward solar installations at their own homes, Politico reported last week.

Zoom in: Curtis once used the tax credits in former President Biden's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act to install solar panels and a geothermal pump at his Provo home, according to a 2023 report by the climate publication The Cool Down.

He then supported President Trump's ""Big, Beautiful Bill,"" which phases out the tax credits.

The other side: Curtis supported a gradual phaseout of the solar incentives rather than the abrupt cancellation pursued by many conservative Republicans.

""For years, there was broad agreement, from Democrats to industry leaders, that these subsidies were intended as temporary,"" Curtis told Axios in a prepared statement.

""I fought hard to ensure we had a responsible off-ramp. Today, the solar industry has matured and proven it can compete on its own.""

Flashback: It's not the first time Curtis' solar subsidy has been called out. The Washington Post in 2023 reported that after The Cool Down's tour of his home's eco-friendly features, climate activists slammed his 2022 vote against Biden's bill, which all Republicans opposed.

11/24/2025 - 08:30 AM

WOODBURY, NY, Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Research Frontiers Inc. (Nasdaq: REFR) highlighted the strong industry interest in SPD-SmartGlass at last week’s ECV Automotive Glazing Summit in Detroit, where Research Frontiers President & CEO Joseph M. Harary served as Chairman of the event and delivered the keynote address.

The summit brought together automakers, Tier-1 suppliers, glass manufacturers, and technology innovators to discuss next-generation automotive glazing and its role in vehicle comfort, safety, and energy efficiency. Across multiple sessions, attendees emphasized that variable-tint glazing has moved from an emerging concept to an essential feature for modern vehicle programs, with benefits for both internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric vehicles (EVs).

In addition to OEM and Tier-1 participation, the summit also included key contributions from Gauzy Ltd. (Nasdaq: GAUZ), a licensee of Research Frontiers and manufacturer of SPD light-control film. Gauzy attended the conference and participated in the panel discussion moderated by Mr. Harary, offering insights into film production capabilities, global scaling, and integration within next-generation vehicle programs.

Industry Momentum and Real-World Adoption

During the summit, Mr. Harary highlighted the growing number of OEM programs evaluating or actively using SPD-SmartGlass—from premium vehicles to next-generation EV platforms. Attendees responded positively to SPD’s real-world performance in production models such as the Ferrari Purosangue, Cadillac Celestiq, and a number of car models from McLaren and Mercedes.

“Automakers are no longer looking for future-concept technologies—they are asking for dynamic glazing solutions that are proven and production-ready today,” said Harary. “SPD-SmartGlass offers immediate, real-time tint response at large scale, giving OEMs design freedom, energy savings, and the elevated customer experience that drivers expect. It has been successfully used in tens of thousands of vehicles since 2011 when it went into serial production.”

Accelerating Collaboration Across the Supply Chain

The Detroit summit also underscored the importance of collaboration among film developers, glass processors, laminators, electronics suppliers, and OEM engineering teams. Research Frontiers participated in multiple working discussions and moderated panel discussions that focused on integrating dynamic glazing into vehicle platforms, addressing cost targets, and optimizing system performance.

Joe Harary noted that the event fostered productive dialogue within the industry:

“Bringing the full supply chain together is essential. OEMs want seamless integration, and the companies supporting SPD today are deeply aligned and ready to deliver.”

Technology Clarity: SPD-SmartGlass Compared to Other Switchable Tint Technologies

A recurring theme throughout the summit was the need for clarity among the different variable-tint technologies available to automakers. Industry participants expressed strong interest in SPD’s fast switching speed (1–3 seconds even on large surfaces), optical consistency, and scalability—especially in comparison to slower electrochromic solutions that can take minutes to transition and may not meet real-time visibility needs for roofs and expansive glass areas, and non-shading privacy applications such as PDLC windows which do not deliver the energy efficiency or relief from unwanted heat, light and glare that SPD-SmartGlass has delivered as a benefit in tens of thousands of vehicles since 2011.

Features and Benefits of SPD-SmartGlass Technology

With global automakers prioritizing sustainability and cabin energy efficiency, SPD continues to differentiate itself in real-world testing. It saves energy, increases driving ranges, and also improves the passenger experience and promotes safety and comfort.

According to a recent announcement, the Arizona Corporation Commission solidified its position on November 19, voting 5-0 to intervene in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s debate without yet taking a definitive stance.

Fueling the discussion, the Department of Energy issued a directive back on October 23, which has launched Federal Energy Regulatory Commission into a rulemaking frenzy. Designed to ensure an equitable and efficient approach to connecting hefty energy consumers like AI data centers to the grid, the Department of Energy's directive supplied Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with 14 guiding principles. The move, aiming for a 'new era of American prosperity' according to Vice Chair Nick Myers, must now be finalized by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission no later than April 30, 2026. Myers said, ""I agree with the Secretary that to usher in 'a new era of American prosperity,' all Americans and domestic industries must have access to affordable, reliable, and secure electricity,"" as per the Arizona Corporation Commission's statement.

With deliberations heating up, the Arizona Corporation Commission’s play ensures Arizona will have a voice in the outcome. The state commission is angling to protect its oversight on giant powerloads plugging into the local power grid. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, historically staying clear of load interconnection authority, now wades into new territory. Accustomed to a certain autonomy, states like Arizona, are now posturing to maintain their regulatory influence amid federal shifts. According to the Arizona Corporation Commission, Chairman Kevin Thompson highlighted this tension, emphasizing that ""FERC work closely with the States and state regulators to ensure rules resulting from this proposal affirm state authority and do not inadvertently create challenges to resource adequacy, reliability, and affordability.""",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/11/arizona-corporation-commission-joins-national-debate-on-federal-energy-interconnection-rules-2.webp,N,,2025-11-24 12:03:20.614655

DTEK, which holds Ukraine’s biggest portfolio of energy generation assets and is now developing battery projects in other countries, including Poland, won the Developer of the Year award.

Meanwhile, Energy Dome, the designer, manufacturer, and holder of the IP for its carbon dioxide-based CO2 Battery technology, won the Long-Duration Energy Storage Company of the Year (LDES Company of the Year) award. It also took home the inaugural prize in that category in 2024.

“Energy Dome is recognised for its innovative, non-lithium CO2 Battery technology, with a 20MW/200MWh commercial project operational in Italy and a strong global pipeline, though its focus is primarily on the US market,” judges said.

“The company excels in commercial maturity, execution, and leadership, offering both storage-as-a-service and ownership models, and is backed by major investors.”

EDF took its second consecutive Trading and Optimisation Team of the Year award, and had the company not finished a close second to Habitat Energy in the first ESAs in 2023, would have been celebrating the hat-trick.

The team at EDF Wholesale Market Services, to give its full name, would have consoled, however, by taking home the Breakthrough R&D / Innovation of the Year. EDF’s entry demonstrated the real-world applications of its trading and optimisation (T&O) platform, which judges described as “a leading platform for BESS asset owners, with a strong focus on breaking down barriers for new customers.”

The ceremony took place last Thursday (20 November) at the Park Plaza Hotel on the South Bank of the River Thames, attended by more than 300 industry hopefuls in their finest evening wear.

Hosted annually by our publisher Solar Media, the event brought the industry together to celebrate, with entrants from the UK, Europe and beyond.

After an exclusive live set of comedy from national television and podcasting star Tiff Stevenson, the audience was treated to a procession of well-deserved winners, Highly Commended runners-up, and, of course, shortlisted nominees as they broke bread together and enjoyed an evening of good-natured, sometimes a little raucous, competitive fun.

While Fluence took the top System Integrator ESA 2025 home, rivals were also strongly represented through award wins: most prominently Wärtsilä, which was named on two winning entries via project collaborations with UK developer-investor Zenobē Energy and also NHOA Energy, which took home the EPC Firm of the Year prize.

Zenobē Energy’s Blackhillock grid-forming BESS in Scotland, UK, was a triple winner, recognised as Grid-Scale Standalone Energy Storage Project of the Year, and Best Project over 100MW in both UK and European categories.

Blackhillock is being built in phases, up to a total 300MW/600MWh when complete and this meant it was also eligible in 2023, when Zenobē, a former Developer of the Year winner in 2024, took home the Best UK Project Over 100MW trophy for it.

On NHOA Energy, judges commented that the company has built an “impressive profile” through an extensive pipeline and projects of growing scale in multiple regions worldwide.

WinES takes first-ever Diversity & Inclusion Award

Rutwij Hoshing, investment manager at UK energy storage investor Gore Street Capital won the Rising Star award for industry professionals under 30, with judges acclaiming Hoshing’s “exceptional early-career milestones, including pioneering US IRA tax credit transactions, securing rare California contracts, and scaling a storage portfolio from 9MW to 900MW, with global impact through M&A and £150 million-plus (US$196 million-plus) raised in debt.”

Outstanding Contribution to Energy Storage was awarded to Vidyadhar Rangojoo, principal electrical engineer and a founding team member at Fluence, credited with making a significant contribution to establishing and growing the company’s global industry platform.

Rangojoo also has a “track record of pioneering first-of-their-kind energy storage deployments across continents,” judges said.

“Vidyadhar Rangojoo has made foundational contributions to technical innovation, industry standards, and mentorship, supporting clean energy reliability and training the next generation.”

This year’s inaugural Diversity and Inclusion Award was handed to Women in Energy Storage Network (WinES), the UK-based cross-industry initiative to bring together “significant support from multiple companies to promote gender diversity in the energy storage sector, empowering women in an industry where they are often underrepresented.”

Judges said WinES “has successfully connected a large number of women, with participation from top companies and influential leaders, and serves as a model for creating a more inclusive industry. The initiative is highly praised and has the potential to expand beyond the UK.”",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Tiff-Stevenson-ESAs-2025.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 10:01:05.878648

This issue is further explored in IDTechEx’s report on “Critical Battery Materials.” Industry Variations in Cell Costs Cell costs differ across industries.","The average cost of lithium-ion cells has significantly decreased from $168 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in 2022 to just over $100/kWh in 2025, according to a recent analysis by IDTechEx. The report, part of its new research titled “Li-ion Battery Market 2026-2036,” projects that cell prices could fall to nearly $50/kWh by 2036, based on assessments of material costs and minimal cell prices observed to date.

The lithium-ion battery market is currently dominated by two chemistries: lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides (NMC) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP). NMC offers higher energy density but at a higher cost, while LFP is less expensive but provides lower energy density. IDTechEx said it has observed a notable shift from NMC cathodes to LFP in China, Europe, and North America. However, NMC remains prevalent in the latter two regions.

Cathode Costs and Material Volatility

Cathode costs are a significant component of total cell costs, particularly for NMC cells. These are heavily influenced by the prices of nickel, lithium, and cobalt. In 2022, challenges in lithium supply led to an over 80% increase in the cost of NMC cathode active materials (CAM) compared to 2021, according to IDTechEx. LFP experienced even greater price inflation due to its reliance on lithium. However, as of 2025, the costs of NMC 811 cell materials have decreased to below $40/kWh. LFP costs have fallen to under $35/kWh.

IDTechEx noted a trend towards higher nickel content in NMC cells, such as NMC 9.5.5,. These contain 90% nickel compared to the 80% in standard NMC 811. This shift reduces cobalt usage, an expensive metal, IDTechEx said.

Lithium’s Impact on Costs

Lithium constitutes a significant portion of cathode active material costs—84% for LFP and 36% for NMC 811, IDTechEx said. The volatility in lithium prices, driven by supply chain issues, geopolitical tensions, and high capital investment requirements, has historically impacted cell costs. Temporary volatility remains a risk for lithium-ion battery supply in the short, medium, and long term, IDTechEx said.

This issue is further explored in IDTechEx’s report on “Critical Battery Materials.”

Industry Variations in Cell Costs

Cell costs differ across industries. In stationary energy storage, where LFP cells are prevalent, costs are more than eight times lower per kWh compared to consumer electronics, IDTechEx said. These require more expensive cathodes and incur higher non-active material costs due to smaller cell sizes.",https://s37629.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/stock-lithium-ion-cells-1400.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 11:04:22.389536

Georgia Power and the data center industry say they need more power — comparable to the needs of many large cities — to serve them.
If this trend continues, Georgia Power could be overbuilding for electrons that have no place to go.
For its part, Georgia Power said there are options if those scenarios come into play.
Meanwhile, Georgia Power stands to profit “tremendously” from the expansion if it’s approved, PSC staff wrote.","Georgia Public Service Commission staff alert in new testimony that existing Georgia Power customers could be on the hook for data center costs.

Analysts with the Georgia Public Service Commission’s staff deliver a stark warning in new written testimony: Georgia Power residential customers could see monthly bills jump $20 or more if the PSC allows the utility to complete the historic power fleet expansion it has proposed to support an influx of data centers.

Instead, PSC staff recommend in filings that for now, the commission should approve only about a third of the new power plants and batteries the company has proposed. To date, the analysts say only a fraction of what the company has asked to build is backed up by signed contracts.

“The rest is speculative and exposes customers to the risk of stranded costs if the anticipated load does not materialize,” Robert Trokey, the PSC’s electric section director, and outside consultants wrote in their combined testimony.

The comments concern the company’s request to add 10,000 megawatts to its power generation fleet in the next five years. For comparison, each of the four nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle near Augusta provides roughly 1,100 megawatts.

Environmental and consumer advocacy groups say the scale of the buildout the company has asked the PSC to approve is unprecedented.

“I think this is the largest single request in terms of how much power they want to build and buy — and how expensive it is — in the history of the state,” said Bob Sherrier, a staff attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.

The staff’s statements come on the heels of a historic defeat of two Republican incumbent PSC commissioners in elections earlier this month, in which customers’ frustration over their rising utility bills was the central issue. The two commissioners who lost, Fitz Johnson and Tim Echols, will get to cast votes in this critical case days before they leave office.

The PSC will decide whether to approve some or all of the company’s proposed buildout on Dec. 19, less than two weeks before the two Democrats elected to replace them take office.

It’s unlikely customers would feel any bill increases from the data center expansion before 2029. This summer, the PSC voted to hold Georgia Power’s base rates steady through 2028. Next year, however, the commission will decide whether the utility can charge customers for its storm repair and fuel costs, both of which could raise bills.

Georgia Power disagreed that the demand is speculative. A company spokesperson pointed to a document filed Friday that the “portfolio” of large customers who have “committed” to receiving electricity service from the utility has grown to 11,000 megawatts.

The utility will file additional testimony next week, a company spokesperson said in an email.

“The electricity demand is based upon the company’s load forecast, which is premised on large load customer commitments and additional organic growth,” the spokesperson said.

‘No guarantee’ customers won’t pay

Georgia is among the fastest growing markets in the nation for new data centers, warehouses packed with servers that power artificial intelligence and our digital lives. Georgia Power and the data center industry say they need more power — comparable to the needs of many large cities — to serve them.

But just as quickly as data center operators say they need these buildings, many are canceling contracts or going to other states. The staff pointed out that this has already happened in Georgia, and the risk is high it will continue.

What’s more, the PSC staff said the evidence shows that so far, Georgia Power’s aggressive forecasts have overestimated electricity demand from data centers.

If this trend continues, Georgia Power could be overbuilding for electrons that have no place to go.

That could leave existing customers stuck paying for those power plants, electricity contracts and grid upgrades whether the electricity is needed or not, the staff said.

For its part, Georgia Power said there are options if those scenarios come into play. These include adding new contracts, delaying construction of planned power supplies or changing upcoming electricity targets.

Earlier this year, Georgia Power and the PSC agreed on new billing terms both parties have said will protect non-data center customers from paying costs incurred to serve the giant server farms. But in their testimony, the PSC staff analysts said those guardrails and assurances aren’t enough.

Most contracts the company has signed so far with data centers were inked before the new “large load” billing rules took effect, staff notes.

“Without executed contracts under the new large load framework, there is no guarantee those costs will not be passed on to existing customers,” Trokey and the two outside consultants wrote.

Meanwhile, Georgia Power stands to profit “tremendously” from the expansion if it’s approved, PSC staff wrote. All told, staff noted the power plant additions the utility wants would nearly double the company’s “rate base,” a key factor in determining its earnings.

Georgia Power likely will ask to charge customers for a wide range of tangential costs for the data centers whether they get built or not, the staff said. This, plus the plethora of costs to upgrade and maintain the power grid, mean Georgia Power will make money off the backs of customers in the long run, they said.

Cost overrun warnings

Staff said the PSC should sign off on 3,100 megawatts, or one-third of the total, and approve another 4,200 megawatts with conditions.

Commissioners should not allow Georgia Power to add the remaining 2,400 megawatts at all, staff said.

Those power projects were the most expensive, staff said.

Georgia Power has been criticized by environmental and consumer advocates for turning mostly to gas-fired power plants to provide the 10,000 megawatts, but PSC staff pushed back on both fossil fuels and carbon-free energy sources — in this case, solar and battery storage.

Staff also took aim at Georgia Power’s ability to finish projects on time and on budget, a chief example of which is its nuclear expansion project at Plant Vogtle. The twin reactors, the first to be built from scratch in the United States in roughly three decades, took seven additional years to finish and were more than double their original forecast $14 billion budget.

While these proposed power plants are different from gigantic nuclear reactors, for customers the economic consequences of delays could be just as great.

“ ... (G)iven the magnitude of the company’s proposed build program and the current highly inflationary environment for generating equipment and labor costs, staff is concerned that there is a significant change that delays and cost overruns could occur at these projects,” Tom Newsome, the PSC’s utility finance director, and outside consultants, wrote in combined testimony.

Many other electric companies in the United States are also looking to build gas-fired power plants, driving up the cost — and creating a backlog — for gas turbines. The proposed battery storage projects are in their early stages, which increases the likelihood of delays and cost increases, and Georgia Power selected contractors that have never built these types of projects before, staff said.

That is according to a new PwC report that delves into how the two sustainable developments should be better coupled in order to scale up together.

The global movement toward cleaner energy and transport is picking up speed, but its success hinges on more than simply swapping out old technology for new. Solar energy has huge potential for the sun-soaked countries of the GCC, which already have robust energy sectors.

There is also a rising wave of electric vehicles (EVs) in the GCC region, much like in other regions. This broad electrification of transportation presents a monumental shift in how people travel, with global electric car sales surpassing seventeen million units in 2024 and projected to exceed twenty million in 2025.

However, this rapid adoption presents a critical challenge: If the power used to charge these vehicles still comes from fossil fuels, the environmental benefit is drastically diminished. The next significant leap in sustainability is not about scaling up individual technologies, but about purposefully weaving electric mobility and solar energy together to create genuinely clean power for transport.

Solar and EVs

Currently, a major inefficiency exists because electric vehicles often charge in the evening when solar output is at its lowest, increasing reliance on conventional energy sources and placing stress on the power grid.

This mismatch overlooks a colossal opportunity: vehicles remain parked for approximately ninety-five percent of the day. With smart planning, this idle time could be perfectly aligned with peak daylight hours for solar charging, maximizing the use of clean energy and reducing pressure on the grid.

This integrated approach is gaining significant traction, particularly in regions with abundant sunlight and aggressive clean energy goals, such as the GCC nations. Saudi Arabia and the UAE, in particular, are positioning themselves to lead the transition.

Saudi Arabia, for instance, has committed to generating a full half of its electricity from renewables by 2030, planning a vast solar capacity of nearly fifty-nine gigawatts. Similarly, the UAE has launched a $6 billion project that will add five gigawatts of solar power combined with nineteen gigawatt-hours of battery storage, creating one of the world’s largest integrated solar-storage systems.

This renewable energy focus is paralleled by rapid electric vehicle adoption, with the UAE seeing an astonishing sales increase of over two hundred sixty percent in 2024, while Saudi Arabia is investing $39 billion to establish a domestic EV manufacturing ecosystem.

Optimized solar charging

The technological framework for this coupling is now maturing – at its core, the solution involves aligning vehicle charging with the sun’s schedule. This is accomplished through smart charging systems, which use digital platforms to automatically time charging sessions to coincide with daytime solar output, especially useful at homes and offices where cars are parked for extended periods.

A more advanced integration involves bi-directional charging, also known as Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. It allows electric vehicles to transform into mobile energy assets, capable of not only drawing power but also sending excess energy back to a building or the main grid during periods of high demand.

This model is already being piloted in places like Germany, where a federal grant incentivizes homeowners to install solar panels, battery storage, and bi-directional chargers as a single integrated system.

But despite the clear benefits, the journey to full integration of these solutions faces significant barriers. The power grid and existing charging solutions were not originally designed to handle the dynamic needs of combined solar-EV systems, and the high initial costs for these hybrid systems remain an obstacle for many.

Ultimately, the success of this revolution depends on moving past technical hurdles and focusing on strategic alignment across all sectors. GCC leaders must ensure that policy, infrastructure, and consumer behavior are all oriented toward a future where every electric car is powered by the sun.

“Coupling solar power and e-mobility isn’t just about cutting emissions – it’s about building a new energy economy for the GCC,” said Heiko Seitz, Middle East eMobility leader at PwC. “Clean mobility can become a catalyst for investment, jobs and innovation across the energy value chain, while strengthening grid resilience for decades to come.”",https://www.consultancy-me.com/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-11-24-085746651-Coupling_solar_power_with_electrical_driving_Shifting_gear_in_clean_transport.jpg?webp,N,,2025-11-24 10:00:33.273288

TRANSCRIPT

Welcome to 2025 Talks, where we're following our democracy in historic times.

We believe the reason why TPS was terminated is because of online rhetoric to score political points and scapegoat the Somali immigrant population here in Minnesota.

Jailani Hussain, who leads the Muslim civil rights group Care Minnesota, says a sudden administration decision to strip temporary protected status from Somalis is landing hard in the nation's largest Somali community.

He warns that increasing misinformation is raising real fear in a state with just short of half of U.S. mosque attacks last year.

President Donald Trump's order ends TPS immediately for about 700 migrants nationally.

Trump calls Minnesota a hub of loosely monitored immigrant money transfers.

At a Minnesota press conference, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said they're following longstanding immigration law that requires TPS get periodic review.

TPS is a program that was always meant to be temporary.

We plan to follow the process that's in law to evaluate TPS and how it applies to different countries and individuals.

Critics argue Somalia remains unsafe and the move could separate U.S.-born children from their parents.

Minnesota's Democratic governor says Trump is targeting an entire community to distract from his political problems.

The administration is defending a new peace framework for Ukraine.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio calls current talks in Geneva positive, but lawmakers from both parties say the framework reads like a Moscow wish list.

They question why the president has set a Thanksgiving deadline for it.

On social media, Trump has again accused Kiev of being ungrateful for U.S. support.

In Texas, the fate of a newly redrawn congressional map remains uncertain after a week of conflicting court rulings.

The map targets several Latina-majority districts that helped shape the 2024 outcome, and both parties say the stakes are high heading into next year's midterms.

The White House is ending the IRS Direct File program in 2026, reversing the free tax filing tool launched under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Adam Rubin with the Economic Security Project says it's enormously popular and saves taxpayers billions.

It could save existing tax filers $8 billion in filing fees, and it could help people who are missing out on tax credits claim an additional $12 billion more.

The administration says as part of its economic focus, it wants to replace direct file with a broader, quote, ""affordability-focused system.""

But consumer and government watchdog groups say the government's failure to deal with rising health insurance premiums doesn't make that look promising.

Brian Lemick with Defend the Vote says political dysfunction is making it harder for Congress to address affordability.

Instead of making laws and legislating, they closed the government.

They limit the ability to make sure families have affordable health care.

China dominates 85% of global rare earth refining and 90% of permanent magnet production.

The US and Europe are dangerously dependent on China for materials critical to electric vehicles (EVs), defense, and renewable energy.

Dr. Erik Eschen, CEO of VAC, warns that only industry can fix this strategic vulnerability through firm commitments and a ‘coalition of the willing,’ as politics alone cannot replace industrial action.

New Western production is emerging with VAC’s South Carolina facility shipping magnets.

Major projects from companies like Vulcan Elements, Energy Fuels-POSCO, and Korea’s JS Link are underway.

Experts estimate that replicating China’s capabilities could take 5-10 years.

China controls more than 85% of global rare earth refining capacity and over 90% of permanent magnet production — a grip that has left the United States and Europe dangerously dependent on a single geopolitical rival for the materials powering electric vehicles, wind turbines, smartphones, and missiles according to Dr. Erik Eschen, (opens in a new tab) CEO of German-based Vacuumschmelze GmbH & Co KG (VAC). Note the German-based company operates a subsidiary in the United States called VAC-Group. A Houston-based private equity house– Ara Partners (opens in a new tab), now is a primary investor.

Despite decades of warnings, the U.S. has yet to build sufficient domestic capacity to separate and refine rare earth elements (REEs) at scale. Even ores mined at California’s Mountain Pass — the nation’s only active REE mine — are still largely shipped to China for processing. The bottleneck isn’t at the mine; it’s in the chemistry.

The Bottleneck: Bespoke, Dirty, and Difficult

As Rare Earth Exchanges just recently reminded in a piece, rare earth separation is notoriously complex. Though they’re called “rare,” these elements are fairly common — but they tend to occur together, and separating them requires painstaking, element-by-element chemical processing. Each rare earth must be extracted through hundreds of solvent extraction stages using corrosive chemicals and precisely controlled reactions. Any deviation can ruin the purity or yield.

This is what China has mastered over three decades: refining at scale. With aggressive state backing, low-cost labor, and lenient environmental rules, China built a vertically integrated rare earth supply chain while Western nations ceded the industry. Most competitors shut down under price pressure and environmental scrutiny, leaving China’s industrial ecosystem unrivaled in midstream capabilities and technical know-how.

Europe’s Wake-Up Call: ""Industry Must Act""

That reality took center stage at Raw Materials Week in Brussels, where Dr. Erik Eschen, CEO of German-based Vacuumschmelze GmbH & Co KG (VAC), issued a blunt warning: “In Europe, we have debated and complained for years. But very little has actually happened. This must change — fast.”

Speaking after a keynote by the European Commission’s EVP Stéphane Séjourné, CEO Eschen underscored the geopolitical urgency. “Rare earths and permanent magnets are now central to global geopolitics — not only in negotiations between the United States and China, but also for Europe.”

He called for a “coalition of the willing” — countries and companies that share values and can build resilient supply chains together.

Eschen’s message: only industry can fix this. Policymakers can ease permitting, reduce bureaucracy, and offer financial incentives, but “politics can support, not replace, industry action.” Without firm offtake commitments from sectors like automotive and wind energy, Europe risks further de-industrialization — and losing what magnet-making capabilities it has left.

Growing Activity Outside China

VAC is one of a handful in a rare earth magnet race. The company announced this month that its new U.S. facility — eVAC Magnetics in South Carolina — has begun production and shipped its first batch of permanent magnets. That makes VAC one of the only Western companies currently delivering rare earth magnets at commercial scale.

Other companies involved with rare earth magnets include Permag (EEC (opens in a new tab)), Arnold Magnetic Technologies (opens in a new tab) plus Canada-based Neo Performance Materials (opens in a new tab) (mostly bonded magnets) and exciting new entrants such as Vulcan Elements, with a several hundred million dollar deal with the U.S. government (plus partnership with ReElement Technologies (opens in a new tab)); Energy Fuels and POSCO are aligning on a rare earth refining and magnet supply chain. Korea’s JS Link (opens in a new tab) announced a $223 million magnet plant in Georgia capable of producing 3,000 tons annually. Of course driving the activity in America is the major equity investment made by the U.S. Department of Defense (War) into MP Materials (opens in a new tab) and the 10x magnet production target. Apple inked a $500 million rare earth recycling magnet product with MP Materials.

Its European factories in Germany, Finland, and Slovakia are also ramping up production. It’s a rare bright spot in a field dominated by China. While firms like MP Materials, Lynas Rare Earths, and USA Rare Earth are investing in mining and separation facilities, most remain years away from full operation. Heavy rare earth elements like dysprosium — critical for high-temperature magnets — remain particularly difficult to refine outside China.

Time, Money, and Political Will

Rebuilding rare earth refining and magnet production in the West will take time. Experts estimate it could take five to ten years to replicate China’s capabilities — if projects can overcome permitting delays, funding gaps, and talent shortages. China’s lead is built not just on capacity, but on experience: decades of chemical fine-tuning, trade control, and end-to-end industrial integration.

In this context, the VAC CEO warning is stark but timely: the decisions that led to this strategic vulnerability were made by industry — and only industry can correct them. But the window is closing. Whether the U.S. and Europe seize the moment may determine who controls the building blocks of 21st-century technology. For now, China still holds the cards.",https://rareearthexchanges.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=rank_math_overlay_thumb&id=8196&type=rare-earth-exchanges&hash=17ba0f41ccc23391c2824cd370af5649,N,,2025-11-24 11:04:13.637328

The two units at the Millstone Nuclear Power Station total about 2,100 megawatts.
But nuclear power is not renewable and its radioactive waste is not really recyclable, as some claim.
Enter the notion of small nuclear power plants broadly, and SMRs specifically.
In October the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC, approved its environmental impact statement, the first such designation for new technology nuclear.","Nuclear power seems to be having a moment.

As the Trump administration methodically throws up roadblocks to slow, if not stop, carbon-free renewable solar and wind power, carbon-free nuclear appears to be the go-to idea for large amounts of power that are presumed to be needed in the future for data centers, AI and more.

Nevermind that before two new nuclear plants opened in Georgia in 2023 and 2024 — seven years late and double their original budget — there had been no new nuclear power plants in the U.S. in more than 30 years.

Now the chatter is around so-called small modular and micro-reactors — touted as easier, cheaper, and faster, leading to a public perception they are ready to be pulled off the shelf and plugged in.

But here’s the problem with that. They don’t exist yet.

Former Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chair Allison Macfarlane, now director of the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at the University of British Columbia, is among those who are frustrated with the public and governmental belief about small modular reactors, also known as SMRs.

“They do think that,” she said of the public perception that small nuclear reactors are an immediate option to help meet energy needs. “A lot of the media writes about these things as if they do exist. ‘We know that they’re cheap, we know that they’re safe.’ But we don’t know anything, because they don’t exist.”

But they are in development. As of last summer, the Nuclear Energy Agency dashboard listed 127 different small modular reactor designs in existence globally, with about 60% of them in active stages of research and development.

There are three reactors operating around the world that are reported to be small reactors: A floating one in Russia powering a remote Arctic region and two in China, but details about those projects have not been shared.

The SMRs are often bundled under the category of advanced nuclear energy. That advanced designation generally refers to the supposedly newer ways they are cooled, and changes to pressurization and uranium formulation common to the water-cooled light-water reactors that comprise most of the world-wide nuclear reactor fleet today.

“Advanced is rather a misnomer of a term,” Macfarlane said, echoing the views of others. “It should really be non-light-water, because ‘advanced’ suggests there’s something new here, and there isn’t anything new. Most of these technologies have been tried for 50 to 70 years.”

She said eight countries have tried to build more than 25 different versions of one of the technologies — sodium-cooled fast reactors. “No one has been able to get them to produce electricity economically, viably and reliably.”

What do we know and what don’t we know about updated nuclear power options? And how realistic are any of them — including in Connecticut?

The short answer — even the owner of the one nuclear station in Connecticut sees the challenges of building new nuclear in the state. And if those could be overcome, it would be a long way off.

The basics of nuclear power haven’t changed much in decades. It’s carbon-free. The classic units — like the 94 stations operating in the U.S. — can generate a lot of power. The two units at the Millstone Nuclear Power Station total about 2,100 megawatts. Plants can provide that power 24/7 with planned interruptions for re-fueling and maintenance. Despite a plant’s large footprint compared to similarly sized fossil fuel power, it takes up far less space than renewables such as wind and solar fields.

It’s more efficient than other forms of power, including renewables, which means nuclear doesn’t lose as high a percentage of its power as other power sources do. Some nuclear systems require a lot of water for cooling — but so do conventional power plants — leaving both vulnerable to droughts, floods and warming water, some of which are due to climate change.

But nuclear power is not renewable and its radioactive waste is not really recyclable, as some claim. Plants take a long time to build and they cost a lot of money.

Enter the notion of small nuclear power plants broadly, and SMRs specifically.

Smaller nuclear units

“I find the name SMR a little bit misleading because it should be called smaller modular reactor, because they’re still 300 megawatts,” said Jacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering at MIT. “This is a substantial facility, requires a lot of civil work, site excavation. So it’s not a factory-produced reactor by any stretch of the imagination.”

Buongiorno said the first one likely to be built in North America is from BWRX — a longstanding nuclear company — at the Darlington nuclear site in Canada. It’s slated for 300 megawatts.

An early-stage project in Wyoming by TerraPower, a private company founded by Bill Gates, will be 345 megawatts. In October the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC, approved its environmental impact statement, the first such designation for new technology nuclear.

The federal government-owned Tennessee Valley Authority, TVA, is also building what it calls an advanced nuclear SMR that uses molten-salt cooling. The unit by Kairos, a startup, is not expected to go online before 2030.

Prior to these efforts, the Biden administration had approved one new project by another startup — NuScale — for a unit in Idaho. But that plan dissolved when costs increased. A larger NuScale design was approved in May by the Trump administration.

Also in May, President Donald Trump signed four executive orders to speed up several aspects of nuclear development. They include adding 300 gigawatts — that’s 300,000 megawatts — of nuclear power by 2050. And they order the NRC to speed up licensing, which some see as dangerous rubber stamping. Earlier this month, Trump nominated a former executive at Westinghouse, a longtime player in the nuclear space, to the NRC.

But Buongiorno and others said, as an alternative to the SMR, there is a proven modernized reactor already available in the U.S. — the AP1000 — Westinghouse’s full-size reactor.

“It’s a great design. It’s an American design. And my personal opinion is that our best bet if we want to grow nuclear is to build more of those AP1000s,” he said. “The downside of the AP1000 and any other large reactor is it takes time to build these units, and it costs a lot of money.”

That is also the reactor used in the two new units added to Georgia’s existing Vogtle plant. But Buongiorno said it would be a mistake to judge the economics of a new big reactor like the AP1000 by the Vogtle experience. It was the first of its kind so likely to be more expensive and slower, though he admitted overall the U.S. nuclear industry does not have the greatest construction track record.

Westinghouse also hadn’t built a nuclear plant in a generation, which brings up another category of problems. The kind of skilled workforce and expertise needed to build and maintain a nuclear facility has all but vanished in the U.S., as has the supply chain that once supported nuclear construction. While the fuel supply is the same for old and new nuclear plants, there’s not enough of it and some of what is needed comes from Russia.

Then there is the question of whether SMRs and micro-reactors will be cheaper and easier to build. The answer depends on the definition of cheaper and easier, especially considering the cost per unit of power.

Ask Buongiorno if it’s cheaper: “The answer is absolutely no. We expect, actually, small, modular reactors to produce energy that will be more expensive than large reactors. This is a mathematical certainty.”

Ask Macfarlane: “It’s quite realistic — at least the light water reactor designs are realistic. The advanced designs less so.” In fact, Macfarlane has just co-written a paper on the cost question. “We conclude that economies of scale still will hold. It’s just simply cheaper to build a single, large light water reactor than 10 small ones,” she said.

Ask Jeff Semancik, the Radiation Division director at the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP): “There’s a trade-off that you’re looking at between what are the upfront capital costs versus the long term cost of electricity.”

On the other hand, Buongiorno points out that investors will perceive the upfront risk as smaller.

“If the check that you need to write at the beginning of the project to build the plant is $3 billion instead of $10 billion, the risk associated with the project is significantly smaller. And that’s really the value proposition for the smaller reactors, the overall project risk, financial as well as execution. There is less to build.”

It’s generally thought the footprint for an SMR won’t be that much smaller, especially if the plan is to install several at once. Siting might be a little easier because of new safety systems that require a smaller perimeter, though factors like access to transmission lines or availability of transmission capacity could impact siting and cost.

The lower the power, the less potential radioactivity if a problem arises. There’s also less radioactive waste, though there’s still no U.S. repository to store it.

As the scale continues to shrink, Buongiorno believes his point about the cost per kilowatt hour continues to hold true. Power from microreactors would be even more expensive per unit, but they are a different animal. They are envisioned to be 10-15 megawatts, but could be as small as one megawatt. The concept is also more as a standalone system that’s not necessarily tied to the grid, so the need for transmission and distribution and its costs may be avoided even though the power itself costs more.

Their use, experts say, would be more for out-of-the-way or hard-to-access locations where connecting to a grid would be extremely expensive or even impossible and where the alternative might be diesel generators. Think remote mining camps or extreme rural Alaska without connecting highways. Or for use by the military, which the Trump executive orders specifically target. The military has a history of small reactor use in things like submarines and aircraft carriers going back decades, though the technologies are not the same as land units.

“The business model is very different. These are not grid-connected electric generators. These are co-located with their end users” Buongiorno said. “So the devil is in the detail of these things, which means it’s all going to be site- and customer-dependent.”

Microreactors are expected to be easily transportable with other needed components, but they are even less developed than SMRs. An initial testing pilot project in the U.S. is expected next summer, which may be aggressive timing, even though some of the well-known and experienced nuclear companies are looking at them. So true deployment, even if everything goes well, is still years away.

What it means for Connecticut

New nuclear is on the table here.

In the last few legislative sessions, lawmakers cleared a slight path. They lifted the state’s nuclear moratorium for the Dominion site in Waterford, which houses Millstone, thereby allowing for nuclear expansion at that location. They also established a process for municipalities to begin consideration of hosting new nuclear facilities and authorized $5 million in bond funds for DEEP to give grants for technical assistance for early site permitting.

To that end, in October DEEP announced informational sessions beginning in December to help municipalities better understand what nuclear power and its new iterations entail.

DEEP is aware of the realities of potential new nuclear power, as evidenced in this 2024 report that noted advanced nuclear technology, SMRs and more are in early stages and that “cost competitiveness has not yet been demonstrated and is unlikely to be realized unless or until such technologies move beyond ‘first of a kind’ projects and are deployed at scale.”

In other words, there’s a long way to go.

“It’s a significant amount of time that’s required to get these large projects off the ground,” said DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes, noting that a project like Revolution Wind, under construction now, first solicited proposals in 2017. “Many of the resources that we’re talking about now and planning and engaging on, we’re contemplating deployment and commercial operation timelines that are in the late 2030s. That’s not unique to nuclear.”

But Connecticut does have some unique circumstances with nuclear — some helpful, some less so.

Dykes thinks the national lack of a nuclear workforce is less of an issue here with existing training at Three Rivers Community College in partnership with Dominion, as well as the skill sets associated with the state’s large defense industry — especially submarines and their nuclear components. And she said DEEP already is responsible for nuclear safety.

On the other hand, she and others point out that a deregulated utility market like Connecticut’s could face challenges with nuclear’s expense.

“How do we create the right balance in terms of the investment approach here to making our market an attractive place to invest while not burdening ratepayers with all of the risks of cost increases?” she asked.

In the meantime, in late October, Connecticut signed on as the 12th observer state to an effort known as Advanced Nuclear First Movers, which also has 11 full state members. Its inception was several years ago through the National Association of State Energy Officials, NASEO, as an education mechanism around advanced and other new nuclear.

Now more formalized, the group is working through the variables and unknowns as states consider the various technologies in the face of state climate policies, electricity needs and costs.

Nuclear, while promising, is not a panacea, said David Terry, NASEO’s president. “It’s kind of flashy in the news right now for good reason, because people are interested. But it’s not a panacea,” he said.

And with trying to figure out what kind of power to use 30 years from now and a lead time that could be a decade, the message, he said, is to weigh the pros and cons carefully. “And, oh, by the way, if you choose the wrong thing and you choose too many of the wrong thing, you’re going to pay dearly.”

CT history

Connecticut’s nuclear history dates to the 1968 opening of the Connecticut Yankee in Haddam, which stopped producing electricity in 1996. Millstone Unit 1 began operation in 1971 and it stopped producing electricity in 1995. Units 2 and 3 — which are still running — opened in 1975 and 1986 respectively, with Unit 2 just celebrating its 50th year. Each has had its license extended, to 2035 and 2045 respectively.

The Millstone units constitute about one-third of the power generated in Connecticut and along with the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant in New Hampshire, the only other nuclear plant operating in New England, supply one-quarter to one-third of the region’s power.

The Millstone units have older technology systems that use Long Island Sound, which is literally outside their doors, for intake and discharge water. In the summer of 2012 after a very warm winter and summer, Unit 2 shut down for 12 days due to intake water temperatures that exceeded what was allowable. The NRC subsequently approved an increase in allowable water temperature and Dominion spokesperson Susan Adams said via email there have been no issues since.

That incident followed a situation in August of 2011 when water from the Sound overtopped the seawall around the plant during Tropical Storm Irene. Adams did not respond directly to the question of whether this has happened since.

The company has clear procedures in place to respond immediately to prevent any impact to operations, she said in an email. “If a storm is coming, we have in our procedures to build a 2-foot-high wall with sandbags around the doors of specific locations.”

The Union of Concerned Scientists has tracked nuclear power safety for years. The director of that effort, Ed Lyman, said climate issues such as rising water temperatures, drought that causes reduced water, flooding and more intense storms are not necessarily safety issues. “But they could be a real operational issues if it has to shut down for some period of time.” He also said plants in Europe, in particular, have had to lower power output during heat waves in recent years.

After the flooding of the Fukushima plant in Japan in 2011, the U.S. looked at the flood standards for its plants. “It turns out that nearly every plant in the country, when they did these assessments, they found out that they were probably vulnerable to more severe flooding than they were designed to withstand,” Lyman said.

With the moratorium now removed for additional building on the Millstone site, there has been some chatter that, despite its proximity to the water, it might be a good location for SMRs given that transmission and interconnections are already available.

Semancik at DEEP said the effects of climate change are considered when sites are selected. “You’re required to do a meteorological, hydrological study of all the sites, including what the potential exists going forward,” he said.

While Dominion has expressed interest in SMR development, Adams noted in a lengthy written response that their focus on SMRs at the moment is at a location in Virginia.

“While we’re not opposed to an SMR at Millstone Power Station, Connecticut might not have the regulatory environment for one. The upfront costs for an SMR, though less expensive than traditional nuclear, are significant enough that Connecticut’s deregulated market might not support such a project,” Adams said, echoing Dykes’ concern. “However, we still plan to work with Connecticut’s policymakers on potential paths to taking advantage of SMR’s next-generation nuclear technology.”

Now what?

Buongiorno offers three thoughts on why nuclear can still be considered worthwhile.

One is that in the face of Trump administration policies that don’t advocate decarbonization, if that is a still a state goal, nuclear is the lowest carbon energy source available and it’s scalable. Another is its reliability. It can run 24/7, which means it is stable and therefore keeps the grid stable. And third is its local economic benefits. It provides high-paying permanent jobs in addition to the initial construction jobs. And a facility will pay local taxes.

But he said: “If we need more power between now and the end of 2030, then nuclear can play a fairly limited role.”

And, of course, you have to be willing to pay. “But I got news for you — you got to be willing to pay for any of the energy technology that you choose,” Buongiorno said. “There is no free lunch.”

That’s something Dykes knows all too well.

“How do you do that? What will it cost? How can you de-risk it?” the DEEP commissioner asked. “How can we make sure the costs are shared equally among those who benefit from the investment?”

Former NRC Chair Macfarlane offers a stark answer when asked whether it’s realistic to move ahead with the new reactor designs.

“I don’t think so,” she said. “It depends on what you want to do. And if you either want to A, address climate change or B, address the energy needs from AI, … it means you have to address it immediately, like yesterday, and none of these technologies are available.”

She said it may be something to continue to develop and see if will work. But she said it will probably take a couple of decades to commercialize.

“To put all our treasure into nuclear right now is not very smart.”",https://assets.hartfordbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WCK_4724-scaled-e1763585120220-1-e1763985303997.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 10:01:22.415456

The mathematics of solar project economics has undergone fundamental changes over recent years. Module costs, which once represented 35-40% of total project capex, have fallen to around 20-30% of overall costs. While this might seem positive, Ksenia Dray explains that this shift has actually reduced developers’ ability to influence project economics solely through hardware procurement.

“The workforce today on a project accounts for much more than the main technology that will influence your yield for 35-40 years,” Dray notes. “It’s more about being able to secure contractors for the mechanical, electrical and civil works at competitive prices, rather than focusing solely on module costs.”

This transformation means that even with modules at historic lows – and expectations of potential increases of one to two cents – developers must look elsewhere to optimise project economics. The challenge is compounded by a shortage of contractors and other key personnel across many European markets, driving up labour costs precisely when developers need to reduce overall capex.

Revenue pressures and market realities

The revenue side of the equation presents equally significant challenges. Wholesale electricity prices have declined substantially across Europe, with markets seeing power purchase agreement (PPA) prices drop to €30-35/MWh (US$35-40), such as in the Nordics, and €50 or lower in Germany, Dray says. This creates a structural imbalance between project revenue potential and construction costs, compressing margins and undermining overall project profitability.

“Projects backed by CfDs or robust PPAs offer far greater bankability,” Dray explains. “Assured revenue streams improve debt capacity, stabilise returns and make the financing process much more efficient. Merchant-exposed projects, on the other hand, carry substantial price-volatility risk — particularly in markets experiencing frequent negative prices such as Germany, Spain, or France — which erodes expected revenues and lowers investor appetite.”

Investor expectations have shifted considerably. Today, capital is concentrating on projects that offer higher returns and a strong de-risked profile — meaning permits secured, grid connection confirmed, and limited exposure to price volatility. Standalone solar projects, especially those fully exposed to market prices and increasing negative-price events, often struggle to meet these elevated return requirements.

Strategic responses and cost optimisation

Faced with these constraints, developers are pursuing multiple strategies to maintain project viability. On the cost side, EPC prices have seen some reduction, falling below €390,000 per megawatt in Germany, or around £400,000 (US$523,000) per MW in the UK. However, Dray cautions that these figures generally reflect ‘vanilla’ projects with no site-specific complexities and minimal contingencies. In reality, most projects cannot reach these ultra-low cost levels, and this likely represents the limit of what can be achieved through traditional cost reductions alone.

“There’s a limit to where capex can drop,” she observes. “Projects are complex, and in the UK, for instance, archaeology constraints or drainage requirements can significantly increase costs. In other regions, rocky terrain or challenging ground conditions have a similar impact. These site-specific factors ultimately set a realistic floor on capex, and they must be carefully assessed, because they can materially influence the project’s overall profitability and the attractiveness of the initial investment.”

Alongside managing costs, developers are also looking more broadly at ways to optimise overall project performance. This includes strategic module selection, with some developers exploring back-contact modules to increase yield and capture additional revenue points. The emphasis on yield optimisation becomes critical when revenue per unit of generation is under pressure.

The rise of hybrid solutions

Perhaps the most significant strategic shift has been toward hybrid projects combining solar with battery storage, which are gaining prominence as developers seek ways to enhance project value. However, Dray cautions that hybrid projects aren’t a guaranteed route to higher profitability. “You can uplift a project’s economics by two to three percentage points with a hybrid configuration, but demonstrating that value is complex. The market is still maturing in terms of hybrid design, and credible hybrid revenue models — including hybrid PPAs — are only just emerging. Lenders and investors want to see a clear, proven revenue stack before they are comfortable financing these projects,” she says

The key challenge lies in the regulatory landscape. In many European markets, the rules for valuing storage and defining which grid services it can sell are still unclear. Relying solely on merchant participation in capacity or balancing markets introduces significant risk, and investors generally prefer more stable, predictable revenue streams.

“This uncertainty is why many banks and investors remain cautious,” Dray explains. “Without a clear and established framework for storage revenues, it’s difficult to underwrite long-term returns.”

Market outlook and industry adaptation

The cumulative effect of these challenges is becoming apparent in market dynamics. Solar Power Europe’s growth projections have been revised downward in H1 2025. The market is now expected to slightly contract to -1.4% in 2025 under the ‘medium scenario’, making it the first year of decline in nearly a decade, rather than the initially optimistic 7%. The high scenario now forecasts only a 1.1% growth.

M&A activity in the European renewables sector has slowed sharply, a trend closely tied to tightening project economics and a broader cooling of investor appetite for ‘green’ assets, which are now viewed as carrying higher risk and weaker returns.

Ksenia Dray suggests the industry may need to accept a shift in business models. “It’s not just about electricity prices— it’s the growing revenue volatility,” she says. “Storage can strengthen the revenue stack and improve risk-adjusted returns, whereas standalone solar is finding it increasingly difficult to remain competitive on its own.”

The challenging economics have also driven innovation in how transactions happen. Digital platforms are emerging to streamline M&A processes, reduce transaction costs and connect buyers with sellers more efficiently. One such example is the platform Nrdeal, which not only facilitates investments in renewable energy projects by connecting key actors, but also provides the market intelligence and advisor network needed to evaluate assets in a more complex economic environment. By reducing the administrative burden of transactions and providing better visibility into opportunities, platforms such as Nrdeal accelerate deal cycles in a market where investors are becoming increasingly selective.

Looking forward

The European solar industry stands at a crossroads. While the fundamental drivers for renewable energy deployment remain strong, the economic realities require a more sophisticated approach to project development and financing. Success increasingly depends on optimising every aspect of project economics – from innovative financing structures to strategic technology choices and revenue diversification through storage integration.

The challenge for developers is navigating this complexity while maintaining the scale of deployment needed to meet Europe’s 2030 renewable energy targets. As Ksenia Dray suggests, this will require continued innovation in project design, financing mechanisms and market structures to bridge the gap between current economics and deployment ambitions.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Ksenia-Dray-RES-Group-crop.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 11:04:05.890377

But very few are confronting the real threat that will decide whether any of these strategies succeed:

⚠️ A systemic skills shortage that is growing faster than investment, technology adoption, and policy development.

If capital, technology, data infrastructure, and government support are all increasing…

why are organisations still struggling to deliver?

Because innovation isn’t constrained by budget.

It’s constrained by people.

And right now, the UK is entering the most intense talent shortfall since the birth of the digital economy.

This isn’t a talent “challenge.” It’s a structural risk. And most organisations are still treating it as a hiring inconvenience.

A Perfect Storm: The Workforce Pressures Colliding at Once

Several forces are hitting UK employers at the same time — and all of them compound each other.

1️⃣ AI adoption is creating demand across every industry simultaneously

The Government’s AI Opportunities Action Plan estimates up to £400bn in economic potential but warns of a massive AI capability deficit.

Every sector is hiring for:

data specialists

model governance talent

AI ethicists

automation leads

AI-enabled R&D roles

This isn’t cyclical competition — it’s systemic.

2️⃣ Clean energy expansion is accelerating workforce demand

The Clean Energy Jobs Plan outlines a surge in:

grid modernisation

hydrogen production

wind, solar, nuclear, and fusion R&D

battery storage

sustainability leadership

environmental AI

These require hybrid digital–engineering–policy skillsets the market simply doesn’t have enough of.

3️⃣ R&D funding is driving spikes in specialist roles

£55bn of research investment across health, biotech, climate science, engineering, and frontier tech means academic and commercial R&D teams are pulling from overlapping talent pools. This is creating a hiring environment where:

research labs

clean tech startups

universities

defence suppliers

AI scale-ups

…are all chasing the same profiles.

4️⃣ Leadership capability isn’t keeping up with technological complexity

Emerging roles such as:

Chief AI Officer

Director of Net Zero Strategy

Head of Digital R&D

Director of Advanced Manufacturing

… require leaders who understand systems, regulation, data, policy, innovation, and compliance. These people are exceptionally rare — and the UK is behind global competitors.

5️⃣ Legacy HR models are collapsing under modern workforce demands

Most orgs still rely on:

static job descriptions

siloed hiring

rigid permanent-only recruitment

slow approval chains

outdated assessment frameworks

None of this works in high-innovation, high-ambiguity environments. Innovation is dynamic — your hiring strategy must be too.

The Outcome? A National Workforce Crunch That Will Slow Innovation

We’re already seeing consequences across the market:

🔸 AI projects paused because governance roles can’t be filled

🔸 Clean energy programmes delayed due to engineering shortages

🔸 R&D cycles slowing due to a lack of cross-disciplinary scientists

🔸 Public sector transformation programmes stalled due to skill gaps

🔸 Competition driving salaries up 20–40% in some capability areas

🔸 Organisations hiring reactively instead of strategically

And here’s the blunt reality:

If you don’t solve your workforce strategy now, your innovation strategy will fail later.

This is the new board-level risk very few leaders are prepared for.

The Biggest Mistake Exec Teams Are Making Right Now

Most organisations respond to skills shortages with a simple tactic:

👉 “Increase the salary and post the role again.”

This is not a strategy. It is a reaction.

And it guarantees you will lose the talent race.

The real solution is not competing harder for scarce people…it is designing a smarter workforce model.

That means looking beyond job titles and instead building capability frameworks aligned to emerging markets.

First Solar CEO Mark Widmar said: “This is more than just a manufacturing facility.
""First Solar opens AI-enabled solar manufacturing facility in Louisiana "" was originally created and published by Power Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.","First Solar has opened its new AI-enabled solar manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana, marking a significant expansion of its US manufacturing footprint.

The fully vertically integrated $1.1bn facility spans roughly 2.4 million square feet and uses advanced AI technologies in its manufacturing processes to automatically detect defects in solar panels during production.

The company said that production at the Louisiana facility began in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule.

First Solar attributed the accelerated timeline to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and trade policies enacted during the Trump administration, which increased demand for American-made solar technology compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern guidance.

The facility manufactures First Solar’s Series 7 modules using domestically sourced materials, including glass from Illinois and Ohio and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into back rails in Louisiana.

Louisiana governor Jeff Landry said: “First Solar’s investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses.

“This is exactly how we advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we’re strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.”

The Iberia Parish facility employs more than 700 people and is expected to employ 826 employees by the end of the year.

Once fully operational, the facility will add 3.5GW of annual nameplate capacity, expanding First Solar’s total American manufacturing footprint to 14GW in 2026 and 17.7GW in 2027.

The Louisiana facility is part of the reportedly largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere.

This foorprint includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing plants in Ohio, one in Alabama, and R&D centres in Ohio and California.

First Solar CEO Mark Widmar said: “This is more than just a manufacturing facility. It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity.

“By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we’re demonstrating that US reindustrialisation isn’t just a thesis, it’s an operating reality.”

Recently, First Solar announced plans to invest in a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 modules initiated by its international fleet.

By the end of 2026, the company expects to employ over 5,500 people in the US and to have invested approximately $4.5bn in domestic manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

Comments on the hydropower NOI are due 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.","The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has initiated a formal inquiry into whether certain routine operations at licensed hydropower facilities should be approved under blanket authorisations rather than individual case-by-case orders. This move is part of a broader effort to streamline federal permitting of energy infrastructure.

At its meeting on November 20, the Commission voted to issue two Notices of Inquiry (NOIs). One (Docket RM26-3-000) seeks comment on changes to the hydropower licensing process under the Federal Power Act (FPA) – specifically on whether maintenance, repairs, upgrades and other post-licencing activities at hydroelectric projects can proceed without project-specific FERC orders.

The other NOI (Docket RM26-2-000) covers similar procedural questions for LNG facilities.

FERC Chair Laura Swett said: “Energy infrastructure needs to be built now, and existing projects need to be maintained efficiently to ensure grid reliability today and in the future. We are taking a hard look at our processes and ways we can simplify certain activities.”

Hydropower facilities operating under FERC licences must obtain authorisation for many kinds of changes, even post-licence. The National Hydropower Association (NHA) in the US has long maintained that the process of licensing, relicensing and amendments is burdensome. For example, the NHA has noted that nearly half of the non-federal US hydropower fleet is due for licence renewal by 2035, and that delays and high costs are causing licensees in some cases to consider decommissioning rather than relicensing.

In their view, allowing defined “routine” activities under blanket authorisations could reduce regulatory burden, give project owners greater certainty and support grid reliability.

With the NOI in place, FERC will collect stakeholder input on which types of hydropower activities could be eligible for blanket authorisation and under what terms — safety, environmental protection, maintenance of fish-passage and other conditions remain key considerations. After the comment period ends, FERC may propose rule changes or adopt new policies.

Beyond the long negotiations, changing drafts and political statements, the real gains for India lie in a mix of modest progress, clearer expectations and one major announcement that came from New Delhi itself.

FRAMEWORK BUT NO MAJOR WINS

India did not walk away from COP30 with dramatic breakthroughs.

There was no new climate fund designed specifically for emerging economies, no binding fossil fuel phaseout decision, and no separate adaptation package that directly addressed India’s vulnerabilities.

Still, the final text did reinforce global principles that India has long defended, particularly equity, climate justice and the idea of a just transition.

While these may not count as headline-grabbing victories, they strengthen India’s negotiating foundation for upcoming climate rounds and help clarify what global commitments will look like over the next decade.

NEW NDCs SOON

The most concrete milestone for India at COP30 was something it announced, rather than something it received.

New Delhi finally announced its updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), laying out clearer targets for cutting emissions, renewable energy growth and adaptation efforts through 2035.

These updated NDCs matter because they give India a firmer roadmap for climate action at home while also making it easier to attract international partnerships and investments. Prior to the announcement, India's 2035 NDCs had attracted major attention due to a delayed announcement, which finally came noting the targets are to be announced in December of this year.

In many ways, the NDC announcement was India’s strongest substantive contribution to the summit.

TECHNICAL, INDUSTRIAL TRANSITION SUPPORT

India also gained quieter, but still important, momentum in industrial transition partnerships.

During the LeadIT roundtable, several countries renewed support for India’s shift toward low-carbon manufacturing, green hydrogen development and technology-sharing.

These aren’t formal agreements with new numbers attached, but they strengthen the practical collaborations India relies on to meet its long-term decarbonisation goals.

In a summit where major breakthroughs remained elusive, these incremental gains were amongst the most realistic outcomes.

CLIMATE FINANCE GROWTH

Climate finance remains India’s biggest sticking point.

At COP30, India pushed for predictable, accessible funding for both mitigation and adaptation. While the final text did call for scaling up finance and reforming global financial institutions, no binding commitments or new mechanisms emerged.

India leaves Belem with clearer expectations but without concrete new financial resources in hand.

THEN, WHAT DID INDIA GAIN?

India’s gains were modest but meaningful.

The most populous country did not secure large, immediate wins. Yet, it strengthened its position on equity and just transitions, reaffirmed global support for its industrial transformation, and most importantly, locked in updated NDCs that offer a concrete, actionable roadmap for the coming decade.

This was not a summit of dramatic breakthroughs for India, but it was one of consolidation, clarity and subtly reinforcing the foundations for the bigger climate battles ahead.

From the Poconos to the Jersey Shore to the mouth of the Delaware Bay, what do you want to know about climate change? What would you like us to cover? Get in touch.

A South Philly native and former climate advisor for the Biden administration is running to replace Dwight Evans as the representative for Pennsylvania’s 3rd Congressional District. The crowded field now includes 10 Democratic candidates who will face off in the primary on May 19.

Pablo Iván McConnie-Saad said he’s focused on the connection between affordability and climate change.

“I think people don’t necessarily make that connection,” McConnie-Saad told WHYY News. “But, I think climate change is raising the cost of food, and obviously we’re experiencing increasing energy costs, and that’s also a result of climate change.”

McConnie-Saad pointed to the impact of high heat and floods on food production, which a recent study found is driving up prices.

The Bella Vista resident also said he’s about to be a father.

“It’s not just for myself, it’s also for the next generation,” McConnie-Saad said. “We have to focus on climate. It’s an existential crisis.”

McConnie-Saad worked for the U.S. Department of the Treasury, helping to increase the use of available funds through the Inflation Reduction Act, former President Joe Biden’s signature climate initiative that encouraged clean energy production and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions through tax credits, rebates and incentives.

Since taking control of the White House, President Donald Trump has worked to dismantle the initiative and claw back much of the funding. Still, McConnie-Saad said Pennsylvania gained $700 million in investments from the Inflation Reduction Act.

“It was working at the individual level,” McConnie-Saad said. “At the household level, at the organizational level, so small businesses could benefit from it, and so could local governments and state governments. It was providing an opportunity for municipalities, nonprofit, tax-exempt, faith-based organizations to invest and make the transition to renewables, and that was gonna bring down the cost for everyone.”

While affordability is front and center for voters, climate change is not, said Democratic political consultant Neil Oxman.

“If Greenland melted tomorrow, climate would be the No. 1 issue,” Oxman said. “But Greenland’s not melting tomorrow. And so the number one issue is the economic strain that people have.”

McConnie-Saad has also taken aim at the current politicians in the race — state Sen. Sharif Street, state Rep. Chris Raab and state Rep. Morgan Cephas. The rest of the field includes two doctors, Ala Stanford and David Oxman, real estate developer Isaiah Martin, Temple University computer science professor Karl Morris, software engineer Cole Carter, and former city employee Robin Toldins.

But McConnie-Saad has the same problem that nine other candidates in the race have. Street, son of former Philadelphia mayor John Street, has a clear advantage through family name recognition, fundraising abilities and a strong base in a part of the city where voters have cast ballots for a candidate named Street for decades.

The 3rd Congressional District encompasses all of West and Southwest Philly, along with Center City, North and Northwest Philadelphia west of Broad Street. It also represents a section of South Philadelphia that includes McConnie-Saad’s Bella Vista neighborhood.

“It’s been a long time that people in there have voted for somebody named Street,” Oxman said.

While Oxman said it will be hard for anyone other than Sharif Street to gain traction in such a crowded field, it is possible, especially if several end up dropping out and putting their energy behind one of their current rivals.

McConnie-Saad, who grew up one of four boys in a Puerto Rican family, said he lived in six different South Philly houses by the time he was 17. McConnie-Saad got a Quaker education as a scholarship student at Germantown Friends School. He then earned a bachelor’s degree at Oberlin College, followed by a master’s and doctorate from the University of Delaware. He said he can distinguish himself through his Beltway experience.

“I’ve been in Washington. I have a Ph.D in urban affairs and public policy,” he said.

He also believes in standing strong against Trump and aligns himself with the Democratic Socialists of America, the ranks of which include the likes of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and mayor-elect of New York City, Zohran Mamdani.

“I’m very disappointed in the Senate Democrats that have caved on the shutdown,” McConnie-Saad said. “It’s tantamount to a union organization going on strike and then not gaining any concessions from management. This is an instance where I think we talk about standing up to the Trump administration. I’m arguing that we should be calling for general strikes.”

This landmark agreement marks a pivotal step in the establishment of MU CITY — a City of Dynamic Innovation in Energy, Mobility, and Urbanization, designed to accelerate Southeast Asia’s transition toward a low-carbon, digital, and inclusive future.

Signed in collaboration with the Karimun Regency Government, the agreement affirms a shared commitment to building a next-generation integrated industrial and innovation ecosystem. MU CITY is now firmly positioned as a regional gateway for clean energy, green manufacturing, advanced e-mobility, and data-driven intelligence — supporting Indonesia’s national roadmap for renewable energy and digital transformation. The MU CITY development represents an estimated USD 2.3 billion investment over the next three years, making it the largest single investment in Karimun to date.

A Dynamic City for the New Energy Era

Spanning 4,000 hectares, MU CITY will be powered by up to 2 gigawatts (GW) of solar power and an additional 2 GW of gas-based power, making it one of Southeast Asia’s largest integrated sustainable energy ecosystems. A major portion of this capacity will power the local industrial zones, data campuses, and mobility manufacturing clusters within MU CITY, while the remainder will be allocated for clean energy exports to ASEAN nations — reinforcing Indonesia’s role as a regional energy provider.

MU CITY will integrate three complementary development zones:

Clean Energy Hub – Anchored by large-scale solar power plants, advanced battery energy storage systems (BESS), LNG import facilities, CCGTs and blue ammonia tank complexes to support domestic decarbonization and regional export markets. This hub will serve as MU CITY‘s energy backbone.

Mobility & Manufacturing Hub – Dedicated to clean transportation innovation through electric vehicle assembly, battery manufacturing, AI chip ecosystems, and green industrial production aligned with Indonesia’s vision for electric mobility and advanced manufacturing.

AI & Digital Infrastructure Hub – Powering up to 1.21 GW of hyperscale data center capacity, purpose-built for artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and high-performance digital workloads — all powered by renewable energy generated within MU CITY.

Together, these interconnected hubs will position MU CITY as a leading force in clean innovation and digital transformation, redefining how energy, technology, and mobility harmonize with people and the planet.

Empowering Local Communities Through Partnership

Through close collaboration with the Karimun Regency Government, Aslan is implementing a cooperative and inclusive development model in which over 10,000 local residents actively participate and benefit from the project’s growth. This model offers opportunities for profit-sharing, equity participation, education programs, and technical training — ensuring that communities are true stakeholders in progress.

“MU stands for Mobility and Utility, and the Greek symbol μ reflects precision, high-performance computation, and technological innovation. MU CITY is a living example of how clean energy, digital innovation, and inclusive prosperity can thrive together. By empowering local communities to participate directly, we are proving that sustainability can be both profitable and people-centered,” said Dr. Muthu Chezhian, CEO of Aslan Energy Capital.

“Karimun proudly welcomes this partnership with Aslan Energy Capital as a meaningful step toward building a stronger, more sustainable local economy. We are confident that MU CITY will bring long-term benefits and the development of MU CITY not only brings clean technology and energy, but also opens up opportunities for employment, education, and ownership for the people of Karimun. We are committed to making this project a symbol of sustainable and inclusive progress,” said the Regent of Karimun Ing. H. Iskandarsyah.

Local communities have led Helene recovery, but federal support has fallen far short of what’s needed.

Federal reimbursement is only 9%, far lower than in past disasters.

FEMA dysfunction and political efforts to weaken the agency have delayed aid.

The damage Hurricane Helene inflicted on Western North Carolina last year borders on incalculable. The efforts of Western North Carolinians to rebuild during the past year stand among the greatest displays of resilience and courage in recent memory. Local residents led the recovery, supported by mutual aid networks and faith communities that provided critical assistance in the weeks and months after the storm. Despite this extraordinary work, the long-term recovery has become a source of frustration due to the lack of substantial federal support.

In September, Governor Stein requested both increased federal funding and the release of federal dollars already promised to Western North Carolina. His office outlined these concerns in a formal federal funding request, noting: “State and local governments and private corporations and charities are contributing billions collectively to this work, but their efforts alone cannot restore our communities.” The inadequate federal response reflects the consequences of disruptive federal reorganization and efforts by the Trump administration to limit support for Americans affected by disasters.

The Federal Response

The federal government traditionally plays a major role in helping communities rebuild after natural disasters. These recovery efforts often require more resources and expertise than local governments can provide. Disasters also affect multiple states, which creates a need for federal coordination. Hurricane Helene caused damage across ten states, underscoring this point.

FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was created in 1979 to support communities before, during, and after disasters. Its mission is wide-ranging and demands sustained federal commitment. FEMA works alongside other agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Labor, Health and Human Services, and the EPA. The USDA has also outlined its role through its post-Helene recovery initiatives.

Historically, the federal government has provided significant financial support for major disasters. As Governor Stein noted, federal support covered 78% of the economic damage caused by Hurricane Sandy, 73% for Hurricanes Maria and Katrina, 60% for Gustav, and 53% for Matthew. Yet for Helene, the federal government has thus far covered only 9%.

Why Has the Government Been So Unhelpful?

Two major factors explain the lack of federal support.

The first is mismanagement. Instability within the Trump administration has directly affected FEMA. The agency is already on its third director this year, following the resignations of David Richardson and Karen Evans, both of whom were appointed without emergency management experience. Reporting in The New York Times examined Richardson’s troubled tenure and departure in detail through a review of FEMA leadership turmoil. His predecessor, Cameron Hamilton, was dismissed only a day after testifying to Congress that FEMA remained essential to communities in crisis, as documented in a separate news report.

This mismanagement aligns with a larger deliberate effort to weaken, eventually eliminate, FEMA. Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem have both advocated for dismantling the agency. A broader analysis of this agenda, including its fiscal and humanitarian implications, appears in a Carnegie Endowment assessment of the administration’s push to abolish FEMA. The lack of federal support for Helene recovery is therefore not only a result of bureaucratic dysfunction but also part of a larger political project to withdraw the federal government from disaster response.

As FEMA resources to help rebuild the devastation in Western North Carolina have ground to a halt, the consequences have been noticed by political leaders in both parties. Just weeks ago, none other than Republican U.S. Senator Ted Budd blocked three Senate nominees submitted by President Donald Trump’s White House to demand action from FEMA. Specifically, Senator Budd asked the Department of Homeland Security (under which FEMA operates) to approve $64 million in reimbursements to North Carolina county governments, which are long overdue to be paid. Remarkably, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem released $12 million of those reimbursements the very same day following Senator Budd’s action.

This is good news for Western North Carolina (though we’re still waiting on the remaining $52 million). But what it also reveals is that a faster response is, in fact, entirely possible – those in charge in Washington simply aren’t doing it.

Consequences for Western North Carolina

Communities in Western North Carolina have felt these failures acutely. Disaster recovery leaders have repeatedly warned that federal delays are slowing progress. Avery County Commissioner Dennis Aldridge described FEMA as “our biggest obstacle,” a point highlighted in WRAL’s reporting. Avery County has already spent approximately $50 million on recovery and cleanup, despite having an annual operating budget of just $42 million. FEMA has agreed in principle to reimburse many of these expenses, but payments have been slow. Several news outlets have documented these delays, including WRAL’s coverage of counties pushed to their limits by slow FEMA reimbursements and The Washington Post’s analysis of stalled federal payments.

The recovery process is far from complete, and slow federal action only makes it harder for communities to rebuild. A federal government that restricts FEMA’s ability to operate effectively creates further harm. In response, Attorney General Jeff Jackson has filed suit against the federal government for withholding disaster relief funds, as reported by ABC11. A system that forces states to sue for congressionally approved disaster funds is deeply flawed.

Western North Carolina deserves a federal partner that will show up when disaster strikes. So do communities across the country. Anything less is its own form of disaster.",https://carolinaforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Helene-Swananoa-.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 12:04:17.714946

She added that Indigenous peoples are the caretakers of 84% of the world's biodiversity and rainforests, which are key to reversing the effects of climate change.
“This is not just an economic discussion or an environmental discussion.","As countries debated a transitional path to clean energy usage, hundreds of faith-based organizations worldwide committed to divest from climate-warming fossil fuels during the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Belém, Brazil.

""We also want to assume our responsibility before God and humanity for what happens with our money and what happens to God's creation,"" said Pastor Neddy Astudillo of Tampa.

She attended the gathering, known as the 30th Conference of the Parties or COP30, as a delegate from Presbyterian Church USA. The 12-day event ended Friday.

""It was very good to be there as a Latina living in Florida, living in a state where the government has erased the word ‘climate change’ from its web page,"" Astudillo said.

Astudillo was invited to speak at a parallel event called the People's Summit, which amplifies voices from undeserved communities most impacted by global warming.

In her talk, she described how environmental racism, human rights and democracy are connected, illustrating her point through current events in Florida.

""The difficulty that we have in Florida of passing laws to protect migrant farmworkers from the increasing heat waves,"" Astudillo said.

“Another example is the building of the 'Alligator Alcatraz' detention center … built in an already climate-vulnerable ecosystem without a prior environmental impact study on the already threatened species, and without the involvement and approval of the Miccosukee people who live and are impacted by the presence of the detention center. Not to mention the impact that this place has on immigrant communities in Florida who are fearing deportation.”

Astudillo said the meeting's location in the Amazon allowed about 900 Indigenous delegates to attend.

""It is a statement of the kind of people who also need to be present in the negotiations, whose lives are being threatened, and whose culture and worldviews and spiritualities also have a say,"" Astudillo said.

She added that Indigenous peoples are the caretakers of 84% of the world's biodiversity and rainforests, which are key to reversing the effects of climate change.

Astudillo is concerned about the location of the next COP in Turkey.

“The last two COPs before Brazil happened in countries that did not have the same freedom for public participation: conversation and marches and the social movements, expressions during the COP,” Astudillo said.

“I'm not sure how it's going to be happening in Turkey, but at least as a Latina, a COP in Latin America provided a space for many more voices to be included in the conversation.”

This was her fifth COP, having attended the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, when the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was established to guide future climate negotiations.

Astudillo’s husband, Thomas Spaulding, was also there in 1992. He was asked by the national leadership of the YMCA of the USA to take a role in that process.

He was a member of the observer in the U.S. delegation at a time when President George H.W. Bush famously said ""the American way of life is not up for negotiation.""

“The American way of life should be something about … we all win when the Earth can thrive,” said Spaulding.

“This is not just an economic discussion or an environmental discussion. This is a cultural discussion … and that's one of the reasons why I think the faith community's roles are so important, because it's about morals. It's about ethics. Who are we as a people? What are we passing to our children and our grandchildren and their children?”

Astudillo mentioned moving words from a former delegate of the Philippines with a similar sentiment.

“He said that the climate battles that we face today will not be won in the chambers of the U.N. climate talks,"" Astudillo said, ""but in people's hearts, and that's where faith communities can make a difference.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b997349/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fa7%2F99ccd2db4a88b04b6f0ec7c59095%2Fneddy-astudillo-speakinhg-at-the-people-summit-cop30.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 10:02:07.464267

Real, artificial.","'Tis the season for Tannenbaum. It’s just a matter of which one.

The choices can seem overwhelming at first: Will a blue spruce fill the house with the sharp scent of balsam better than a white pine? Will a 15-foot fir fit in the living room, and what colored lights should you drape on its needles this year?

Beyond the aesthetics, you might wonder if it’s more eco-friendly to cut down a real tree or purchase an artificial one. We dug into the debate to find out which option is more sustainable.

The case for artificial trees

Over the next month and a half, Christmas tree farmer Tom Dull expects to see more than 25,000 people walk through the grounds of Dull’s Tree Farm. Various species of evergreen trees, ranging from three to 16 feet tall, sit in neat rows across 65-acres nestled in the rolling hills of Thorntown, Indiana. Many folks who visit the farm this season will leave with one of the trees in tow.

Dull is convinced that real trees like his are more environmentally-friendly than artificial ones.

“It’s an easy argument to win,” he said, adding real Christmas trees are “recyclable, they’re renewable, they’re good for wildlife.”

However, Dull acknowledged, some people have an aversion to chopping down real trees year after year. Looming threats of climate change and headlines with news of deforestation might mar the twinkling memories of stooping in the snow, surrounded by family, to saw through the trunk of a living tree.

But Christmas tree farms aren’t exactly forests under siege; they’re actual farms. And the 65,000 trees on Dull’s farm that store carbon, breathe out oxygen and create habitat for wildlife might not have existed if Dull’s first dream — to be a hog farmer — worked out.

Still, many environmentalists argue that agriculture and development are leading drivers of habitat loss in Indiana and the Midwest. More than 14 of Indiana's 23 million acres were cultivated as cropland in 2022, according to the Indiana State Department of Agriculture, and 448 native plant species are endangered or threatened in the state.

Although he did not deliberately set out to do so, Dull created a wildlife habitat on his tree farm, something a hog farm would likely never have accomplished. Dull and his employees have seen deer, coyotes, foxes, rabbits, quail, mice, snakes — and once, even a bobcat — snaking through the fields of pine, fir and spruce.

Dull, whose species of choice is a concolor fir, said that he plants more trees than his customers chop down. He expects to sell around 6,500 trees this year and plant 10,000 more in 2026.

The case for artificial trees

Jami Warner, the executive director of the American Christmas Tree Association (ACTA), a trade group representing the artificial Christmas tree industry, thinks that the carbon footprint of either type of tree is ""really quite small,"" especially when you consider how long consumers keep artificial trees.

""An artificial tree is an investment. It is something you use year after year. It's the epitome of sustainability,"" she said. ""Our members have customers who have kept their trees for years and years and years, and they pass them down from generation to generation. They become sort of heirlooms.""

Much of a real tree's environmental impact comes from its disposal, so an artificial tree's long lifespan works in its favor in the battle for the greenest tree award.

An assessment commissioned by the ACTA in 2017 showed that buying an artificial tree has a ""more favorable effect on the environment"" than real trees if kept for at least five years, Warner said.

But transportation emissions — artificial trees are often imported from China — and the plastic manufacturing required to replicate small green pine needles still concern consumers. Warner said some companies, like Balsam Hill, are leaning into new technology, such as plant-based plastics, but most artificial trees are still made from steel and resin.

Buying a new artificial Christmas tree each year probably isn't as eco-friendly as buying a live one annually, but Warner said she thinks most Americans keep their artificial trees for around a decade.

And for some folks, an artificial tree is the only option.

Families living in small apartments, people with limited mobility or someone worried about fire safety might prefer an artificial tree. In fact, more than 80% of the country does, according to the ACTA.

Evergreen disposal matters

Perhaps the most environmentally impactful part of a tree’s life cycle, real or artificial, is where it is laid to rest.

On Dull’s tree farm, some trees that don’t get sold are tossed into the property’s pond where they create habitat and offer protection for the fish, Dull said.

In his eyes, the plastic of artificial Christmas trees makes the real thing far superior.

“You buy a fake tree; it's made out of petroleum,"" he said. ""You throw it away; it stays a landfill for who knows how long.""

Despite a rising demand for artificial trees, the real Christmas tree industry still woos a fair amount of Hoosiers: there are more than 200 Christmas tree farms in Indiana, creating habitat for wildlife in agricultural parts of the state and supporting local economies. Dull's Tree Farm employs more than 170 locals during the pumpkin and Christmas tree seasons, including many young people.

In the true holiday spirit, Warner thinks choosing the right tree all comes down to personal preference and circumstance.

""There is no such thing as a bad Christmas tree,"" she said. ""They're all beautiful. Real, artificial. Charlie Brown, tall, short, one-sided, multicolored, whatever. There is a perfect Christmas tree out there for everyone.""

Orange County resident Jamie McConnell read about PFAS in biosolids and what other states have done to curb the risk.","A flush of a toilet, the rinse of a washing machine, or the discharge from factories – it all ends up as wastewater. That waste is then treated and made into a sludge called biosolids. Biosolids can be converted to agricultural fertilizer and by using it, many farmers in Virginia may be unknowingly spreading toxic chemicals on their land that could end up in crops and the state’s waterways.

As state Sen. Richard Stuart, R-King George, said in a recent State Water Commission hearing, “we don’t want it to go in the river anymore, for goodness’ sake.”

Biosolids can contain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which pose serious health risks if people are exposed to them in higher amounts. The danger has led some states to outright ban, or enact stricter requirements in the use of biosolids, and prompted calls from some Virginia communities to do the same.

PFAS are everywhere; Virginia doesn’t test for them in biosolids

Forever chemicals are in hundreds of products we use every day, from nonstick cookware to takeout food packaging and even dental floss. They take hundreds of years to break down and can be a serious challenge to remove from the environment. The use of these chemicals started around the 1940s and has only expanded with time.

Being exposed over long durations and frequent occurrences to PFAS increases the risk of the chemicals interfering with the body’s natural hormones, possibly increasing cholesterol levels, lowering women’ s chances of getting pregnant, affecting the immune system, or boosting the risk of certain cancers.

The hangup for many community members and lawmakers is that Virginia does not test biosolids to see if there are high concentrations of PFAS in them.

The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality does sample rivers and creeks across the commonwealth to look for the presence of PFAS, however, that data dashboard was disabled on the agency’s website during the course of writing this story.

DEQ is not required to test biosolids for the presence of PFAS under current law. A map provided by the agency shows that biosolid permits have been granted in almost all corners of the commonwealth, but the map has not been updated in five years.

The federal Environmental Protection Agency put out a draft assessment on the risk two chemicals in the PFAS family pose on farmers with amounts as small as one part per billion. However, the report did not call for the regulation of those chemicals when they are found in biosolids.

Maine became the first state to ban the use of biosolids after multiple farms were shut down after extreme levels of PFAS were detected in soil, livestock, and even farmers’ blood where biosolids had been spread nearby. Well water at these farms had also been poisoned by the chemicals. The state has set up a fund to aid farmers who may have had to halt their production due to the presence of PFAS.

Michigan prohibits the use of highly contaminated biosolids from being used, but still lets some be spread on the very small amount of land that still uses biosolids. Meanwhile, Virginia only regulates setbacks from wells and homes during the spreading of the sludge as well as nutrient management plans for the fields.

Researchers, communities press for PFAS protection

At Virginia Tech, Shilai Hao researches analysis of PFAS in the environment and is looking for ways to permanently remove it. He said that people are commonly exposed to forever chemicals by way of the products they use. Hao said it is critical for the state government to be testing biosolids due to the concentration of those chemicals in one source.

“Testing helps agricultural producers understand whether biosolids-derived products are safe to apply on their farms. It also helps wastewater treatment plants decide how biosolids should be managed or disposed of to reduce PFAS-related risks,” Hao said.

One of the companies that provides biosolids in Virginia is Synagro. It is in the process of getting permits reissued in multiple counties. A spokesperson for the company said “Synagro is a passive receiver of PFAS from municipalities, who themselves are passive receivers from their customers.”

The spokesperson went on to say that Synagro supports potential legislation to remove PFAS at the source or to implement discharge limitations for manufacturers to stop it from ending up in wastewater.

The Shenandoah Valley has a concentration of biosolid permits issued near Charlottesville, according to the 2020 map. At the University of Virginia, Bryan Berger is researching how PFAS end up in soil and food. He said that despite PFAS being basically ubiquitous, biosolids still pose a higher risk.

“There’s a direct correlation between PFAS application and PFAS levels in drinking water and blood serum. At minimum, you’d want to test because you don’t want to have that,” Berger said. “Why do that to yourself, expose yourself to that risk?”

The concern over biosolids is not new in Virginia. Stuart Overbey lives in Albemarle County, where she is trying to raise awareness for years about the farms in her area that have permits to spread biosolids. She said in the summer of 2024, when spreading was happening near her house, the substance was all over the roads.

“You had to roll up your windows, turn off your AC. It’s not like cow manure smell or even chicken manure. It’s like death. It’s like your body reacts,” Overbey said.

She has been collecting stories of people across Virginia who say their health and well water quality declined after neighbors used biosolids. She’s joined forces with groups like the Piedmont Environmental Council and community advocates in Orange and Albemarle counties to request public hearings for the permit requests and renewals for the biosolid companies.

In Virginia, counties can pass ordinances requiring the testing and monitoring of biosolids. Overbey has written a draft for her county but it has not been taken up by the Board of Supervisors yet.

The permits in each county last for 10 years and additional land can be added between each permit. In Orange County, Synagro is currently going through the process to add 200 acres to their permit and remove 1178 acres for a total of 2564 acres permitted for the sludge.

Orange County resident Jamie McConnell read about PFAS in biosolids and what other states have done to curb the risk. When he first learned about it he didn’t know how to try and stop it from being used in his community. Now he’s pressing the state to take action.

“They didn’t know the extent to which it’s contaminated. It’s an outrage at the DEQ that they won’t test. It’s silly,” McConnell said.

At an October meeting, dozens of community members showed up to a hearing about the reissuance of the Orange permit. Some of the land in the permit is near Pamunkey Creek.

The chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, R. Mark Johnson, wrote to DEQ to alert the agency that PFAS has already been detected in the creek. Johnson wrote that the board is not against the use of biosolids for fertilizer, but they want to ensure farmers are aware of potential contaminants.

“Our farmers deserve to know what they’re putting on their land, and our citizens deserve protection from forever chemicals,” Johnson said in his letter.

Alternatives to biosolids

With biosolids being a cheaper option for farmers who need to use fertilizers on their land, many are asking what can be done to reduce the need for it.

On a windy November afternoon outside of Charlottesville, Massey Teel coils up a wire on his land to let cows, sheep, goats and donkeys shift over to a new small quadrant of land, part of the process of regenerative farming.

Every day he moves his livestock to a new roped off area of his land to feed and drop their own waste. He doesn’t put them back in the same area for months to allow for the natural fertilizers to work into the land and the grasses to grow back.

The land he works on had been leased to a previous farmer who had used biosolids in the past. Teel said he understands something has to be done with the waste – but there needs to be more done to help the environment and preserve farmland.

Teel said often, crops are grown and cattle are raised in ways that don’t allow the land to naturally regenerate nutrients, leading farmers to need the fertilizer.

“It’s not just that those biosolids are being put down there or any other fertilizers being put down there, but because they have poor ground cover and every time it rains, a huge amount of that fertilizer is going to flow downstream,” Teel said. “ And it has all sorts of negative effects for our watersheds all the way down to the bay.”

There are ways to reduce that need, protect the land from runoff and save farmers money, Teel said, including more oversight from state authorities.

“As far as I’m concerned, a little more regulation is not a bad thing,” Teel added.

In Richmond, lawmakers are debating how to protect their constituents who increasingly reach out to them with their worries about the chemicals in biosolids.

Stuart, the state senator representing King George, said Maryland recently set limitations to how many parts per billion of PFAS found in the sludge can be allowed in order to spread the substance on agricultural land. That often leads to Maryland’s biosolids being shipped over to Virginia, which does not have such limits.

He said he plans to bring legislation in the 2026 General Assembly to set limits and require testing. He would prefer to have a zero tolerance, he said in an interview, but understands that may not be fair to industry.

“I think it’s important that you go, we at least meet or go below Maryland’s threshold, because if we don’t, they’re going to keep sending it across the river with us,” Stuart said. “The EPA guidelines are much higher than Maryland’s threshold. So we’re not going to be able to rely on the EPA.”

With the strong pushback from communities in Orange county as well as Essex County, Synagro has put a pause on the Essex permit process to see how things play out in Orange, a DEQ representative told the Water Control Board last week.

Legislators will decide the next steps for PFAS testing of biosolids in the upcoming General Assembly session in January. If they fail to take action, there could be negative consequences for Virginia’s agricultural industry and communities, some experts warn.

“If we just let this come to pass, and we apply these biosolids and we don’t test we can look at places like Maine as an outcome, right? Where there’s now dairy cattle and milk, which is heavily contaminated to the point that, you know, farmers have to dump the milk and can’t sell it anymore and you can’t just clean it up. That farmland is lost,” UVA’s Berger said.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1115-2048x1536.jpeg,N,,2025-11-24 10:03:33.675407

The International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook 2025 confirms that electricity is quickly becoming the backbone of the global energy system. Electricity demand is soaring. Renewables are continuing to rise globally. But Governments are too slow in delivering the infrastructure needed to electrify industry, mobility and heating. And they need to address new supply chain risks.

This month the International Energy Agency (IEA) published its World Energy Outlook 2025 in which it claims that the world has entered the “age of electricity”.

The IEA estimates that electricity demand will rise by 40–50% by 2035, driven by electrified industry, transport, digitalisation and heating. Investment in electricity supply and electrification already accounts for half of today’s global energy investment. Global investment in data centres is expected to reach $580 billion in 2025.

To meet this electricity demand, renewables – wind and solar in particular – will continue to rise globally, the IEA’s Outlook states. Renewables are the fastest-growing energy source in all scenarios presented in the World Energy Outlook.

More investments in grids and storage required

The message from this year’s World Energy Outlook is clear. Europe must accelerate wind energy deployment and build electricity grids that can match this buildout.

Investments in electricity generation have charged ahead by almost 70% since 2015. But annual grid spending has risen at less than half that pace. Electricity connections and storage are lagging. This creates grid congestion, higher electricity prices and curtailed renewables output.

Without faster permitting and investment in infrastructure, Europe will fall behind in the “age of electricity”. It will lose its position as technology leader in clean tech. And it will put its economic competitiveness at risk, as China is pushing ahead, electrifying their economies. The “age of electricity” in short: the future is electric – and renewables are leading the charge.

Energy security depends on the grid. That’s the message from COP30, the IEA’s World Energy Outlook – and from anyone who wants cheaper, cleaner energy. The European Commission is set to present its EU Grids Package on 10 December to fix bottlenecks in Europe’s electricity system. What should it do?

Align grid planning with energy policy. Make sure investments happen.

Push anticipatory investments. The grid must be ready for new renewables.

Filter out speculative connection requests. Prioritise strategic projects.

Boost EU funding and EIB financing. It’s cheaper than paying for congestion.

Incentivise optimisation of existing grids. Dynamic line rating can unlock capacity.

Prioritise connections for combined wind, solar and storage projects.

Drive a regional approach with more cross-border interconnections.

Speed up permitting. Treat grids as overriding public interest – but keep ambitious wind deadlines.

Improve procurement. Long-term contracts and clear goals cut costs.

Support grid equipment manufacturing. Europe needs more transformer factories. Follow the wind supply chain model.

This will help unlock GW of wind energy currently waiting for their grid connection permits. Now Member States will have to move fast to implement it.",https://windeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/grids-meet-renewable-conference.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 08:00:42.269673

Having grown up on that farm, he knew about flora, fauna and other nature. So when his public-policy career started draining him and he'd ""gotten sick of writing deadly serious policy papers,"" he tasked his brain (and heart) to come up with poetry and prose instead.

Cardwell's latest book, his sixth, is ""Limestone & Leaves."" Humans need to plunder less and plant more, he believes. This collection of poetry and prose describes Cardwell's lifelong concern for the environment.

""We have to do everything possible to engage in dialog about what we're doing to the environment,"" he said in a recent phone call. ""If we don't, it's going to be hard for future generations to live in a civilized way.""

Public policy papers turn to poems and prose

Cardwell, who lives in Indianapolis, spent his career in writing and examining public policies. Some of his particular interests concerned people with disabilities, Native Americans, retired people and home- and community-based care.

""I worked with a group that made substantial changes to long-term care,"" he said. He worked as the legislative and program director for Citizens Action Coalition, where he ""was their point-guy for all the public policy initiatives.""

Formed in 1974, Citizens Action Coalition is Indiana's oldest and largest group devoted to advocating for consumers and the environment. It helps Indiana residents with energy regulations, utility reform, healthcare, pollution and farms run by families. Staff do research, education outreach and lobbying of lawmakers, as well as assisting and litigating for people in utility cases before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Citizens Action Coalition's mission statement also mentions preserving democracy, conservation of natural resources and access to human services.

A tale of two squirrels

Maybe one of Cardwell's motivators to attempt poems and prose was the squirrel that would ripple up the tree outside Cardwell's office window — and spy as the writer typed. ""He just sat in that tree and stared at me,"" Cardwell said. Another squirrel appeared, and this one had no use of its two hind legs.

""It would climb up and down the trees — living in the wild — with its back legs not working! That squirrel lived like that for two years.""

From Cardwell's poem ""A Small Animal, Really?"" come these words at the piece's close:

""In a thousand years, I speculate squirrels

will have managed to maintain their niche,

if climate change does not take us all.

As for humans, who can say if that will

be true, but if it is not,

I am certain the squirrels will be digging

in the trash we leave for a long time.

A small animal, really, but don't vote

against them.""

In 2014, Cardwell the public advocate, was breakfasting with his wife, Nancy Griffin. He wasn't yet a poet but was reading a piece by someone who was. ""Hey, I could write a better poem than this,"" Cardwell said. ""(Nancy) sneered, so I walked off and wrote one. When I reappeared and read it to her, she said, 'Hey, that's good.'""

Writing about nature, he said, lets him write about humans.

""Nature gives us a means to address issues. We don't hold up our end of the bargain with nature. We take so much from the environment around us.""

Forests, which support huge quantities of flora and fauna, are in danger of human-led destruction. Every year 15 billion trees are felled throughout the world, which is roughly 38,610 square miles of forest each year, according to the British Ecological Society.

Industrialized fishing harms marine life, and internationally, humans are catching more fish than can reproduce, according to the Oceanic Preservation Society. More than 90% of marine stocks are abused or ruined outright. Up to 40% of marine life is captured inadvertently (not the target), the society reports.

Hundreds of thousands of seals, dolphins and whales, die every year in traps meant for fish. This is in addition to birds, sea turtles, sharks, and others dying due to unethical fishing methods.

In Cardell's poem ""Warmth and Radiation"" he says:

""developers are forcing turtles

to cross busy highways,

house cats are killing salamanders,

Florida's panthers are looking anorexic,

bees are being chemically nuked.""

Living beings other than humans, he said, don't affect the environment in the ways we do, such as destroying vegetation to erect buildings. ""In Bloomington, for example, any beautiful woods is at risk because of rapid development.""

Readers will feel Cardwell's appreciation of nature and history, as they learn about Hoosier forests, rural living and prehistoric creation myths.

It's something Cardwell and his wife, Nancy, understand: They own and operate a small farm.

For the Impact and Sustainability track, the conversation has shifted from mere sustainability to regeneration by creating systems that improve both the environment and community well-being. This expanded role leverages business events to drive global equity by empowering under-represented voices and creating policy for vulnerable communities, all while demanding data-driven credibility through transparent reporting on metrics like carbon footprint, food waste, and measurable impact outcomes.

Meanwhile, discussions during the Future Leadership and Resilience Sharing Hub indicate that in an era of rising member activism and geopolitical ‘noise’, the most critical leadership skill is principled neutrality, and anchoring the organisation in its core mission to serve as a calm, de-escalating force.

Simultaneously, association leaders must shift their value proposition from being mere knowledge providers to competence builders, focusing on actively developing the skills members need to succeed. The events industry’s long-term viability also depends on renewing the social contract with host cities, ensuring that events deliver shared prosperity, while improving the local quality of life.

During the Purposeful Business Models and Start-ups Sharing Hubs, it was found that the most entrepreneurial associations are now transforming events by making purposeful business models a reality. This is done through embedding impact requirements directly into RFPs, which establishes legacy as a contractual deliverable for host cities.

Events are also intentionally convening experts to produce lasting policy frameworks, where this approach proves that purpose is the ultimate competitive advantage, driving profitability and brand differentiation. To achieve this, there is a call to co-create and move beyond transactional bids to genuine engagement and partnership.

As for the Innovation and Technology track, the key consensus among stakeholders is that AI should be treated as a co-pilot, not an autopilot, using it to augment human capability and boost team efficiency rather than replace staff.

Leveraging AI for hyper-personalisation – delivering tailored session recommendations and matchmaking – is also now a core strategy for maximising attendee ROI. The ultimate goal for data usage is to move beyond simple engagement metrics and utilise information to prove impact.

Finally, during The Creative Edge Sharing Hub, it was found that the most authentic events tap into the DNA of a city by integrating its history, culture, and spirit into the delegate experience. Moving beyond the visual, events must be designed for all five senses, utilising soundscapes, scents, and textures to create immersive and memorable multi-sensory narratives.

This requires viewing local talent not as hired entertainment, but as co-creators, turning the event into a canvas for authentic cultural expression. Finally, a key design challenge is to intentionally design for serendipity, creating beautiful and effective spaces where valuable, unplanned connections can naturally occur.",https://ttgmice.2017.ttgasia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/Sharing-hubs_640.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 10:02:20.398856

Foreword

The United Kingdom stands at a pivotal moment in its industrial evolution. As global competition intensifies and technological transformation accelerates, we must ensure that British industry is not only resilient but also relentlessly competitive.

The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme (BICS) is a flagship intervention of the Industrial Strategy – a strategy built on a clear vision: to back the sectors and businesses with the greatest potential to drive sustainable growth, productivity and prosperity across the country.

This scheme directly addresses one of the most pressing challenges facing these businesses today: how to remain globally competitive while navigating some of the highest industrial electricity costs in Europe.

By providing eligible manufacturing businesses with exemptions from the indirect cost of the Renewables Obligation, Feed-In Tariffs and Capacity Market schemes, BICS will reduce cost pressures and support the long-term viability of our most strategically important industries.

This consultation seeks views on how to determine which businesses within the Industrial Strategy manufacturing frontier industries, and manufacturing foundational industries in their supply chains, should be eligible for the scheme.

We want to ensure that the approach we put in place is workable for businesses and support is directed to where it will have the biggest impact on economic growth. Your feedback will help us shape a fair, transparent and effective scheme that reinforces the strength of our manufacturing base.

This scheme is part of our broader commitment to backing British industry with practical, responsive policy. By reducing electricity burdens, we can unlock investment, protect jobs and ensure our Industrial Strategy sectors remain world-leading in both productivity and industrial excellence.

I encourage all stakeholders to engage with this consultation and help us deliver a scheme that reflects the needs and ambitions of British industry. I look forward to hearing from respondents on this important topic.

The Rt Hon Peter Kyle MP

Secretary of State for Business and Trade and President of the Board of Trade

Introduction

Context

The government is committed to retaining a modern, dynamic and globally competitive industrial base as part of its wider Industrial Strategy. However, high electricity costs have made it increasingly difficult for businesses to compete with their international counterparts.

This government has been clear that the long-term answers to the challenges around energy security, affordability and sustainability point in the same direction – clean energy. Last December, we launched our Clean Power 2030 Action Plan which set out a detailed plan for achieving the target of clean power by 2030. Our clean power target means transitioning to an electricity system that produces at least 95% of Great Britain’s generation from clean sources.

To address the more immediate electricity cost challenges, the government announced the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme (BICS) as part of its Modern Industrial Strategy. The scheme aims to support eligible manufacturing frontier industries within ‘IS-8’ manufacturing sectors, and manufacturing foundational industries which provide important inputs to the frontier industries, who meet a certain threshold of electricity intensity. It will do this by bringing British electricity costs more in line with other economies in Europe, and level the playing field for British businesses.

Businesses eligible for BICS are to be exempt from paying the indirect cost of 3 schemes:

the Renewables Obligation and Feed-in Tariffs which require electricity suppliers to make payments to support generation of electricity from renewable sources

the Capacity Market which requires electricity suppliers to make payments to ensure the UK has adequate electricity capacity

The proposed scheme will apply in Great Britain only, given that energy policy is largely devolved in Northern Ireland. The scheme will require implementing legislation and be designed in compliance with the Subsidy Control Act, the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) and other international subsidy control commitments.

As the scheme is developed, it is vital to ensure that its design is robust, fair and delivers the intended benefits to British industry. This consultation seeks views on the proposed approach, including how eligible businesses should be selected.

This scheme is one of a suite of interventions announced in the UK’s Modern Industrial Strategy which made the following commitments:

an increase in support for our most energy-intensive industries (EIIs) eligible for the Supercharger package, with an uplift of the Network Charging Compensation (NCC) scheme from 60% to 90%. The NCC uplift will reduce electricity prices for about 500 eligible highly electricity-intensive users by around a further £8 to £10 per megawatt-hour (MWh), bringing the total reduction to around £65 to £87 per MWh.

continued support for the Energy-Intensive Industries Compensation Scheme which tackles carbon leakage. We will conduct a review of the scheme by the end of this year that will set out how we plan to continue supporting EIIs through the scheme when the UK Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is implemented in 2027.

supporting the development of the Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPA) market in the UK, as a potential route for energy consumers to secure more stable electricity prices for the long term. The government will call for evidence in due course on how the market for CPPAs can be developed and improved for industry.

a new ‘Connections Accelerator Service’ which will provide support connecting to the grid for demand projects, including prioritising those that create high-quality jobs and bring the greatest economic value. We will work closely with representatives from the energy sector, local authorities, Welsh and Scottish governments, trade unions, and industry to design this service, which we expect to begin operating at the end of 2025.

new powers, in the Planning and Infrastructure Bill (PIB), which will allow amendments to regulatory processes and accelerate connections for strategically important projects; and launching a new Strategic Sites Accelerator (SSA) and setting up AI Growth Zones (AIGZs) across the UK. The SSAs will enable the government to deploy a range of interventions to bring sites to market faster, such as land remediation, anticipatory grid capacity, transport improvements and fast-tracked planning approval.

establishing AIGZs as dedicated hubs to fast-track artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure development, support planning approvals, and unlock access to energy.

The rationale for the scheme

Evidence from advanced economies suggests that there is a strong link between high energy prices and reduced economic activity. Over the last 20 years, higher electricity and energy costs have been associated with lower investment , lower productivity (including lower capacity utilisation) , lower rates of employment , and more firms leaving the market .

These effects have been pronounced for advanced manufacturing industries and more energy-intensive foundational sectors in their supply chains, which play a crucial role in driving economic growth.

Great Britain has been particularly heavily affected by rising electricity costs. Between 2008 and 2020, electricity prices in the UK rose by approximately 50% , resulting in an estimated fall in manufacturing investment of between 13% and 26% .

The same analysis also suggests that increasing electricity costs could account for a reduction of 9% of jobs in pharmaceuticals, and 8% in chemicals, with similar reductions in other manufacturing sectors. Firms frequently cite high electricity costs as one of the largest risks to their business .

While many countries have faced similar increases in electricity costs in recent years, the UK has seen a sharper rise than other comparable nations. In 2024, the UK’s industrial electricity prices (including taxes) were the highest of all countries in the International Energy Agency data published by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), and more than double the EU-14 + UK median for large and very large industrial users .

We recognise the need for a broader approach to help level the playing field on electricity costs between Great Britain and our competitors, so we can capture major growth and investment opportunities and secure our supply chains. Our most electricity-intensive sectors at risk of carbon leakage already receive support through the British Industry Supercharger, among other schemes.

The international price gap

Retail electricity prices are made up of 3 components:

wholesale price – the costs suppliers incur to purchase electricity from generators

network costs – the costs of maintaining and operating transmission and distribution infrastructure

policy costs – the costs used to fund environmental and social policies, including investment in homegrown low-carbon generation, such as the Renewables Obligation. These costs are levied on electricity suppliers, who typically pass them on to consumers via their electricity bills. This investment is vital to lowering wholesale electricity prices and reducing exposure to international gas price volatility

Great British electricity prices are high due to a combination of structural and policy factors. British wholesale electricity costs are relatively high for a number of reasons including a reliance on natural gas for electricity power generation, periods of higher carbon prices on electricity generation due to the Carbon Price Support and lower levels of interconnection than within mainland Europe.

They are broadly comparable to similar nations (apart from the USA whose domestic gas price is decoupled from world markets because they are self-sufficient in gas), and are expected to fall as the amount of renewable generation increases.

However, British policy costs on industrial electricity are significantly higher than most other major economies. For very large industrial users in the UK they typically are around £61 per MWh or around 27% of the overall electricity bill compared to around £2 per MWh for France and £10 per MWh for Germany .

Great Britain has historically funded the development of renewables infrastructure via electricity bills rather than taxpayer funding. Britain distributes these costs more evenly between households and industrial users, compared to other countries where household bills bear a larger proportion of the cost .

The government is committed to addressing high wholesale and network costs through long-term investment in infrastructure and generation capacity. Our plans to deliver clean, homegrown power and accelerate to net zero will reduce the exposure of industry to volatile fossil fuel prices.

However, high electricity prices are an urgent concern for our manufacturing sectors, where there is fierce competition for investment to gain advantage in future growth markets. This means there is a strong case to take action now, and providing exemptions from some policy costs provides an efficient mechanism to reduce costs in the immediate future.

Overview of the scheme

This scheme has 2 main objectives:

grow the economy: retain and attract investment in manufacturing businesses in frontier industries within IS-8 manufacturing sectors with high growth potential, by bringing their electricity costs more in line with other economies in Europe

protect the basis of our economy: support manufacturing foundational industries that supply important inputs to the IS-8 by addressing high electricity costs, with a view to boosting supply chain resilience

Together, these objectives are designed to ensure that manufacturing businesses with the greatest potential to deliver growth can thrive in a challenging international environment, supporting both immediate economic growth and long-term industrial resilience.

How the exemptions will be implemented

To achieve the objectives, BICS proposes to exempt eligible business activity from the indirect costs of the RO, FIT, and CM schemes.

These costs fund policies to support the development of renewable energy (in the case of the RO and FIT) and protect the security of electricity supply (in the case of the CM). They are levied on electricity suppliers, who typically pass them on to customers via their energy bills. We expect this exemption to reduce costs for eligible businesses by between £35 per MWh and £40 per MWh.

To implement these exemptions, we intend to amend existing secondary legislation establishing the RO, FIT and CM. For the RO, which is devolved in Scotland, the Scottish government will be responsible for making the necessary legislative changes. We will further engage stakeholders in advance of making these legislative changes.

The proposed scheme is due to commence in April 2027, subject to implementing legislation and the completion of subsidy control processes. The scheme will run until 2035, with a review in 2030 to ensure that, as prices evolve, it continues to deliver its aim of supporting the competitiveness of British businesses in critical manufacturing Industrial Strategy sectors through support on their electricity prices, and that it is operating in an efficient and cost-effective way. This review will also consider whether the methodology for identifying businesses in eligible sectors will need to be updated.

Impacts of the scheme

Anticipated impacts of the scheme are outlined and a full impact assessment of the scheme will be published alongside legislation.

Impact on eligible businesses

Eligible businesses will incur a familiarisation and administrative burden in the application process. Through the scheme design and lessons learnt from previous support schemes, the aim will be to minimise these costs.

Impact on other electricity users

By bearing down on costs across the energy system, we expect to deliver BICS and ensure that the scheme is delivered in line with our wider priorities to deliver affordable power for businesses and households. For example, the proposals in DESNZ’s recent consultations on RO and FIT indexation, if implemented, could contribute to that goal.

Impact on suppliers and delivery bodies

There are 64 domestic and non-domestic electricity suppliers in the Great British market with a further 38 suppliers which serve non-domestic consumers only. All licensed suppliers are expected to be in scope for applying BICS exemptions to RO, FIT and CM costs for eligible businesses, and may face familiarisation costs and administrative burdens associated with the change of policy.

Suppliers’ obligations with respect to these policies will be unchanged overall. We will work closely with suppliers to explore the requirements and costs related to system changes and aim to design the scheme in a way that minimises administrative burdens. We will support suppliers to implement the scheme in a robust and cost-effective manner. This will include specific engagement that will run in conjunction with this consultation.

We are conscious that the scheme should not create unnecessary financial risk for suppliers and are interested in views on how best to ensure the scheme does not place additional burdens on supplier cashflow or result in uncertainty of cost recovery. For example, we will pay particular regard to the period of notification to suppliers before commencement of the scheme to assist them with tariff pricing.

We will continue to work closely with existing scheme administration bodies, including Elexon and the Low Carbon Contracts Company, to plan a cost-effective and streamlined delivery pathway for the scheme.

Interaction with other schemes

The British Industry Supercharger (BIS)

Since 1 April 2024, eligible Energy Intensive Industries (EIIs) have benefited from the British Industry Supercharger (BIS): a decisive set of measures to make Britain’s strategic EIIs more competitive and tackle the challenge of carbon leakage. The BIS scheme and BICS are both designed to support British businesses with high electricity costs.

Both schemes exempt eligible businesses from the indirect costs associated with the Renewables Obligation, Feed-in Tariffs, and Capacity Market. However, the BIS scheme also exempts eligible businesses with costs associated with Contracts for Difference and provides compensation for the charges paid for using the Great British electricity grid through the EII Network Charging Compensation (NCC) Scheme.

Some businesses, such as high electricity-intensive firms in the steel and chemicals sectors, may meet the criteria for both the BIS scheme and BICS. These businesses will only be able to apply for 1 of the 2 schemes, as the same exemptions cannot be provided twice.

Businesses already in receipt of, or eligible for, the Supercharger will be ineligible for BICS for the same reason. Businesses which meet the criteria for both schemes are recommended to apply for the BIS, to take advantage of the higher level of support.

While eligibility for both schemes is dependent on an electricity-intensity test, the threshold for this test will differ across both schemes. For BICS, this electricity intensity threshold will be determined following consultation. It will be lower than the BIS scheme (which is set at 7% at the sector level and 20% at the business level), considering the different objectives of the 2 schemes.

Eligibility for the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme (BICS)

BICS is aimed at manufacturing businesses in manufacturing frontier industries within IS-8 sectors, and manufacturing foundational industries in their supply chains, which meet a certain threshold of electricity intensity.

This means that, to be eligible, a business must:

operate in one of the manufacturing frontier industries within an IS-8 sector, or in a manufacturing foundational industry which provides important inputs to the frontier industries

carry out manufacturing activities

meet the required level of electricity intensity

Figure 1: illustration of the steps to determine eligibility

The following section sets out the rationale for including each of these tests and outlines how they will be administered.

Criterion 1: eligible businesses must operate in a manufacturing frontier industry within an IS-8 sector, or in a manufacturing foundational industry providing important inputs to the frontier industries

Why we are targeting these businesses

Support is being targeted to specific sectors which we have identified as having the greatest potential to achieve our policy objectives: namely, growing the economy by retaining and attracting investment in high-potential industries, and enabling production of the inputs required by those industries.

The IS-8 are the sectors identified by the Industrial Strategy as having the highest potential to drive growth across the whole economy. Within those sectors, the frontier industries are the subsectors at the cutting edge, where there are major opportunities to be captured if the UK can attract the necessary investment and build competitiveness.

Supporting the foundational industries is necessary to ensure frontier industries have ready access to important components. These sectors provide important inputs for the IS-8 sectors, meaning they play a significant role in underpinning broader growth opportunities. Foundational industries are heavily impacted by high electricity prices and are natural targets for BICS support.

How this test will be administered

We need a system which will enable business to clearly identify whether they are in scope and that can be reflected in legislation. Businesses applying for BICS will need to provide verifiable evidence that they manufacture products included in eligible manufacturing frontier or manufacturing foundational Industrial Strategy industries.

Manufacturing frontier industries

Our proposal is that to receive BICS support businesses in manufacturing frontier industries must be within eligible Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes and produce eligible ‘Harmonised System’(HS) products mapped to a SIC code in that frontier industry.

The Industrial Strategy published a list of SIC codes to define the frontier industries in the June 2025 white paper. These covered both services and manufacturing aspects of those sectors, which meant that SIC definitions were not feasible in some instances (for example, Clean Energy Industries, where service activities are spread across a wide range of codes).

However, BICS focuses on manufacturing activities, where SIC mapping is more feasible, although still challenging in more nascent sectors such as Clean Energy Industries and Digital and Technologies. DBT has produced more granular SIC mappings for manufacturing frontier industries for the purposes of delivering BICS. These are included in Annex A. Note that sectors listed in Annex A will not automatically be eligible for the scheme.

SIC mappings alone may not be sufficiently nuanced to identify eligible businesses. SIC mappings may capture businesses that manufacture products which are not primarily used in frontier industries. Similarly, companies may be producing frontier industry products, but these are only part of their production and/or they report under a different SIC.

This scheme will therefore use HS codes alongside SIC codes. The Harmonised System provides a list of codes for goods, which can be mapped to SIC codes using open-source methods. SIC codes are capped at the 4-digit level to correspond to NACE (Nomenclature statistique des activités économiques dans la communauté européenne) and CPA (Classification of Products by Activity) rev 2.1 .

Using correspondence tables , these codes can then be attributed to the relevant HS6 code. The list of SIC codes are in the Annex A and HS codes in the proposed scope for BICS are included in the excel document accompanying this consultation (Annex B).

Our proposal is that to receive BICS support businesses in manufacturing frontier industries must be within eligible SICs and produce eligible HS products mapped to a SIC code in that frontier industry. This will allow government to objectively define who is operating in a frontier industry and producing associated goods.

However, we welcome feedback where businesses consider themselves to be clearly within the narrative definition of a frontier industry but are not captured by the proposed SIC and HS codes.

We will review the feedback and consider if the BICS list of SIC or HS codes need to be adapted. We are also considering if there are alternative approaches to scheme eligibility to better capture industries where SIC/HS code mapping is challenging and ensure consistency with other Industrial Strategy initiatives.

For example, we recognise that manufacturing frontier and manufacturing foundational industries can include a number of activities that support the circular economy within their specific industries. We welcome feedback where businesses engaged in this type of activity consider themselves within a narrative definition of an eligible manufacturing frontier industry or manufacturing foundational industry but may not be captured by the proposed SIC and HS codes.

This list of eligible SIC-4 industries and HS commodities will be made public before applications for the scheme open.

Note: HS codes are predominantly used by businesses and government to classify imports and exports of goods. They are being considered for use in the BICS methodology because they are a useful proxy for manufacturing activity. However, we recognise that they may be unfamiliar to businesses who are not engaged in international trade.

The application process for BICS will signpost applicants to the HS code look-up tool, which provides a simple way to identify the correct codes for the products they manufacture. There will be no requirement for a business to be an importer or exporter to access support under BICS.

Manufacturing foundational industries which supply the frontier industries

Our proposal is that to receive BICS support businesses in manufacturing foundational industries must be within eligible SIC codes.

The Industrial Strategy white paper and Technical Annex provides information on how foundational industries are identified and treated. See Annex A for the SIC codes identified in the initial analysis and published in the June 2025 Industrial Strategy.

As outlined in the Industrial Strategy Technical Annex, we will work with government’s new Supply Chain Centre to analyse and refine the list of important inputs into frontier industries. This will inform the creation of a more refined list of SIC-4 sectors within manufacturing foundational industries which provide important inputs to the frontier industries. The codes in Table 3 of Annex A are indicative and not guaranteed to be eligible for BICS.

This list of eligible SIC-4 industries will be made public before applications for the scheme open, alongside any further relevant information about eligibility.

As BICS provides support on manufactured products rather than services, service foundational industries are excluded. However, the manufactured products used by those service industries may fall in scope, for example the manufacture of electric cables, or the production of building materials, dependent upon the insights from the Supply Chain Centre analysis.

Note: The new Supply Chain Centre, based in DBT, will lead the government’s work, in tandem with business, to build resilience of the supply chains critical to the UK’s security and prosperity. The new Supply Chain Centre will review inputs required for our growth industries and national security, consider the impact of future trends on demand, and determine what action may be required to build resilience.

Criterion 2: eligible businesses must be manufacturers

Why we are targeting these businesses

As set out in the previous section on the rationale for the scheme, there is substantial evidence linking high electricity costs with decreasing investment and growth in manufacturing industries, leading to increased firm exits and job losses over the past 2 decades. Responses to the Industrial Strategy consultation also showed that there was a clear demand for intervention on electricity costs in manufacturing sectors.

How this test will be administered

This scheme will filter for manufacturing activity at both the sectoral and business level. Only manufacturing frontier industries within the IS-8 manufacturing sectors and manufacturing foundational industries will be in scope for support.

We intend to identify manufacturers within these sectors using a combination of SIC and HS code information submitted by applicants, in line with the methodology outlined in this document.

Criterion 3: eligible businesses must meet the required level of electricity intensity

Why we are targeting these businesses

The purpose of introducing an electricity intensity threshold is to increase efficiency of the scheme by targeting support to sectors and businesses which will be more responsive to electricity price changes. This ensures the support will make a meaningful difference to growth and investment.

How this test will be administered

This test can be applied at the sector and/or business level. We are considering which is the most appropriate combination of tests to administer.

The sector-level electricity intensity test. Sectoral electricity intensity will be calculated by DBT using the most recent Annual Business Survey and Annual Purchasing Survey Data available.

The intensity will be calculated as the electricity consumption as a proportion of measures of economic activity such as total expenditures or gross value added (GVA). Details of the threshold for the electricity intensity test, and a list of sectors which pass the test (and are therefore eligible for support), would then be provided to businesses.

The business-level electricity intensity test. Under this approach, applicants would be required to provide evidence of their business’s level of electricity intensity and would only be eligible if this figure exceeds the threshold defined by DBT. This threshold would be determined based on comprehensive modelling of a business level test’s impact, and details would be shared before applications open.

There are also multiple possible ways to measure electricity intensity.

We have identified 2 options for consideration:

option 1: electricity intensity could be calculated as (total electricity expenditure/Gross Value Added). This is the measure of electricity intensity used by several other electricity price support schemes, such as the British Industrial Supercharger

option 2: electricity intensity could be calculated as (total electricity expenditure/total expenditure). This measure focuses on the importance of electricity costs in the cost base

Pro-rating exemptions

It is likely that many businesses will produce a mixture of both eligible and ineligible products. To accommodate this, we are consulting on the option to administer exemptions on a pro-rated basis. The options in scope are presented for consultation.

Option 1: exemptions are pro-rated

Under the pro-rating approach, applicants would need to provide verifiable evidence of the percentage of their output comprised of eligible products. Rather than receiving a 100% exemption from the relevant levy costs, they would receive a proportional exemption.

For consultation, we are proposing 2 different options as to how this could be calculated:

option 1a: pro-rating based on proportion of revenue generated by eligible products

option 1b: pro-rating based on proportion of electricity usage used in the manufacture of eligible products

Example A illustrates how each of these approaches could work in practice.

Example A: pro-rating based on revenue

A business produces 2 products, Product A and Product B. Product A accounts for 65% of the firm’s revenue, and Product B accounts for 35%.

The HS code for Product A is included in the eligible list, while the HS code for Product B is not. The business would therefore be eligible for an exemption from 65% of the costs of the Renewables Obligation, Feed-in Tariffs, and Capacity Market schemes, provided it meets the other eligibility criteria.

Example B: pro-rating based on energy usage

A business operates 2 sites, Site A and Site B. 100% of the energy used at Site A contributes to the manufacture of eligible products, while Site B manufactures no eligible products and therefore 0% of the energy used is eligible.

The business would be eligible for an exemption in proportion to the electricity used to produce eligible products. This means it would receive an exemption from Renewables Obligation, Feed-In Tariffs, and Capacity Market costs for all of the electricity used at Site A, but not for the electricity used at Site B.

Pro-rating would allow the scheme to target eligible activities more precisely. Eligibility would not be restricted only to businesses whose primary product(s) are eligible. Any firm which produces a relevant product, even if it is a smaller part of their overall business, may be able to receive support, provided they meet the other eligibility criteria.

However, many beneficiaries would receive a lower value of exemption under this approach when compared to the option without pro-rating. Only businesses which exclusively manufacture products within Industrial Strategy sectors would be eligible for a full exemption from the relevant levy costs; all other eligible businesses would receive partial exemptions.

In addition, this approach is likely to be more complex for government, applicants and energy suppliers to administer. Applicants would need to provide details of how their output breaks down between eligible and ineligible products, in a form that can be verified by scheme administrators. Suppliers may require more complex processes to administer partial exemptions to the levies, as opposed to full exemptions.

Option 2: exemptions are not pro-rated

Under the non-pro-rating approach, all businesses which meet the eligibility criteria would be exempt from 100% of the relevant levy costs. For businesses producing both eligible and ineligible products, there would be an additional test to determine if they, as a whole, operate in an Industrial Strategy sector.

This may include a minimum requirement for proportion of eligible activity. This consultation includes a question on the most suitable way to approach eligible businesses in these circumstances.

An approach that does not include pro-rating is likely to result in a narrower cohort of eligible businesses, with a greater benefit for businesses which meet the criteria. However, this approach carries a risk of potential distortive effects in sectors outside the scope of the Industrial Strategy. Businesses which predominantly produce eligible products, but have some output in ineligible sectors, may be able to pass their cost savings through to the non-eligible portion of their business, in a way which gives them an advantage over other businesses in those sectors who are not eligible for support.

Scheme cost control

It is vital that we have robust measures in place to manage the ongoing costs of BICS and that costs do not exceed the savings – as made clear in the government’s Modern Industrial Strategy – that will be realised by bearing down on levies and other costs in the energy system. The primary method of controlling costs will be through applying the eligibility criteria as outlined – specifically exercising discretion on the level of the sector and/or business-level electricity intensity test.

We welcome feedback on the merits of additional measures, for example, modest year-on-year adjustments to the overall level of exemption available to eligible businesses, to control the cost of BICS alongside the level of sector- and/or business-level electricity intensity test. We welcome views on how such measures may impact business and investment decisions and suppliers when administering the proposed exemptions.

Future scheme conditionality or flexibility

Ensuring businesses have a sustainable way of managing their energy costs in the long term is integral to delivering the growth this government seeks to achieve. This can be supported through the uptake of baseline energy flexibility and efficiency technologies in these sectors as they grow, allowing the system benefits and business savings to naturally grow with them.

For industrial energy users specifically, businesses of all sizes may be able to save by using electricity flexibly. These electricity optimisation processes can increasingly be automated within defined ranges, such as by setting a defined temperature zone on a freezer system, so that business processes are unaffected.

On a system level, integrating energy flexibility and efficiency will help to shorten network connection times for businesses generally and reduce energy demand peaks that require reinforcement work at both transmission and distribution level. Ultimately, this lowers electricity system costs and bills for all consumers, which is central to this government’s Clean Energy Superpower and growth missions

A critical barrier that currently prevents industrial participation in flexibility services is outdated building management systems. This can pertain to a lack of adequate and appropriate metering technology, or to a lack of smart systems preventing flexibility from being automated. Consequently, the journey for many businesses in becoming ‘flexibility ready’ and enabling participation can vary.

We welcome views on whether you agree with the principle of linking flexibility readiness to participation in the scheme or differentiated benefits, and this being considered at the 2030 review point. We also want to identify the opportunities and challenges this might present, including potential benefits for the system and businesses, impact on business and investor confidence and any technical, financial or operational implications.

Application process and evidence requirements

We aim to create a simple and accessible application process for businesses to apply for the scheme, prove eligibility and subsequently manage their exemption (for example, by adding new electricity meters, changing business details and applying for periodic renewals of their exemption certificate). We are looking to identify the simplest possible process for applying, which is robust against fraud, but not excessively burdensome for applicants.

Under current proposals, businesses will be required to provide evidence to demonstrate eligibility for BICS.

This evidence could include:

company name

company registration number

eligible SIC code(s) matching Companies House records

eligible HS code(s)

energy supplier

relevant Meter Point Administration Number(s)

evidence of the percentage of firm revenue generated by eligible activities

We will put in place a robust verification system to validate the submitted information and prevent fraudulent claims for support. If the application is approved, the company would be granted an exemption certificate containing all of the required evidence (including the exemption percentage proportionate to eligible activity), which will be provided to energy suppliers to deliver exemptions onto businesses’ electricity bills. Where reasonable, an appeals process will be available for businesses who believe they are eligible but have not been granted an exemption certificate following verification.

We will work closely with suppliers to explore requirements and costs related to system changes and support them to implement the scheme in a robust and cost-effective manner. This will include through specific engagement that will run in conjunction with this consultation.

Given a choice between the two, Sheetz wins. “It has more watts, so it charges a little faster,” he said.

The seemingly small question of where to spend 20 or so minutes topping off a battery reveals the transformation taking hold among fuel retailers. For more than 50 years, chains like Wawa, Sheetz, and Love’s Travel Stops have defined when and where people refuel. As EVs reshape mobility, they are among the retailers embracing charging.

Their challenge goes beyond providing power to turning the time drivers spend plugged in into profitable foot traffic. Selling electricity alone won’t pay the bills; the real money lies in selling snacks. Making that work requires reimagining what a pit stop looks and feels like, even as costly infrastructure upgrades and shifting federal policies complicate the transition.

Wawa and Sheetz are among the furthest along. The Pennsylvania-based companies have built out hundreds of chargers and enjoy fervent fanbases that make them two of the most popular convenience stores in the country. Their made-to-order sandwiches, vast array of snacks, and clean restrooms have made them regular stops for road trippers and commuters alike — and now, for EV drivers looking to recharge their cars and, often, themselves.

They offer a glimpse of the road ahead. As electric vehicles move ever further from niche toward norm, the focus for retailers like these could shift from who offers the cheapest fuel to who can make waiting for the car to fill up the best experience.

“The problem with a lot of current gas stations is [they’re] not that nice of a place to spend 15, 20, or 30 minutes,” said Scott Hardman of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California-Davis. “Hopefully in the future, we’ll see more of them turn into coffee shops, cafes — places you actually want to be.”

That future is slowly coming into focus. Retailers like Wawa and Sheetz have spent the past few years exploring what the transition from selling gasoline to selling electricity might look like. Even with the headwinds EVs face, at least 26 percent of cars on U.S. roads could be electric by 2035, and some projections suggest they could account for 65 percent of all sales by 2050.

The two chains offer a place to plug in at roughly 10 percent of their locations. Wawa has installed more than 210 chargers, while Sheetz provides more than 650 at 95 locations that have logged more than 2 million sessions. Clean amenities and expansive menus with offerings like Wawa’s turkey-stuffed Gobbler and Sheetz’s deep-fried Big Mozz have placed them near the top of convenience store satisfaction rankings.

Both say embracing cars with cords builds on what already attracts customers. Wawa frames it as an extension of its “one-stop” model for food and fuel. Its competitor calls charging “a seamless extension of the Sheetz experience.” The language differs, but the message is the same: Selling electricity works if it brings people like John Baiano inside.

The New York resident owns two Tesla Model Ys and travels throughout the northeast for his two businesses, a Bitcoin consultancy and a horse racing operation. He plugs in at Wawa because the stores are clean, offer plenty of amenities, and provide a comfortable place to check in with clients. “I use the bathroom, maybe get a snack,” he said. (He prefers the turkey pinwheel.) “I was a little nervous about the charging aspect of things. Once I started experiencing this, it was seamless.”

At the moment, most public quick chargers are tucked away in the far corners of shopping centers, inside parking garages, and other functional but hardly inviting places to spend 20 minutes. They’re fine when you’re out and about running errands, but not terribly appealing at night and not particularly conducive to a road trip.

Tesla dominates the space with its Supercharger network, which provides over half the country’s quick chargers, with Electrify America, EVGo, and ChargePoint together accounting for another 25 to 30 percent. Retailers like Love’s Travel Stops, Pilot Flying J, and Buc-ee’s are joining Sheetz and Wawa in working with those networks and others to add chargers alongside gas pumps. Their efforts signal how a system built for gasoline is starting to evolve for electricity.

Everything Stafford and Baiano like about plugging in at a convenience store reflects an Electric Vehicle Council study that ranked security, lighting, and 24/7 access as three things drivers most want in a charging station. Another survey found that 80 percent of them will go out of their way to get it. Reliability is another concern — and a frequent complaint with the nation’s current charging infrastructure. As EVs become more common, drivers are going to be less willing to put up with malfunctioning or broken chargers than the early adopters were.

Ryan McKinnon of the Charge Ahead Partnership, which pushes for a comprehensive charging network, sees fuel retailers as a logical place to build out such a system because they already have the right locations and amenities. “What EV charging needs is a competitive and lucrative marketplace where folks can actually make money selling EV charging,” he said.

Therein lies the challenge. Buying and installing a quick charger can cost more than $100,000. Beyond that lie fluctuating prices from utility companies, which one leading charging provider said is a key factor in deciding where to locate the devices. Retailers won’t recover that by selling electrons alone, given that the machines might generate just $10,000 in revenue each year, Hardman said. EVGo noted in its second quarter earnings report that it earned just under $12,000 per stall.

Making this work for retailers requires getting people out of their cars and into the stores. Just as gas retailers earn two-thirds of their profit selling sandwiches, snacks, and sodas, those selling electricity can expect to do the same. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that installing an EV charger increased spending by 1 percent, which would cover 11 percent of the cost of installing the charger. (Other studies have found similar benefits for surrounding businesses; Tesla Superchargers can boost revenue by 4 percent.)

For some retailers, chargers are a loss leader meant to pull customers into stores, said Karl Doenges of the National Association of Convenience Stores. Others see them as a way to secure increasingly scarce electrical capacity while it’s available. Some are moving “forward on a charging station, even though they don’t think [the market is] 100 percent ready,” he said.

Even the strongest business cases for installing the devices depended on Washington’s help to pencil out. Incentives the Biden administration created through the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided billions in grants, tax credits, and matching funds to help expand the fueling infrastructure of tomorrow, particularly in rural and low-income communities that a free market might overlook.

When Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election, there was little doubt federal support for this ambitious effort would change. Yet the upheaval was more dramatic than expected. In February, the Trump administration paused the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure, or NEVI, program, the backbone of Washington’s effort to build a nationwide charging network. Fuel retailers, which have been some of the effort’s biggest beneficiaries, expressed concern.

The administration reluctantly reinstated NEVI, which had installed just 126 charging ports by the time Trump won his second term, in August. “If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at the time. But with most of the funding allocated, the program will likely expire in 2026.

When it revived NEVI, the Trump administration updated recommendations for states, which administer the funds, in a way that seems to favor a national network run by big chains with highway operations. The Federal Highway Administration’s guidance explicitly recommended building charging infrastructure near fuel retailers.

Nonetheless, at least some of those companies see this as a difficult moment for EV charging. Joe Sheetz, executive vice chairman of the family-owned company, has said momentum is slowing because much of the funding has come from the government and big players like Tesla. Some smaller chains are backing away, but Sheetz said his company will keep at it.

Even as EV adoption grows, most people will continue to plug in largely at home. About 80 percent of charging occurs there, and some providers, like It’s Electric, are skipping partnerships with fuel retailers, focusing instead on slower and cheaper level 2 chargers that are convenient for apartments or homes without garages and do the job in four to 10 hours.

Charles Gerena, a lead organizer of the advocacy organization Drive Electric RVA, rarely visits a public charger in his Chevy Bolt. But on longer trips, he’s noticed more opportunities to plug in, especially in rural areas where fast charging was once scarce. On a recent road trip to Virginia Beach in his wife’s Ford Mustang Mach-E, he took advantage of the car’s ability to tap the Tesla Supercharger network and used the PlugShare app to find a reliable station — at a Wawa.

“I like Wawa’s food better than Sheetz,” he said. “I think I’m in the minority. My daughter actually likes Sheetz better.” Still, for Gerena, reliability trumps loyalty. “If it gets a lousy rating, I’d be wary of going to it, regardless of which gas station it was.”

Despite customer loyalty that can sometimes divide households, retailers are learning that sandwiches and snacks aren’t enough. Success will depend on providing plenty of opportunities to plug in, and making sure the hardware works when drivers need it.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/wawa.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-24 07:00:23.475097

Where companies choose to locate their data centers could alter their combined environmental footprints by a factor of up to 100.
In the course of their operations, data centers use water as a coolant.
The researchers also examined the water impact of existing Google data centers and found that the majority were located in areas with low water stress.
“We infer that Google already somewhat considered water stress because they put most of the data centers in low-stress regions.”","Data centers are notoriously thirsty. Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have found that, in 2023, the facilities consumed roughly 17 billion gallons of water for their operations in the U.S. alone. But that’s only a small part of the picture: A much, much larger share of data center water-intensity is indirect, a byproduct of the facilities’ enormous appetites for energy. That’s because most power plants themselves require huge amounts of water to operate. This off-site, indirect water consumption amounted to a whopping 211 billion gallons in the Berkeley lab’s 2023 tally — well over 10 times the direct on-site usage. As Silicon Valley continues to pour hundreds of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence and demand for data centers grows, these water needs are only going to grow in tandem.

However, new research from Cornell University shows that there’s a way to mitigate both the climate and water footprints of these facilities: build them in places with lots of wind and solar energy. “Location really matters,” said Fengqi You, an energy systems engineering professor at Cornell and co-author of the new study. Where companies choose to locate their data centers could alter their combined environmental footprints by a factor of up to 100.

In the course of their operations, data centers use water as a coolant. Energy-hungry servers generate substantial heat, and water circulates through cooling systems to prevent the equipment from overheating and breaking down. But substantial amounts of water are also used indirectly through the generation of electricity to run the facilities. Thermoelectric power plants, regardless of whether they use coal, gas, or nuclear material, use that fuel to generate heat that converts water into steam, which is then used to spin a turbine and generate electricity. And since hydroelectric plants typically store large volumes of water in reservoirs behind dams, there is water loss there as well, as water continually evaporates from the surface of reservoirs.

All told, water use during power generation can be responsible for more than 70 percent of a data center’s total water consumption, according to the new Cornell research. “That’s why the electricity power grid mix is very critical,” said You.

You and his co-authors examined the energy and water use of data centers across the country to project where future investments should be made to reduce environmental impacts. The study assumes that the data center boom, which is being fueled by staggering levels of investment in artificial intelligence, is unlikely to slow down anytime soon. Against that backdrop, the question the study then poses is: Where in the country is the most environmentally sustainable place to build a data center?

The researchers considered both the direct and indirect uses of energy and water as a result of building a data center in a specific location. The most promising region they identified might turn heads: bone-dry West Texas. But because the region is sparsely populated, has groundwater that can be drawn on for use as a coolant, and produces ample wind energy, it scored highest on both energy and water stress metrics. In fact, the grid-related water footprint in West Texas is among the lowest in the country, thanks to the large amount of wind energy produced, according to the study.

“From an energy and water efficiency perspective, the states that have enough dry renewables will be the best choice,” said You, adding that Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota all appear to be prime locations for future AI servers, alongside the Lone Star State.

Conversely, most parts of the Pacific Northwest didn’t score as well because of the region’s reliance on hydropower. Although the cost of electricity is low in the area, the associated loss of water through power generation means that building more data centers is likely to have a substantially larger water footprint than it would in other parts of the country.

Another recent study from researchers at Purdue University came to a similar conclusion. They looked at the availability of water across the country and mapped out how that might change over time, particularly as climate change makes some regions hotter and drier. The researchers also examined the water impact of existing Google data centers and found that the majority were located in areas with low water stress.

“Companies absolutely take the environment into consideration in their decisions — not just the economic factor,” said Yi Ding, one of the authors of the paper and an electrical and computer engineering professor at Purdue. “We infer that Google already somewhat considered water stress because they put most of the data centers in low-stress regions.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2236721497-e1763760608494.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-24 04:59:18.808837

Ambassadors and colleagues. Welcome to the 172nd meeting of the Committee of Permanent Representatives (CPR).

Today, we will focus on preparations for the upcoming Open-Ended CPR (OECPR) and the seventh session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-7). Before we get into those details, please allow me to update you on some key developments that have relevance for UNEA – not just for this session, but for the long-term future of the assembly.

I will begin with the findings of UNEP’s Emissions Gap and Adaptation Gap reports, as they are crucial to understanding where we are with respect to climate change and where we need to be.

While we have made some progress, the world remains off track to deliver commitments made under the Paris Agreement. 117 new Nationally Determined Contributions have been submitted by countries, but, as our data shows, we still need much greater ambition as global warming projections over this century are 2.3-2.5°C. The multi-decadal average of global temperatures will exceed 1.5°C, very likely within the next decade.

So, we still need rapid and unprecedented cuts to greenhouse gas emissions – to make this overshoot minimal and temporary and to reduce an escalation of costly climate impacts. And as we hurtle towards greater climate damage, developing countries will need adaptation finance of US$310 to US$365 billion per year by 2035 – 12 times as much as current international public adaptation finance flows. The world is simply not prepared for what is coming.

UNEP took this message to COP30, called by many ‘the implementation COP’.

And here, please allow me to express my deep appreciation to the government and people of Brazil for hosting us at the gateway to the Amazon in Belem. I think it was a stroke of genius to place the COP in this complex setting, where the real world meets climate change. Where the pressures on the forests are real and tangible. Where Indigenous People voices are clear and loud. Where the rain comes not in drops, but in buckets. Where nature is lush and vibrant. And where heat and humidity are so high that you long for the blast of the air conditioner, come what may. Not a wealthy city. But a city light, vibrant, and alive – leaning to green solutions and possibilities.

And while achieving progress in challenging geopolitical times is never guaranteed, Belém showed that the Paris Agreement is working. The talks delivered a call to triple adaptation finance by 2035, a Just Transition Mechanism, new dialogues on how trade can support climate-resilient economic transformation and more.

COP30 also reinforced growing global momentum, inside and outside the negotiating halls, to transition away from fossil fuels, as agreed at COP28. To halt deforestation – including through the launch of the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which now stands at US$6.7 billion. And to pursue rapid, high-impact measures such as cutting methane emissions. The Action Agenda, the foundation to an inclusive COP that saw unprecedented Indigenous Peoples leadership from the Amazon and across the world, reinforced that this momentum is coming from all sources.

No one is saying that we are on track. But proven solutions do exist and are right in front of us. A pathway remains to meet our global commitments. Countries should see their new national climate plans as a baseline to build on, not a ceiling for ambition.

Keeping 1.5°C within reach requires us to accelerate the era of implementation at an unprecedented rate, so that we can deliver what people deserve: affordable clean energy, good jobs, clean air, and a safer, more-resilient future for all. And we have to better finance, implement and prioritise adaptation efforts.

UNEP will support the drive to bring down emissions and adapt to climate change, including through new initiatives launched at COP30. For example, UNEP teamed up with the Brazilian Presidency to launch the Beat the Heat implementation drive, with over 150 cities signing up in support of efforts to adapt to climate change in urban environments and reduce emissions through passive, nature-based cooling.

Excellencies,

Another crucial issue is the environmental impact of armed conflict and climate-related risks to peace and security. Prior to the COP, I was invited by the Presidency of the UN Security Council, Sierra Leone, to brief the Council on this issue. I made the point that climate change exacerbates tensions and can, under some circumstances, contribute to conflicts. I also made the point that conflict-related environmental damage can push people into hunger, disease and displacement – as we have seen in Gaza, the Sudan, the DRC, Ukraine and elsewhere. For Gaza, I hope that the recent ceasefire will be upheld by all parties and fully implemented so that it can turn into a long-lasting peace that will allow for a full recovery, including of the environment, backed by international support.

In this regard, in the Security Council, I called for all conflict-affected countries to be supported with tools to protect natural resources and the environment and provided three priorities that the Security Council could engage on: rebuilding national capacity for environmental management, facilitating and enabling work across sectors, and increasing investments in climate adaptation in conflict-affected countries.

During the high-level week of the 80th UN General Assembly (UNGA), we also saw climate change high on the agenda, as well as overwhelming support for the text of the first UN global political declaration on responding to noncommunicable diseases and mental health in an integrated manner. The declaration called for efforts to address the environmental determinants of health, which is central to UNEP’s work – from reducing air pollution to limiting exposure to hazardous substances and chemicals. And, of course, when we talk about mental health, we know that spending time in nature reduces stress and anxiety. UNEP clearly has a leading role to play in this space.

UN80 and UN reform were also welcomed at UNGA. As you know, UNEP is engaged in a reform process to strengthen environmental support for the three pillars of the UN charter – peace, human rights and development – and to address fragmentation of the UN environmental architecture.

We now have a UN80 Action Plan, which has been distributed to Member States. Work package 27 of this Plan, led by me and Simon Stiell, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, is to “undertake a thorough assessment of current arrangements and make proposals on possible structural changes and programme realignments on environmental issues”.

UNEP has always sought to be cost efficient and responsive. You are aware that UNEP undertook a Functional Review in the context of UN80 to identify cost reductions and to create a more agile streamlined and forward-looking organization. This coming Thursday, I will provide a briefing to delegations on the key outcomes of the Functional Review. Last week, the Directors of the Corporate Services Division and the Policy and Programme Division also briefed you on the resource mobilization strategy and how UNEP could offer more-impactful and results-driven delivery.

The delivery of these necessary changes for the organization’s future is possible only if UNEP’s core fund, the Environment Fund, is adequately resourced. Let me therefore invite all Member States who have not yet contributed in 2025 to do so as soon as possible.

Excellencies, now let us turn to UNEA-7 itself.

The informal consultations on the draft resolutions and decisions, which began on 18 September, concluded on 14 November. This was an important milestone. Over the past weeks, proponents have introduced their draft resolutions and decisions, engaged in constructive question-and-answer sessions, submitted revised drafts, and completed a full first reading of most drafts with textual proposals.

We now have 19 draft decisions and resolutions. I am pleased to see that there are drafts on AI, on minerals and metals and on issues related to the hydrological cycle and many other areas, some of which were priority areas highlighted in the first part of my report to UNEA-7.

The progress made during the intersessional period is encouraging and significant. When we come to the OECPR, Member States will have advanced versions of the texts in hand, allowing negotiations to begin from a more informed and mature starting point. This is how we strengthen the OECPR’s effectiveness and ensure that the process delivers outcomes that are both ambitious and implementable.

My thanks to the co-facilitators for their leadership and to all delegations for their active and constructive participation. I am also aware that the co-facilitators are already working diligently on cross-cutting issues – work that will be essential to building convergence and addressing linkages in a coherent manner.

Let me also acknowledge the efforts invested last week, when the Bureau and co-facilitators undertook three intensive days of further familiarization with the UN processes and the co-facilitator role. This kind of preparation – practical, focused and collaborative – is exactly what enables the OECPR to function as the strong and solution-oriented body it is meant to be.

All of this gives me confidence. We are entering the OECPR well prepared, with solid groundwork laid and a clear sense of direction. UNEP will support you every step of the way as we move toward a successful OECPR and, ultimately, a strong UNEA-7.

Excellencies,

Let us also remember that this is moment for UNEA and the CPR to lean into the UN80 space. This is a moment for real leadership.

Just to reiterate some of what I said in the second part of my report to UNEA, we must now look hard at how to unleash UNEA’s full potential as the world’s highest level global environmental forum and decision-making body. At how to make UNEA more focused, strategic and responsive – with meaningful resolutions that Ministers and cabinets in capitals will back and implement, with strong technical and scientific support from UNEP and the trifecta of science-policy panels. And at how to ensure that UNEA and UNEP knit together the work of Multilateral Environmental Agreements, and other bodies and initiatives, in a way that is consistent with the drive for united and efficient action under Work Package 27.

We are in a period of change. It is up to us all to shape this change so that the CPR, UNEA and UNEP emerge stronger. Sharper. Better able to support the UN system and Member States to stabilize the climate; restore nature, land and biodiversity; and decrease pollution and waste. And ultimately deliver a better future for the billions of people we serve across the world.

That’s where the EV Readiness program comes in, helping municipalities increase charging stations and educate residents on EVs and the incentives that are still available.
Before that designation, Rolling Meadows already hosted a number of EV chargers on-site at corporate employers, including aerospace firm Northrop Grumman and the Gallagher insurance company’s global headquarters.
Despite the troubling federal outlook, Botero said, “the silver lining is Illinois is extremely committed to EVs.”","In the waning days of the Biden administration, the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus announced an award of $14.5 million in federal funds to build almost 200 EV charging stations across the Chicago area.

A few weeks later, after President Donald Trump had taken office, the funds were “gone,” as the caucus’ environmental initiatives director, Edith Makra, put it. One of Trump’s earliest actions was to suspend the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure grant program, which is where the money for the Chicago-area charging effort had come from.

The Metropolitan Mayors Caucus is forging ahead with its EV Readiness program anyway. Even without the funds, there’s much it can do to help Chicago-area towns and cities get more chargers in the ground and EVs on the road. In fact, the caucus has already been doing that work for the last three years, thanks to funding from the Illinois utility ComEd.

Leaders say it’s an example of how local programs can make progress even when federal dollars are ripped away. It’s also a way to help meet Illinois’ ambitious goal of placing 1 million EVs on the state’s roads by 2030, a major leap from the roughly 160,000 registered as of November.

This fall, the caucus launched its fourth EV Readiness cohort, wherein representatives of 16 municipalities will learn how to upgrade their permitting and zoning processes related to EV charging, raise awareness about EVs and state and local incentives, and craft mandates for charging access.

Since 2022, 38 communities have gone through the program, and state data shows that EV registrations in most of these communities have increased faster than in the state as a whole.

More than money

Cost is one of the core factors holding back EV adoption in Illinois, and beyond.

Trump administration policies have made that hurdle even higher. Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, rebates of $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used ones expired in September, while the federal tax credit for EV chargers will disappear in June 2026.

But price is not the only factor, and as manufacturers manage to bring down costs, these other barriers will become even more crucial to address.

For example, many people hesitate to buy an electric vehicle because of range anxiety — the fear they will run out of battery and be unable to find a reliable charger. Or they may feel intimidated by the concept of an EV in general. That’s where the EV Readiness program comes in, helping municipalities increase charging stations and educate residents on EVs and the incentives that are still available.

Participating communities can achieve bronze, silver, or gold status by taking certain actions on a checklist of over 130 possible steps. These include nuanced zoning and permitting changes, like examining when chargers can be in the public right of way and processing permit applications for the equipment in 10 days or less.

Streamlining such regulations helps charging-station companies that want to do business in the area, and the owners of gas stations, apartment buildings, parking garages, corporations, and other locations who want to install ports.

Makra called EV-friendly zoning and permitting codes “a glide path for sensible development.”

“Municipalities have a big role to play in making charging infrastructure available to their communities,” added Cristina Botero, senior manager of beneficial electrification for ComEd, which funds the EV Readiness program as part of a state mandate called beneficial electrification. “This program is so effective because it’s helping the leadership of these communities understand what steps need to happen.”

The EV Readiness program also encourages municipalities to establish requirements for charging access in new construction and to train first responders to deal with EV battery fires. Participants can take steps to boost public awareness, too, informing residents about utility rate programs conducive to EV charging and creating a landing page about EVs on the town website.

“People sometimes think that the dollars are the only reason people are not transitioning to EVs,” said Botero. “But a big part of it is education.”

Across the map

The EV Readiness program has so far attracted a wide range of municipalities, from the EV-friendly and relatively high-income Highland Park to smaller communities that otherwise “do not stand out from a sustainability or transportation standpoint,” noted Makra.

“What’s so gratifying is to see the diversity in jurisdictions,” she said. “They’re stepping forward and saying, ‘This would be good for our community.’”

That diversity is reflected in the new cohort, too, which includes the wealthy Chicago suburb of Winnetka and the small farm town of Sandwich.

Glen Cole, assistant manager for the city of Rolling Meadows, said the EV Readiness program helps local governments make it easier for building owners and businesses to comply with state law, which requires that all parking spaces at new large multifamily buildings and at least one space at new smaller residences have the electrical infrastructure needed to one day install an EV charger.

Rolling Meadows is a leafy suburb of about 24,000 people. Along with Chicago, it became one of three municipalities to earn gold status in the cohort that finished this summer.

Before that designation, Rolling Meadows already hosted a number of EV chargers on-site at corporate employers, including aerospace firm Northrop Grumman and the Gallagher insurance company’s global headquarters. Seven chargers are also under construction at Rolling Meadows’ city hall. The city adopted an ordinance in February mandating that new or renovated gas stations have one EV fast-charger for every four fuel pumps, and that parking lots with 30 or more spots have EV chargers.

Cole said the EV Readiness program helped advance the city’s progress

“The biggest part for us was putting in one place all these standards and expectations for an installer or investor or business, and incrementally easing into policy requirements to provide charging at public locations,” Cole said. “The availability of quick, easy, high-quality access to charging is a big determinant of whether people will take the leap to EVs, and it’s something the city can exercise a lot of control over.”

Utility leadership

Multiple items on the EV Readiness checklist require collaborating with ComEd and making the public aware of the utility’s EV incentives and billing plans conducive to charging.

ComEd, whose northern Illinois territory is home to 90% of the state’s EVs, offers rebates for households that install “smart” Level 2 EV chargers and covers the cost of any electrical work needed. In 2026, the maximum rebate will be $2,500, and could change with market conditions, according to the utility. ComEd also covers the cost of fast chargers and the “make-ready” construction and prep work for businesses and public agencies, and offers rebates for EV fleet vehicles.

The utility has paid out over $130 million for more than 8,700 charging ports and more than 2,700 fleet vehicles since early 2024, with 80% of the funds spent in communities identified as low-income or equity-eligible, per state law prioritizing investment in underserved communities. Low-income and equity-eligible customers receive higher rebates, and Botero said the utility has done extensive outreach in those areas, where the tax-credit expiration will make it especially hard for people to afford EVs.

“The opportunities we offer are more important than ever,” Botero said.

Botero said that after the Trump administration ended EV tax credits, the utility “went back to the drawing board” and increased the rebates it had previously planned for 2026, though some of the amounts will still be lower than in 2025. Incentives for light-duty vehicles in non-equity areas will end, but the utility will increase rebates for some types of vehicles in equity areas. For example, the 2026 rebate for electric school buses in those areas will be $220,000 to $240,000, up from $180,000 this year.

The state of Illinois offers $4,000 rebates for low-income EV buyers and a $2,000 rebate for those who don’t qualify as low-income. The state also this month started accepting applications for about $20 million in grants for public charging stations. In the third quarter of 2025, Illinois logged a record number of EV sales, mirroring national trends as people scrambled to buy EVs before the tax credits expired in September.

Despite the troubling federal outlook, Botero said, “the silver lining is Illinois is extremely committed to EVs.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/canary_media_articles_453/ff3097b2ec167a927aacd00c052351ea,N,,2025-11-24 07:00:27.973562

500 skilled clean energy jobs will be secured for workers in North Wales and the North West as 2 trailblazing carbon capture projects get ready for construction.

The UK’s first carbon capture-enabled cement plant at Padeswood, developed by Heidelberg Materials UK, and one of the world’s first full-scale carbon capture-enabled waste-to-energy facilities at Protos in Ellesmere Port, developed by Encyclis, have signed final contracts with government to begin construction. The 2 projects will provide highly skilled opportunities for Britain’s engineers, construction workers, technicians and health and safety experts.

Cement and waste-to-energy production are carbon-intensive and have no route to cut emissions without carbon capture. As the government accelerates to net zero, Padeswood and Protos will deploy world-leading technologies to remove 1.2 million tonnes of CO2 annually, forging a cleaner future with secure, long-term jobs for workers and businesses in the cement and waste-to-energy industries.

The projects will serve as the launch-point for exporting British technology, innovation and expertise abroad, creating economic opportunities for UK-based companies across the world - boosting growth and giving British business a competitive edge in the global green economy.

These are the first 2 anchor projects to join Eni’s Liverpool Bay Transportation & Storage network, part of the HyNet carbon capture cluster which was green-lit by the Prime Minister in April, after years of delay in getting the industry moving. As a key pillar of the modern Industrial Strategy, the government further backed carbon capture in June’s Spending Review with £9.4 billion over this Parliament to revitalise Britain’s industrial heartlands with good, skilled jobs for working people.

Today’s announcement is that investment in action - shovel-ready projects, jobs secured, and growth locked in for decades to come across North Wales and the North West.

Energy Minister Michael Shanks said:

Our clean energy mission means good jobs, regional growth, and investment for local communities.

These trailblazing projects showcase North Wales and the North West’s workforce on the global stage – leading the charge in the clean industries of the future and powering Britain’s reindustrialisation.

Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens said:

We are making the UK a clean energy superpower while delivering the well-paid, highly-skilled jobs of the future.

It is fantastic to see North Wales at the forefront of carbon capture and the hundreds of new jobs being created by these projects will help drive regional growth as well as accelerating our drive towards lower bills and energy security.

HyNet is a network of new and repurposed infrastructure, such as pipelines, spanning North Wales and the North West which will capture carbon emissions and store them safely underground.

Both projects have now signed contracts with the Low Carbon Contracts Company, marking their final investment decisions. With this milestone reached, projects are expected to move into the construction phase shortly. The projects directly support 500 skilled jobs, as part of the 2,800 jobs across the wider HyNet network.

Padeswood and Protos carbon capture projects also provide long-term job security for workers in the cement and waste industries by providing a crucial route to decarbonisation for the sectors, preserving these proud British industries as we reach net zero.

By investing in proven carbon capture technology, the government is positioning Britain as a global leader on net zero while protecting skilled manufacturing jobs for future generations.",,N,,2025-11-24 08:58:15.898847

The UK’s new Vision 2035 minerals strategy aims to secure lithium, rare earths and other critical materials to support advanced industries including clean energy, defense, semiconductors and emerging quantum technologies.

By expanding domestic refining, midstream processing and recycling capacity, the plan reduces reliance on concentrated global supply chains that also underpin superconducting, photonic and trapped-ion quantum hardware.

The strategy’s diversification targets, investment tools and defense-sector resilience measures position the UK to stabilize upstream inputs for future quantum processors, sensors and networking systems while strengthening broader industrial security.

The UK government laid out a sweeping plan to secure critical minerals through 2035, aiming to shield its high-tech industries from global supply-chain shocks while building domestic mining, refining and recycling capacity. The strategy, published as Vision 2035: Critical Minerals Strategy, targets sectors ranging from clean energy and advanced manufacturing to defense, digital infrastructure and, while not mentioned specifically, the quantum technology industry.

In essence, the policy outlines an effort to increase domestic production, expand midstream processing, diversify imports and create a circular economy for minerals essential to modern hardware.

The strategy places significant emphasis on lithium, rare earth elements, nickel, copper and a new category of “growth minerals,” which the UK expects will be central to economic expansion. Quantum technologies — like superconducting processors, trapped-ion systems, photonic chips and quantum sensors — depend heavily on many of the same materials. That overlap positions the quantum industry to be involved in a minerals policy crafted primarily with smart phones, batteries and clean energy in mind.

Supply Chains for Tomorrow’s Hardware

The government’s roadmap anticipates dramatic increases in demand for materials across advanced industries, adding that lithium demand, for example, could increase more than tenfold. The plan warns that concentrated global supply chains — especially in rare earths and midstream processing — have created strategic vulnerabilities that now ripple into sectors beyond electric vehicles or renewable energy. Quantum computing and sensing would likely fall into this category because they depend on ultra-pure metals, semiconductor feedstocks and rare-earth dopants used in photonics, superconducting circuits and precision measurement devices.

The UK’s experience with lithium, nickel, tin and rare-earth recycling highlights why the strategy could matter to quantum firms. Quantum processors require high-purity aluminum, copper, niobium, silicon and rare-earth elements used in optical amplifiers or quantum memories. Quantum sensors rely on specialty alloys, doped crystals and diamond substrates. As quantum prototypes scale toward commercial hardware, the industry faces the same upstream risks that challenge battery and semiconductor manufacturers. The minerals plan could be seen as a way to place the UK on a path to relieve some of those pressures.

The most immediate connection to the quantum sector lies in the government’s push to expand the country’s midstream processing — transforming mined or recycled materials into high-purity feedstocks suitable for manufacturing. The strategy singles out this stage of the value chain as a national competitive advantage, citing the country’s refining expertise, research institutions and industrial clusters in Cornwall, Wales, the North East and Northern Ireland.

Quantum hardware companies have struggled with midstream vulnerability, particularly in superconducting and photonic systems where purity levels must meet strict tolerances. The UK’s focus on building capacity for refining lithium, rare earths and specialty metals could give domestic quantum firms more stable access to critical inputs. It may also lower cost volatility by reducing exposure to overseas processors, especially in markets where supply is concentrated in a small number of countries.

The government’s investment mechanisms — including the National Wealth Fund, UK Export Finance and a new £50 million critical-minerals project fund — are structured to support capital-intensive projects that bridge mining, midstream processing and advanced manufacturing. Quantum firms that depend on rare-earth dopants, ultra-pure metals or semiconductor-grade materials may be able to align with these programs through supply-chain integration rather than direct mineral extraction.

Defense Stockpiling and Dual-Use Technologies

The plan also outlines new steps to strengthen mineral supply chains for the defense sector. The government is considering industry-led stockpiles and diversified sourcing requirements tied to procurement, aiming to reduce strategic dependence on any single country. Because quantum technology is increasingly treated as a dual-use capability — serving defense communications, navigation, sensing and code-breaking countermeasures — the sector is likely to be affected by these measures even though it is not explicitly named in the strategy.

Quantum processors rely on materials such as ytterbium, strontium, beryllium, high-purity gold, superconducting metals and rare-earth magnets used in trapping and control systems. Defense-aligned supply rules could impose higher sourcing standards and new reporting requirements on firms operating in or selling to the UK. They may also open new funding channels for quantum hardware suppliers who align with the UK’s mineral security posture.

A Circular Economy for High-Tech Materials

Recycling plays a central role in the government’s 2035 targets, which call for 20% of total UK mineral demand to be met via recovered materials. Today, recycling of many rare earths and specialty metals remains limited by low collection rates and high processing costs. The strategy views this as an opportunity, pointing to UK capabilities in platinum-group metals and early-stage rare-earth magnet recycling.

For quantum technologies, which have not yet reached a scale where recycling is a pressing issue, the long-term benefits could be substantial. As cryogenic systems, photonic modules and trapped-ion devices enter commercial service in the 2030s, recycling infrastructure for rare earths, superconducting alloys and high-purity metals will matter more. The report indicates that recycled sources of key minerals will increase sharply after 2030 as large energy systems reach end of life. That timeline aligns with forecasts for larger-scale quantum deployments, giving the industry a future pathway to more sustainable and less volatile input materials.

The strategy acknowledges that China dominates rare earth and midstream processing, controlling the majority of global refining capacity. The UK intends to maintain engagement with China while expanding partnerships with countries such as Canada, Australia, Japan, India, Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan. These partnerships cover long-term purchase contracts (called offtake agreements), joint project development, financing arrangements and technology exchange.

Quantum firms, particularly those developing photonic and superconducting systems, source materials from the same networks facing geopolitical tension. The UK’s effort to diversify imports and strengthen industry-to-industry ties may ease some of the supply-chain friction quantum hardware makers face as export controls tighten and markets become more protectionist.

The government’s diversification target, which aims to ensure that no single country provides more than 60% of any aggregated critical mineral supply, signals a move toward greater resilience across all high-tech sectors.",https://thequantuminsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-24-at-4.14.20-AM.png,N,,2025-11-24 06:00:32.208522

Maxvolt is building a complete circular ecosystem for lithium battery manufacturing and reuse. How does your Aligarh recycling plant fit into this strategy?

Our circular ecosystem is designed to cover the complete lifecycle of a battery from manufacturing to reuse and eventually recycling. Once fresh batteries are produced from raw materials sourced from our vendors, we also collect used or scrap batteries from customers through our exchange model. These used batteries are first evaluated to extract healthy cells, which are then repurposed into more miniature battery packs suitable for applications like electronic gadgets, toys, robotics, and compact backup devices. The remaining unusable materials are sent to our Aligarh recycling plant, where they are processed and segregated into different metals and materials. These recovered materials are then made available again for new battery production, completing the circular loop.

How will the company manage the flow of used batteries from collection to repurposing or recycling?

Our collection-to-recycling flow is designed to be seamless and customer-friendly. We offer attractive exchange values for returned batteries that are no longer fit for use in vehicles. Customers benefit from receiving good value for their scrap batteries, while we ensure the safe handover and responsible handling of these units. Usable components are repurposed for secondary applications, whereas the remainder is sent for proper recycling. This process not only lowers customer costs but also accelerates our recycling workflow while ensuring all materials are handled safely.

What environmental and business benefits do you foresee from integrating recycling with production?

Integrating recycling with production brings multiple environmental and business benefits. Environmentally, it ensures that scrap lithium cells are used to their full potential rather than ending up in landfills, where they would decompose improperly. Since the metals used in lithium batteries can be reused multiple times, recycling allows us to extract valuable materials from old batteries and convert them into new, usable components. From a business perspective, recycling creates a strong additional revenue stream and reduces dependence on fresh raw materials. It also supports long-term sustainability while boosting operational efficiency.

With 5x year-on-year revenue growth and a strong IPO response, what key factors are sustaining this momentum?

Our momentum is being driven primarily by strong customer satisfaction and continuous demand for our products. As customers experience reliable performance from our batteries, market demand naturally continues to rise. This consistent demand cycle has helped us maintain strong year-on-year revenue growth and has directly contributed to the positive response we received during our IPO.

How do you plan to balance domestic and international market expansion over the next few years?

Currently, our focus remains on the domestic market, as India presents a massive opportunity in the EV battery segment. The demand here is skyrocketing, and we aim to serve this market fully in the near term. Once our domestic supply is strong and stable, we plan to expand into international markets as well. That will allow us to take the strengths of our product to global users while continuing to grow our footprint.

What new customer segments or applications do you see emerging for lithium-ion technology in India?

We are seeing a significant increase in demand across multiple new segments, especially as the government is actively promoting renewable energy and new battery-based technologies. Most modern gadgets are now shifting to rechargeable formats, which naturally creates a greater need for lithium-ion solutions. As these trends accelerate, customer segments and application areas for lithium-ion batteries continue to expand across consumer electronics, mobility, small appliances, and digital devices.

Maxvolt has invested heavily in R&D. What are your current focus areas in lithium battery innovation and fast-changing technologies?

We continuously invest in R&D because lithium batteries are highly technical products, and the market demands the highest levels of safety and reliability. Our current focus is on enhancing battery safety, improving error-free performance, and developing systems that make batteries more user-friendly. Additionally, with the rise of fast-charging technology, especially on two-wheelers, we are working to make our batteries fully compatible with fast charging. This ensures longer battery life and greater convenience for users in line with evolving technological needs.

How are strategic collaborations helping Maxvolt expand its footprint in the EV and energy-storage markets?

Strategic collaborations are playing a key role in strengthening our growth. These partnerships enable us to enhance R&D, expand our manufacturing capability year after year, and accelerate our recycling initiatives. They also improve our market presence by helping us reach customers more directly through promotional and on-ground activities. Through these collaborations, end users gain better awareness of our products, their features, and the advantages of using Maxvolt batteries, which ultimately supports rapid market expansion.

How do Maxvolt’s manufacturing and recycling initiatives align with India’s clean energy and sustainability goals?

Our manufacturing and recycling efforts are closely aligned with India’s clean energy vision. By integrating recycling into our operations, we reduce waste and support a circular economy, thereby reducing the need for imported raw materials and contributing to national resource efficiency. These initiatives help reduce environmental impact and support India’s long-term net-zero and sustainability commitments. Overall, our work in both battery production and recycling directly strengthens the country’s green energy ecosystem.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/11/24/Mukesh-Gupta-Co-Founder-and-CMO-Maxvolt-Energy.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 07:00:33.146414

Offshore wind alleviates grid woes in winter, study says. - Canary Media",Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/grid-reliability-east-coast-trump-study,"He has derided wind energy as unreliable and expensive while freezing permitting and halting projects already under construction.

Countering Trump’s offshore wind claims The report’s conclusions stand in stark contrast to rhetoric coming from top officials implementing Trump’s war on offshore wind.
But when temperatures plummet, offshore wind power could be a huge cost-saver for many U.S. residents.","President Donald Trump has made it his mission to banish offshore wind farms from America. He has derided wind energy as unreliable and expensive while freezing permitting and halting projects already under construction.

Yet a new report suggests that the president’s moves could be working against grid reliability in key parts of the country. Along the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, offshore wind can play a critical role in keeping the lights on year-round, especially through the winter, according to a study published this month by New York City–based consultancy Charles River Associates.

Trump’s attacks on offshore wind and other renewable sectors come amid dire challenges for the nation’s power system. The world’s wealthiest companies are building power-hungry data centers as grid infrastructure ages and households’ energy bills skyrocket. The White House itself has declared an ​“energy emergency,” which it’s using to push for more fossil-gas, coal, and nuclear power plants.

But offshore wind is well suited to ​“meeting the moment,” in part because gas plants are reliable in the summer but can buckle under winter weather, according to the study. Ocean winds in the Northeast are at their strongest and steadiest in winter months, making turbines there a way to boost the reliability of power grids connected to underperforming gas plants.

Oliver Stover, a coauthor of the study, called offshore wind farms a ​“near-term solution,” saying that turbines at sea and gas plants on land complement each other throughout the Northeast’s changing seasons: ​“They’re stronger together.”

Stover explained that if grid reliability is the goal, it makes sense for planned offshore wind farms to reach completion. Those projects will help regional grids burdened by extreme winter weather and data-center demands ​“buy time” as more infrastructure is built.

“Every megawatt is a good megawatt,” he said.

All eyes on winter

The periods in which offshore wind performs best also align with the time of increasing grid strain: winter mornings and evenings, when people tend to crank up the heat. While peak electricity demand has historically happened during the summer months, it is shifting to these winter moments in many parts of the country, largely due to the mass electrification of space-heating systems.

That means securing power generation during colder months must be, according to Stover, ​“a priority going forward.”

Stover and his colleagues aren’t the first to underscore the reliability benefits of offshore wind. Other analysts, along with grid operators, have warned that Trump’s efforts to squash certain projects that East Coast states were planning to rely on could raise blackout risks and power bills in the region.

Take Revolution Wind: Trump paused construction of the Rhode Island project in August due to ​“national security concerns” that a federal judge said were not rooted in ​“factual findings.” Having won an injunction in court, developer Ørsted eventually resumed construction one month later.

But during the pause and amid mounting uncertainty over the project’s fate, ISO New England — the region’s grid operator — released a statement saying that delaying delivery of power from Revolution Wind ​“will increase risks to reliability.”

Susan Muller, a senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told Canary Media that if Revolution Wind were killed, the impact would be most acutely felt in winter months. That’s when the region’s limited supply of fossil gas is stretched even thinner, since the fuel is used for both building heating and power generation.

Losing Revolution Wind’s electricity entirely would have cost New England consumers about $500 million a year, according to Abe Silverman, a research scholar at Johns Hopkins University. His estimation was based on the value that the offshore project had secured in ISO New England’s forward capacity market as well as its potential to supplant costlier power plants used during grid emergencies, like snowstorms.

“We don’t need a bunch of fancy studies to tell us that these units are needed for reliability,” Silverman told Canary Media in September during Revolution Wind’s government-ordered pause.

In Virginia, the world’s data-center capital, America’s largest offshore wind farm is slated to start generating power in March 2026. Trump has not yet targeted the 2.6-gigawatt project, but if it doesn’t come online as planned, the mid-Atlantic grid region run by PJM Interconnection would be less reliable and have higher electricity costs, this month’s study says.

In a large swath of the Mid-Atlantic region, offshore wind has one of the highest ​“resource-adequacy” scores among energy types, according to the study. In other words, when it comes to lowering the probability of blackouts there, offshore wind outcompetes all other types of renewable energy — and is even on par with the most efficient gas-fired power plants.

But the sector is not without its issues, Stover emphasized. Even before Trump’s anti-wind policies made investors skittish and permits no longer guaranteed, construction costs had been ballooning for years, given supply chain issues and inflation.

Offshore wind farms are also, by nature, megaprojects that come with inherent logistical hurdles. Just last month, New York’s Empire Wind lost the turbine-construction vessel it was banking on, due to a skirmish between two shipbuilding companies. Only a handful of boats in the world are capable of doing that kind of work.

Countering Trump’s offshore wind claims

The report’s conclusions stand in stark contrast to rhetoric coming from top officials implementing Trump’s war on offshore wind. The sector was just taking off in the U.S. when the president was inaugurated in January, with the first commercial-scale project coming on line last year and five more arrays now under construction.

“Under this administration, there is not a future for offshore wind because it is too expensive and not reliable enough,” Doug Burgum, secretary of the Interior Department, told an audience in September at a fossil-gas industry conference in Italy.

Burgum’s statements mirror some of Trump’s favorite talking points that have long misled the public about the risks of wind power. In September, Trump told the United Nations General Assembly in a speech that ​“windmills are so pathetic and bad” because of their unreliability, falsely claiming that wind power is ​“the most expensive energy ever conceived.”

The grid does not automatically face problems when ​“the wind doesn’t blow,” as Trump falsely claimed at the United Nations. Grid operators routinely handle the intermittent nature of power generation from multiple sources — whether it be solar, gas, or wind turbines — through grid-management techniques and, increasingly, battery storage.

While offshore wind energy is currently expensive, nuclear energy — a sector the Trump administration aims to boost — is typically the most expensive type of power.

Globally, power generated from wind turbines in the ocean is comparable to other sectors such as geothermal and coal when it comes to cost-competitiveness. In fact, offshore wind has become more cost-competitive relative to other power types in recent years as the sector has matured in Europe and China, according to the most recent analysis by financial advisory firm Lazard.

But when temperatures plummet, offshore wind power could be a huge cost-saver for many U.S. residents. One analysis found that in New England, if 3.5 gigawatts’ worth of under-construction offshore wind farms had been online, households there could have saved $400 million on power bills last winter. In the coming months, cost savings and reliability will take center stage as Vineyard Wind, the region’s first large-scale offshore wind farm to break ground, feeds the grid for its first full winter season.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/OffshoreTurbineRhodeISlandGettyImages-589721018.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=d9b06ac616e70c1c3f2ba191d97e753e,N,,2025-11-24 03:59:48.882910

GMB Scotland, one of the biggest unions across the energy sector, said nine out of ten members in oil and gas want the chancellor to cut the Energy Profits Levy in her budget on Wednesday to safeguard jobs, skills, and UK energy security.

The union’s polling also reveals eight out of ten (84 per cent) oil and gas workers do not believe UK or Scottish governments are capable of delivering a fair transition to renewable energy.

UK energy secretary Ed Miliband is promising 400,000 new jobs in green energy but, the poll suggests, nine out of ten (86 per cent) of GMB members do not believe renewables jobs will ever replace those lost in oil and gas.

Louise Gilmour, GMB Scotland secretary, said the snapshot survey of 250 oil and gas workers this week exposes their crushing lack of faith in ministers’ energy strategy and escalating fears over the rushed rundown of offshore production.

She said: “Our members are witnessing the needless and self-harming rush from oil and gas firsthand and their expert judgement could not be more damning.

“Ministers have stuck their fingers in their ears and ignored the voice of workers for too long but the warnings of industrial catastrophe are now deafening.

“Day after day, there are closures and redundancies in the oil and gas sector and across all the industries relying on it while we continue to be told of green jobs tomorrow.

“Tomorrow is too late, we need action today to slow the carnage and that must start with Wednesday's budget.”

The GMB Scotland poll revealed 84 per cent of oil and gas workers surveyed believe creating secure jobs should be the top priority for ministers during the transition to renewables.

Other priorities highlighted by the workers, with jobs offshore and in supply chains, include lowering household bills (79 per cent); ensuring an effective mix of energy sources (71 per cent); investment to allow more oil and gas exploration (66 per cent); and safeguarding energy security (65 per cent).

Almost every one of the workers (98 per cent) polled believe oil and gas will be essential in UK energy mix for years to come, however, and 77 per cent thought they would still be working in the sector in five years’ time.

Gilmour said the survey only confirmed how the drive to decarbonise will fail unless it is shaped by the expertise and insight of energy workers.

She said: “Experienced and skilled workers across oil and gas know better than anyone what the scale of this transition will demand and what is at stake.

“Promises of green jobs tomorrow mean nothing when real jobs are being lost today and, so far, this transition has been something done to our workers and their communities not with them.

BANGKOK, Thailand/RATANAKIRI, Cambodia — “When you touch the water of the O’Ta Bouk River, the mud will stick to your skin,” said Thao*. “It creates skin issues and we can’t catch fish this year anymore. It’s thick, like condensed milk. The oil from the machinery floats on the water surface, so it might affect our health, like our stomach or intestines.”

On the quiet banks where the Sesan River and O’Ta Bouk River (also known as the Prek Liang River) meet in the northeastern Cambodian province of Ratanakiri, Ta Bouk village is where Thao calls home. The O’Ta Bouk River flows some 90 kilometers (56 miles) through Virachey National Park, one of Cambodia’s oldest protected areas, before feeding into the Sesan River and providing water to Ta Bouk village, just 2 km (1.2 mi) from the park’s border.

The O’Ta Bouk has long sustained the Brao Indigenous communities who live, farm and fish along the river’s banks, providing them with clean, potable water for generations.

But Thao’s village is just one of the hundreds across the Mekong region that have seen their life-giving rivers poisoned by toxic runoff from an explosion of unregulated mining, much of this is driven by surging gold prices, rising demand for rare earth elements and limited government oversight or environmental standards.

Extensive satellite imagery analysis conducted by U.S. think tank the Stimson Center has uncovered 2,404 mines operational between 2014 and 2025 within river basins across the region — 114 of them identified as opening this year, and a further 182 appearing in satellite imagery in 2024.

Most of the mines identified, 1,868, are situated in Myanmar, and a significant amount, 518, are in Laos, along with one in Malaysia.

But even in Cambodia, where only 17 mines were found in close vicinity to rivers and streams, the impacts are already being felt keenly by communities that rely on rivers. In Thao’s case, the O’Ta Bouk River appears to be contaminated by a politically connected and unregulated gold mine upstream, that’s sending toxic runoff downstream into the Sesan River, a key tributary of the Mekong River and part of the 3S basin that includes the Sekong and Srepok rivers.

“In July, I experienced a skin issue with my foot after touching the water [from the O’Ta Bouk River],” Thao told Mongabay in November 2025. “After half an hour [my foot] was inflamed and itchy with small bumps on my skin. I went to buy medicine and after a week it disappeared.”

Thao, his sister and his 11-year-old son had all entered the water to bathe — and all developed red lesions on the parts of the skin that were submerged beneath the O’Ta Bouk. Thao showed reporters photos of his sister’s leg that were taken in July, shortly after they’d entered the water. Clusters of raised red welts can be seen speckled below his sister’s knee.

Ta Bouk village in Ta Veng district is home to more than 200 families, all of who rely heavily on the rivers and spend much of the year living and working on their plantations along the banks of the O’Ta Bouk.

Similar symptoms developed across members of the community who had entered the water, but few had access to health care; for some, Thao said, it took up to a month for the rashes to disappear.

Nearly 13 km (8 mi) northeast, further up the O’Ta Bouk River and nearly 6 km (3.7 mi) deep into Virachey National Park, lies the village of Mondul Yorn, where Chorn*, a former fisherman turned farmer, has had to abandon the water in the wake of the contamination. He also described developing itchy skin, red blemishes and inflammation after going into the O’Ta Bouk to fish.

“Before the [O’Ta Bouk] river changed I could catch 2-3 kilograms [4.4-6.6 pounds] of fish per day, but after the river changed, I had empty hands,” he said. “Now there’s no more fish in the river.”

Speaking with rangers from the provincial environmental department, who patrol within Virachey National Park that surrounds Mondol Yorn village, Chorn learned that gold mining operations had begun upstream. The rangers, he said, were convinced that the opening of gold mines between 2023 and 2024 was why the O’Ta Bouk River was devoid of fish and making people sick.

“I feel like [the company] wants to kill us, they don’t love us anymore. The river doesn’t pollute itself; it’s polluted by the company,” he said.

Tracking toxic rivers

As the Stimson Center data show, the poisoning of the O’Ta Bouk River is not an isolated incident. The spillover of chemicals associated with mining have long proved a problem for riverine communities in the Mekong region. Over the course of 2025, the situation on the Thai-Myanmar border has underscored the urgent need for government intervention on river pollution linked to unregulated mining operations.

But while these incidents have often been viewed as separate, the waterways that connect the Mekong region threaten to spread the problem downstream.

According to Brian Eyler, director of the Stimson Center’s energy, water and sustainability program in Southeast Asia, tributaries of the Mekong and the Irrawaddy rivers have the highest concentrations of mining operations. But, he said, the threat is spread across the Bilin, Irrawaddy, Salween and Sittaung river basins in Myanmar, the Lam, Ma and Mekong basins in Laos, and the Mekong Basin in Cambodia, potentially putting scores of rivers — and millions of people who depend on them — at risk from contamination.

“Testing on water, soil and sediment along these rivers should happen immediately with resources first allocated to the rivers with the highest number of mines and those that are home to the largest populations,” Eyler said. “Eventually, all rivers with mining activity should be tested. Testing should not be limited to the areas directly near the rivers’ channels because many of these rivers flood.”

Flooding, he warned, would see toxic water and sediment dispersed widely across floodplains, threatening agriculture and food security across the region. Testing the soil and groundwater of floodplains would allow authorities to tell people where it’s safe or not safe to plant crops.

Mines choke the region’s rivers

The mines identified by the Stimson Center’s satellite imagery analysis have largely not been confirmed with a visit to the site, or ground-truthed, but can be divided into three distinct types: alluvial mining, heap leaching mines extracting gold and other precious metals, and rare earth element mines.

“Alluvial mining for gold is the process of extracting sediment in the riverbed and along the riverside and extracting gold through various separation techniques including gravity techniques like sluicing, dredging and panning,” said Regan Kwan, lead researcher at the Stimson Center. “Mercury is often used alongside gravity techniques to improve the capture of gold through amalgamation.”

Between 2014 and 2025, the Stimson Center identified 1,342 alluvial mines, with 16 in Cambodia, 347 in Laos and 979 in Myanmar. But while these mines are thought to have a relatively short lifespan, the Stimson Center found 68 across the region that opened in 2024 and a further 17 that opened in 2025. Most of the mines identified are suspected to be gold mines. But without ground-truthing, it’s possible that some mining operations may be seeking tin, copper, nickel and other metals.

Another form of mining identified was heap leaching, which Kwan said entails gold ore being mined, crushed and heaped on top of an impermeable lining before being sprinkled with a sodium cyanide solution known as leacheate for several months. The cyanide dissolves the gold, and the gold-laden solution is extracted and separated from the liquid.

Only one heap leach mine was found in Cambodia by the Stimson Center; it identified 145 in Laos and 340 in Myanmar. Forty-two of the 486 total appeared to have opened in 2025, compared to 50 in 2024.

Both alluvial and heap leaching mining operations are mobile, Kwan said, with heap leaches lasting several months or longer and alluvial mines being exhausted even faster, but both have a tendency to be abandoned and then reestablished further along the river.

“As an example, observing a single river over two to three years demonstrates how miners move throughout the river system, leaving mined sites abandoned as vegetation slowly takes over the abandoned site,” Kwan said. “In both cases, there are no indications of any post-mining cleanup process or mitigation efforts.”

Chemicals, often stored in pools or tailing ponds, are often poorly contained across the region and are exposed to monsoon seasons, which can lead to chemical spillover flowing into rivers, streams and groundwater.

“The use of cyanide and mercury to separate and extract gold puts people and the environment at risk to prolonged and or concentrated exposure to the harmful chemicals,” Kwan said, detailing the various ways mercury poisoning affects the central nervous, immune and reproductive systems, along with causing symptoms described by residents across Ta Veng district.

But it’s not just people who stand to be affected: plants, animals and crops are all at risk from contamination from mercury, cyanide, chromium and heavy metals (often introduced as waste from the mining process), which threaten the soil upon which Southeast Asia’s agricultural economy is built.

In the case of Virachey National Park, the chemical contamination threatens at least 89 species of wildlife found in the park, including clouded leopards (Neofelis nebulosa), gaur cattle (Bos gaurus), endangered Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) and critically endangered Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica). Mining contamination throws the future of both Indigenous communities and threatened wildlife species into jeopardy, but the Cambodian government has so far not responded to the issue, which could flow further downstream if unaddressed.

“The region really lacks expertise in understanding how these chemicals and dangerous elements dilute as they move downstream,” said Eyler, of the Stimson Center. “Some are soluble and others are not. What we do know is that they can contaminate crops as they grow, fish and other biota in rivers, and are directly harmful to humans if consumed or exposed to the skin. A regional effort is required for effective testing and also effective messaging to people who may be exposed.”

Officials from Cambodia’s Ministry of Mines and Energy and the Ministry of Environment could not be reached for comment on the matter.

Testing the water

As the health concerns mount, residents of Ta Bouk village been forced to find alternative sources of water, mostly by digging wells, fearing for their safety should they continue to use the O’Ta Bouk River for drinking, bathing, cooking and agriculture. Their concerns have gone largely ignored by local authorities, who Thao said have visited following complaints but didn’t conduct any testing in the O’Ta Bouk or on its banks. The riverbanks now lay sticky with a toxic mud after water levels rose in the monsoon season.

“The district authorities came between June-July this year [to inspect the O’Ta Bouk River] but there’s been no action,” he said. “The water has been muddy since May this year. After they came, nothing happened.”

Mongabay spoke with 10 people across three separate villages in Ta Veng district, eight of whom had personally contracted skin conditions from entering the river. All were deeply concerned by the risk of falling sick through coming into contact with contaminated water and felt the local authorities were powerless to do anything.

While authorities have been absent in the unfolding crisis in Ratanakiri’s waterways, Mongabay reporters conducted their own testing of both water and fish from the O’Ta Bouk and at the confluence of the O’Ta Bouk and Sesan rivers, as well as soil from their banks. An independent laboratory confirmed that two fish caught from the O’Ta Bouk and Sesan rivers contained significantly higher levels of mercury — 40.5 milligrams per kilo in the fish caught in the O’Ta Bouk and 20.8 mg/kg in the one from the Sesan — than is considered safe. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends people avoid consuming fish containing 0.46 mg/kg of mercury.

Likewise, a soil sample taken from the banks of the O’Ta Bouk was found to contain 24.1 mg/kg of mercury, significantly above the 7.1 mg/kg level that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets as a benchmark for soil in residential areas. Water samples from both the O’Ta Bouk and Sesan tested positive for arsenic contamination, at 0.029 mg/liter and 0.035mg/l respectively — nearly three times higher than World Health Organization’s safe limit of 0.01 mg/l.

However, these samples only represent a snapshot of the water, soil and fish quality in both rivers, with Stimson Center experts urging more testing to be done in the O’Ta Bouk and Sesan rivers, as well as downstream in the Mekong River to establish a baseline that will determine a policy response. One independent expert who reviewed Mongabay’s lab results noted that while natural processes could raise contamination levels, the proximity of the gold mine to the river was a more likely explanation for the unusually high concentrations of arsenic in the water and mercury in the fish and soil.

The unabated flow of toxic chemicals from the gold mining operations upstream has left Thao and his community with little hope for the future, where freshwater resources may become scarce in Ta Bouk village. Thao said the community is afraid of the contamination, with residents fearful of eating their own crops and vegetables, while noting that fish stocks have plummeted rapidly, plunging the villagers into hardship.

“If we can no longer use the water, we might have to migrate to find other jobs because we rely on the O’Ta Bouk River,” he said. “If there’s no river water, we’ll move from this area.

“There also might be issues with food security because the locals here produce food from this area,” he added. “Some families with enough money can dig a well, but those who are poor will have to move from this area because the water is the main source of living. The pollution could spread to the Sesan River and onto other areas, like Veun Sai.”

Eleven alluvial gold mines and the only heap leaching gold mine identified in Cambodia by the Stimson Center’s data set fall within or in close proximity to a 4,000-hectare (9,900-acre) economic land concession that was awarded to Global Green (Cambodia) Energy Development. Documents seen by Mongabay show the company had previously been granted an 18,900-hectare (46,700-acre) mining exploration license inside Virachey National Park. However, it remains unclear whether Global Green was ever granted the right to extract gold.

Poisonous influence

What is clear is that Global Green is controlled by Try Pheap, an infamous Cambodian tycoon who’s been sanctioned by the U.S. government and has a long track record of illegal logging, along with mining in the Mekong and in other protected forests. Pheap has long enjoyed near total impunity in Cambodia due to his close ties to senior ruling party officials.

Combined, verified government documents, satellite imagery and interviews with residents and local officials across Ta Veng district suggest that gold mining began in mid-2023, resulting in the discoloration and pollution of the O’Ta Bouk and Sesan rivers.

One local official, who asked for anonymity for fear of speaking out against such a politically connected gold mine, recalled how armed private security denied police and government rangers access to inspect the mining site.

“Everyone knows the name, we cannot stop them,” the official said.

While an environmental impact assessment (EIA) was conducted, according to one document dated Feb. 19, 2024, the local official said the assessor — which Mongabay has since identified as E&A Consultants, a company frequently used to produce EIAs for Global Green — didn’t even visit the remote gold mining site in Virachey. E&A Consultants did not respond when Mongabay sent questions.

According to the local official, who was able to verify documents acquired by Mongabay, Global Green was only granted an exploratory license and is not permitted to extract, process or refine gold. Satellite imagery shows at least five of the alluvial mines are operating illegally outside Global Green’s concession area.

“What I’m concerned about is the natural resources in the water,” the local official said. “Mercury and acid — it’s very important that we think about this because mercury is a very bad chemical that impacts humans and wildlife. We should collect the samples in the water or wildlife that live in the area to have a laboratory [test them] to determine whether it contains these chemicals or not.”

No such tests have since been conducted, according to the official, who also questioned why the government had failed to respond to something that is so obvious to so many people across Ta Veng district.

The O’Ta Bouk is the longest river in Virachey National Park and provides a migratory link for fish species between the Sesan and Mekong rivers, but now poses a public health risk.

“If the fish are polluted with mercury, what problems could happen when humans eat them? [Global Green isn’t] following the EIA, isn’t following the law, [someone] should respond,” the local official said. “What loss will it take on the ground? What impact to the river resources? What about those living along the river, Indigenous people, who collect nontimber forest products from the area? That’s my concern.”",https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/11/24072528/Header-1200x800.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 10:03:43.609127

Scotland's only oil refinery stopped processing crude oil at Grangemouth in April, after a century of operations.

The UK government has been accused of failing to deliver £200m pledged to Grangemouth from the National Wealth Fund.

The money will go towards the site's transition into a clean energy hub.

A Treasury source said: ""We said we would stand squarely behind communities like Grangemouth, and we meant it.

""And we're building on what we have done already by putting millions in as a starter to help put the community on a firm footing and strengthening its places as part of the clean energy revolution.

""These investments will help deliver a fair transition for Grangemouth, securing jobs for local people way into the future.""

Petroineos announced the refinery at the central Scotland facility would close and transition to become an import terminal after reporting massive losses.

Redundancy letters were sent out to staff at the refinery at the beginning of this year, with just 65 of 500 jobs expected to be retained.

Approximately 2,000 people were directly employed at the site - 500 at the refinery, 450 on the Forties pipeline from the North Sea and a further 1,000 in the Ineos petrochemicals business.

Project Willow

A £1.5m report into the feasibility of Grangemouth becoming a low-carbon energy hub, known as Project Willow came up with nine ideas that could be developed with private sector investment.

This included alternative uses for the site such as hydrothermal plastics recycling and anaerobic digestion.

The prime minister pledged £200m to the site at the Scottish Labour conference telling delegates it was an ""investment in Scotland's industrial future"".

In August, Unite the union said the money hadn't been delivered and workers felt abandoned.

Last November, the Scottish and UK government also signed the Falkirk and Grangemouth growth deal which promised £100m for the area through measures like a skills transition centre to get locals into work.

The UK government said work on delivering the investment continues, and this newly announced money is on top of the funds already promised.

First Minister John Swinney also announced £25m of new funding in a statement to Holyrood in February.

This latest Grangemouth commitment builds on investments in Scotland's clean energy industries, including £17.3 million of the Aberdeen Energy Transition Zone and headquartering GB Energy in Aberdeen.

Existing regulations do not yet set out specifications or enforcement mechanisms for E15, despite the fuel having been authorised under recently passed legislation (AB 30) and used safely across the United States for the past 14 years.

In written comments submitted to CARB, ACE’s Chief Marketing Officer, Ron Lamberty, called on the Board to issue a clear statement confirming that E15 sales are permitted and to publish implementation guidance without delay.

“We urge CARB to move quickly with a clear statement that the sale of E15 is allowed in California, and provide guidance promptly, so California fuel marketers can begin offering the low-cost and clean fuel to consumers immediately,” Lamberty said.

He stressed that E15’s safety and compatibility are already well proven through extensive research by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy, as well as more than a decade of day-to-day use by millions of motorists.

“E15 is no longer a new, untested product. We now have 14 years of safe, real-world use in unmodified tanks, lines, and dispensers at thousands of retail stations,” he added.

ACE is urging CARB to classify E15 as a standard petrol grade, in line with federal treatment, warning that categorising it as an alternative fuel would drive up retailer costs, create confusion for drivers, and weaken the potential air-quality benefits for California.

The organisation also highlighted evidence that much of California’s fuelling infrastructure is already compatible with E15. ACE’s Flex Check tool, available at flexfuelforward.com, helps retailers verify whether existing tanks, lines, dispensers, and hardware can safely handle the blend.

According to Lamberty, “the short answer is there should be little or no cost for the majority of California’s fuel terminals and retailers.”

BELEM, Brazil (Reuters) -Despite the U.S. government souring on the global climate agenda ahead of the COP30 summit, American companies did not shy away.

A Reuters analysis of attendance lists shows there were 60 representatives of Fortune 100 companies at the Brazil event, compared with 50 at last year’s in Baku, Azerbaijan. Still others attended pre-conference events in Brazil’s finance hub Sao Paulo and in Rio de Janeiro.

Tech firms including Microsoft and Google, energy company Occidental Petroleum, carmaker General Motors and lender Citigroup were among those represented on a provisional U.N. list of attendees of the official summit.

“We’ve seen no discernible change in the engagement of U.S. companies on climate policy over the course of this year. And that was certainly reflected in attendance levels,” said Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary general for policy at the International Chamber of Commerce.

“We are also seeing growing concern across industry about the growing costs of extreme weather events — underscoring the need for effective policy responses.”

Executives said they didn’t think now was a good time to opt out of the climate conversation, with rising temperatures unleashing ever more threats to factories, supply chains and the bottom line.

“We’re doing it because it’s good for the business. It helps create supply security,” said PepsiCo Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) Jim Andrew on the sidelines of the talks.

“We need farmers to be successful, we need them to keep farming,” he added, given the company makes the bulk of its revenues from foods including Walkers Crisps and Quaker Oats.

FILLING THE VOID

Darren Woods, the boss of top U.S. oil company ExxonMobil was among the U.S. executives, mayors and other sub-national leaders who attended the pre-COP events.

All those players have an important role in the future of climate action, according to Lou Leonard, Inaugural Dean of Clark University’s School of Climate, Environment, and Society.

Existing policies from federal and non-federal actors would lead to a 35% reduction in U.S. emissions by 2035, a recent analysis led by the Center for Global Sustainability (CGS) at the University of Maryland showed.

Much of that is being driven by companies.

“Despite the headlines, the private sector continues to invest in and deploy clean energy,” said Gina McCarthy, former administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and now Managing Co-Chair of ‘America Is All In’, a coalition of non-federal leaders.

“Last year, clean energy jobs in the U.S. expanded three times faster than the rest of the nation’s workforce.”

The two-week-long COP30 conference also included many smaller U.S. companies in sectors set to profit from the world’s shift to low-carbon energy, including in carbon markets.

“Being here is about connecting globally,” said Brennan Spellacy, chief executive at carbon credits platform Patch, “Most of my meetings here are with English, French, and German sustainability leaders and CSOs.”

U.S. COMPANIES HAVE A CRUCIAL ROLE

President Trump has called climate change a hoax. But regardless of the U.S. federal position, regulations are changing across the world to hasten the energy transition even though the final deal at COP30 disappointed some.

“Irrespective of what’s coming out of the United States, in terms of rhetoric, the market is moving (and) policymakers are recognising the direction of travel,” said Jack Hurd, head of both the World Economic Forum’s Earth System Agenda and the Tropical Forest Alliance.

More U.S. companies are also disclosing their climate strategies despite the U.S. dropping plans for a federal rule requiring it, although the quality of plans from companies across the globe remains low, data from disclosure platform CDP showed.

Whether they were at the main event or not, the fact U.S. companies appeared was significant, said Maria Mendiluce, CEO at the We Mean Business Coalition.

“The U.S. has a decisive role in global climate, energy and industrial policy, so sub-national leaders, non-state actors and businesses showing up at COP30 matters.”

“Even when domestic politics are unsettled, the U.S. shapes markets, capital flows and technology pathways. Its engagement signals to investors that the world’s largest economy understands the competitiveness, innovation, security and supply-chain stakes of the energy transition.”

The vertically integrated facility is expected to add 3.5 GW of annual nameplate capacity once fully ramped.

The facility will increase First Solar America’s manufacturing portfolio to 14 GW in 2026. This portfolio is expected to increase to 17.7 GW in 2027, after a recently announced South Carolina facility reaches full capacity.

The South Carolina facility will be in Gaffney, with an investment of approximately $330 million. The company aims to utilize this facility to onshore the final production process for its Series 6 Plus modules.

First Solar said the Iberia Parish facility began production ahead of schedule in July 2025. It added that the accelerated timeline was driven by the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill this year. This catalyzed demand for U.S.-made solar components that are fully compliant with the Foreign Entities of Concern guidelines.

The company said the Iberia Parish facility is not dependent on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains. Its Series 7 modules are produced using materials from the U.S., including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi, which is then fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

First Solar stated that the Iberia Parish facility is AI-enabled, using computer vision and deep learning to detect solar panel defects during production. Additionally, the technicians and operators leverage AI-powered tools to make operating adjustments and guide decision-making.

The company has three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio and one in Alabama. It also has research and development (R&D) centers in Ohio and California. First Solar said it will have invested roughly $4.5 billion in U.S. manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019. It expects its global nameplate capacity to grow to about 25 GW by 2026.

First Solar’s revenue rose 79.6% year-over-year to $1.59 billion in the third quarter (Q3) of 2025 from $887.67 million.

It delivered 5.3 GW of modules in Q3 2025. The company’s expected contracted backlog stands at 54.5 GW through 2030. It manufactured 3.6 GW of modules during the quarter, with 2.5 GW coming from its U.S. facilities and 1.1 GW from its international facilities.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Standard-Mercom-2025-06-10T184439.631.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 02:59:46.986983

After the third quarter of 2025, it is clear that the plateau or slow decline of China’s CO2 emissions that started in early 2024 continues.
Having committed to peaking emissions “before 2030”, China’s policymakers have left their specific peaking year open.
CO2 emissions estimates are based on National Bureau of Statistics default calorific values of fuels and emissions factors from China’s latest national greenhouse gas emissions inventory, for the year 2021.
For oil consumption, apparent consumption of transport fuels (diesel, petrol and jet fuel) is taken from Sinopec quarterly results, with monthly disaggregation based on production minus net exports.","One clear driver of the growth in plastics production is import substitution – replacing equivalent products imported from overseas – as well as growing exports.

China is still a net importer of primary plastics by value in 2025 so far, but only just. The value of imports fell by 8 per cent while the value of exports increased by 8 per cent in the first nine months of the year.

The five-year plan for 2021-25 targeted an increase in chemicals production to reduce the imports of key raw materials to less than 40 per cent of demand, with projects launched to meet this target coming online this year.

More recently, the government has encouraged oil refineries to shift from the production of transport fuels to chemicals, in order to adapt to falling demand for oil in transportation. It set a target for the petrochemical and chemical sector’s economic output to grow by more than 5 per cent per year in 2025-26.

The US-China tariff tit-for-tat has added further momentum to import substitution. The US has been China’s largest source of imports of polyethylene – the most widely used plastic in the world – since 2023, but China has expanded its domestic production in response to the trade spat.

Still, the change in China’s net exports of plastics cannot account for more than a fraction of the increase in output volume, however, as estimated based on reported polymer prices. This indicates that growing domestic demand is a major driver of the rapid growth in plastics production.

Packaging is the largest use of plastics in China, with the booming online retail and food delivery industry driving rapid growth.

Express parcel volumes grew 21 per cent in 2024 and 17 per cent through September 2025. The value of the single-use plastic tableware market averaged 21 per cent annual growth from 2017 to 2022 and the revenue of the online food delivery industry is projected to grow 11 per cent in 2025.

The government is taking measures to curb single-use plastics, but these would need to be intensified to fully counteract the growth rates seen in food deliveries and other drivers. The demand for high-performance materials in new manufacturing industries is also a significant driver.

Will China’s emissions peak early or rebound?

After the third quarter of 2025, it is clear that the plateau or slow decline of China’s CO2 emissions that started in early 2024 continues.

Whether emissions increased or decreased marginally in the first three quarters of the year is too close to call, given the uncertainties involved, but a drop in full-year emissions became much more likely after September, which recorded an approximately 3 per cent drop in emissions year-on-year.

Still, either a small increase or decrease in the calendar year of 2025 remains possible and will be ultimately be decided by developments in the fourth quarter.

China’s emissions from fossil-fuel use are highly likely to increase this year, with the increase of coal and oil use in the chemical industry outweighing the reductions in emissions from the power, metals, building materials and transportation sectors. This will be balanced out by a fall in cement process emissions.

What is already clear is that the 2025 carbon-intensity target will be missed, as it would have required absolute emission reductions of 4 per cent or more this year, after slow progress during the earlier years of the five-year period.

This also means that the carbon-intensity target in the next 15th five-year plan for 2026-2030 would need to be more ambitious than the one that China missed during the current period, to close the shortfall to the country’s 2030 intensity target.

China targeted an 18 per cent reduction in 2021-25, but will only have achieved around 12 per cent by the end of this year. It would then need a reduction of around 22-24 per cent in the next five years to achieve its headline climate commitment for 2030, a 65 per cent carbon-intensity reduction on 2005 levels.

Whether emissions fall this year – or not – has high symbolic significance. Having committed to peaking emissions “before 2030”, China’s policymakers have left their specific peaking year open.

China’s new greenhouse gas emission target for 2035, announced by Xi in September, was set as a reduction of 7-10 per cent below an undefined “peak level”, making it clear that policymakers are still planning for – or at least leaving the door open to – a late peak, only just before 2030.

Setting this target from “peak levels” means that the timing and level of China’s emissions peak affects not only the path of its CO2 output in the next few years, but also the size of cuts needed to meet the 2035 goal – and presumably also subsequent targets thereafter.

The target of reducing emissions from “peak levels” could also create an incentive for provinces to increase emissions before the expected peak year, known as “storming the peak” in Chinese.

This incentive could be curbed by the creation of the “dual control” system for carbon intensity and total carbon emissions. The Central Committee of the Communist Party recently reiterated that this should happen during the next five-year period, but the specific timeline is an open question.

If the system is not operational from 2026, with annual carbon intensity and possibly absolute carbon emission targets allocated to provinces, then that could further allow for and incentivise emissions increases in the short term.

At the same time, China has made commitments to peak emissions before 2030, reduce coal consumption gradually during the 2026-30 period and to reduce carbon emissions per unit of GDP by more than 65 per cent by 2030, from 2005 levels.

Meeting the last target – which China has made internationally as part of its 2030 Paris pledge – would require, in practice, that emissions in 2030 are limited at or below their 2024 level, given progress to date and expected GDP growth rates.

Realising these targets, in turn, would require clean-energy growth rates well above the minimum of 200GW of new wind and solar capacity per year, set by China’s 2035 pledge – unless the rate of energy-demand growth sees a sharp and unexpected slowdown.

Beating these minimum clean-energy growth rates would also be necessary if policymakers want to maintain the tailwind that these sectors have provided to China’s economy in recent years.

About the data

Data for the analysis was compiled from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, National Energy Administration of China, China Electricity Council and China Customs official data releases, from WIND Information, an industry data provider, and Sinopec, China’s largest oil refiner.

Wind and solar output, and thermal power breakdown by fuel, was calculated by multiplying power generating capacity at the end of each month by monthly utilisation, using data reported by China Electricity Council through Wind Financial Terminal.

Total generation from thermal power and generation from hydropower and nuclear power was taken from National Bureau of Statistics monthly releases.

Monthly utilisation data was not available for biomass, so the annual average of 52 per cent for 2023 was applied. Power sector coal consumption was estimated based on power generation from coal and the average heat rate of coal-fired power plants during each month, to avoid the issue with official coal consumption numbers affecting recent data.

CO2 emissions estimates are based on National Bureau of Statistics default calorific values of fuels and emissions factors from China’s latest national greenhouse gas emissions inventory, for the year 2021. Cement CO2 emissions factor is based on annual estimates up to 2024.

For oil consumption, apparent consumption of transport fuels (diesel, petrol and jet fuel) is taken from Sinopec quarterly results, with monthly disaggregation based on production minus net exports. The consumption of these three fuels is labeled as oil product consumption in transportation, as it is the dominant sector for their use.

Apparent consumption of other oil products is calculated from refinery throughput, with the production of the transport fuels and the net exports of other oil products subtracted. Fossil-fuel consumption includes non-energy use, as most products are short-lived and incineration is the dominant disposal method.",https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/billow926-Vh4uekJdCSw-unsplash.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,N,,2025-11-24 04:59:03.848213

Supporters of the administration say the EPA is demonstrating that environmental protection can coexist with accelerated permitting and energy development.
Environmental advocates say the pace and focus deserve closer scrutiny, especially as major decisions around water rules, air standards, waste management, and industrial permitting continue to unfold.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has released a new list of 100 actions completed in the last 100 days, bringing the agency’s public tally to 300 accomplishments since President Donald Trump took office in January. The update, announced Monday in Dallas by Administrator Lee Zeldin, highlights a blend of emergency response work, enforcement activity, and regulatory changes—but also raises questions from outside groups about how these actions align with long-term environmental protections.

EPA officials say the rapid pace reflects a focused effort to meet statutory obligations while responding to crises across the country. Critics counter that the administration’s emphasis on permitting reforms and a narrower regulatory approach may shift burdens to states, weaken oversight, or accelerate industrial projects without fully accounting for environmental impacts.

Region 6: Major Response Operations and High-Profile Permits

EPA’s Region 6—covering Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico—was at the center of several large actions, including:

Smitty’s Supply Fire Cleanup: EPA oversaw the removal of more than 11 million gallons of waste from waterways impacted by a fire in Roseland, Louisiana.

Key Energy Permits: The agency issued permits for ExxonMobil’s Class VI carbon storage wells and a Clean Air Act permit for the Texas GulfLink deepwater port project. Supporters see these decisions as essential for energy development, while environmental groups warn of potential long-term risks tied to increased industrial activity.

Los Alamos Oversight: EPA monitored the depressurization of tritium waste containers at Los Alamos National Laboratory, with no deviations in air monitoring detected.

Region 6 Administrator Scott Mason said the team has shown it can “fulfill our mission to protect human health and the environment while not getting in the way of economic development.” Some community and environmental organizations in the region, however, argue that permitting decisions are moving faster than public engagement processes can keep up.

Nationwide Actions: Regulatory Changes and Cleanup Work

The EPA’s list covers a wide range of actions—some routine, some controversial. Among them:

A proposed rule redefining “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), which the agency calls “clear” and “commonsense,” but which opponents say could scale back federal water protections.

Continued work on the Tijuana–San Diego sewage infrastructure, with the agency reporting accelerated project timelines following the U.S.–Mexico agreement signed in July.

Enforcement actions targeting illegal pesticides and chemical imports at the border.

Cleanup and emergency responses in wildfire zones, industrial sites, and PFAS-affected communities.

The EPA also highlighted progress on pesticide backlogs, Brownfields redevelopment, and Superfund enforcement, including cases that collectively address tens of millions of pounds of air, water, and chemical pollution.

Administrator Zeldin framed the update as evidence of an agency moving quickly.

“300 days, 300 major environmental wins—this is the energy that propels us forward,” he said.

Supporters of the administration say the EPA is demonstrating that environmental protection can coexist with accelerated permitting and energy development. Environmental groups counter that some of the gains- - particularly around enforcement and cleanup—reflect long-term, ongoing work rather than new initiatives, and that other actions, such as regulatory rollbacks, could have lasting implications for air and water quality.

Rather than listing every individual action, the EPA pointed to broader areas of progress:

Emergency response: Major deployments after fires, industrial accidents, hurricanes, and chemical releases.

Superfund and cleanup: Advancements at sites in Michigan, Idaho, Massachusetts, Kansas, New Jersey, and elsewhere.

Permitting and regulatory work: State plan approvals, air-quality revisions, infrastructure permits, and streamlined review processes.

Enforcement: Nearly 1,800 enforcement cases concluded and strengthened oversight of illegal pesticides and chemicals.

Drinking-water protections: Orders, treatments, and infrastructure assistance in states from New York to Arizona.

Many of these actions are typical of EPA’s role regardless of administration; others reflect policy priorities unique to the Trump EPA—particularly around permitting, energy projects, and state-led regulatory approaches.

The EPA says the accomplishments reflect its mission to protect human health and the environment while advancing “commonsense” policies. Environmental advocates say the pace and focus deserve closer scrutiny, especially as major decisions around water rules, air standards, waste management, and industrial permitting continue to unfold.

As the agency nears the end of its first year under Administrator Zeldin, the divide underscores a broader debate: whether the EPA is recalibrating environmental protection to be more efficient and economically flexible, or reshaping key environmental safeguards in ways that may be felt long after these 300 days.",https://www.thedriller.com/ext/resources/2025/11/23/Medals-for-EPA.png?height=635&t=1763957967&width=1200,N,,2025-11-24 04:00:10.356186

While the commitment to clean energy is commendable, a regional organization is calling on municipalities, businesses, faith-based organizations, charitable groups, and schools to take advantage of federal tax credits to undertake solar installations.

To date, five municipalities in Montgomery, Bucks, and Chester counties have installed solar panels and arrays, dramatically cutting their energy costs.

In its fourth year of solar power use, West Rockhill Township has completely offset the $16,000 annually in taxpayer expenses associated with the 84 megawatts used to power municipal operations, including local government buildings, parks, traffic infrastructure, and water wells. In addition, the 16.3-square-mile Bucks County municipality has reduced carbon emissions by 644,814 pounds, according to a 2025 presentation.

Bill Sabey, a volunteer with Community Advocates and Ready for 100 – Montgomery County, encourages municipalities to make the switch to solar power – and take advantage of federal tax credits in the process. To qualify for the 30 percent federal tax credit, entities, including nonprofits, schools, faith-based groups, and commercial businesses, must start installation by July 4, 2026, or finish by the end of 2027.

“By installing solar power systems and transitioning to clean energy, municipalities can significantly reduce carbon emissions, enhance public health by mitigating air pollution, set an example for the community, and save substantial amounts of money over time through lower energy costs,” Sabey said. “The move to solar energy is not only a financial decision, but also a public health, public safety, and environmental strategy. Moreover, it positions municipalities as leaders in sustainability, benefiting from the numerous financial, social, and environmental rewards that come with a greener energy future.”

Community Advocates volunteers work with towns to set goals of transitioning to 100 percent clean renewable electricity by 2035. To date, 45 municipalities have adopted similar clean energy resolutions, which also includes reaching clean energy for heat and transportation by 2050 community-wide and developing a plan to get there.

With solar installation incentives soon set to expire, Sabey hopes more communities get on board.

Solar saves money and reduces reliance on other power sources

Lansdale Borough Mayor Garry Herbert said in 2023 that the borough estimated saving $330,200 over 30 months – or roughly $11,000 per month – as a result of solar power.

“Solar power allows Lansdale Borough to produce its own sustainable energy, reducing reliance on external sources. This independence is crucial as it helps shield the community from the volatile natural gas market,” Herbert said. “By investing in solar panels, the borough mitigates the risks associated with unpredictable energy prices, ensuring a stable and affordable energy supply for residents.”

Doylestown Borough, earlier this year, finished a solar installation on its administration building roof and a section of its police station. The municipality received a one-time federal credit of $114,318, PECO rebates, and other solar incentives. Borough Manager John Davis said solar will save the borough more than one-third of its energy costs.

Horsham Township announced in 2023 that the governing body had approved a solar project that would equip key buildings, including the municipal building, police station, community center, and public works building, with solar panels.

“Solar energy is a clean and renewable resource that will lower the township’s energy costs and help mitigate the environmental impacts associated with traditional energy sources,” according to Horsham’s 2023 State of Horsham report.

Extra solar power pays

Earlier this year, West Goshen Township Board of Supervisors Chairman Shaun Walsh said that the solar array installation on the public works building is expected to generate 312,000 kWh of electricity in its first year.

“This quantity exceeds the annual amount of power consumed by the Public Works building, hence the net metering requirement for this account,” Walsh wrote. “Meaning … we get paid for exporting power to the grid anytime our electricity generation is greater than our usage!”

The array consists of 468 panels. The project cost $537,000, with total projected cost savings of $1,375,000 based on a 30-year expected life for the solar panels The project has a 10-year simple payback. The project is eligible for a federal rebate of 30 percent of the cost.

MU CITY is now firmly positioned as a regional gateway for clean energy, green manufacturing, advanced e-mobility, and data-driven intelligence — supporting Indonesia's national roadmap for renewable energy and digital transformation. The MU CITY development represents an estimated USD 2.3 billion investment over the next three years, making it the largest single investment in Karimun to date.

A Dynamic City for the New Energy Era

Spanning 4,000 hectares, MU CITY will be powered by up to 2 gigawatts (GW) of solar power and an additional 2 GW of gas-based power, making it one of Southeast Asia's largest integrated sustainable energy ecosystems. A major portion of this capacity will power the local industrial zones, data campuses, and mobility manufacturing clusters within MU CITY, while the remainder will be allocated for clean energy exports to ASEAN nations — reinforcing Indonesia's role as a regional energy provider.

MU CITY will integrate three complementary development zones:

Clean Energy Hub – Anchored by large-scale solar power plants, advanced battery energy storage systems (BESS), LNG import facilities, CCGTs and blue ammonia tank complexes to support domestic decarbonization and regional export markets. This hub will serve as MU CITY's energy backbone.

Mobility & Manufacturing Hub – Dedicated to clean transportation innovation through electric vehicle assembly, battery manufacturing, AI chip ecosystems, and green industrial production aligned with Indonesia's vision for electric mobility and advanced manufacturing.

AI & Digital Infrastructure Hub – Powering up to 1.21 GW of hyperscale data center capacity, purpose-built for artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and high-performance digital workloads — all powered by renewable energy generated within MU CITY.

Together, these interconnected hubs will position MU CITY as a leading force in clean innovation and digital transformation, redefining how energy, technology, and mobility harmonize with people and the planet.

Empowering Local Communities Through Partnership

Through close collaboration with the Karimun Regency Government, Aslan is implementing a cooperative and inclusive development model in which over 10,000 local residents actively participate and benefit from the project's growth. This model offers opportunities for profit-sharing, equity participation, education programs, and technical training — ensuring that communities are true stakeholders in progress.

""MU stands for Mobility and Utility, and the Greek symbol μ reflects precision, high-performance computation, and technological innovation. MU CITY is a living example of how clean energy, digital innovation, and inclusive prosperity can thrive together.

Instead of accelerating, global climate action is losing steam.
Instead of sticking with existing targets, Connecticut could recalibrate its goals to better align with today’s economic and political realities.
Counterintuitive as it may seem, easing off aggressive climate targets could enable faster emissions reductions.","Connecticut residents rank among the strongest supporters of climate policy in the country. In 2022, Gov. Ned Lamont was reelected by a wide margin shortly after he and the legislature committed the state to a bold decarbonization pathway.

The science behind climate risks is stronger than ever, and there’s little reason to believe concern in Connecticut has waned. But the world around us has changed dramatically: our climate strategy was designed when there was strong momentum for global decarbonization that has since stalled. Because Connecticut’s efforts only matter in the context of a global response, we must ask whether our strategy fits today’s realities.

A few years ago, optimism for global climate progress was high. President Joe Biden committed the country to ambitious targets, and Congress passed landmark legislation—most notably the Inflation Reduction Act— pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into clean energy. Other major economies were pushing forward as well: China stunned the world with its net-zero pledge, and the European Green Deal promised the first carbon-neutral continent.

Connecticut followed suit with a bold climate law of its own, including a mandate for 100% zero-carbon electricity by 2040. At the time, we were doing our “fair share” as part of a global coalition committed to climate leadership.

Today, that context looks different. Under President Trump, the U.S. is retreating from domestic decarbonization and actively undermining global efforts —including sabotaging an international pact on shipping emissions. In Europe, the war in Ukraine has shifted focus to energy security and affordability. China’s latest climate pledge merely codifies its business-as-usual trajectory. Instead of accelerating, global climate action is losing steam.

Connecticut faces its own headwinds. In 2021, regulators envisioned offshore wind supplying roughly half of the state’s electricity by 2040. Today, the offshore wind industry is struggling due to rising costs and the loss of federal support. More broadly, clean energy projects will be costlier for ratepayers due to the pullback of federal subsidies.

This doesn’t mean we should abandon our climate goals. But we should rethink our strategy. How should a small state like Connecticut, that is committed to climate progress, navigate a world that’s not moving in the same direction?

One option is to stay the course and strive to be a model. We teach our children to keep promises even when others don’t —shouldn’t we do the same? A small state can have global influence by becoming a success story that others can replicate.

Major changes would be needed to get there. Replacing the 60% of Connecticut’s electricity that comes from natural gas will require massive investments— not just in renewables and batteries but also in 24/7 generation like nuclear power. That would come with a steep price tag. Those costs may be worthwhile given the climate, health, and community benefits of clean energy.

However, few will look to Connecticut as a model if we simply stack large costs on top of an already expensive system. Our electricity rates are among the highest in the country, and nearly double those in Pennsylvania. Leading by example would require cutting costs while cutting emissions.

I’ve authored a study that highlights some opportunities, including streamlining the permitting and interconnection processes for critical clean energy infrastructure; reducing the overlap between our cap-and-trade program, renewable portfolio standard, and state-led procurements; and completing the transition to performance-based regulation, aligning the incentives of utilities with our affordability and decarbonization goals.

Instead of sticking with existing targets, Connecticut could recalibrate its goals to better align with today’s economic and political realities. More gradual decarbonization could enable the state to postpone major investments —such as in offshore wind or new nuclear plants— until the costs of these technologies fall. We could reevaluate expensive rooftop solar subsidies, which pay about three times as much per kilowatt-hour as grid-scale solar. And we could consider investments in natural gas infrastructure —additional pipeline capacity could help relieve bottlenecks that drive up costs and emissions each winter.

Counterintuitive as it may seem, easing off aggressive climate targets could enable faster emissions reductions. More affordable energy helps to sustain support for climate policies and encourages more households to switch to electric cars and appliances.

Reasonable people will disagree on which of these two paths —or others— best reflects Connecticut’s values and constraints. The worst option is to press forward blindly until we hit a breaking point: ambitious targets, no credible way to meet them, and public frustration over rising energy bills.

Energy prices will be a key issue in next year’s governor’s election, just as they were in New Jersey this year. Connecticut needs an honest debate, and fresh thinking, to shape a strategy fit for today, not 2022.

By Max Oechsner

The current American administration has been canceling climate change initiatives since its first day in office.[1] The administration has abandoned lawsuits,[2] heavily deregulated,[3] and issued executive orders that repeal environmental initiatives.[4] Most recently, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a rule[5] that would eliminate the 2009 endangerment finding by the EPA.[6] This finding determined that certain greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions hurt human health and the environment. [7] The endangerment finding is the only legal basis for the federal government to regulate GHG emissions.[8] This makes it a fairly special piece of regulation. If the endangerment finding goes away, potentially all emission regulations carried out since 2009 could go with it.[9]

Lee Zeldin, the current administrator of the EPA, has defended this proposal to the media vigorously. In one interview, Zeldin bashed the economic costs of EPA regulations as having been “significant.”[10] In another interview, Zeldin claimed that EPA regulations “were seeking, in some respects, to strangulate out of existence entire sectors of our economy.”[11] He claimed that he inherited a “mess,” which has contributed to the high costs of heating homes.[12] But how true is this rhetoric that he presents to the public in support of the EPA’s proposal?

First, we may look to the EPA proposal’s own Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA).[13] In the RIA, one major consideration is the change in assumptions related to consumer interests in purchasing electric vehicles.[14] Specifically, they discuss how recent uncertainty in the continuation of tax credits established by the Inflation Reduction Act has reduced projected demand for EVs.[15] The uncertainty comes from Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” but these projections raise concerns that current initiatives are underperforming. However, this consideration does not go so far as to include evidence of economic strangulation.

Another consideration in the RIA is the EPA’s estimate of future gasoline and diesel prices.[16] They conclude that rollback would cause the price of gasoline to be $1 lower compared to Biden-era projections.[17] This projection, however, is not supported by data.[18] The RIA only references President Donald Trump’s “energy dominance” policies.[19] And still, this consideration does not imply the strangulation of any sectors of the economy. To quote Kathy Harris, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council: “It’s a lot of funny math.”[20]

What about the past fourteen years since the endangerment finding? Has there been a noticeable strangulation of any sector of the economy that the endangerment finding regulates? Gas prices, despite being highly volatile, have not shown much increase or decrease in price since 2009.[21] U.S. field production of crude oil has actually gone up.[22] The automotive industry has seen significant growth, increasing by roughly 20 million jobs.[23] On the clean energy front, automakers have invested nearly $200 billion in U.S. clean vehicle production, supporting almost 195,000 jobs.[24] Clean energy itself has increased, with wind and solar production now providing more electricity than coal.[25] In fact, it appears that the more stable regulatory environment has been compatible with growth, innovation, and clean solutions.[26]

The inverse may also be true: a less stable regulatory environment could lead to worse economic conditions. As previously mentioned, rescinding the endangerment finding will result in important climate change regulations being repealed.[27] This could theoretically lead to patchwork state and local regulations in the absence of federal rules. Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia have already adopted GHG emission targets.[28] It is not difficult to imagine that these states may increase those targets while others do nothing. This would likely negatively affect industry, as shown by some automakers recently signing on to self-regulate to avoid regulatory uncertainty.[29]

Ultimately, the endangerment finding being repealed will be harmful on many levels. Our economy will likely do worse overall, with the clean energy market being hit especially hard.[30] The clean energy market’s pain, in turn, hurts our environment and our communities. Socioeconomically disadvantaged communities bear a particularly disproportionate cost from the use of fossil fuels.[31] Without emission limitations, fossil fuel pollution will continue to hurt those communities, deepening existing health disparities.[32] This is especially true considering EPA regulations are the only real option for abating harm, given the significant hurdles to bringing private suits.[33] As a result, those who could benefit most from clean energy investments—through job creation, affordable energy access, and cleaner air—are left behind.

The natural gas pipeline sector is experiencing its most significant transformation since the initial unconventional resource development began in 2008. Current infrastructure utilisation patterns reveal a system operating at capacity constraints, with flow management becoming increasingly complex as production outpaces transportation capabilities. Emergency protocols activate when demand spikes exceed available capacity, forcing operators to implement costly mitigation strategies including controlled flaring and negative pricing mechanisms.

Recent analysis indicates the U.S. Gulf Coast region faces a fundamental infrastructure challenge. Twelve major pipeline projects scheduled for completion represent the most substantial single-year capacity expansion in over fifteen years, delivering a 13% increase in regional transportation capability. This expansion addresses critical bottlenecks where production centres cannot efficiently deliver gas to consumption hubs.

Furthermore, the Permian Gas Wave Sparks Biggest Pipeline Buildout represents a paradigm shift in American energy infrastructure development. This unprecedented expansion responds to growing US economic outlook and industrial demand patterns.

Infrastructure Capacity Analysis

Pipeline utilisation data reveals systematic stress across the network. The Waha gas hub in West Texas has recorded negative pricing events as producers pay to dispose of excess gas when transportation options become unavailable. These pricing inversions signal severe infrastructure constraints rather than demand weakness.

Industry analysis confirms that $50 billion in committed pipeline investments will add 8,800 miles of new infrastructure. This represents a fundamental shift from previous expansion cycles, where producer-led development connected low-cost resources to existing markets. Current buildout responds to demand-pull dynamics from industrial consumers, export facilities, and power generation requirements.

TC Energy projections indicate North American natural gas demand will increase by 45 billion cubic feet per day by 2035. This forecast incorporates tripling LNG export capacity and unprecedented electricity demand from data processing facilities and manufacturing reshoring initiatives.

Advanced Pipeline Engineering Solutions Transform Transportation Networks

Modern pipeline development incorporates sophisticated flow optimisation technologies that adapt to volatile production patterns characteristic of unconventional resources. Unlike traditional fixed-capacity systems, new infrastructure features modular designs enabling real-time capacity adjustments without efficiency penalties.

Smart flow management systems integrate predictive analytics with automated pressure control across thousands of miles of pipeline networks. These systems process real-time data from production facilities, compression stations, and delivery points to optimise throughput while maintaining operational safety margins. In addition, data-driven operations enhance decision-making processes across the industry.

Modular Infrastructure Design

Contemporary compression stations utilise variable-speed electric drives allowing output modulation between 40-60% of maximum capacity. This flexibility accommodates the rapid production decline curves typical of unconventional wells while maintaining system efficiency during off-peak periods.

Variable frequency drives enable real-time motor speed adjustment

Predictive maintenance systems monitor equipment condition continuously

Remote monitoring capabilities reduce operational costs

Modular expansion allows capacity scaling without system redesign

Advanced compression technologies achieve efficiency ratings between 88-96% depending on drive configuration. Electric variable frequency drive systems demonstrate superior performance metrics with 8,760-hour maintenance intervals and full automation capabilities.

Engineering Project Examples

The ExxonMobil acquisition of a 40% stake in Enterprise Products Partners' Bahia natural gas liquids pipeline demonstrates industry commitment to integrated transportation solutions. This Cowboy Connector Pipeline project connects Permian production directly to Gulf Coast refining and chemical facilities while enabling export market access.

Pipeline engineering now incorporates bi-directional flow capabilities, allowing seasonal demand optimisation and emergency rerouting during maintenance periods. These systems feature automated switching mechanisms and quality monitoring stations positioned at strategic intervals throughout the network.

Specialised Infrastructure Requirements for Industrial and Export Applications

Data processing facilities require ultra-reliable gas supply with strict pressure stability parameters. These installations consume gas at steady baseload rates typically ranging from 0.8-1.2 million British thermal units per megawatt, creating predictable demand patterns that enable pipeline optimisation.

Technical specifications for data centre supply include pressure variations limited to ±2%, supply reliability exceeding 99.95% uptime, and response times under 15 minutes for demand changes. Backup capacity requirements typically specify 150% of peak demand to ensure uninterrupted operations.

LNG Terminal Engineering Complexities

Liquefied natural gas facilities present unique infrastructure challenges due to massive scale and precise operational requirements. Single processing trains typically require 0.5-0.7 billion cubic feet per day of feedgas with strict quality specifications for heating value, moisture content, and contaminant levels.

LNG terminal specifications demand feedgas quality between 1,050-1,150 British thermal units per standard cubic foot heating value, moisture content below 7 pounds per million standard cubic feet, and hydrogen sulfide limits under 4 parts per million. Processing capacity can reach 4.2 billion cubic feet per day per facility.

However, the LNG market implications extend beyond infrastructure requirements to global supply chain dynamics.

Facility Type Gas Consumption Reliability Requirement Quality Specifications Data Centres 0.8-1.2 MMBtu/MW 99.95% uptime Standard pipeline quality LNG Terminals 0.5-0.7 Bcf/d per train 99.5% availability 1,050-1,150 Btu/scf Chemical Plants Variable demand 98% reliability Process-specific

U.S. LNG exports continue reaching record levels with additional export facilities expected to commence operations before decade end. This expansion drives demand for dedicated high-capacity feedgas pipelines connecting production areas to coastal processing facilities.

Variable Production Patterns Drive Compression Technology Evolution

Unconventional gas production exhibits significant volatility requiring adaptive compression strategies. Modern compression stations integrate variable-speed electric drives enabling real-time output adjustment without mechanical modifications or efficiency degradation.

Variable frequency drive technology adjusts voltage and frequency supplied to AC motors, allowing precise output modulation. These systems can modify compression capacity by 40-60% while maintaining optimal efficiency ratings throughout the operating range.

Advanced Compression System Performance

Technology Configuration Efficiency Range Maintenance Interval Automation Level Electric VFD Systems 92-96% 8,760 hours Full automation Gas Turbine Drives 88-92% 6,000 hours Semi-automated Reciprocating Units 90-94% 4,380 hours Manual override

Predictive maintenance systems utilise vibration analysis, thermal monitoring, and performance trending to identify potential equipment issues before failure occurs. These systems can reduce unplanned downtime by 35-40% while improving overall system efficiency by 8-12%.

Remote operation capabilities enable centralised monitoring and control of multiple compression facilities from single control centres. Automated shutdown systems activate within seconds when operational parameters exceed safe thresholds, preventing equipment damage and environmental releases.

Multi-Commodity Pipeline Systems Present Complex Engineering Challenges

Integrated pipeline systems transport both raw natural gas and extracted natural gas liquids simultaneously, maximising infrastructure utilisation while reducing capital requirements. These systems incorporate sophisticated separation and processing capabilities enabling real-time product optimisation during transport.

Inline fractionation units enable ethane and propane separation during pipeline transport, eliminating the need for separate processing facilities. Quality monitoring stations positioned every 50-100 miles ensure product specifications remain within required parameters throughout the transportation process.

Processing Technology Integration

Modern pipeline systems integrate field processing equipment directly into transportation infrastructure, enabling continuous gas conditioning and natural gas liquid extraction. This approach reduces overall project costs while maintaining strict product quality standards.

Dedicated NGL pipeline networks utilise 8-16 inch diameter systems

Automated switching systems enable product routing optimisation

Integrated vapour recovery units minimise emissions

Real-time quality analysis ensures specification compliance

Multi-commodity systems require specialised engineering to handle different product characteristics, flow rates, and quality requirements. Pipeline materials must accommodate varying pressures, temperatures, and chemical compositions while maintaining long-term operational reliability.

Regulatory Engineering Standards Shape Modern Pipeline Design

Pipeline engineering must incorporate comprehensive safety and environmental protection systems significantly impacting design complexity and capital costs. These systems include automated leak detection, emergency shutdown capabilities, and continuous environmental monitoring.

Mandatory safety engineering features require computational pipeline monitoring systems, automated valve closure mechanisms responding within 30 seconds, cathodic protection for corrosion prevention, and seismic monitoring with automatic shutdown triggers.

Emissions Control Integration

Advanced emissions reduction technologies include vapour recovery units, low-emission pneumatic devices, and methane detection systems. These technologies typically add 12-18% to capital costs but ensure regulatory compliance and operational sustainability.

Safety engineering standards mandate multiple redundant systems including emergency block valves, pressure relief systems, and fire suppression equipment. Pipeline routes must avoid sensitive environmental areas while incorporating wildlife crossing structures and habitat protection measures.

Regulatory approval processes require comprehensive environmental impact assessments, stakeholder consultation programs, and long-term monitoring commitments. Projects must demonstrate compliance with federal, state, and local regulations throughout their operational lifecycle.

Investment Models Drive Strategic Pipeline Development Decisions

Pipeline developers utilise sophisticated economic models incorporating multiple revenue streams including transportation fees, processing margins, and capacity optimisation services. These models account for 20-30 year operational periods with varying demand scenarios and regulatory changes.

Investment decision metrics target internal rates of return between 12-15% minimum, net present values ranging $2-4 billion for major projects, payback periods of 8-12 years, and capacity utilisation breakeven points at 65-70%.

For instance, the Permian Gas Wave Sparks Biggest Pipeline Buildout reflects strategic investment alignment with market fundamentals. The US natural gas forecast supports this infrastructure expansion through projected demand growth.

Revenue Optimisation Strategies

Contemporary pipeline operators implement dynamic pricing models, seasonal capacity auctions, and interruptible service contracts to maximise revenue while maintaining system reliability. These strategies can increase revenue by 15-25% compared to traditional fixed-rate approaches.

Firm transportation contracts provide guaranteed revenue streams

Interruptible services offer premium pricing during high-demand periods

Processing services generate additional margin opportunities

Storage integration provides seasonal optimisation benefits

Capital allocation frameworks evaluate projects based on strategic importance, risk profiles, and synergistic opportunities with existing infrastructure. Developers prioritise projects serving multiple markets and customer segments to enhance long-term viability.

Artificial Intelligence Transforms Pipeline Operational Efficiency

AI systems analyse real-time data from thousands of sensors throughout pipeline networks to optimise gas flow, predict maintenance requirements, and prevent operational disruptions. These systems improve overall efficiency by 8-12% while reducing unplanned downtime by 35-40%.

Machine learning algorithms process historical production data, weather patterns, and demand forecasts to continuously optimise pipeline operations. These systems learn from operational patterns to improve performance and predict future requirements.

Predictive Analytics Applications

Advanced analytics enable predictive maintenance scheduling, real-time flow optimisation, automated leak detection and response, and demand forecasting with capacity planning integration. AI systems can identify potential issues days or weeks before traditional monitoring methods.

Pattern recognition identifies equipment degradation trends

Automated optimisation adjusts flows across multiple pipeline segments

Predictive models forecast maintenance requirements

Real-time analytics enable rapid response to operational changes

Furthermore, AI transformation insights demonstrate similar technological applications across energy sectors. Digital twin technology creates virtual pipeline models enabling scenario testing and optimisation without operational risks.

Long-Term Infrastructure Sustainability and Future-Proofing Strategies

Pipeline engineers design systems with flexibility to handle evolving gas compositions including higher hydrogen content and renewable gas blends. This future-proofing requires upgraded materials, modified compression systems, and enhanced monitoring capabilities.

Sustainability engineering features incorporate hydrogen-compatible steel specifications, renewable gas blending capabilities, carbon capture integration points, and electrification-ready compression stations. These modifications ensure infrastructure remains viable as energy systems transition.

Lifecycle Management Approaches

Comprehensive lifecycle management strategies include planned capacity expansions, technology upgrade pathways, and end-of-life transition planning. These approaches ensure 40-50 year operational viability while maintaining environmental compliance and economic performance.

Modular design enables incremental capacity additions

Technology platforms support equipment upgrades

Materials selection considers long-term compatibility

Environmental monitoring ensures regulatory compliance

Infrastructure developers increasingly focus on adaptability and resilience rather than simply meeting current requirements. Projects must accommodate changing energy markets, evolving regulations, and emerging technologies throughout their operational lifespans.

Consequently, the Permian Gas Wave Sparks Biggest Pipeline Buildout represents more than immediate capacity expansion—it establishes foundation infrastructure for decades of energy market evolution. Analysis from Natural Gas Intel confirms this strategic positioning addresses both current constraints and future opportunities.

""This pipeline buildout reflects fundamental shifts in American energy infrastructure, positioning the sector for sustained growth across multiple demand segments while maintaining operational excellence and environmental stewardship.""

The Gender Action Plan (GAP) is a key component of the Enhanced Lima Work Programme on Gender (LWPG), which aims to integrate gender equality into all aspects of climate policy and action. The GAP provides clear guidance for countries to implement gender-responsive climate policies and actions – policies that recognize that climate impacts are not gender-neutral and that women, girls, and gender-expansive people are disproportionately affected. The LWPG was established in 2014 and has undergone several reviews and extensions, with the most recent decision stretching its mandate for 10 more years. The new iteration of the GAP was developed at the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SB62) in June 2025, with a draft decision now up for consideration and, hopefully, adoption here at COP30. These workstreams on gender intersect with the other major tracks – Adaptation, Mitigation, and Loss and Damage – because gender justice is not an ancillary concern but a thread woven through the whole climate tapestry.

Within the negotiations, I caucus with the Women and Gender Constituency (WGC), which has put forward a comprehensive and compelling set of recommendations for the GAP. The WGC’s demands aim to drive measurable, gender-transformative action and secure the resources necessary for implementation. These proposals come directly from communities experiencing multiple, layered impacts: women defending land rights, Indigenous women safeguarding forests, girls denied education due to climate-driven displacement, and gender-diverse people whose livelihoods and safety are threatened by climate instability. The WGC Demands for COP30 – well worth reading in full – are grounded in lived experience and proven community-based solutions.

And yet, these community-based solutions are under attack on several fronts, notably by theocracies like Saudi Arabia and the Holy See.

For me, as a faith-based advocate in international problem-solving spaces, theocracy presents a peculiar problem.

Every government is subject to hardline positions and orthodoxies. Democracies, monarchies, republics, parliaments – all have the capacity to assert their ethical boundaries in ways that would shock the conscious elsewhere. But theocracies add a new layer to that problem: They attribute those assertions to God. They project their political choices as divine will, wrapping policy positions in sacred language in ways that attempt to shield them from scrutiny in ways that are neither accountable nor correctable through the usual diplomatic tools.

The existence of true theocracies sometimes makes me defensive about the nature of the work I do. I speak as a person of faith and as a member of a church; I advocate in the name of teachings that shape my moral imagination. And yet I am firmly convinced – convicted, even – that governments function best when they are separate from the church. I come to the UNFCCC space representing a faith-based organization but not as someone attempting to legislate scripture or impose doctrine. Instead, my grounding is in a tradition that commands us to protect the vulnerable, tend creation, and ensure the flourishing of all people.

In international spaces, I caucus with religious leaders from across the world – people with sincerely held beliefs based on religious laws and doctrines that affirm, for example, that the planet ought to be protected, vulnerable communities deserve to be shielded, and human flourishing is the will of the divine. These leaders and advocates bring moral clarity, historical wisdom, and spiritual courage to the negotiations, calling for justice where politics alone has failed.

However, when people professing those same beliefs act in the name of governments or nation-states and use religious vocabulary to derail needed action, the dynamic shifts. When “religious freedom” becomes the justification for blocking inclusive language, stopping gender-responsive financing, or undermining human rights protections, it muddies the waters I have to swim in. It forces those of us who speak from a place of faith to clarify – over and over again – that our advocacy does not align with theocratic control, that our moral imperatives do not require the silencing of others, and that our sacred texts do not excuse injustice.

The paradox is stark: The climate crisis requires moral courage and spiritual imagination. Yet some of the loudest religious voices in this process deploy theology not to advance justice but to obstruct it. And in doing so, they make the work of faith-rooted advocates even more necessary.

Faith is not the problem. Theocracy might be. And here at COP30, that distinction matters more than ever.

The Permian Express pipeline system is owned by Permian Express Partners LLC, an 85/15 joint venture of Sunoco Logistics Partners and ExxonMobil Pipeline Co. that was formed in 2016.
Then in 2017, Sunoco Logistics turned around and acquired its former parent, Energy Transfer Partners.
The two companies merged and then took on the Energy Transfer name and combined their pipeline systems into a single network.
Today, Energy Transfer owns 85% of Permian Express, while ExxonMobil retains its 15% stake under the original joint operating agreement.","Energy Transfer stitched together its Permian Express system in stages over multiple years — first reversing and repurposing existing crude oil pipes, then building new capacity — and it’s now a standout in the company’s midstream portfolio, able to carry 600 Mb/d of crude oil from the Permian Basin to Nederland, TX, with multiple receipt and delivery points. In today’s RBN blog, we’ll look at the Permian Express system and how it fits into Energy Transfer’s broader midstream strategy.

This is the latest in our series on crude oil pipelines exiting the Permian Basin. In Bustin’ Out, we discussed the EPIC Crude Pipeline, which has been operating at full capacity. Then, we told the story of Gray Oak Pipeline in Movin' On Up and the Cactus I and II pipelines in Can’t Hold Back. All four travel to Corpus Christi. We recently wrapped up our Permian-to-Houston series with a new Drill Down Report, West Texas Highway, where we detailed how Houston is competing head-to-head with the Corpus Christi area to attract Permian barrels.

There are only two pipelines that make the long trip from the Permian to Nederland, both owned by Energy Transfer: West Texas Gulf, the subject of our most recent blog on the subject, and Permian Express, which we’ll discuss today. These two lines boast a combined capacity of nearly 1 MMb/d to Nederland, a small city about 10 miles southeast of Beaumont. Beaumont and Nederland are in an industrial corridor in southeast Texas known as the Golden Triangle and are often referred to as a single market.

Nederland receives considerably less Permian crude than Corpus Christi and Houston because its primary role is feeding nearby refineries in Port Arthur and Beaumont, including facilities owned by ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies. In contrast, Houston and Corpus Christi are export-driven hubs that together handle about 75% of Permian output. Through mid-year 2025, roughly 2.45 MMb/d of Permian crude flowed to Corpus Christi and 2.44 MMb/d headed to Houston, according to RBN’s Crude Oil Permian report, with only about 860 Mb/d destined for Nederland.

Early flows to Nederland primarily supplied refinery demand, but after the ban on most U.S. crude exports was lifted in 2015, volumes also began supporting export movements. In October, crude export loadings in the Beaumont/Nederland area averaged about 230-250 Mb/d, while Houston consistently exports more than 1 MMb/d and Corpus Christi pushes above 2 MMb/d, according to RBN’s Crude Voyager. While crude export volumes from Nederland are far smaller than those from Houston or Corpus Christi, Permian Express’s connectivity is vital to Energy Transfer’s strategy (more on that below).

The Permian Express pipeline system is owned by Permian Express Partners LLC, an 85/15 joint venture of Sunoco Logistics Partners and ExxonMobil Pipeline Co. that was formed in 2016. As for the ownership of Sunoco Logistics Partners, that’s a little complicated. In 2012, Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) bought Sunoco Inc., which was the parent company of Sunoco Logistics. After the purchase, Sunoco Logistics continued to operate separately under its own name. Then in 2017, Sunoco Logistics turned around and acquired its former parent, Energy Transfer Partners. The two companies merged and then took on the Energy Transfer name and combined their pipeline systems into a single network. Today, Energy Transfer owns 85% of Permian Express, while ExxonMobil retains its 15% stake under the original joint operating agreement.",https://rbnenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_image/public/single-use/2025-11/Figure%201.%20Energy%20Transfer%27s%20Permian-to-Gulf%20Connectivity.%20Source%20RBN.png?itok=YQ2zTEvo,N,,2025-11-23 23:59:27.723839

Global clean energy investments exceeded $2 trillion for the first time in 2024, more than double the value invested in fossil fuels.
Less than one in five dollars of global clean energy investment flows to EMDEs outside China.
Africa, with 20% of the world's population and 85% of the population lacking electricity access, receives just 2% of global renewables.","The UN Energy Transition Report 2025 highlights a historical turning point: the world is experiencing record-breaking growth in renewables, outpacing fossil fuels as the dominant source of new electricity. Solar and wind are now the least expensive options in nearly every region, with solar photovoltaic (PV) generation costs dropping to 4.3 cents/kWh—41% lower than the cheapest fossil fuel alternative. Between 2015 and 2024, 96% of newly installed solar PV and onshore wind capacity beat coal and gas plants for cost.

Accelerating Progress in Solar and Renewables

Renewables supplied 92.5% of all new global power capacity additions in 2024 and accounted for 74% of electricity generation growth. The total installed renewable capacity increased by 140% (about 2,600 GW), while fossil fuel growth slowed to just 16%. Solar's rapid expansion saw more than three-quarters of new renewable capacity coming from solar alone, with China, the USA, India, and Brazil leading the charge. This remarkable cost decline and exponential deployment of renewables and electric vehicles are driving a virtuous cycle of further adoption, technological improvement, and investment.

Ten Years Since Paris Agreement Global Warming Trends and Renewable Targets

Since the Paris Agreement, global policy ambitions have progressed. The highest warming projections have been revised downward from nearly 4°C to around 3.1°C under current policies, but ambitions are needed to achieve the safer 1.5°C scenario. In 2025, renewables are projected to surpass coal-fired generation, and by 2029, solar PV will become the largest single source of renewable electricity globally.

Global climate milestones include 141 countries now setting net-zero targets, covering 76% of global greenhouse gas emissions. These commitments have driven innovation and adoption across the solar PV, wind, and electric vehicle sectors. Major advancements in battery storage technology—costs have fallen by 93% since 2010—enable the grid to accommodate higher shares of renewables.

Want an expert assessment on meeting your own net-zero goals? Atlantic Renewables are here to help UK homeowners and businesses plan integrated solar systems.

Key Clean Energy Statistics from the Report

Installed renewable capacity surged 141% since 2015, now representing 46% of global power capacity (from 29%) and 32% of electricity generation

Battery storage worldwide increased from 2 GW in 2015 to 89 GW in 2024

Electric vehicle sales grew from just 0.5 million (1% of total car sales) in 2015 to over 17 million (20%) in 2024. In China, EVs now account for almost half of all new car sales.

Global clean energy investments exceeded $2 trillion for the first time in 2024, more than double the value invested in fossil fuels.

Renewable sector jobs reached 16.2 million (out of 34.8 million total clean energy jobs), with solar at the forefront of global employment growth.

Opportunities for a Just and Inclusive Energy Transition

The report stresses that renewables can unlock vast social and economic benefits beyond emissions reductions. Investment in clean technologies boosts job creation and GDP—clean energy accounted for 10% of China’s GDP in 2024 and drove nearly one-third of European Union economic growth. The transition supports millions of new green jobs, improves air quality, and strengthens public health. Access to clean energy—especially in developing countries—remains an urgent priority, with solar mini-grids identified as the most effective solution for rural electrification.

Systematic adoption of renewables and energy efficiency leads to:

6.4% higher GDP, 3.5% more jobs, and 25% higher social welfare across Africa by 2050 (IRENA report).

3.4% higher GDP and 10% higher social welfare in Southeast Asia.

Atlantic Renewables is committed to delivering inclusive solar solutions—reach out for community projects or educational solar initiatives.

Persistent Barriers to Achieving Net Zero

Despite rapid progress, global fossil fuel use remains stubbornly high—dropping only modestly from 83% to 80% of primary energy supply over the last decade. Clean energy financing is a major bottleneck, especially in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs). Less than one in five dollars of global clean energy investment flows to EMDEs outside China. Africa, with 20% of the world's population and 85% of the population lacking electricity access, receives just 2% of global renewables.

Other vital challenges include:

High upfront capital costs and weak enabling policy frameworks.

Grid bottlenecks, with 3,000 GW of renewable projects awaiting connection.

Political resistance and lobbying by fossil fuel interests.

Continued public subsidies for fossil fuel use, which dwarf investment in climate-friendly solutions.

Supply chain vulnerabilities—with 88% of global solar manufacturing capacity in China, and critical minerals supply dominated by a handful of countries.

The UN calls for annual clean energy spending in developing countries to reach $1.4-1.9 trillion by 2030, a five-to-sevenfold increase from current levels, to meet Paris Agreement and SDG goals. Massive public-private mobilisation and international cooperation will be crucial.

Six Priority Actions for Policymakers

Outlined in the report, priority actions include:

Policy coherence, clarity, and certainty, with just transition roadmaps.

Investment in enabling infrastructure—grids, storage, and smart technologies.

Meeting new electricity demand with renewables, particularly for Big Tech and data centres.

Placing people and equity at the heart of the transition, ensuring universal energy access and social protection for affected workers.

Supercharging trade and investment cooperation, lowering tariffs on clean technologies and reforming treaties.

Dismantling structural barriers to finance—mobilising upgrades in global financial architecture, increasing concessional finance, and building local capacity.

For government white papers and new national energy strategies, review the UN Moment of Opportunity report.

Implications for the UK and Atlantic Renewables Clients

UK energy prices have demonstrated the value of renewables—households could have paid double absent solar and wind deployment in 2022. The push for decarbonisation, energy security, and cost savings mirrors the opportunities outlined for wider Europe and the world. Local investment in solar PV, battery storage, and smart grid infrastructure is essential for resilience, cost control, and job creation. As the UN report demonstrates, acting now delivers not only climate but economic and social wins.

It’s a fair question. This year saw an abrupt end to tax credits for electric cars, renewable energy projects, and home energy efficiency improvements. The U.S. Department of Energy canceled nearly $6 billion in grant funding for clean energy projects , including $550 million slated for projects in Colorado . For the second time, the United States is backing out of the climate goals established in the Paris Agreement , and fossil fuel interests are being given priority over endangered species and critical wildlife habitat . Meanwhile, climate change continues to make heatwaves more common , wildfires worse and hurricanes more intense . And holiday travelers be warned — air turbulence is becoming more frequent , too.

It sure feels like national environmental policy is having a Sisyphus moment . So, is there any reason to be hopeful? Yes, there is. Certainly, the challenges are real. But not all the news is bad. In this season of Thanksgiving, let’s remind ourselves of some good news.

A 100% clean energy future is possible

When you think about the kind of world you want to live in, is it a world full of power plants that spew air pollutants toxic to both humans and the environment? While fossil fuels like coal have historically kept our lights on, they’ve done so at a cost. There are well-established links between mining , refining , and burning fossil fuels and negative human health outcomes, like asthma, heart attack, cancer, and premature death.

Instead, what if we prioritized affordable, abundant energy systems as well as healthy humans and thriving ecosystems? That vision is possible. Not in the future, not with yet-to-be-discovered technology — it’s possible now.

In fact, it’s already happening. In 2019, 20% of the U.S. electric grid was powered by renewable sources . Electricity in Summit County is over 40% renewable and on track to be over 80% renewable by 2030 . Research out of Stanford University shows that the entire U.S. electric grid can be fully powered by wind, water, solar and battery storage while maintaining grid stability. Moreover, it can be done more cheaply, more efficiently, and with greater job creation than the business-as-usual scenario (which includes fossil-fuel generated electricity). When factoring in the savings from fewer premature deaths and illnesses caused by air pollution, as well as avoided costs from climate change-related damage to infrastructure, agriculture, etc ., the payback period for this transition is less than 10 years.

Global emissions are flattening

A recent analysis from the U.S. research firm Rhodium Group found that international cooperation to decrease greenhouse gas emissions is working . Climate change is still a very pressing challenge, but the scale of renewable energy and electric vehicle deployment across the globe is beginning to flatten emissions. This doesn’t mean that we’ve solved the climate crisis . Indeed, the likelihood of meeting the goals set forth in the Paris Agreement is less than 5% .

Nevertheless, new reporting from the United Nations indicates that, because of the commitments countries made under the Paris Agreement, expected temperature increases by the end of the century are lower than they were 10 years ago. And Rhodium Group’s data shows that strong policy support, investment, and thoughtful regulatory reform can accelerate progress both at home and abroad. Need proof that rapid decarbonization is possible? Uruguay did it in less than 10 years .

From good news to active hope

Less than 10 years to decarbonize a grid, and less than 10 years to pay off the investment. That’s enough to give me hope for the future. But that doesn’t mean sitting idly by waiting for that future to come. What we need is active hope.

Active hope means taking concrete action to ensure the renewable energy future arrives sooner rather than later . It means advocating for smart policy and regulations, submitting comments to our elected officials, and even the Colorado Public Utilities Commission . It also means participating in the clean energy transition as we’re able. In these Sisyphean moments when I feel like the rock is slipping away yet again, it is this active hope that grounds me and keeps me going. And for that, I am grateful.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/2/2025/04/17162433/as17-148-22727_lrg_0.jpg.jpeg,N,,2025-11-23 21:58:00.128910

US President Donald Trump recently visited several Asian nations, including Japan, on a tour of the region, stopping off in China for a high-level tariff meeting with President XI, before heading off to several other nations, where he was praised and given the kind of adoration that he so obviously craves. In his trip to Japan, the Japanese government agreed to invest up to $550 billion in the US’s energy and LNG infrastructure.

The US and Japan have agreed on a framework for the astonishing investments in US energy

During his visit with Japan’s new and first-ever female Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, Trump and the Japanese PM put pen to paper on a comprehensive trade and investment agreement that aims to implement previous commitments made by Japan, as well as Japan’s pledged $550 billion investment in US sectors that will boost the US energy market to new levels under the directive of Trump.

The new agreement was signed in a ceremony that builds on previous trade and tariff agreements made in July of this year. The eye-watering $550 billion investment framework covers a wide range of US energy sectors, including but not limited to:

Energy infrastructure and production capacity

LNG production in the US

advanced fuels like biofuels

grid modernization

critical minerals mining

processing and refining in the upstream and midstream sectors

“The two leaders noted with satisfaction swift and continued efforts by both countries, and confirmed their strong commitment to implementing this GREAT DEAL. The Agreement will help both countries to strengthen economic security, promote economic growth, and thereby continuously lead to global prosperity.” – joint statement by the US and Japan

Japan’s commitment to invest in the US energy sector has set the tone for the market

US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, who heads up the “investment committee” responsible for selecting eligible projects, has noted that 10 to 12 Japanese companies have expressed interest in entering the US energy sector through the established investment framework.

Some of the projects and companies identified as part of the substantial investment framework are:

Westinghouse – A leader in the nuclear sector, the company has planned the construction of AP1000 nuclear reactors and small modular reactors alongside Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Toshiba Group, and IHI.

Bechtel – the company has noted its plans to provide project management, engineering, procurement, and construction services for large-scale energy projects such as power plants, substations, and transmission systems.

Kinder Morgan – the energy firm will provide natural gas transmission alongside several Japanese energy companies. Kinder Morgan has the added benefit of working on a refined products pipeline in the US state of Texas.

Trump has been on a roll as of late, boasting at the meeting between himself and Japan’s new Prime Minister about his administration’s regulatory cuts and rapid project approvals in recent months as the US aims to increase energy production, an idea that Trump ran on for his second term in office.

Minister-in-charge of Science and Energy & Technology, Dr Tan See Leng, set the tone for the week with the Singapore Energy Lecture. Acknowledging the uncertainties brought on by geopolitical tensions, Minister Tan reassured the audience that Singapore will continue to strive to balance sustainability with security as it navigates the energy transition. The four pillars of this journey –Sustainable pathways, Interconnectivity, Ecosystem resilience and Workforce capabilities – were the cornerstone of his address.

Here are the key highlights of these announcements:

EMA also signed a Letter of Intent with the Idaho National Laboratory to affirm our commitment to collaborate on research, technology assessments, and capacity building for advanced nuclear technologies.

For Singapore, these partnerships represent a pivotal step in its long-term strategy to diversify its energy mix. With the US Department of Energy (DOE) approving Singapore’s inclusion in the Part 810 list of Generally Authorised Destinations for exports of controlled nuclear technology and assistance, this opens the door for deeper knowledge exchange and collaboration. This milestone brings Singapore closer to a future where nuclear energy may potentially be able to play a role in its sustainable energy mix.

As Singapore transitions to cleaner sources of energy, the need for a more flexible and resilient power grid is paramount. This is where distributed energy resources (DERS) – such as rooftop solar photovoltaics, battery energy storage systems or even electric vehicle chargers – come into play. These small-scale power generation units offer a solution to meet growing energy demands and enhance grid resilience alongside centralised power generation.

To support the integration of DERS into the grid, EMA launched the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) regulatory sandbox. This two-year pilot will assess the feasibility of managing a network of DERS to provide energy and ancillary services to the grid.

Alongside this, the Energy Grid 3.0 Grant Call was also introduced, inviting innovative solutions to enhance grid planning and operations. This initiative is crucial for managing complex grid challenges, such as maintaining stability and resilience when integrating renewable energy sources.

In another major step toward greater grid flexibility, EMA unveiled the Demand-Side Flexibility Roadmap to outline our plans to harness demand-side resources to meet the needs of the power grid caused by supply or demand fluctuations. A key feature of this roadmap is the enhancements made to the Interruptible Load (IL) programme, which will soon offer participants greater certainty by reducing each activation event to half an hour. EMA will also be exploring the feasibility and design of a new programme that would incentivise demand-side resources to provide contingency reserves for extended periods. Together, these initiatives will ensure that Singapore’s grid remains reliable and adaptable as the nation shifts to a low-carbon future.

One of the initiatives is the Institute of Technical Education (ITE)’s new Technical Engineer Diploma in Electrical Engineering (Clean Energy). This diploma, which provides students with a foundation in electrical engineering while equipping them in clean energy areas, is recognised by EMA for Licensed Electrical Technician (LET) licence application.

But the work does not stop there. To truly build a future-ready workforce, learning has to be continuous. That is why EMA has worked with Singapore Polytechnic and the Singapore Institute of Technology as part of the Green Skills Committee to offer continuing education programmes in emerging fields such as renewable energy integration and smart grid technologies.

We have also introduced an internship training plan for tertiary students to receive the necessary training and work experience that would better prepare them to become licensed electricians and licensed electrical technicians.

To support individuals and the workforce in navigating emerging opportunities, we have refreshed the Clean Energy Jobs-Skills Insight– a resource that spotlights emerging areas of work, jobs, and skills across the energy sector, and how new technologies are unlocking fresh possibilities for growth.

These initiatives ensure that the current workforce stays ahead of the curve, ready to harness emerging technologies and drive Singapore's energy transition.

Following the signing of the MOU on Energy Cooperation with Sweden in 2024, EMA co-hosted the inaugural Singapore–Sweden Forum with Team Sweden at SIEW 2025. The Forum brought together energy leaders from both countries to discuss hydrogen and other clean fuels, smart grids, and energy efficiency. The discussions paved the way for continued collaboration, especially in areas like regional energy interconnectivity and innovative clean energy technologies.

To further regional integration, EMA has partnered with the Ministry of Trade and Industry and The International Tracking Standard Foundation to develop the Cross-Border Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Framework. This framework will allow for cross-border tracking of renewable electricity, providing transparency and boosting confidence in the international renewable energy market.",https://ema.gov.sg/content/dam/corporate/news/feature-stories/shaping-the-future-of-energy-highlights-from-the-singapore-international-energy-week-2025/minister-tan-see-leng.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 23:59:19.308651

The shift towards electric vehicles means the government will get less revenue from fuel duties in the coming years.
""EV [drivers], like drivers of petrol and diesel cars, are driving on roads that require maintenance.""
""We need to have a fair taxation system that is future-focused, but we're not going to do anything to jeopardise the transition to electric vehicles,"" she said.
""Ordinary families are facing increased taxes and spiralling inflation under Labour, yet the government's priority is handing out discounts on new electric cars,"" the Conservative MP said.","The government is expected to announce an extra £1.3bn in funding for a scheme encouraging the use of electric vehicles (EVs) at next week's Budget.

The Electric Car Grant scheme started in July as part of the move to zero emission vehicles. The government says it has helped 35,000 switch to EVs.

However, early research suggests there is little indication the scheme has attracted entirely new buyers.

There will also be money to create more charging points, and a consultation on helping people without driveways to charge their cars.

It is also possible EV owners could face a new tax elsewhere in Wednesday's Budget in the form of a pay-per-mile charge in future.

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander the told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that subsidising EV sales would support economic growth.

""This is an investment in the country's future... and the good quality manufacturing jobs associated with that,"" she said, pointing to production of the Nissan Leaf in Sunderland.

""So making sure that we are enabling people to buy a new electric vehicle if that's what they want to do, whilst also investing in charging infrastructure, it is the right long-term decision.""

All new cars will have to be electric or hybrid from 2030, when a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars comes into force.

The Electric Car Grant scheme, which provides a discount of up to £3,750 on eligible vehicles, was launched with an initial fund of £650m.

New AutoMotive, a non-profit organisation supporting the UK's transition to electric vehicles, found in a recent study that the scheme had yet to expand the market for EVs.

EVs covered by the scheme made up 23.8% of new registrations in September, the same as their share before the Electric Car Grant was announced, New Automotive said.

""It isn't yet clear that it's prompting consumers to consider buying cars that they wouldn't have gone ahead and bought anyway,"" David Farrar, policy manager for New AutoMotive, said at the time.

The Budget is also expected to announce a further £200m for speeding up the rollout of chargepoints across the UK.

Data from Zapmap shows almost 87,000 points across the UK, in about 44,000 locations. Those include places like supermarket car parks and lamppost chargers.

""The proposed funding will support the creation of thousands of charge points and provide extra resources for local authorities to ramp up charging infrastructure on local streets - making it easier for everyone to access reliable charging, including those without off-street parking,"" the government said.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves, it added, was ""expected to publish a consultation on Permitted Development Rights to make it easier and cheaper for people without a driveway to charge"".

However, it is also possible that EV owners could face a new tax in the Budget in the form of a pay-per-mile charge from 2028 to mirror the fuel duty that drivers of petrol and diesel cars pay.

The shift towards electric vehicles means the government will get less revenue from fuel duties in the coming years.

The transport secretary did not rule out a new tax on EV drivers' road use, saying support for the transition to EVs needed to be balanced with a ""fair vehicle taxation system for all motorists"".

""EV [drivers], like drivers of petrol and diesel cars, are driving on roads that require maintenance.""

""We've got ageing infrastructure, motorways that were built back in the sixties and seventies,"" Alexander said.

""We need to have a fair taxation system that is future-focused, but we're not going to do anything to jeopardise the transition to electric vehicles,"" she said.

Reeves is being urged not to raise taxes on drivers overall, with campaigners preparing to deliver a petition to Downing Street early next week which calls for fuel duty, long frozen, not to be increased.

Richard Holden, the shadow transport secretary, said that ""handing out £1.5bn in EV subsidies while hard-working taxpayers are squeezed dry"" was ""madness"".

""Ordinary families are facing increased taxes and spiralling inflation under Labour, yet the government's priority is handing out discounts on new electric cars,"" the Conservative MP said.

Reeves is expected to increase some taxes in the Budget after saying she means to bring down NHS waiting lists, the national debt and the cost of living.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lmsI_4hvvk5bJ0WUtjZwiw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/9b88648e89c5b2181d706e484817f494,N,,2025-11-23 23:59:23.691661

Because public power utilities are not-for-profit, any federal investment to support those utilities is certain to benefit the local communities,” APPA said.
Moreover, federal investment in public power utilities will facilitate speed to power.
Data centers not only need to obtain power, “but they also require water and other utility services, which many public power utilities also provide.
In conclusion, APPA said public power utilities are committed to serving their communities with reliable, affordable power.","The American Public Power Association on Nov. 21 submitted comments to the U.S. Department of Energy in response to the DOE’s request for information on accelerating speed to power and winning the artificial intelligence race.

The U.S. Department of Energy on Sept. 18 announced the Speed to Power initiative, which is aimed at accelerating the speed of large-scale grid infrastructure project development for both transmission and generation.The Speed to Power initiative ""will help ensure the United States has the power needed to win the global artificial intelligence (AI) race while continuing to meet growing demand for affordable, reliable and secure energy,” DOE said.

“Public power utilities across the nation are expanding their capacity to serve new data center loads by building grid infrastructure, creating innovative rate structures, and partnering with data center developers,” APPA said in its comments.

“Some public power utilities have been serving data center loads for decades, powering the internet as we know it today,” it said.

“And in public power communities that seek to serve new artificial intelligence data centers, data center developers see benefit in partnering with public power utilities because their not-for-profit business model and local governance structure allow public power utilities to be nimble in meeting the needs of new data centers,” APPA told DOE.

“But significant barriers continue to constrain the ability of public power utilities to expand their capacity to serve new loads while protecting their existing customers from undue costs and risks. APPA therefore appreciates and applauds the efforts of DOE to strengthen the federal role in accelerating critical projects to enable the growth in electricity demand.”

Large-Scale Generation and Transmission Projects to Enable Load Growth

APPA noted that it conducted a survey of its members to identify generation and transmission projects in development and the barriers that are impeding the speed or increasing the cost of completing those projects.

Dozens of public power utilities have projects in development, ranging from early-phase partnerships for developing small modular nuclear reactors to natural gas plant upgrades to novel new geothermal plants.

Many individual projects are between 20 megawatts (MW) and 100 MW, while some larger public power utilities have portfolios of planned projects that would add several gigawatts of capacity to their systems.

“APPA is committed to collaborating with DOE to identify public power projects that would benefit from federal support and facilitating meetings with public power utilities that are developing projects of interest to DOE,” it said.

High-Priority Geographic Areas for Targeted DOE Investment

Public power communities “are particularly well suited for targeted federal investment to enable grid expansion that supports new electricity demand growth. Because public power utilities are not-for-profit, any federal investment to support those utilities is certain to benefit the local communities,” APPA said.

“APPA has a long history of coordinating with DOE on delivering funding and technical assistance to public power utilities that not only strengthen grid resilience but also result in tangible community benefits. Moreover, federal investment in public power utilities will facilitate speed to power. Because public power utilities are community-owned and locally governed, the support of local leaders for new data centers can alleviate local barriers to deployment,” it noted.

Data centers not only need to obtain power, “but they also require water and other utility services, which many public power utilities also provide. And developers need to navigate local siting and permitting requirements.”

As instrumentalities of state and local governments, public power utilities “can participate in whole-of-government efforts to enable data centers to successfully—and with all due speed—locate in communities that seek to attract such investment. As noted above, APPA is committed to meeting with DOE to identify public power utilities that would benefit from federal assistance.”

DOE Support for Large Scale Projects

APPA said it supports DOE’s efforts to use existing statutory authority to help development and deployment of generation and transmission projects.

“In the short term, financial assistance and technical assistance are critical to achieving speed to power. Additionally, DOE can play an important role in alleviating supply chain challenges and addressing workforce vulnerabilities.”

And DOE “must coordinate with other federal agencies to reduce barriers for expanding grid capacity,” it said.

APPA urged DOE to consider the following principles as it evolves its programs to support speed to power and expansion of grid capacity to meet growing demand reliably:

• Ensure financial and technical assistance is available to public power utilities

DOE should ensure that financial and technical assistance opportunities are available to all those willing – including public power utilities.

Conditions on assistance opportunities that are inconsistent with a not-for-profit business model and requirements that conflict with or duplicate obligations that apply to instrumentalities of the state or local governments should be avoided. Congress recognized, for example, that public power utilities’ tax-exempt status materially limited the ability of those utilities to benefit from certain tax incentives, and therefore added elective pay provisions to recent incentives that provide equal access to incentives for not-for-profit utilities.

DOE should similarly be cognizant of rules that inadvertently prevent public power utilities from accessing assistance, APPA said.

• Enable joint action among communities

Many public power utilities form “joint action agencies” that allow multiple utilities to work together to build generation and transmission that would not be possible for any of the individual utilities. Such joint action agencies should be eligible to apply for grants on behalf of their member utilities, which are often located in smaller, rural communities, APPA said. “This would help ensure projects are built that benefit smaller public power utilities and allow them to work together to achieve economies of scale on building significant generation and transmission projects.”

• Improve certainty and reduce burdens

Applicants for technical and financial assistance have often described the application process as unduly complex or burdensome, APPA noted. “Especially for small non-profit, community-owned public power utilities, application processes can be streamlined. For technical assistance, improved communication— such as a “one stop shop”—describing the range of programs available and eligibility requirements would allow for more utilities to make use of the programs. Furthermore, greater certainty around the durability of assistance programs will allow beneficiaries to more effectively plan and execute on projects that expand grid capability.”

Interagency Coordination

Achieving speed to power requires all federal agencies to coordinate to reduce barriers to building new generation and transmission, APPA said.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), federal land management agencies, and internal revenue service (IRS) all play important roles in alleviating barriers, so DOE should coordinate closely with them to prioritize grid expansion to serve growing demand, it said.

“The Department of Commerce can also play a role in addressing issues such as supply chain constraints. The National Energy Dominance Council has been—and should continue to be—an effective body for facilitating the interagency coordination that is need to accelerate speed to power.”

Environmental Protection Agency

APPA supports continued collaboration with EPA on reliability issues. “We urge DOE to conduct analysis of proposed EPA rules to determine whether they will unduly affect grid reliability or harm resource adequacy. DOE and EPA should also designate points of contact for permitting issues and hold joint technical workshops with stakeholders to address roadblocks and share best practices.”

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

Natural gas remains a major source of electricity generation, and many APPA members are expanding their gas-fired power plants to serve growing demand, including new data centers. This often requires expansion of natural gas infrastructure. “DOE should continue its coordination with FERC to ensure adequate gas supply for power plants, as well as ensuring effective coordination between the gas and electric systems.”

Land Management Agencies

Wildfire risk is an impediment to building out the transmission grid, particularly in the West but throughout the country, APPA said.

“Today, electric utilities encounter numerous federal hurdles and delays when undertaking wildfire mitigation, grid hardening, and wildfire recovery actions to protect their systems and the communities they serve. These operational challenges pose a barrier to utilities planning to build more transmission to serve growing demand.”

Statutory changes to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) “are certainly needed, but land management agencies can take action immediately to reduce burdens for utilities, including by”:

• Further clarifying emergency hazard tree removal approval processes and have those policies consistent across regions and agencies;

• Clarifying regulations under the FLPMA that currently do not allow utilities to then remove the felled timber, slash, and other vegetation from the forest itself without undergoing a timber sale or donation process; and

• Expediting implementation of master service agreements combining multiple permits and updating expired with utilities that hold multiple operating and maintenance electric corridor permits.

Internal Revenue Service

APPA said IRS regulations can significantly impact whether a new infrastructure project gets built or not.

“Certainty and stability of those rules is critical to enabling new grid infrastructure. A tax issue that some public power utilities encounter is that the IRS limits “private use” of municipal bonds in ways that prevent public power from crafting innovative arrangements with data centers.”

A customized contract with a data center that lasts longer than three years and makes use of more than 10 percent of bond proceeds would, in the IRS’s view, likely be considered private use.

“DOE should coordinate with the IRS about the importance of crafting tax rules in a way that enables—rather than hinders—public power to serve growing loads, including data centers. Like EPA and land management agencies, the IRS does not have the goal of ensuring reliable electricity service at the lowest reasonable cost; DOE should therefore ensure that the IRS is (at minimum) informed about electric reliability and affordability challenges associated with new or existing tax rules.”

Public Private Partnerships

The RFI asks how DOE can leverage public-private partnerships to accelerate development of projects that address grid capacity and load growth.

“One type of public-private partnership with a proven track record is joint ownership of transmission. Joint ownership allows for all load-serving entities in the relevant footprint—including public power utilities—to participate in the ownership and development of new transmission projects. Such ownership structures lead to a collaborative and inclusive process for the planning, development, and financing of new transmission that results in a more efficient grid that can serve growing demand reliably,” APPA said.

Joint ownership can eliminate weak spots, make it easier to garner support for transmission projects, and lay an important foundation for the prompt siting of new transmission lines, the association noted.

“It may be the single most important factor in determining the success of a transmission project. There are many structures for inclusive joint ownership of transmission. In some regions, investor-owned utilities have partnered with public power utilities and rural cooperatives to form transmission companies that can own and operate new transmission facilities. In other regions, public power transmission owners have partnered with investor-owned neighbors to plan and operate transmission facilities jointly, as a single-system, pursuant to a long-term arrangement.”

Regardless of the structure, joint ownership arrangements have led to a collaborative and inclusive process for planning, developing, financing, and siting transmission, APPA said.

“Including public power in the ownership of transmission lines has facilitated effective planning and has helped manage cost allocation issues because the project is able to demonstrate multiple benefits by meeting the needs of several utilities. Moreover, public power ownership of transmission lines—even in small percentages—can attract political support for state and local approval processes. Given the significant benefits of the joint ownership model, DOE should consider all available tools to encourage and facilitate joint ownership as a proven model of public-private partnership.”

Barriers to Expanding Infrastructure

APPA said its members report a range of barriers that are slowing down infrastructure development and increasing costs.

Based on survey responses from members, major barriers include supply chain constraints, federal permitting, and regulatory uncertainty.

APPA elaborated on these barriers as follows:

Supply Chain Constraints

Many APPA members that are developing new generation and transmission projects are experiencing challenges with procurement of major materials, notably circuit breakers, switchgear, transformers, and turbines.

There are two main types of challenges: delays and price changes. Some suppliers have been informing APPA members that the equipment they ordered will be delayed by several months or even years, which has significant impacts on the overall project timeline, APPA said.

“And other suppliers are increasing the cost of equipment: multiple APPA members reported cost increases in the range of 15-20 percent from the time of a preliminary quote to the time of the order; others have reported price increases even after orders are completed. Tariff uncertainty also poses a barrier to completing projects on time and on budget.”

DOE should coordinate within the administration to consider targeted tariff exemptions for critical electric equipment and materials. Such an exemption would reduce uncertainty and allow all utilities to progress more quickly on getting new infrastructure built, APPA said.

Federal Permitting

“Projects that require federal permits face extraordinary delays in getting built. It regularly takes multiple years—even absent litigation—to get through NEPA review and other federal permitting requirements, even when the federal nexus is quite narrow (e.g., some amount of federal funding or an incidental take under the Endangered Species Act),” APPA said.

Litigation, which is very common in NEPA assessments for electric infrastructure, adds more years.

APPA noted that it has advocated pragmatic legislative changes that would streamline the permitting and siting process, provide clearer federal guidance, and produce timelier decisions.

Specifically, APPA said reforms should enhance: (1) predictability, so utilities know what to expect and when; (2) efficiency, through better agency cooperation and fewer duplicative steps; (3) transparency, by tracking project milestones openly; and (4) meaningful stakeholder input at each stage. Sustained funding for federal agencies is also critical, as under-resourced offices are often a root cause of slow permitting.

To address federal permitting, APPA supports H.R. 4776, the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, including (1) a limitation that an agency’s scope of review under NEPA be limited to major federal actions within the agency’s authority and control; (2) confirmation that federal assistance does not automatically constitute a major federal action; (3) clarification that reasonably foreseeable federal actions are actions directly under the control of the agency and have a close casual relationship to the proposed agency action; and (4) limiting unnecessary litigation.

The House Natural Resources Committee on Nov. 20 passed H.R. 4776 by a vote of 25-18.

In conclusion, APPA said public power utilities are committed to serving their communities with reliable, affordable power.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-23 21:58:17.442236

Such conditions including panic reaction among the disaster victims may even obstruct relief operation and their efforts to seek safety measures.
But analysis of websites containing AI-generated pictures of buildings provided some clues to the pictures spreading on the social media.
Though the media houses deleted the reports and regretted to have broadcasted those, it was circulating on the social media all the same.
But the worst public enemies are fearmongers who use the social media to spread fake reports and pictures of deaths and devastations that did never happen.","Whether it is fire, or storm, earthquake or flood, what the magnitude of devastation it would cause depends both on pre-calamity preparedness and post-calamity reaction of the population stricken by any disaster. The destruction in question is not just about deaths, injuries and loss of property. However, in our materialistic outlook, after deaths, collapse of buildings and other physical infrastructure gets the most attention. Attention to the victims of physical injury comes next. Unfortunately, in our society, victims of post-disaster psychological injury get the least attention. Nowadays, with the advent of social media, the psychological harm caused to the disaster victims has amplified due to information overload, misinformation and rumour. A research article published in the prestigious British science journal, Nature, in its July 27, 2024 issue stated that the widespread dissemination of negative online information might generate cyber violence or lead to serious adverse psychological outcomes.

The finding was the outcome of a study that considered a natural disaster event involving avoidable deaths and child casualties as an example to identify emotional contagion and simulation interventions. The data according to the study was derived from the aftermath of a flash flood in the Loncaogou Scenic Area, Sichuan Province, China. The analysis found that negative emotions were more persistent and contagious than positive emotions. That negative emotions spread and impact the audience, here the victims in a post-disaster dispensation, faster and deeper than positive emotions, we know from our everyday experience. Especially, rumours and fake reports about the fallouts from a disaster is a common experience in the present-day world. Except those deliberately involved in causing psychological trauma in a populace following a natural calamity, those behind such misinformation as well as disinformation are, often, unaware of the fact that the rumours and fake pictures of damage on the social media may cause widespread anxiety, depression, Post traumatic Disorder (PTSD) and other forms of fatal consequences. Such conditions including panic reaction among the disaster victims may even obstruct relief operation and their efforts to seek safety measures.

Consider the deluge of rumours and fake news that followed November 21 (Friday)'s earthquake in Bangladesh of which the epicentre was (at Narsingdi) not far from the capital city of Dhaka. Considering the actual number of deaths and damage to infrastructures so far reported since last Friday morning, the earthquake caused more psychological damage to the people across the country than physical harm. However, this is not meant to anyway belittle the casualties of the tremor so far reported. Every death counts and the families affected by such deaths know that whatever the reason behind the deaths, road accidents or earthquakes. But here we are concerned more about how social-media-created rumours following sudden disaster like earthquake might negatively impact the direct victims of the calamity or those who just listen to or read about those on the social media.

A fact check conducted by a local media house, for example, found that a picture was spreading on the social media to the effect an eight-storey building had collapsed in Dhaka following Friday's tremor. But a reverse search found that the image of the collapsed building doing the rounds on the social media bore some similarity to that of the Lafayette building of the Detroit city in the USA. The building is learnt to have been demolished in 2010. However, some difference in the image of the taken down Lafayette building which was a 14-storey (with one floor as basement) one, while the one in picture passing for the damaged building in Dhaka, was showing 11 storeys over the ground.

The fake picture about the so-called 'destroyed Dhaka building' had other points of difference with surroundings of the demolished Lafyette building in that the latter had high-rise structures around it. But the fake 'Dhaka building' did not have images of high-rise buildings surrounding it. However, the search to find if it (the fake collapsed Dhaka building) was created with the help of AI could finally come up with an answer. It was indeed done with help of AI. Similarly, there were also pictures of some leaning buildings among which was a two-storey one with a big crack in the middle, while other parts of the building showing as unaffected. Its picture was spreading on the facebook. The picture also had a poetic caption that said how helpless humans were before the forces of nature. However, reverse image search proved futile as no similar source image could be found. But analysis of websites containing AI-generated pictures of buildings provided some clues to the pictures spreading on the social media. Clearly, the picture of the part-bifurcated two-storey building has no copy in the real world. Also, take the fake video of the collapsed flyover at Diabari in the capital city. The fake video-link of the collapsed flyover was also spread to some Indian news media. The fake report was briefly carried by some news media in Dhaka. Analysis reached the conclusion that the picture of the collapsed flyover was hundred per cent AI-generated. Interestingly, some news media even circulated report of the tilted building of the Chief Adviser at Tejgaon. Though the media houses deleted the reports and regretted to have broadcasted those, it was circulating on the social media all the same. But the misinformed public, all of whom may not be educated enough to tell the real from the fake images, might be unduly panicked by such pictures or videos.

Many people, just out of fear, have already left Dhaka city to neighbouring districts with fewer buildings and more open spaces. Maybe those areas are safer in case of a devastating tremor striking the city. But if the city is the source of their livelihood, how long can they stay away from their work? For no one can predict when the next jolt will come -- it may be the next moment, the next week or a century later. Worse, no place on earth can guarantee one ultimate safety. Moreover, the earthquake-related fear arises mainly from the public's unfamiliarity with this kind of danger. But when it comes to familiar circumstances but with dangers lurking around there, people do not show signs of much fear. Consider, for instance, a bus travel in Bangladesh. Will the fear of a possible road accident leading to even death, which is a common experience in this country, stop a person from travelling?

So, what is important is to increase public awareness about the danger of earthquake or about any kind of disaster including fires, floods, storms or tsunamis. But the worst public enemies are fearmongers who use the social media to spread fake reports and pictures of deaths and devastations that did never happen.",https://tfe-bd.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/posts/125763/p5-earthquake-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-24 01:58:43.364282

Project another part of Cook Government's Made in WA plan to create jobs and drive economic diversification

The Cook Government is backing the delivery of a WA-made vanadium battery for Kalgoorlie, creating jobs, strengthening regional power reliability and supporting the establishment of a new industry for Western Australia.

Installing a Vanadium Battery Energy Storage System (VBESS) is a major election commitment under the Cook Government's Made in WA plan, to diversify the economy, enable Western Australia to become a renewable energy powerhouse, and to make more things here.

The VBESS will be the largest of its kind in Australia and has the potential to help grow WA's advanced manufacturing industry and support the development of a new local supply chain around vanadium mining, processing and flow battery technology.

The project will be supported by $150 million in government funding.

The first part of a two-stage Expression of Interest opens today and runs until 30 January 2026, to identify and understand existing capabilities in the market. It is not part of a procurement process.

The government wants local businesses to play a role in delivering the project, working with industry to determine practical and achievable local content outcomes.

The project will involve the installation of a 50-megawatt/500 megawatt-hour, WA-made vanadium flow battery using locally sourced and processed vanadium capable of discharging for up to 10 hours.

Vanadium flow batteries are fire resistant, efficient in WA's hot climate, recyclable and scalable.

Stage Two of the EOI process, to be held in early-to-mid 2026, will evaluate detailed business cases, with the aim of selecting a preferred proponent to deliver the VBESS project.

More information is available on the Energy Policy WA website.

“The neurocognitive harms of fossil fuel pollution disproportionately impact children, older adults and communities already facing environmental and health inequities.
These communities are more likely to be low-income or communities of color, compounding the risks.” Similarly, mental health, kidney health, hormonal health, and reproductive health are all also negatively affected by fossil fuel pollution.
There is at least some good news about the damage to public health that is being done by fossil fuel pollution, including in Black and Brown communities: we know how to stop it.
As the report puts it, “the most powerful health protection strategy is to reduce climate pollution by transitioning away from fossil fuels.”","It’s by no means new news that there are myriad ways that extracting and burning fossil fuels — or making them into other products, like plastics — is bad for public health, and particularly so for Black and Brown Americans. But we still continue to burn methane, and gasoline, and even coal, so the point bears being made again (and again).

The latest to do so is a broad coalition of medical and health organizations that released a new report last week titled “Fueling Sickness: The Hidden Health Costs of Fossil Fuel Pollution.”

It makes the case that society’s ongoing reliance on fossil fuels is severely damaging public health already — particularly demographics overburdened by such pollutions, including Black and Brown Americans — and that it will only get worse as the effects of climate change get worse.

“Fossil fuels harm our health in more ways than most people realize,” Dr. Mark Vossler, board president at Physicians for Social Responsibility, one of the organizations that put out the report, said in a statement.

“This report makes it clear that every stage of the fossil fuel process, from extraction, to transportation, to burning for energy causes widespread damage to the heart, lungs, brain and other organs. Rapidly transitioning away from fossil fuels is not just an environmental necessity; it’s a public health imperative.”

A disproportionate burden

“Fueling Sickness” shows that fossil fuel pollution is everyone’s problem while also making it clear that it is even more of a problem for some groups, including Black Americans.

“A complex array of interconnected factors (including but not limited to historical redlining, lending discrimination, exclusionary land use policies, disinvestment and urban renewal projects) have resulted in low income and communities of color disproportionally living in areas with a greater concentration of polluting sources, like highways and factories, and thus have greater exposure to multiple pollutants from multiple sources,” the report reads.

“As a result, a higher percentage of racial minorities are exposed to particulate matter and ozone, contributing to a greater incidence of childhood asthma and other respiratory conditions.”

As the report notes, fossil fuels harm public health at every point of their production and use cycle, from extraction to refining to transportation to combustion — and the waste products made along the way, like coal ash, can make people sick, too.

Widespread health impact

Respiratory diseases like asthma are some of the most obvious effects of breathing polluted air. Fine particulate matter and other emissions generated by extracting and burning fossil fuels can damage other parts of the body, too, including the cardiovascular system and the brain, increasing the risk of neurological diseases.

Like so many of the negative consequences of fossil fuel pollution, the neurodegenerative effects are not evenly felt. “The neurocognitive harms of fossil fuel pollution disproportionately impact children, older adults and communities already facing environmental and health inequities. People living near busy roadways, diesel truck routes or polluting industries are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5 and other air pollutants. These communities are more likely to be low-income or communities of color, compounding the risks.”

Similarly, mental health, kidney health, hormonal health, and reproductive health are all also negatively affected by fossil fuel pollution. According to the report, “one of the strongest associations between air pollution and negative birth outcomes like low birth weight and preterm birth are with power plants and petrochemical industries” — facilities that Black Americans are much more likely to live alongside than other people are.

The Physicians for Social Responsibility collaborated with a number of organizations, too: Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments, Children’s Environmental Health Network, Climate Psychiatry Alliance, Climate Psychology Alliance North America, The International Society for Environmental Epidemiology North America Chapter, The Medical Society Consortium on Climate & Health, Medical Student for a Sustainable Future, the National Medical Association, Oncology Advocates United for Climate and Health, and the Public Health Institute.

Mike Bruan, Jaworowski has bullishly championed an all-of-theabove energy approach in the state, including building more wind, solar and natural gas generation infrastructure.
Counties that have impeded new energy development or placed moratoriums on solar and wind projects have drawn her ire.
The chair of the House utilities, energy and telecommunications committee said if counties continue to have the final say on energy projects, the state faces a dark future.","PERU — In 2017, an international energy developer began signing land-lease agreements in Miami County to build 75 wind turbines as part of a multi-county development.

Project leaders said the wind farm would produce up to 600 megawatts of electricity — enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes.

A year later, the venture was dead.

Fierce pushback from local residents led county officials to approve a new wind ordinance with 2,000-foot setback requirements for the turbines that made the project nearly impossible to develop.

Larry West, then a Miami County commissioner who supported the wind farm, said losing the project cost the county and local school districts over $7 million in new tax revenue and robbed landowners who signed lease agreements of a lucrative new income source.

Eight years later, as electricity rates skyrocket and energy demand soars, losing the project has also cost Indiana what would have been a major new energy source, he argued.

“Our electricity is going to come from somewhere … and I think it’s going to have to be a combination of probably some green projects and nuclear modules,” he said.

BANNING CLEAN ENERGY

The situation in Miami County has played out time and again across Indiana, where county officials have total authority on zoning and permitting solar and wind projects.

But in the past two year, more counties than ever have started restricting clean-energy developments.

Of Indiana’s 92 counties, 64 have bans or impediments on new wind and solar projects as of September, according to an analysis by USA TODAY and the Indianapolis Star. That’s nearly double from just four years ago, when 34 counties had bans or restrictions.

Other counties, including Boone, Tippecanoe and Putnam, have also recently approved temporary moratoriums while officials consider their options.

The pushback comes as Hoosiers’ electricity bills are soaring and massive, energyguzzling data centers develop around the state, creating an unprecedented demand for more power.

Data centers being built for artificial intelligence in northern Indiana are projected to use more electricity by 2030 than every home in the entire state combined, according to Indiana Michigan Power.

Without county restrictions, wind and solar projects could have likely produced thousands of megawatts of new energy to help meet the state’s surging electricity demands, according to Hunter Jones, executive director of the Indiana Conservative Alliance for Energy.

“When it comes to solar, it’s in an especially worse position than it was a year or two ago. I think a lot of that has to do with changes going on at the federal level,” he said.

President Donald Trump blocked about $136 million for solar development in Indiana that federal lawmakers had approved under the Biden administration. A $6.7-million grant to expand the large solar array at the Indianapolis International Airport was also cut.

Trump’s open skepticism about clean energy has only further entrenched windand- solar opposition in conservative politics.

That sentiment is fueling resistance to clean-energy projects in Indiana, argued Topher Anderson, director of programs and operations for the conservative energy alliance.

He said that political rhetoric must be extracted from the state’s energy debate, which should focus on the science and economics of building out more wind and solar infrastructure.

“Go out to a transmission line, take that wire down and cut it open,” Anderson said, speaking hypothetically. “You’re not going to see red or blue electrons in there. You’re going to see the electrons that power your home.”

“We have to get back to focusing on these things without it being perceived as a red or a blue issue.”

NEW SECRETARY, NEW TONE

That sentiment is shared by Suzanne Jaworowski, Indiana’s new secretary of energy and natural resources who served in the first Trump administration as a senior advisor on nuclear energy.

Since being appointed by Indiana Gov. Mike Bruan, Jaworowski has bullishly championed an all-of-theabove energy approach in the state, including building more wind, solar and natural gas generation infrastructure.

Counties that have impeded new energy development or placed moratoriums on solar and wind projects have drawn her ire. During an Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute luncheon in September, she said those restrictions are making the state unattractive to industries and new developments.

Jaworowski specifically slammed counties that engage with energy developers and “string them along” before ultimately killing a project.

“That’s disgraceful,” she said. “Personally, I think that those companies should start suing the communities and get serious about it.”

That’s exactly what one company is doing in Fountain County.

Dolphin Solar received a permit in December to build a 700-megawatt installation representing a $800 million investment. In September, a newly appointed zoning administrator, within minutes of starting the job, nullified the permit without explanation.

The company had spent years and invested more than $75 million to develop the project and is now suing, saying the decision is illegal and causing “irreparable harm.”

Jaworowski said those kinds of actions have spurred a new state effort to create a map of counties and communities that are open to new energy and industrial development so officials can tout those areas to companies interested in investing.

It’s the state’s way of “putting out a carrot” to incentivize counties to participate and attract new development in their communit ies, she explained during the luncheon.

Jaworowski urged county officials not to view developing more energy sources as a political undertaking, but as a patriotic duty to ensure the state can continue to provide reliable electricity.

“We are looking at a Hoover Dam moment,” she said during a video interview with the Indiana Business Journal’s Off the Record. “We are going to have to build nuclear plants, more gas plants and renewables, and Indiana really wants to be a leader on this front.”

‘BUY SOME CANDLES’

While Jaworowski proposes using proverbial carrots, other Indiana lawmakers want a more forceful way to stop county officials from impeding large-scale energy developments, including solar and wind.

Rep. Craig Snow, R-Warsaw, introduced legislation this year that would give the state total authority on zoning and siting multi-county projects that generate at least 50-megawatts of electricity.

Developers would no longer be required to get permits or approval from local governments, which would be barred from taking “specified actions concerning the siting, construction or deployment” of clean-energy projects.

The bill failed to pass out of committee but had the support of Republican Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso. The chair of the House utilities, energy and telecommunications committee said if counties continue to have the final say on energy projects, the state faces a dark future.

“Buy some candles, because we’re not going to be able to meet the (electricity) demand,” Soliday said during a committee hearing in January.

Larry West, the former Miami County commissioner, said he would support more state regulation of solar and wind projects to create some uniformity on new developments.

“We generally like to see less big government, but I think sometimes it’s necessary to add some state controls or rules on something like this,” he said.

As it stands, allowing counties total authority to approve clean-energy projects has created unpredictability and inconsistencies that are major barriers to creating more electricity in the state, explained Jones, director of the conservative energy alliance.

Until that changes, Indiana can expect to lose out on billions of dollars of new investment and fall behind other states with modern zoning laws, he said.

“If Indiana cannot meet those needs, companies will go elsewhere,” Jones said. “That will cost us jobs, tax revenues for communities and jeopardize our long-term economic growth.”

The year-long initiative, undertaken in partnership with Global Citizen and backed by the International Energy Agency, seeks to expand electricity access, stimulate sustainable industrial growth, and accelerate Africa’s shift from fossil fuels to cleaner, modern energy systems.

The campaign also feeds into international efforts to scale renewable energy deployment and boost global energy efficiency.

The European Union contributed more than €15.1 billion of the total sum, while President von der Leyen, on behalf of Team Europe, pledged over €10 billion, with the remainder coming from substantial bilateral contributions by EU Member States, European development finance institutions, and private investments mobilised through the campaign.

Speaking at the close of the pledging event in Johannesburg, von der Leyen said the global response demonstrated unprecedented support for Africa’s clean-energy ambitions.

She emphasised that the package has the potential to provide life-changing electricity access to millions of households, unlock new economic opportunities, and lay the foundation for thriving markets and new jobs.

She described the initiative as a future led by Africa but strongly supported by Europe, a partner she said remains committed to the continent’s long-term energy needs.

Team Europe’s commitments consist of new Global Gateway projects supported by contributions from Germany, France, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, alongside the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Additional bilateral financing arrived from Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Denmark, Sweden, Austria and Ireland, while the EBRD announced an extra investment package exceeding €600 million.

The African Development Bank backed the campaign by pledging to allocate at least 20 per cent of the African Development Fund’s seventeenth replenishment to renewable energy. Norway also joined the effort with an estimated €53 million contribution through its support to the Fund between 2026 and 2028.

Organisers say the pledges secured through the initiative will generate 26.8 gigawatts of renewable energy and provide reliable electricity to 17.5 million households currently living without stable access.

According to a statement by the EU, the scale of these outcomes reflects the urgency of addressing Africa’s energy gap, with more than 600 million people still lacking electricity despite the continent possessing the world’s most abundant solar resources.

It noted that Africa attracts only a small fraction of global energy investment, and continues to face high financing costs, logistical barriers and supply chain challenges.

The “Scaling up Renewables in Africa” campaign was launched in November 2024 in Rio de Janeiro to galvanise governments, financial institutions, philanthropies and the private sector toward stronger clean-energy commitments.

It also helped build momentum toward global goals agreed at COP28, including tripling renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency by 2030.

“Of the €10 billion pledged by President von der Leyen on behalf of Team Europe, €3.1 billion had previously been unveiled during key international summits throughout 2025, including the EU–South Africa Summit, the Mattei Plan event, the Africa Climate Summit, the UN General Assembly and the Global Gateway Forum.

“The remaining €7 billion was announced during the final pledging event in Johannesburg on 21 November.

“Several European institutions also signalled plans to increase renewable-energy investments by 2030, amounting to an additional €4 billion, demonstrating long-term commitment beyond the current campaign”, the statement reads.

The EU confirmed that the new financing commitments fall under the Global Gateway strategy, particularly the Africa-Europe Green Energy Initiative, which supports renewable energy generation projects, modern electricity grids, and regional power-trade infrastructure across the continent.",https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Nigerias-energy-transition-1.png,N,,2025-11-23 19:58:34.754197

The deal represents a 63% reduction in upfront costs compared to the $3,993 down payment Tesla required earlier this year. For a vehicle delivering 363 miles of range and premium features that once cost substantially more to lease, the new terms signal how dramatically the post-subsidy EV market has shifted.

Model 3 Premium Delivers Serious Value at $299 Monthly

The Model 3 Premium RWD now leasing for $299 per month isn’t a stripped-down base model. This is the same vehicle Tesla marketed as the Long Range RWD through most of 2025, offering 363 miles of EPA-estimated range and acceleration from 0-60 mph in 4.9 seconds.

Standard equipment includes heated and ventilated front seats, a panoramic glass roof, premium audio with 17 speakers, and Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) hardware. The rear features a touchscreen display for passengers, customizable ambient lighting throughout the cabin, and power-folding heated side mirrors.

Tesla’s Autopilot driver assistance system comes standard, providing automatic steering, acceleration, and braking within marked lanes under driver supervision.

The lease terms require $1,500 due at signing for a 36-month contract with 10,000 miles annually, plus a $695 acquisition fee and first month’s payment. That brings the total initial outlay to roughly $2,494 before taxes.

Pricing Whiplash: From $249 to $529 and Back to $299

Tesla’s Model 3 lease pricing has experienced wild swings throughout 2025 as the company adapted to shifting market conditions and the looming expiration of federal subsidies.

In February 2025, according to CarsDirect, Tesla briefly offered the Model 3 for $249 per month with $3,943 down. That deal made the electric sedan cheaper to lease than a Honda Civic.

By March, Tesla raised the monthly payment back to $299 with $3,993 down. The automaker maintained those terms through the summer as consumers rushed to purchase EVs before the September 30 tax credit expiration.

October brought sticker shock. After the tax credit disappeared, Tesla initially raised Model 3 lease prices to between $409 and $529 per month, representing increases of up to 23% as the company attempted to offset lost subsidy revenue.

Now Tesla has reversed course, dropping both the monthly payment and slashing the down payment by nearly two-thirds.

The Math Tesla Doesn’t Want You to Calculate

The current $299 monthly deal with $1,500 down works out to an effective monthly cost of approximately $340 when spreading the down payment over 36 months.

Compare that to the February offer: $249 monthly with $3,943 down produced an effective monthly cost of $359. Tesla’s current deal is actually $19 per month cheaper despite the higher advertised monthly payment.

But here’s the critical detail. When Tesla offered $299 monthly in the summer of 2025, lessees received a $7,500 federal tax credit that the leasing bank claimed and passed through as reduced payments. Tesla didn’t absorb those costs.

Without that subsidy, Tesla is now eating roughly $208 per month in reduced revenue ($7,500 divided by 36 months) compared to what the federal government was subsidizing just two months ago. The reduced down payment represents another $69 monthly loss when amortized over the lease term.

Tesla is essentially recreating the economics that existed when federal tax credits were available, but doing it with company money instead of taxpayer dollars.

Post-Subsidy Reality Hits Hard

The federal $7,500 EV tax credit for new vehicles and $4,000 credit for used EVs expired September 30, 2025, eliminated by legislation that accelerated an end date originally set for 2032.

The market impact has been severe. According to market analysis firm Omdia, October 2025 EV sales dropped 24% compared to September, falling from 98,289 units to just 74,897 units in a single month.

Tesla managed to report record third-quarter deliveries of 497,099 vehicles by capitalizing on the pre-expiry rush. But CEO Elon Musk warned of rough quarters ahead during July earnings calls, acknowledging that the tax credit elimination would make EVs effectively $7,500 more expensive for buyers.

General Motors announced layoffs of more than 3,400 workers across battery plants and EV facilities in late October. Ford halted F-150 Lightning production indefinitely. The entire industry is recalibrating for a market without the federal support that drove much of the recent EV sales growth.

Competition from Tesla’s Own Used Inventory

Tesla faces pressure not just from reduced consumer demand but from a flood of off-lease vehicles returning to market.

Nearly 1 million EVs were leased between 2022 and early 2025 under favorable terms created by a tax code loophole. Those leases qualified as commercial sales, allowing banks to claim the $7,500 credit and pass savings to consumers through reduced monthly payments.

The loophole caused EV lease rates to skyrocket from 15% of transactions in 2022 to 67% by March 2025, according to Cox Automotive. Now those leases are maturing, with 123,000 vehicles returning in 2025 alone.

A Model 3 leased for 36 months returns to market with roughly 36,000 miles and typically prices between $25,000 and $30,000. That’s 20-30% below new vehicle pricing and creates direct competition for Tesla’s new car sales.

EVXL’s Take

Tesla’s lease pricing gymnastics reveal an uncomfortable truth about the EV industry that legacy automakers and startup EV makers don’t want to acknowledge: the entire market was built on a foundation of government subsidies that disguised the real economics of electric vehicle ownership.

We’ve been tracking this story for months. When Tesla eliminated the down payment on Model Y leases just last week, we noted the company was absorbing roughly $3,000 in upfront costs plus free upgrades to maintain competitive pricing. Now we’re seeing the same strategy extend to the Model 3.

The pattern is clear: Tesla initially raised prices by up to 23% when the tax credit expired in October, discovered that consumers wouldn’t pay those rates, and has now reversed course by essentially subsidizing its own vehicles to the tune of $200+ per month per lease.

This isn’t sustainable long-term business strategy. It’s panic.

As we reported when Trump touted a vehicle loan interest deduction that replaced the tax credit, the new policy provides a fraction of the financial support the eliminated credit delivered. A loan interest deduction might save buyers $500-$1,000 annually. The tax credit provided $7,500 upfront.

Tesla’s third-quarter performance, which we analyzed in our October earnings coverage, showed record deliveries built entirely on pulled-forward demand before the subsidy expired. Q4 and 2026 will reveal whether Tesla can maintain volume without either federal subsidies or company-funded subsidies eating into margins.

The flood of returning lease vehicles we documented in our July coverage of the used EV market adds another pressure point. Why lease a new Model 3 for $299 monthly when you can buy a three-year-old one for $25,000 and own it outright?

Here’s what Tesla won’t say publicly: the $299 lease with $1,500 down is probably losing money on every transaction when accounting for the subsidies Tesla is now self-funding. The company is betting that maintaining sales volume and market share matters more than per-unit profitability right now.

That might be correct if Tesla can sustain losses long enough to force competitors out of the EV market entirely. But it’s a brutally expensive strategy when you’re already dealing with falling regulatory credit revenue, rising competition from Chinese manufacturers, and the reality that your core product just became 15-20% more expensive overnight due to policy changes.

The Model 3 lease deal is aggressive. It’s also desperate. And it confirms everything we’ve been saying about subsidy dependency in the EV market since the tax credit expiration was first proposed.

Six months from now, we’ll see whether Tesla’s bet on absorbing these costs pays off or whether the company joins the rest of the industry in scaling back EV production and refocusing on hybrid vehicles that don’t require government support to achieve market-competitive pricing.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img_8862-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 18:59:15.418830

On Wednesday November 19, the Town of Lansing Board withdrew its proposed moratorium (presumably aimed at the proposed TeraWulf data center) on large scale development. The issue was first brought forward at a board meeting in September. The moratorium was extensively discussed by both the board and public and has been reported by local media. There was at least one previous public hearing on October 15, with speakers both pro and con airing their points of view. Another public hearing was set for November 19. Then on November 14, the town announced that the public hearing was cancelled, and that a motion to withdraw the moratorium would be on the agenda.

TeraWulf had threatened legal action if the moratorium was passed. Note that the proposed data center would at peak capacity draw enough electricity to power over 200,000 homes, according to calculations by associate professor of environmental engineering at Rice University, Daniel Cohan as reported in an article from CBS, Austin Texas. I spoke at the board meeting last week on my own behalf after the moratorium was withdrawn, urging the board to reconsider a moratorium on large-scale developments. I noted that it would put a huge demand on our power grid when we are currently falling behind the pace to reach our state’s mandated goal of producing 70% of our electricity by the year 2030 without producing climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions. I noted also that it would be vital to have strict noise standards to prevent noise pollution locally and across the lake, and that to prevent degradation of aquatic life it would be necessary to screen the water intake and return the water cooled sufficiently to prevent harmful blooms of algae in the lake. Note that this data center is just one of thousands being proposed and built around the world. We know that greenhouse gas emissions do cause global warming, which in turn increase severe heat, fires, droughts, crop losses, hurricanes, floods, loss of glaciers and polar ice, rising sea levels with loss of coastlines and islands, loss of wildlife, severe economic losses, and mass migration. Currently, necessary environmental efforts to transition from carbon-based energy production to non-polluting energy generation and building materials are being blamed for the lack of affordability in this country. This year Governor Hochul has stopped or delayed implementation of several vital programs passed by the state legislature, with the lack of ""affordability"" being a major reason for doing so. However, investigation of these programs and clean energy alternatives (as mandated by law) show that solar and wind are the cheapest forms of energy to generate and that nuclear is the most expensive and most time intensive to get online. And the immense costs to our environment and societies by uncontrolled global warming and climate change would be vastly more financially expensive and destructive to our world, as noted by the above.

It is unclear at this time if the town board will enlist the aid of the planning board and zoning board to draft another moratorium and set of zoning regulations to limit or prevent the harm of businesses that would otherwise pollute in such a severe degree, also helping to drive up the cost of electricity for everyone. If such large-scale operations are allowed to operate in the Town of Lansing, with such huge energy demands, and with such huge climate-changing emissions, then they should be obligated to ensure that the energy that they use is clean energy, whether it is produced on-site, or developed newly off-site within New York State. Energy credits of dubious authenticity should be disallowed.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/files/styles/sierra_full_page_width/public/sce-uploads/sharing/FLG_Header_1440_400.JPG.webp?itok=eIP204m0,N,,2025-11-23 22:58:26.109715

Environment Minister Murray Watt says he is confident the laws will pass, but he’s not sure which party will help make it happen.

“It’s really a matter of whether it’s with the Coalition or the Greens,” he said on Monday morning (24 November).

“And the decision they’ve got to make this week is do they want to be part of passing historic reforms to our national environment reforms, or do they want to see the other side get in on the action and do it with us instead.”

The overhaul of Australia’s environmental protection laws seemed one step closer with the Federal Opposition signalling it is open to passing them.

But there’s a catch: Labor has to agree to a few Coalition proposals.

Because the government has an overwhelming majority in the House of Representatives, the legislation easily passed there shortly after its introduction.

But it is in the Senate where Labor needs support from either the Coalition or the Greens to pass the legislation.

Opposition Leader Sussan Ley said on Friday morning (21 November) that she would be open to her team in the Upper House passing the government’s legislation if a few fairly significant tweaks were made to it.

The Opposition wants the bill to better define what would be known as an “unacceptable impact” on the environment and, on the flip side, what a “net gain” would mean from a proposed development.

“We are up for a sensible conversation about how to get this right, because we do want to see projects with a shorter timeline than they have right now,” Ms Ley said.

“What we’ve done is propose sensible changes to the government’s laws because we want them to work for business, industry, and of course, the environment, which needs protection.”

The Coalition wants to amend the legislation’s penalty provisions for environmental protection breaches, saying the size and scope of the penalties as they currently stand in the proposed laws need revisiting.

The Opposition also wants the powers of a new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) changed to ensure the environment minister of the day maintains full final authority over development assessments.

The long-awaited, recently introduced environmental protection bill seeks to establish a national environmental protection agency and require development projects to report their carbon emissions.

However, the legislation specifically rules out a climate trigger that would prevent projects from going ahead.

The suite of legislation is more than 1400 pages and includes provisions for a federal environment minister to approve projects on the grounds of the national interest, even if they don’t tick off all environmental guidelines.

It also allows for no-go zones where projects can be denied before applications are progressed.

Environment Minister Murray Watt said the proposed reforms must be passed now after recent years of failed attempts.

The government insists that when the bill is passed, it will yield several demonstrable benefits for nature and establish a new ministerial authority to set national environmental standards.

Those standards were the centrepiece of the review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 undertaken by Professor Graeme Samuel.

Senator Watt said stakeholders broadly supported the proposed standard.

It emerged over the weekend that Senator Murray has offered concessions to the Greens on native forest logging and on removing fossil fuel projects from fast-tracked approvals under a new “national interest” mechanism in the proposed new laws.

But the Minister said on Monday that he was not prepared to go further and add a climate trigger to legislation.

“You will have seen over the weekend that we said that we are prepared to remove fossil fuel projects from the national interest approval mechanism that is included in the bill,” he told ABC radio.

“So I guess that’s a bit of a nod towards the concerns around climate change and fossil fuels. But no, we won’t be including climate considerations.”

Greens leader Larissa Waters said on Friday that the federal government needs to “pick a side” with whom it wants to strike a deal to get the legislation through.

She said choosing the Greens’ proposed amendments will make sure the new laws really do protect the environment.

Accepting the Coalition’s amendments, she said, is dealing with big fossil fuel developers who have little regard for the environment.

The Greens, who have the sole balance of power in the Senate, want the legislation to include an end to native forest logging and no fast-tracking of coal and gas projects.

But they also want the new laws to consider climate impacts when approving developments, which the current legislation specifically rules out.

“They need to pick a side, and if they want to have reforms that will actually protect nature, then they know to come and talk with the Greens,” Senator Waters said.

“If the government can’t even come at those things, it’s pretty clear they’re not environmental laws – they’re laws for business.”

Senator Waters described the legislation as it currently stands before the Senate as a “huge backward step” for the environment.",https://region.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sussan-Ley-with-the-Oppositions-Energy-Policy-Photo-Sussan-Ley-Facebook-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 19:00:06.765608

Policy whiplash, the end of a leasing era, and a crowded market are creating a complicated landscape for EV makers, and a price war could be coming down the pike. Times are very tough for EV makers, but may be shaping up to be better than ever for EV buyers.

A record number of EV leases will be returned in the United States in 2026, causing a surge in used EV supplies and therefore making the used vehicles more affordable than ever before. At least 243,000 EV leases are set to expire, and a recent study from J.D. Power projects that this figure could reach 330,000, representing a 3-fold increase over 2025 levels.

Accordingly, Auto Blog reports that an “EV Avalanche” is in store, and with incentives expiring and inventories rising across used car lots, a price war is likely to make the vehicles even cheaper than gas cars. But will consumers embrace the newly affordable technology? Experts aren’t so sure.

EV policy is undergoing a massive shift in the United States as the Trump administration pulls the plug on industry incentives. The $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles expired on September 30 of this year. “With EV tax credits expiring, and automakers continuing to prioritize hybrid powertrains, drivers may choose to ditch electrification,” says Auto Blog. “Though EV sentiment remains high, the electrification bubble is showing some stress.” Currently, EVs represent only six percent of new vehicle sales, down from 12.9 percent in September, when sales surged as consumers rushed to buy before tax credits ended.

As a result, automakers including Ford, Kia, and General Motors are cutting back on their EV manufacturing for U.S. markets. “They're explicitly delaying when they're going to bring out new models, or in some cases, pulling back models,” Elaine Buckberg, senior fellow at Harvard's Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability and former chief economist at General Motors, recently told Marketplace. “They're just not moving as ambitiously into the market as they had been planning to six months ago.”

“They're looking at this landscape where they're facing multibillion dollar tariff hits, so they really need to think about their profitability,” Buckberg went on to say.

Those tariffs are causing turmoil on the other end of the trade route as well. When the largest economy in the world is facing market uncertainty, global markets feel the impact. China’s Xiaomi corporation, which produces EVs and smartphones, among other technologies, has seen a remarkable crash in recent months, going from being the market darling to the nation’s worst-performing tech stock seemingly overnight.

Meanwhile, Beijing is fighting hard to pressure Western powers to reverse their 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs by targeting farmers in Canada, Europe, and the United States. “Beijing has levied billions of dollars of agricultural sanctions against the U.S., the European Union, and Canada, after they imposed duties on Chinese EVs to protect their own automakers,” says a Rest of World report from this week. “China has said it will lift farm tariffs only when Western governments drop EV duties.”

Despite extreme volatility in the global EV sector and a “grim” outlook going forward in the United States, there is still hope for the future of EVs worldwide. EV sales are still going strong in many regions around the world, and will continue to pick up as EVs continue to get cheaper – brutal price wars within the Chinese market ensure that prices in markets without tariffs will remain low. The International Energy Agency’s Global EV Outlook 2025 projects that “despite uncertainties in the outlook, the share of electric cars in overall car sales is set to exceed 40% in 2030 under today’s policy settings.”

Coal’s not coming back Rhetoric is one thing, but reality is another.","Once upon a time, digging rocks out of the ground and burning them to create steam was America’s best source of energy and economic growth. But technology’s relentless progress has obviated a technology that debuted in Victorian England, and coal-fired power cannot compete economically with clean energy.

So what is coal’s future in the United States?

Coal’s proponents say surging electricity demand from the AI data center boom and hundreds of millions in subsidies from the Trump administration promise a rebirth for aging, expensive power plants. But coal composes just 15 percent of U.S. electricity generation, and total electricity generated from coal is down 67 percent from its 2007 peak, primarily due to simple economics – coal is more expensive than cleaner power sources like wind, solar, batteries, and gas.

While demand growth, bailouts by the federal government, and clean energy incentive repeals may slow this downward spiral, the last large coal-fired power plant to open in America came online in 2013 and no new coal plants are proposed in the U.S.

And what’s left isn’t sticking around. Half of the remaining U.S. coal fleet – 93 gigawatts of capacity – is still planned for retirement by 2035. State regulators and utilities have planned these retirements because they know clean energy cuts consumer costs, cleans the air, and creates a more reliable grid.

Coal plants are more expensive, dirtier, and keep breaking down

As of 2021, 99 percent of the country’s existing coal fleet costs more to operate than replacing that generation capacity with new, local clean energy technology. Meanwhile, the cost of running coal plants rose 28 percent from 2021 to 2024, nearly double the rate of inflation over that time, forcing consumers to pay $6 billion in unnecessary energy bills.

This harms families in states that still rely on coal – states with coal-heavy power supply have seen power prices rise faster than those that have embraced clean energy.

Coal is also the dirtiest available source of energy. Burning those crushed up rocks spews more air pollution into the air than any other fossil fuel, releasing toxins like mercury and sulfur dioxide that cause asthma in humans and form acid rain. Even technologies like carbon capture don’t catch pollution like nitrogen oxide or heavy metals, and communities near coal plants often have their region’s highest rates of respiratory disease.

If the reason for keeping coal online is to prevent blackouts, then we’ve embarked on a fool’s errand. The average U.S. coal plant is now 44 years old, and as with most things hitting middle age, they’re getting harder to maintain. North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) data shows coal plants break down more frequently than gas, hydro, or nuclear generation with an average unplanned outage rate of 11.4 percent between 2020-2023, up from 8 percent between 2014-2017.

Third-party analysis of NERC data reports coal has the highest “equipment-related outage rate” or how often a generator is broken due to a mechanical issue – in fact coal plants are offline twice as much as wind turbines.

Oh and, Sandy Creek, America’s newest coal plant, the Texas facility that came online in 2013? It broke down in April 2025 and won’t be back online until at least 2027. Meanwhile wind, solar, and batteries have met that state’s 5 percent increase in demand across 2025.

Forcing plants to stay open with federal subsidies won’t help

It is true that the U.S. Department of Energy has begun forcing coal-fired plants that were scheduled to retire to stay open under an “energy emergency” executive order, but that action will cost consumers millions while taking away states’ rights to determine how to run their grid.

Michigan’s J.H. Campbell plant was forced to stay open past its planned retirement this May, even though the state’s top energy regulator said “no energy emergency exists.” That decision has already cost ratepayers $80 million, or $615,000 a day. Additional DOE orders to force coal plants to stay online could increase consumer costs $3 to $5 billion annually.

Other administration actions to prop up the teetering coal fleet are expected to similarly fall flat. $625 million in federal funds was re-appropriated to modernize existing coal plants or extend their life, but individual plant upgrades like this can cost hundreds of millions per plant. 13 million acres of public lands are expected to opened up to coal mining, but several failed sales of coal mining rights this fall returned bids of less than one cent per ton of coal.

And the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that even if the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s rules to cut smokestack pollution from power plants are repealed, coal generation will still fall to 7 percent of U.S. electricity generation by 2035.

EVs Just Keep Getting Better, Tax Credits Or Not

The news about EVs in the US has been mixed this year, to say the least. The zero emission movement suffered a crushing blow over the summer when US President Donald Trump signed a new federal tax bill into law. The new law prematurely killed a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs (and $4,000 for used), with the expiration date set for this past September 30.

As predicted, sales surged ahead of the September deadline only to crash in October. However, the seeds of recovery have already been planted. Though some automakers have cut back their near-term EV manufacturing plans, GM and Ford are among the automakers adopting new LFP (lithium iron phosphate) battery technology as part of a renewed focus on reducing costs in the years to come. Both companies are also excited about the affordability potential of new LMR (lithium manganese rich) batteries, too.

Just one year ago, Nissan also indicated a strong interest in LFP batteries. However, in May of this year, the company scuttled plans for a new LFP battery factory in Japan, adding to concerns that the automaker is teetering on the brink.

Nissan Rises From The LFP Ashes

Teetering or not, earlier this week, Nissan earned props for itself, and for the entire vehicle electrification movement, when the company announced that its 2026 LEAF electric SUV made the cut for North American Utility Vehicle of the Year, in the North American Car, Truck and Utility Vehicle of the Year award program.

The ultimate NACTOY winners won’t be announced until mid-January at the Detroit Auto Show, but in the meantime, Nissan is taking full advantage of the publicity.

“The North American Car, Truck and Utility Vehicle of the Year™ awards are judged by an independent panel of 50 automotive journalists from the U.S. and Canada. Evaluation criteria include innovation, design, safety, driver satisfaction and overall value,” Nissan observed in a press statement.

Nissan also enthused at length about the 2026 Sentra, an ICE vehicle that earned a Top 3 Finalist slot in the Car of the Year category. However, the real achievement is getting an EV into one of the Top 3 slots, in a competition that does not distinguish between battery power and internal combustion engines.

“The third-generation LEAF redefines what value means for a new model in the electric vehicle segment,” Nissan emphasized, noting that the starting point of $29,990 for the S+ grade is “the lowest starting MSRP for any new EV currently on sale in the US.”

Nissan also took the opportunity to tout the LEAF’s EPA-estimated range of 303 for combined highway-urban driving and its DC fast charging speed of 35 minutes to go from 10% to 80%.

Nissan Is Still Alive & Kicking

Although things looked gloomy for Nissan overall at the end of last year, this year the company’s EV sales in the US started off on the right foot. In January, CleanTechnica noted a significant sales spurt for both the LEAF and the ARIYA. The launch of the sleek, stylish 2026 LEAF in June promised more to come.

If the awards cycle is any indicator, Nissan has a winner on its hands. Prior to earning its Top 3 NACTOY slot, the 2026 LEAF also pulled a trifecta in the new “Buzz Awards” hosted by several publications under the umbrella of Valnet Auto Group.

The hat trick followed recognition from Wards Auto in September, when the 2026 LEAF garnered a slot in the firm’s “10 Best Engines & Propulsion Systems” award program.

“The advanced 3-in-1 next-generation electric powertrain integrates the motor, inverter and reducer into a single compact unit. This design reduces weight and size, improves energy efficiency and enhances driving dynamics,” Nissan explains.

CleanTechnica also weighed in with some first-hand observations from a sneak peek hosted by Nissan in September. “Driving the new Nissan LEAF, we found it to be extremely capable and well mannered on everything from city streets, to high speeds on freeways, to aggressive sprints through backcountry corkscrews,” reported CleanTechnica’s Kyle Field (see lots more details, with photos, about the LEAF drive here).

The 800-Pound EV Maker In The Room

Of course, no story about the US electric vehicle market is complete without a mention of Tesla. Unlike normal automakers, whose CEOs are familiar names almost exclusively within automotive circles, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has inserted himself into every corner of the global conversation, venturing far beyond nuts and bolts into politics, gender identity, and gaming, among other topics, always emerging on the side of white supremacy and fascism if not outright Nazism.

Right-wing extremism has been a feature, not a bug, of Musk’s public persona over recent years, though with little or no impact on sales of Tesla EVs until last year, when his effect on the company’s brand reputation finally became impossible to ignore.

Last year’s sales dropoff gathered speed during the run-up to Election Day 2024, when Musk devoted a reported $277 million to help push US President Donald Trump into office. The bleeding has continued into this year, highlighted by Musk’s new role as Deconstructor-in-Chief of the US government as head of Trump’s “DOGE” office.

With all this in mind, it’s little wonder that CarBuzz has tapped Tesla as the “most avoided EV brand in the world.” Citing a recent survey by the Global EV Alliance, CarBuzz journalist Lou Cataldo noted that in years past, when ICE vehicles ruled the roost, brand loyalty was a significant choice factor. In the new world of EVs, though, new patterns of car buyer choice are emerging.

“One particular trend has emerged: prospecting buyers avoiding certain brands for political reasons. In this part of the survey, Tesla has emerged as the most frequently mentioned brand, with 41% of respondents saying they would avoid the brand due to politics,” Cataldo wrote.

“It’s not hard to make a connection to Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, who has become a highly controversial figure in recent years,” Cataldo added.

Ya don’t say. By way of comparison, if you can name the CEO of Nissan off the top of your head, run right out and buy yourself a cigar (that would be Ivan Espinosa, appointed to the position in March). Bonus points if you can name the chairperson of the company’s Americas division (Chritian Meunier, appointed in March).",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/nissan-2026-leaf-ev-kyle-field.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 17:58:51.789275

CLTC, meanwhile, offers 20 percent higher estimates (WLTP = CLTC x 0.80).
The CLTC to EPA conversion is the most dramatic, with estimates being around 30 percent lower than the Chinese Light-Duty Test Cycle numbers (EPA = CLTC x 0.70).
CLTC fuel consumption figures are, generally speaking, 15 to 20 percent lower than WLTP numbers (CLTC = WLTP x 0.85 or 0.80).
As for EPA to CLTC, make that an eye-watering 30 to 40 percent higher energy consumption (EPA = CLTC x 1.30 or 1.40).","How can the exact same vehicle, with the exact same drive unit and battery, deliver such wildly different range estimates depending on where it's sold? The answer lies in the region-specific approaches to vehicular testing. In Europe, the WLTP replaced the far too optimistic NEDC in September 2017 for new models and September 2018 for all new registrations.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency enforces a more stringent methodology, with the EPA testing vehicles differently from its European counterpart due to different driving realities. China relies on the famously exaggerated CLTC, which emphasizes long idle times and low-to-moderate speeds.

Given the headaches created by these discrepancies, autoevolution has decided to strip away the confusion by dissecting all three standardized driving cycles for light-duty vehicles. After that, mathematical correction factors will help us come up with a unified framework that should facilitate decoding the fuel economy and electric driving range estimates better than before.

The WLTP or Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicle Test Procedure

In the continent where the modern automobile was born, the European Union adopted the Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicle Test Procedure in 2017. It was a long time coming, for it replaced a driving cycle that features mild acceleration, low maximum speeds, and long periods of idling for inflated figures. The New European Driving Cycle was born in the 1970s.

The WLTP's core objective is not real-world driving conditions, but global harmonization, which explains the first two words in its name. The Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicle Test Procedure is based on the World Light Vehicle Test Cycle, a specific laboratory test conducted on a chassis dynamometer that lasts approximately 30 minutes.

Over those minutes, a vehicle covers 23.25 kilometers (14.45 miles) in four driving phases. The shortest one simulates congested urban driving. Frequent acceleration from rest and stops are included, along with a maximum speed of 56.5 kph (35.1 mph). The medium-speed phase simulates city and suburban driving in lighter traffic at speeds no higher than 76.6 kph (47.6 mph).

In the medium-speed phase, a mix of sustained medium-speed driving and dynamic acceleration increases the overall power demand on the vehicle. The high-speed phase models rural highways and high-speed roads, lasting for a sustained period. This, in turn, means that aerodynamic drag begins to become a major factor in energy consumption, be it electricity, gas, or diesel.

The high-speed test, which tops 97.4 kph (60.5 mph), is joined by the extra high-speed phase of the WLTC. As implied, vehicles are pushed all the way to 131.1 kph (81.5 mph) to simulate motorway driving scenarios. WLTC testing is conducted at 23 degrees Celsius (73 degrees Fahrenheit). Said temperature avoids the massive energy drain required for thermal management.

During the WLTC test, the cabin heater and air conditioning system are not used. Also worth noting, the WLTP testing process for plug-in hybrids and battery-electric vehicles starts with a full battery, measuring energy consumption as the vehicle primarily runs on electricity rather than fossil-fuel muscle.

The complementary on-road test follows suit, with the subject vehicle being tested over a wide range of conditions that include high and low altitudes, year-round temperatures, uphill and downhill driving, and so forth. Referred to as RDE, the Real Driving Emissions test supplements the lab-based WLTP test.

Think of the RDE as a check on the WLTP lab results. Unlike the NEDC, the WLTP utilizes a mathematical formula to determine optimal gear shift points for each manual transmission vehicle. This makes it nigh-on impossible for manufacturers to make noteworthy software optimizations for improved results.

As opposed to the New European Driving Cycle, in which a vehicle was tested in the most basic (and lightest) configuration, the Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicle Test Procedure takes into account the impact of all major optional equipment for more realistic test results. From larger wheels to aerodynamic spoilers, the premium audio system, and the sunroof, these variables are taken into consideration by the type approval authority.

Larger wheels increase rolling resistance, whereas an optional rear wing increases drag, thus leading to different fuel economy ratings from the standard configuration. This brings us to the granularity of the WLTP's min/max rating. Max stands for the most efficient configuration, and the min rating is for the least efficient setup.

To better understand how big of a difference the WLTP makes over NEDC, remember that the New European Driving Cycle had two test phases (urban and extra-urban tests) conducted over 20 minutes at temperatures of 20 to 30 degrees Celsius (68 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit). The gear shift points are fixed to boot, and the average speed is nearly 50 percent lower when compared to the WLTP.

Even the standstill time differs, with vehicles being idle approximately 25 percent of the NEDC testing cycle instead of 13 percent for the Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicle Test Procedure. At the end of the day, the WLTP acknowledges more specifications, driving habits, and traffic scenarios than the NEDC.

The Environmental Protection Agency's fuel economy and driving range testing

An ocean's distance away from Cabo da Roca in Portugal, the EPA is responsible for setting and enforcing the motor vehicle standards for pollutant emissions, driving range, and fuel economy. Established under the Nixon administration in December 1970, the federal agency uses a five-cycle test procedure for internal combustion vehicles and a multi-cycle test procedure for EVs.

The EPA's approach to fuel economy, driving range, and pollutant emissions is noticeably stricter than the European continent's preferred testing procedure, with the self-imposed strictness resulting in a closer representation of real-world driving conditions. When it comes to methodology, a chassis dynamometer is used for testing at the National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Michigan or by the manufacturers themselves.

Internal combustion vehicles are listed on the EPA's Fuel Economy website with city, highway, and combined ratings. These ratings are derived from the city, highway, aggressive driving, hot weather, and freezing weather tests. FTP-75 is what the EPA calls the city test, which simulates stop-and-go urban driving with a cold start, idling, and an average speed of 21.2 mph (34.1 kph).

HWFET stands for highway testing, with the EPA simulating highway driving with no stops, an average speed of 48.3 mph (77.7 kph), a top speed of 60 mph (96.6 kph), and a warm start. US06 is the short way of saying aggressive driving test, which includes rapid acceleration and hard braking, sustained high-speed driving, and speeds no higher than 80 mph (128.7 kph). The aggressive driving test is also performed with a warm start.

Things get more interesting with SC03, namely the hot weather test with the AC running. Following the warm start, the test is performed at 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius) with the AC on to increase engine load and fuel consumption. Lastly, the cold weather test is similar to the city test, but performed at 20 degrees Fahrenheit (-7 degrees Celsius) with a warm engine.

Following these five cycles, the final MPG figures listed on the window sticker are calculated by weighing the results of said cycles to factor in a variety of inefficiencies. Highlight inefficiencies include the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system, cold weather, and high speed. Considering the aforementioned, it's easy to understand why EPA figures are lower than WLTP figures.

Over in the electric vehicle space, the EPA's method for determining range and energy consumption involves driving battery-electric vehicles until their batteries are completely depleted. The EV-specific test is designed to be highly demanding, consequently ensuring conservative ratings. The first step of the multi-cycle test procedure is a full charge of the battery.

Said vehicle is then left overnight in a temperature-controlled environment, which is called the soak room. The ambient temperature ranges from 68 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (20 to 30 degrees Celsius). The vehicle has to go through repeated city and highway test cycles on the dyno until the battery is discharged. The total distance accumulated during this test is the preliminary (unadjusted) range.

In the final phase of the multi-cycle test procedure, the vehicle is fully recharged using the standard charger, therefore allowing the EPA to calculate the energy efficiency in miles per gallon equivalent. The EPA uses a conversion factor of 33.7 kilowatt-hours of electricity as being equivalent to the energy yielded by a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline.

The fixed downward adjustment factor is 70 percent, and it accounts for a number of real-world factors that can't be simulated properly in the lab. From driving accessories to aggressive driving behavior, gradients, and cabin heating, this adjustment factor is multiplied by the preliminary driving range figure. This intentional 30 percent reduction gives prospective customers more attainable driving range estimates on a full charge.

Said factor is not used by the EPA to estimate the driving range of internal combustion vehicles. The estimated driving range of an internal combustion vehicle is derived from the combined MPG figure and the fuel tank capacity. The total internal combustion range has a particularity we have to talk about as well.

Simply put, the combined MPG figure is a weighted average of the adjusted city and highway miles-per-gallon estimates. The city-highway split used by the Environmental Protection Agency as of this writing is 55 percent city and 45 percent highway.

The China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle

Issued back in October 2019 and put into force in May 2020, national standard GB/T 38146.1-2019 defines the China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle for all manufacturers who sell cars in the country that prides itself on almost 30 percent of global manufacturing output. Similar to Europe's WLTP, the CLTC replaces the far less realistic New European Driving Cycle.

Primarily developed by the China Automotive Technology & Research Center, which also has a European subsidiary, the CLTC acknowledges the significant differences between China's unique traffic environment and global testing standards. CATARC researchers collected a whole bunch of data from over 3,700 light-duty vehicles across 40 cities in China to construct the China-specific test cycle.

Typical driver behavior, traffic volume, and road conditions were considered in the development phase, but unsurprisingly, the CLTC puts an emphasis on the short trip analysis method. Otherwise said, the Chinese test cycle for passenger vehicles (CLTC-P) is split between a total of 11 short trips and 12 idle segments.

A rather curious methodology, indeed, but there is science behind it. The CLTC-P reflects the overly congested traffic in Chinese urban areas, which are defined by frequent acceleration, deceleration, prolonged idling periods, and lower average speeds. Performed over 30 minutes, the CLTC-P test cycle totals 14.48 kilometers (9.00 miles) at 28.96 kilometers per hour (18 miles per hour). Its maximum speed is 114 kph (71 mph).

A clear bias for urban driving environments, for sure, and the maximum speed of the test does not reflect the expressway limit of 120 kilometers per hour (75 miles per hour). Adding insult to injury, the idle ratio is 22.11 percent of the CLTC-P test's 30 minutes. The CLTC-P is more favorable to battery-electric vehicles due to less aerodynamic drag and regenerative braking.

This explains why the CLTC for passenger vehicles yields higher estimate ranges than for the same vehicle under the WLTP and EPA protocols. Digging a little deeper, the CLTC-P test cycle is divided into three phases, of which the slow- and medium-speed phases are longer than the high-speed phase. How much longer? The answer is 674 and 693 seconds compared to 433 seconds.

The CLTC-P1 or slow-speed phase mimics heavy urban traffic, whereas the CLTC-P2 or medium-speed phase represents less congested urban driving with less frequent stops. Because its maximum speed is lower than the high-speed cycles found in the WLTP and EPA standards, the CLTC-P3 is the least realistic of the bunch. But similar to its Western counterparts, the cycles are run on a dynamometer in a controlled environment.

For electric vehicles, the CLTC-P is a charge-depleting test. Only relevant for Chinese motorists, the China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle is excellent only for those who primarily drive in extremely congested urban areas. Due to its structure, the CLTC is often perceived by Westerners as having an optimism bias.

The China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle has also faced criticism for not fully accounting for heating, air conditioning, and other energy-draining equipment. As far as electric vehicles are concerned, every little bit counts, especially in extremely hot or cold weather. A fixed, non-driving load is included in CLTC-P testing, often simulated at 300 watts or thereabouts.

WLTP, EPA, and CLTC approximation formulas for EV range and ICE fuel economy ratings

Electric vehicles work differently from their internal combustion equivalents, which explains why the approximation formulas for EV range and ICE fuel economy ratings are different between the WLTP, EPA, and CLTC. At press time, the WLTP to EPA conversions for electric vehicle range are 10 to 15 percent (EPA = WLTP x 0.90 or 0.85). CLTC, meanwhile, offers 20 percent higher estimates (WLTP = CLTC x 0.80).

The CLTC to EPA conversion is the most dramatic, with estimates being around 30 percent lower than the Chinese Light-Duty Test Cycle numbers (EPA = CLTC x 0.70). Because the NEDC-replacing WLTP testing cycle is conducted under ideal conditions, either 0.90 or 0.80 factors are sometimes used to determine the real-world range (Real World = WLTP x 0.90 or 0.80).

Turning our attention to internal combustion vehicles, EPA testing includes a correction factor for air conditioning and aggressive driving. This means a vehicle consumes more fuel during the EPA test, which is why EPA consumption is about 10 to 20 percent higher than WLTP estimates (EPA = WLTP x 1.10 or 1.20).

CLTC fuel consumption figures are, generally speaking, 15 to 20 percent lower than WLTP numbers (CLTC = WLTP x 0.85 or 0.80). As for EPA to CLTC, make that an eye-watering 30 to 40 percent higher energy consumption (EPA = CLTC x 1.30 or 1.40).

To demonstrate these formulas, we'll pick an electric vehicle in the form of the Tesla Model Y with rear-wheel drive and the long-range battery. Said configuration of the world's most popular electric sport utility vehicle nets 357 miles (575 kilometers) in the United States, 386 miles (534 kilometers) in Europe, and 467 miles (751 kilometers) in China.

The WLTP rating is 8.2 percent higher than the EPA rating, and by extension, the CLTC rating is 30.6 percent higher than what you can squeeze out from the Model Y Rear-Wheel Drive Standard Range in the United States market. An internal combustion model sold in all three markets is the BMW 330i sedan, albeit the Chinese model does have a longer wheelbase.

Gifted with the B48 four-cylinder turbo and ZF's eight-speed automatic, the 330i drinks a combined 31 miles per gallon (7.6 liters per 100 kilometers) in the United States of America. The WLTP rating is 6.6 liters per 100 kilometers (35.6 miles per gallon), whereas the CLTC estimate is 6.1 l/100 km (38.6 mpg).

The WLTP rating is 13.2 percent better than the EPA-estimated combined fuel economy of the 2026 BMW 330i sedan. The 330Li for China is 19.7 percent more efficient, but only on paper because the CLTC is optimized for low-speed urban driving scenarios.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/wltp-vs-epa-vs-cltc-why-range-estimates-differ-and-which-is-the-most-realistic-261500_1.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 17:59:05.005856

EYEING GLOBAL MARKET Already the world's largest exporter of passenger cars, China is turning its sights to the global electric truck market.","HANOI, Vietnam -- China is replacing its diesel trucks with electric models faster than expected, potentially reshaping global fuel demand and the future of heavy transport.

In 2020, nearly all new trucks in China ran on diesel. By the first half of 2025, battery-powered trucks accounted for 22% of new heavy truck sales, up from 9.2% in the same period in 2024, according to Commercial Vehicle World, a Beijing-based trucking data provider. The British research firm BMI forecasts electric trucks will reach nearly 46% of new sales this year and 60% next year.

Heavy trucks carry the lifeblood of modern economies. They also contribute significantly to global emissions of carbondioxide: In 2019, road freight generated a third of all transport-related carbon emissions.

Trucking has been considered hard to decarbonize since electric trucks with heavy batteries can carry less cargo than those using energy-dense diesel. Proponents of liquefied natural gas have viewed it as a less polluting option while technology for electric heavy vehicles matures.

Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid fuel for easy storage and transport.

China's trucking fleet, the world's second-largest after the U.S., still mainly runs on diesel, but the landscape is shifting. Transport fuel demand is plateauing, according to the International Energy Agency and diesel use in China could decline faster than many expect, said Christopher Doleman, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Electric trucks now outsell LNG models in China, so its demand for fossil fuels could fall, and ""in other countries, it might never take off,"" he said.

The share of electrics in new truck sales, from 8% in 2024 to 28% by August 2025, has more than tripled as prices have fallen. Electric trucks outsold LNG-powered vehicles in China for five consecutive months this year, according to Commercial Vehicle World.

While electric trucks are two to three times more expensive than diesel ones and cost roughly 18% more than LNG trucks, their higher energy efficiency and lower costs can save owners an estimated 10% to 26% over the vehicle's lifetime, according to research by Chinese scientists.

""When it comes to heavy trucks, the fleet owners in China are very bottom-line driven,"" Doleman said.

Early sales were buoyed by generous government incentives like a 2024 scheme for truck owners to trade in old vehicles. Owners can get up to about $19,000 to replace older trucks with newer or electric models.

Investments in charging infrastructure are also boosting demand for electric trucks.

Major logistics hubs, including in the Yangtze River Delta, have added dedicated charging stations along key freight routes. Cities like Beijing and Shanghai have built heavy-duty charging hubs along highways that can charge trucks in minutes.

CATL, the world's largest maker of electric vehicle batteries, launched a time-saving battery-swapping system for heavy trucks in May and said it plans a nationwide network of swap stations covering about 93,000 miles out of China's about 114,000 miles of expressways.

The surge in sales of electric trucks is cutting diesel use and could reshape future LNG demand, analysts say.

Diesel consumption in China, the second-largest consumer of the fuel after the U.S., fell to 3.9 million barrels per day in June 2024, down 11% year-on-year and the largest drop since mid-2021, partly reflecting the shift to LNG and electric trucks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

""The rise of China's electric truck sector is one of the more under-reported stories in the global energy transition, especially given its potential impact on regional diesel trade flows,"" said Tim Daiss of APAC Energy Consultancy.

LNG truck sales peaked in Sept 2023 and March 2024 after China eased transport restrictions imposed during the covid-19 pandemic, said Liuhanzi Yang of the International Council on Clean Transportation Beijing. By June 2025, sales had slipped 6% as electric trucks gained ground.

Shell's 2025 LNG Outlook projects that demand for imported LNG in China, the world's largest LNG importer, will continue to rise partly due to LNG trucks. It also suggests LNG trucking might expand to other markets, such as India.

China's electric trucks are already cutting oil demand by the equivalent of more than a million barrels a day, estimates the New York-based research provider Rhodium Group.

But Doleman views LNG as a ""transitional step"" unlikely to be seen apart from in China, where a vast pipeline infrastructure, abundant domestic gas production and byproducts like coke oven gas created conditions conducive to LNG-fueled trucking not seen elsewhere.

China is planning new emission standards for vehicles that will limit multiple pollutants and set average greenhouse gas targets across a manufacturer's fleet. This will make it ""almost impossible"" for companies relying solely on fossil-fuel vehicles to comply, Yang said.

A 2020 ICCT study found LNG-fueled trucks cut emissions by 2%-9% over 100 years but can be more polluting in the short run due to leaks of methane, a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide.

Modern diesel now nearly matches LNG in air-quality performance.

EYEING GLOBAL MARKET

Already the world's largest exporter of passenger cars, China is turning its sights to the global electric truck market.

Chinese automakers have kept costs down and sped up truck manufacturing while ensuring different parts work seamlessly together with in-house production of most key components, from batteries to motors and electronics, said Bill Russo, founder and CEO of the Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility Limited.

China's hyperactive delivery industry, particularly urban freight trucks, has been an early proving ground for these vehicles, he noted.

In 2021-2023, exports of Chinese heavy-duty trucks including EVs to the Middle East and North Africa grew about 73% annually while shipments to Latin America rose 46%, according to a McKinsey & Company report. The share of electrics is expected to grow, though limited charging infrastructure could pose a challenge.

China's Sany Heavy Industry says it will start exporting its electric trucks to Europe in 2026. It has already exported some electric trucks to the U.S., Asian countries like Thailand and India, and the the United Arab Emirates, among others.

In June, Chinese EV maker BYD broke ground in Hungary for an electric truck and bus factory, with an eye toward a mandatory European target of cutting carbon emissions from new trucks by 90% by 2040 compared to 2019 levels.

This also represents a step up to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to clean and sustainable energy globally.
President von der Leyen said: “Today, the world has stepped up for Africa.
In the context of the campaign, the African Development Bank pledged to allocate at least 20% of the African Development Fund’s 17th replenishment to renewable energy.
In addition to the campaign pledges, a number of Team Europe actors have indicated their intention to increase investments in renewable energy by 2030.","A year-long campaign to mobilise investments in renewable energy in Africa, led by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, has secured €15.5 billion to power a clean future across the continent, as well as additional commitments in clean energy generation and access for households to electricity.

The European Union led the pledging effort, with more than €15.1 billion. This includes a pledge made by President von der Leyen, on behalf of Team Europe, of over €10 billion, as well as significant additional bilateral contributions by European financial institutions, Member States and their Development Finance Institutions, and estimated private investment mobilised.

The campaign, organised in collaboration with the international advocacy organization Global Citizen and with the policy support of the International Energy Agency, was aimed at driving public and private investment in supporting the clean energy transition in Africa, expand access to electricity – and promote Africa’s sustainable economic growth and decarbonised industrialisation. This also represents a step up to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to clean and sustainable energy globally.

President von der Leyen said: “Today, the world has stepped up for Africa. With €15.5 billion, we are turbocharging Africa’s clean-energy transition. Millions more people could gain access to electricity; real, life-changing power for families, for businesses, for entire communities. This investment is a surge of opportunity: thriving markets, new jobs, and reliable, clean energy that meets the needs of partners across the globe President Ramaphosa and I both look forward to a clean-energy future for the continent. A future led by Africa, with strong support from its friend and partner, Europe.”

The Team Europe package announced by President von der Leyen includes new Global Gateway projects co-financed with contributions from Germany, France, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain as well as the European Investment Bank (€2.1 billion) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (€740 million). In addition, Italy (€2.4 billion), Germany (over €2 billion), the Netherlands including FMO (€250 million), Portugal (€113 million), Denmark (€81 million), Sweden (€44 million), Austria (€5 million), Ireland (€5 million) made bilateral contributions, worth over €5 billion, while the EBRD announced a separate bilateral investment of over €600 million.

In the context of the campaign, the African Development Bank pledged to allocate at least 20% of the African Development Fund’s 17th replenishment to renewable energy. Norway pledged approximately €53 million through their contribution to the African Development Fund over 2026-2028.

The campaign also secured additional commitments that will generate 26.8 GW generated renewable energy and bring renewable electricity to 17.5 million households a that currently live without reliable access.

From the €10 billion pledged by President von der Leyen on behalf of Team Europe, €3.1 billion were announced previously on the occasion of the EU-South Africa summit in March 2025, the Mattei Plan for Africa and Global Gateway event in June 2025, the Africa Climate Summit and the United Nations General Assembly in September 2025 and the Global Gateway Forum in October 2025, while €7 billion were announced by the President during the final pledging event in Johannesburg on 21 November.

A list of projects included in today’s announcement is available online.

In addition to the campaign pledges, a number of Team Europe actors have indicated their intention to increase investments in renewable energy by 2030. This amounts to another €4 billion.

A new system called K-flex allows the plant to build SUVs, hybrids, EVs and sedans on a single assembly line.

This flexible manufacturing line reduces the time and cost typically required to retool for new vehicle models.

Autonomous sleds ferry vehicle shells, sparks dart in every direction, and robotic arms as tall as basketball hoops install car windows.

Like an industrial symphony from another world, each process plays its part in the intricate choreography of Toyota’s largest manufacturing plant on Earth.

Located on a 1,300-acre plot of land 70 miles away from Louisville, Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky (TMMK) represents the future of automotive production.

Toyota has 14 manufacturing plants all over the U.S. including in Indiana, Mississippi and Jackson, Tenn., where engine blocks and transmission cases and housings are produced. So far, TMMK is the only Toyota plant in the world to implement this new technology.

But as TMMK works to adapt its manufacturing capabilities, on Nov. 18 Toyota Motor announced it will invest more than $912 million to renovate its manufacturing sites across five states, including at TMMK and its Tennessee plant. A week before that announcement, Toyota said it's planning a $13.9 billion battery plant in North Carolina.

Meanwhile, at the plant responsible for more than 435,600 vehicles and 714,400 engines in 2024, the company is spending $1.8 billion to introduce a more flexible, technologically advanced manufacturing line poised to redefine efficiency and scale.

Historically, manufacturing assembly lines have strict size requirements limiting production, but at TMMK that's not the case. SUVs, hybrids, EVs and sedans can all be built on one line, by something called K-flex.

What is Toyota's new K-flex platform?

“A lot of people think that means Kentucky flexibility, but what it really means is actually K platform flexibility,” TMMK President Kerry Creech said.

A K platform, specific to Toyota, is a shared skeleton that includes the chassis, suspension and drivetrain for Toyota-produced vehicles like the Camry, RAV, Highlander, Sienna, Lexus RX and NX.

K-flex allows for the versatility of that shared skeleton across SUVs, hybrids, EVs and sedans all on one line.

While only one of its three manufacturing lines has full flexibility, Creech — who began his TMMK tenure in 1990 as a powertrain production team member — said as manufacturing demands evolve, flexibility is vital across the assembly line.

Roughly 35 years ago, “we could only build a sedan” on the line due to size restrictions, he said. At that time, the industry was producing about 80% sedans and 20% light trucks and SUVs. But “now that’s flipped,” Creech added.

To meet evolving consumer demand, Toyota is rolling out new vehicle models. But the conventional retooling process for electric and hybrid vehicles can be expensive and time-consuming, slowing production and straining output.

So the automaker had to rethink how it builds cars to stay competitive in a market shifting toward electrification and diverse vehicle types, Creech said.

“Whether it’s a plug-in hybrid or a total battery electric vehicle, we had to have that flexibility,"" Creech said.

Traditionally, as automakers gear up for the latest model, they invest heavily into modifying the manufacturing line to meet the dimensions of the next vehicle. With K-flex, that’s not the case.

“So we really reduce our production preparation lead time, as well as our capital expense, which kind of gives us an advantage at this facility compared to the traditional, because each time you introduce a new vehicle, then you may be changing some of the structure that’s in there,” Vice President of Manufacturing Chad Miller said, on the intricacies needed for different vehicles.

While K-flex allows for adjustability among many of its vehicles, it doesn't encompass everything. Some larger vehicles like SUVs and framed trucks are too big to be built on the flexible line.

In addition to K platform products, TMMK also produces 4-cylinder and V6 engines, hydrogen fuel cell kits, axles, steering components, machine blocks, cylinder heads, crankshafts, camshafts, rods and axle assemblies and dies.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/07/PNAS/86571792007-tmmk-025.jpg?crop=3999,2250,x0,y208&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-23 16:01:22.754614

But the Greens and Coalition say they are not convinced of the bill’s urgency.
Watt has offered concessions to both Greens and Coalition demands.","Years of debate about environmental law reform have come down to a tense standoff in the final sitting week of federal parliament for the year, with Labor claiming it can do a deal that will pass the Senate by Thursday.

The government is still pushing to pass its major changes, despite not yet having reached an agreement with either the Greens or the Coalition.

The Greens appear to be inching closer to a deal on updating the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, with the Coalition still refusing to back the changes. But the Minerals Council has joined other peak business groups in urging the Liberals and Nationals to back the changes, with the environment minister, Murray Watt, pledging to make a deal with whoever will come to the table first.

“We will pass these reforms this week with whichever of the Coalition and the Greens is willing to work with us to deliver that balanced package,” Watt said on Sunday.

Greens and Labor sources said they expected the two parties could come to an agreement later in the week, ahead of parliament rising on Thursday afternoon, but the Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, wanted more limits on fossil fuel developments before signing up.

“We also want to make sure we’re not seeing coal and gas fossil fuel projects accelerated,” she told the ABC’s Insiders.

“I think it’s crazy in 2025, you’re talking about a new set of environment laws and it doesn’t even consider the climate pollution that a coal or gas mine makes.”

Despite the 1,500 pages of environmental law reform still being examined by a Senate committee, due to report in March 2026, the government says it wants to ram the bill through parliament by year’s end because it would improve approvals and build times for major parts of its agenda including housing construction, critical minerals sites and green energy projects.

But the Greens and Coalition say they are not convinced of the bill’s urgency. Despite not ruling out a deal later in the week, Greens sources said they didn’t see the need for rushing, noting the ongoing Senate inquiry, and their concerns that the bill could help fast-track approval of coal and gas projects.

Labor, in turn, is pressuring the Greens. Watt held a press conference on Sunday in the Brisbane electorate of Ryan, the last Greens-held seat in the country after the party lost three seats at the May election.

“We saw at the last federal election that the Greens party paid a very big political price for being seen by the Australian people to be blocking progress on important things like housing and environmental law reform,” Watt said.

“There’s a real opportunity for the Greens this week to demonstrate that they have heard the message from the Australian people, that they’re not going to keep blocking progress, that they’re not going to make the perfect the enemy of the good.”

The Liberal party’s finance spokesperson, James Paterson, said on Sunday: “Where it stands today, we certainly couldn’t support the proposed legislation.”

He claimed the laws were “deficient” and that the opposition would stick to its earlier demands, daring the government to “do a deal with the Greens and they will wear the consequences of that”.

Watt has offered concessions to both Greens and Coalition demands.

To the Coalition, Watt has conceded amendments to tighten rules around the National Environmental Protection Agency’s powers, while for the Greens, Labor has offered limits on the “national interest” test being used to approve fossil fuel projects.

On Sunday, Watt extended another olive branch to the Greens, offering to force native forestry projects to comply with national environmental standards within three years. But Hanson-Young wanted more for their support, saying a three-year phase-in was not fast enough.

“It’s 2025 and it’s time we ended native forest logging,” she said.

Corporate groups such as the Business Council of Australia have urged the Coalition to back the EPBC changes. The Minerals Council CEO, Tania Constable, added her voice on Sunday, calling for a “sensible compromise by both sides”.

“This will allow our industry to deliver investment, jobs and regional benefits faster,” she said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5f88623c859d21d5ea569701701c4300e9692a6/1296_0_6449_5163/master/6449.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cd656022c27e66bf91d3d0ba5da80fef",N,,2025-11-23 16:01:01.785782

Store visited the Damlaagte and Ilikwa solar power plants in South Africa's Free State province on Friday. The plants were developed by Mainstream Renewable Power, in which Norway's Aker Horizons ASA is a major shareholder. According to the Norwegian government, the company has provided renewable energy to around 200,000 households, while the two plants Store visited together supply electricity equivalent to the annual consumption of roughly 120,000 households.

While progress in renewable energy deployment has been rapid, Store underscored the need for more investment and cooperation on solar power across the African continent.

""Some 600 million people on the African continent lack access to electricity. At the same time, Africa has an abundance of sunshine, which is a good source of renewable energy. I had the chance to see how Norwegian companies are helping to produce renewable energy. This solar energy plant is serving both to reduce emissions and create growth,"" Store said during the visit.

South Africa remains heavily dependent on coal, which accounts for about 85 percent of its power production. The Norwegian side sees solar projects such as Damlaagte and Ilikwa as examples of how foreign investment can both ease the country's energy crisis and contribute to its green transition.

One key takeaway: mutirão—a Tupi-Guarani word for “community work”—must continue to guide us beyond COP30.","As COP30 in Belém came to a close, it didn’t end with a single, tidy gavel. Instead, it wrapped up as a complex package—balancing new initiatives for implementation with the COP decision itself, and reflecting the mutirão spirit of compromise across diverse voices.

We came into COP30 knowing we are still falling short of our climate goals. Yet over these two weeks, we also saw real movement: beyond the formal outcome text, countries, communities, businesses, and civil society began pulling in the same direction.

The pavilions and dialogues revealed an axis of action—solutions we can deploy now and build on tomorrow. Global ambition still falls short, but the inspiration here was clear: the future depends on how quickly we turn ideas into implementation.

Ultimately, COP30 must be assessed in its entirety, not just through the lens of negotiations. For EDF, we measure success at COP30 through partnerships ignited, finance mobilized, and voices engaged.

From tropical forests to the food sector, air quality to adaptation, here are the bright spots that EDF is building on after Belém:

Financing for forests

In the Amazon, the link between forests, people and climate is immediate. That made progress on forest finance one of the most important signals from COP30.

The COP30 Presidency formally launched the Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF) with an initial multibillion-dollar pledge from over 50 countries, including Brazil, Indonesia, Norway, Germany, and France. The goal is to provide long-term, reliable finance for countries that keep their tropical forests standing, with a dedicated share (20 percent) of funding for Indigenous Peoples and local communities.

EDF also helped launch the J-REDD+ Coalition, a new effort to help countries to bring high-integrity jurisdictional forest credits to market, and to ensure that the benefits reach the people who are keeping forests standing – from the Amazon to other critical forest regions around the world.

Finally, the COP30 Presidency announced that it plans to draft a roadmap to halt and reverse deforestation, to be presented this time next year. While this roadmap was not included in the formal COP decision, it nonetheless will have the potential to set out a pathway for timely and urgent actions.

Wildfire resilience

Belém also elevated one of the fastest-growing climate risks in forest regions: wildfire.

EDF and partners launched the Wildfire Action Accelerator Pledge, bringing together partners from 18 countries and regions have joined – such as Ecuador, Peru, Ghana, and Kenya – and more than 30 Indigenous and local community organizations. Its aim is to move from reacting to wildfires to preventing them, through community-centered approaches, stronger climate ambition and innovative finance for integrated fire management.

Brazil’s Call to Action on Integrated Fire Management and Wildfire Resilience, endorsed by 50 countries, reinforced that shift. Taken together, these efforts begin to build the global cooperation needed to keep forests – and the communities who depend on them – safer in a hotter, drier world.

Adaptation

Another clear signal from COP30 was the growing centrality of adaptation. Within the final COP30 negotiated outcome, Parties agreed to triple the support for developing countries to increase their resilience against climate change by 2035

But we need to scale adaptation solutions faster, as the impact of climate change are hitting communities and affecting economies today. Throughout the two weeks, EDF convened and joined events that framed adaptation not only as a moral imperative, but as an economic one – a way to reduce risk for municipalities, businesses and households while safeguarding lives and livelihoods. That framing ran through discussions, highlighting the need to move the market on adaptation and make resilience the common-sense economic choice.

Health and air quality

Short-lived climate pollutants, such as methane and black carbon, have outsized impacts on both warming and human health. New efforts including the Super Pollutant Country Action Accelerator and coordinated national plans to target black carbon demonstrate promising steps to reduce these pollutants, while also generating critical co-benefits like cleaner air and economic savings.

Renewed efforts to slash super-pollutants are critical to meet the Global Methane Pledge goal of a 30 percent methane reduction by 2030. Achieving this target could prevent 180,000 premature deaths annually.

EDF was proud to root our work on healthy air at COP30 in the Amazonian communities that hosted us. EDF’s new report, ‘Breathing Life into Amazonian Cities’ set out practical steps to cut air pollution in Brazil’s Amazon region and detailed the health and economic benefits of doing so. Partners used the report in Belém to show how cleaner air, public health and climate action reinforce one another.

The Belém Health Action Plan, backed by more than 80 countries, and the announcement of a Climate and Health Funders Coalition pledging hundreds of millions of dollars to climate-health initiatives, underlined the point: protecting people’s health is a powerful driver to cut pollution.

Global coordination on carbon markets

COP30 delivered an important step toward making climate policy more effective for fast action.

The Open Coalition on Compliance Carbon Markets launched with an initial group of 18 countries. The coalition is designed as a platform for governments to learn from one another and build carbon markets that are more connected, more transparent and better aligned with real-world emissions cuts. Done well, the Coalition can pave the way for these compliance markets to align and collaborate unlocking innovation and investment to cut climate pollution around the world, while promoting cleaner and affordable development.

Sustainable agriculture

Agriculture is a leading driver of climate pollution – it accounts for 40 percent of annual global methane emissions from human-related activities.

In Belém, EDF and partners put forward a plan to scale up finance and increase practical solutions for methane mitigation in resilient agri-food systems. EDF also released a survey of insights from over 150 agricultural finance institutions, finding that most view climate risk as a financial risk that needs to be managed, and offer sustainability-related products and services to farmers.

From COP30 to 2030

COP30 in Belém wasn’t the breakthrough many hoped for, but it wasn’t a failure either. It revealed gaps in emissions, finance, and justice, even as communities worldwide already face the consequences of delayed action.

One key takeaway: mutirão—a Tupi-Guarani word for “community work”—must continue to guide us beyond COP30. With that operating principle, and a coordinated Action Agenda in place, we can turn momentum into real-world impact.",https://blogs.edf.org/climate411/wp-content/blogs.dir/7/files//COP30_Delegation-MM-on-wildfire-TED-panel.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 16:58:45.412242

The most explicit statement of that came from Washington today. On November 23rd, the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) signalled that it plans to deploy up to US$100 billion to secure U.S. and allied supply chains for critical minerals, nuclear energy and liquefied natural gas. The bank’s chair described a pipeline of projects in Europe, Egypt and Pakistan and framed the move as a response to an “over-reliance” on suppliers whose terms are “no longer fair.” The important point for investors is not just the headline number, but the shift in EXIM’s role: from a transaction-support lender to a central instrument of mineral and energy security policy. It effectively adds a quasi-sovereign backstop to large-capex projects that might otherwise stall on funding or political-risk constraints.

That macro signal lands in the same week that a specific U.S.–Central Asia supply-chain play came into sharper focus. On November 10th, the U.S. Embassy in Kazakhstan released a fact sheet describing an agreement under which U.S. firm Cove Capital LLC and the Government of Kazakhstan plan to build a tungsten mining and processing plant with roughly US$1.1 billion in U.S. financing. The project targets the Northern Katpar and Upper Kairakty deposits and is structured around a joint venture between Cove Capital LLC and Kazakhstan’s state mining company JSC Tau-Ken Samruk, with Cove holding a 70 % interest and Tau-Ken Samruk 30 %. Although the commercial joint-venture documentation dates from early November, the diplomatic framing over the past two weeks makes it clear this is being treated as a strategic tungsten reserve play aimed at diluting Chinese dominance in a metal that is central to armour-piercing munitions, drill bits, and high-temperature alloys.

Here are 2 interviews with Cove Capital’s Pini Althaus on the tungsten deal that Jack Lifton and I did on Wednesday:

FYI: Market pricing is starting to reflect that renewed focus on tungsten. Chinese data show wolframite concentrate at about RMB 325,000 per tonne and ammonium paratungstate (APT) around RMB 482,000 per tonne as of November 19th, up sharply from levels seen earlier this year (Source).

Across the Atlantic, the United Kingdom chose the same fortnight to formalise its own critical minerals strategy. This weekend (November 22-23rd), the government published a plan that targets 10% of domestic demand from U.K. production and 20% from recycling by 2035, and – more importantly – sets a hard ceiling so that no more than 60 % of any one critical mineral comes from a single foreign supplier (Source). The strategy is backed by up to £50 million in new funding and explicitly highlights lithium and tungsten assets in Cornwall, positioning them as European-scale resources for batteries and defence-grade alloys (Source). At present the U.K. sources only about 6% of its critical-mineral needs domestically, so the targets are ambitious and will require accelerated permitting, recycling build-out and midstream processing capacity, not just new mines.

In Brussels, the European Union spent the week of November 17-21 convening Raw Materials Week 2025, the annual gathering of policymakers, industry and financiers. This year’s programme, built around the theme “Choose Europe,” focused on implementation of the EU Critical Raw Materials Act and previewed a forthcoming “ResourceEU” platform, scheduled for announcement on December 3rd, which will act as a matchmaking and risk-sharing mechanism for raw-materials investments, storage and offtake (Source). One notable side-event on November 19th highlighted Canada–EU cooperation in raw materials, underscoring how Ottawa is positioning Canadian critical-mineral assets as part of a transatlantic security-of-supply architecture (Source). The direction of travel is clear: Europe is trying to solve its raw-materials exposure with institutional architecture – regulation, joint platforms and cross-border partnerships – rather than relying predominantly on national industrial strategies.

While policy makers were re-drawing the strategic map, capital markets were reminding participants that bottlenecks and policy risk can still dominate the narrative, even when they sit in relatively small corners of the periodic table. Recent volatility in niche rare earth products, including yttrium oxide, has been less about fundamentals and more about Chinese export licensing, U.S.–China tariff tensions, and the way thin markets amplify regulatory signals. The episode has been a useful stress test: it reinforced that supply-chain vulnerability is real, but also that not every price spike reflects a durable shift in underlying demand.

It is important, however, to separate signal from noise. Industry experts continue to push back on headlines that frame yttrium as an irreplaceable semiconductor input, noting that substitutes exist in many applications and that a large share of demand is outside the chip sector entirely. By contrast, more mainstream benchmarks such as neodymium and praseodymium-neodymium oxide have been comparatively stable in recent weeks, with modest firming rather than explosive moves. The capital markets takeaway is less about chasing spot moves and more about recognising where genuine structural tightness exists versus where liquidity and regulation are doing most of the work.

Lithium, in contrast, offered a clear reminder of how quickly regulatory action can whipsaw speculative positioning in a mainstream battery metal. On November 21st, the most-traded lithium carbonate contract on the Guangzhou Futures Exchange hit its daily limit down after a strong run-up, following exchange moves to raise transaction fees and tighten position limits for certain traders. At the same time, reports that Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) is preparing to restart the Jianxiawo lithium mine in Yichun, with meaningful incremental supply, added a fundamental reason for speculative length to come out of the market. The sequence underscored how exchange rules, not only supply-demand forecasts, can drive short-term price action in critical minerals futures.

Equity markets across the lithium value chain reflected that tension between long-term demand optimism and near-term volatility. On November 17th, Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) led the S&P 500 after commentary from a major competitor pointed to strong expected lithium demand growth in 2026, citing grid-scale storage and AI-driven data-centre loads as key drivers. The same session saw outsized percentage gains across several peers, including Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE: SQM; Santiago Stock Exchange: SQM-B, SQM-A), Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE: LAC | TSX: LAC), Lithium Argentina AG (NYSE: LAR | TSX: LAR), and Sigma Lithium Corporation (NASDAQ: SGML | TSXV: SGML). Since then, trading in these names has remained choppy: most have bounced off their lows, but they continue to trade at substantial discounts to 2022–2023 peaks, reflecting both uncertainty about the next leg of the price cycle and a more disciplined attitude toward growth assumptions.

Investor positioning is also responding to a growing perception that rare earths now offer more policy-backstopped upside than lithium. Reporting over the past week highlighted that Australian investor Gina Rinehart has been reducing positions in several lithium names, including Albemarle Corporation, Lithium Americas Corp., Lithium Argentina AG and Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A., while significantly increasing her stake in MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP). MP Materials, a key U.S. producer of rare earth oxides that is developing downstream magnet capacity, has benefited from U.S. Department of Defense support and government-linked offtake frameworks. That rotation is a concrete example of capital following the perceived direction of government guarantees and long-term procurement, rather than simply tracking spot commodity moves.

Against this backdrop, broader commodity benchmarks have been relatively subdued but broadly supportive. As of November 21st, the S&P GSCI Copper Index was up roughly 24% year-to-date and the S&P GSCI North American Copper Index had gained about 25% year-to-date, while the headline S&P GSCI composite index was essentially flat over the prior month, with only marginal week-on-week movement. In other words, the sharper moves investors are observing in selected critical mineral equities are not part of a broad-based commodity super cycle, but are instead being driven by sector specific policy decisions, technology shifts and capital allocation themes (tracking government investments) rather than an across-the-board surge in critical mineral prices.

Taken together, the last two weeks show three converging trends. First, state-backed finance is scaling up: the EXIM commitment, the U.K.’s targeted funds and the EU’s forthcoming ResourceEU platform all point toward a more interventionist model in which public balance sheets are actively used to de-risk critical-mineral projects. Second, security-driven partnerships such as the Cove Capital LLC–Tau-Ken Samruk tungsten joint venture in Kazakhstan are becoming central tools of bilateral diplomacy, not just commercial ventures, with tungsten prices moving accordingly. Third, market microstructure – particularly in thinly traded or policy-sensitive materials like yttrium oxide and lithium futures – is increasingly where geopolitical risk is first reflected, often with price moves that far exceed underlying fundamental shifts.

,Clean Energy ,2025-11-23 19:28:04+00:00,the Guardian,We delivered a clear message at Cop30: the delayers and defeatists are losing the climate fight,"Ed Miliband, www.theguardian.com, ed-miliband",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/23/cop30-ed-miliband-climate-change-brazil-conference-clean-energy,"We went to Cop because working with other countries to tackle the climate crisis is the only way to protect our home and way of life.
And Brazil will launch a roadmap to help countries transition away from fossil fuels and scale up clean energy.
Last year, countries agreed that, by 2035, we would need to mobilise at least $300bn (£230bn) of climate finance annually for developing countries.
The message coming out of Belém was clear: despite the noise, clean energy and climate action remain the foundation on which the global economy is being remade and rebuilt.
We are up against the march of time and massive global forces that would slow down or stop action.","Sweaty, maddening, sleepless. That’s what it was like to be part of Cop30 in Brazil. And yet more than 190 countries came together in the rainforest of the Amazon and reaffirmed their faith in multilateralism, the Paris agreement and the need to redouble our efforts to keep global warming to 1.5C.

We went to Cop because working with other countries to tackle the climate crisis is the only way to protect our home and way of life. We know the UK produces just 1% of emissions, which is why, as the prime minister said in Belém, our government is “all-in” on working with others to reduce the remaining 99%.

We also know there are huge opportunities from driving the transition forward, which is why in Britain we are making historic investments in renewables and nuclear, upgrading millions of homes, and acting to protect nature.

It is true that Britain wanted more from this Cop, including details of how we would speed up the global energy transition through an agreement that explicitly pledged a roadmap for the transition away from fossil fuels. This didn’t happen because some countries would not agree.

Yet on this issue, we have seen the emergence of an impressive coalition of 83 countries from the global north and global south, backed by more than 140 global businesses and civil society groups. And Brazil will launch a roadmap to help countries transition away from fossil fuels and scale up clean energy.

This offers such an important lesson: that detailed negotiations matter, but the movements we build around them profoundly influence what can be delivered. The roadmap to achieve our goal to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030 offers the same opportunity to drive forward our global efforts to tackle the nature and climate crises together.

There is also a larger picture here. This year’s summit was a test of whether, at a time of political challenge, countries would keep working together on the greatest collective threat we face or, with the US stepping out of the Paris agreement, there might be a domino effect of others departing. For all the challenges, countries chose the path of cooperation.

Cop30 therefore forms part of the long history of these negotiations that have seen the world change its trajectory from 4C of warming around a decade ago to 2.3- 2.5C. Despite that progress, our goal is 1.5C for a reason – because the science is clear that every fraction of a degree matters in limiting the impacts people will face here and around the world. That is why it is important that the world has pledged to enhance efforts to meet it through the Belém Mission to 1.5 and Global Implementation Accelerator.

Ambition on emissions reduction goes hand-in-hand with finance to make that possible, including for developing countries. Last year, countries agreed that, by 2035, we would need to mobilise at least $300bn (£230bn) of climate finance annually for developing countries. This year, as a core part of our fight against climate change, we agreed that this finance needs to be targeted at aiming to treble the support to building resilience to climate impacts.

Our Brazilian hosts were determined to make this the implementation Cop – and much progress was made outside the negotiating halls. This was, of course, the first Cop in the Amazon, and the UK was proud to work with Brazil in the two years running up to the summit to help it develop the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which offers an incredibly inspiring solution to global deforestation.

We also worked alongside Brazil and many others on the Global Climate Action Agenda, which is about building the coalitions spanning governments, businesses, cities and civil society needed to accelerate action on the ground – on issues from reducing methane emissions and phasing out coal, to unlocking investment in clean energy.

Thousands of British businesses were involved in these initiatives. Our researchers, universities, mayors and others were also deeply engaged on climate issues at this Cop. And the UK was key to delivering the final outcomes of this summit, because of our record of climate leadership at home and abroad, as well as the extraordinary skill and determination of our civil service.

The message coming out of Belém was clear: despite the noise, clean energy and climate action remain the foundation on which the global economy is being remade and rebuilt. We are up against the march of time and massive global forces that would slow down or stop action. In the face of this opposition, multilateralism is our best hope. For all its flaws, Cop has reaffirmed the belief of the vast majority of the world in this ideal. Those who would deny or prevent action are not winning the argument, they are losing.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69740a9d89bde0ff514cbcae015ec5c1aa1bf5e4/191_0_3450_2761/master/3450.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=07aa7d3f1e8a22499de2083f9e751a50",N,,2025-11-23 16:00:55.322849

,American Energy,2025-11-23 19:01:46+00:00,The Motley Fool,Should You Buy Oklo While It's Below $110? | The Motley Fool,"Courtney Carlsen, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/11/23/should-you-buy-oklo-while-its-below-110/,"This is where Oklo (OKLO +0.19%) seeks its opportunity.
Oklo is developing advanced nuclear technology Oklo develops advanced fission power plants known as Aurora powerhouses.
Under the program, Oklo will build and operate three fuel-fabrication facilities to ensure a domestic supply of advanced nuclear fuel.
Is Oklo stock a buy today?
If it can accomplish all of this and streamline the development of future powerhouses, Oklo could be a force in the nuclear power space.","Nuclear power is making a comeback. In recent years, numerous countries have come together to sign the Declaration to Triple Nuclear Energy by 2050. This initiative has also gained the support of several financial institutions. Meanwhile, in the U.S., rising electricity demands are making nuclear energy a top priority.

Nuclear power is appealing because it's scalable, reliable, always-on, and zero-carbon. The nuclear buildout had stalled for several years, but things are turning around. Under U.S. President Donald Trump, the U.S. is aiming to ""unleash American energy,"" and investing in nuclear energy is part of this plan.

This is where Oklo (OKLO +0.19%) seeks its opportunity. The nuclear power start-up has the backing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Not only that, but the current U.S. Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, is a former Oklo board member.

Oklo stock has surged, up 347% over the past year. But more recently, the stock has faced some selling pressure and is 52% below its all-time high from one month ago. With the stock well below $110 per share, is now a good time to buy? Let's dive into the business and its outlook to find out.

Oklo is developing advanced nuclear technology

Oklo develops advanced fission power plants known as Aurora powerhouses. It does not currently have a commercially operating business. Instead, it is working on research and development, obtaining Nuclear Regulatory Commission certifications, and securing more customers for its next-generation nuclear plant technology.

Its Aurora powerhouses utilize metal-fueled fast-reactor technology based on the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II, which operated for 30 years at the Argonne National Laboratory until its shutdown in 1994.

Its powerhouses are initially designed to produce 15 MWe and 75 MWe, with plans to expand to 100 MWe and beyond. These reactors can run on recycled fuel, with the Aurora powerhouse designed to operate for over 10 years before refueling.

Oklo's long-term growth opportunity stems from surging power demand, particularly in AI, data infrastructure, electrification, and decarbonization, which it can meet with its modular, deployable nuclear plants. As Oklo scales, it hopes to capture a significant market share in the promising advanced reactor industry.

It is working closely with regulators to get the necessary approvals

Oklo was selected by the Department of Energy (DOE) for an advanced nuclear fuel line pilot program, which is designed to accelerate permitting, construction, and operations, creating a fast-track approach to licensing. Under the program, Oklo will build and operate three fuel-fabrication facilities to ensure a domestic supply of advanced nuclear fuel.

These projects are intended to enable Oklo to build and operate facilities that directly support its powerhouse deployments and complement existing work at its Advanced Fuel Center and the Aurora INL fuel fabrication facility.

The goal of the Fuel Line Pilot Program is to create pathways for the faster deployment of advanced nuclear technology, streamline reviews, and leverage private investment alongside federal oversight. This initiative helps Oklo secure fuel for early powerhouses while strengthening U.S. manufacturing and fuel independence.

The U.S. NRC accepted Oklo's Principal Design Criteria (PDC) topical report for accelerated review. Once approved (expected for early 2026), this report can be referenced in future applications, reducing the need to re-review established material.

Watch its cash needs

It will take time for Oklo's Aurora powerhouse to come online. In September, it held a groundbreaking ceremony on the Aurora-Idaho National Laboratory (INL) site, marking the start of construction work for its first Aurora reactor. It expects its first commercial powerhouse to come online in 2028.

To fund its growth during this early, non-profitable stage, Oklo needs capital. Last month, it filed a $3.5 billion mixed securities shelf offering. A mixed shelf offering is a flexible SEC filing that lets a company issue different types of securities, such as common stock, preferred stock, debt, or warrants, up to a pre-approved total amount over time. This means Oklo isn't issuing shares right away, but it does give it the option to raise capital quickly when needed.

It will take significant capital to finance its capital-intensive own-and-operate model. If Oklo needs to continue tapping equity or debt markets, it could significantly dilute shareholders along the way.

Is Oklo stock a buy today?

Oklo has several hurdles ahead of it before its powerhouses become operational. It must still navigate regulatory requirements, build its first powerhouse, and secure firm customer agreements. If it can accomplish all of this and streamline the development of future powerhouses, Oklo could be a force in the nuclear power space.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F843799%2Fatomic-particle-for-nuclear-energy-getty.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2025-11-23 14:59:52.146522

Amazon has become the dominant force in the tech industry with investments that span the length and breadth of the world. Not only are they one of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, but they also serve as a crucial investor in the US nuclear sector. Following the recent outage of Amazon’s substantial web services, it has become clear that the company needs to develop a more reliable service for the global tech sector.

Amazon has invested in a new plan for a 960 MW small modular nuclear facility in Washington state

The nuclear sector in the United States has big plans, as the nation aims to revive the sector to ensure safe and sustainable energy for a variety of sectors. Most importantly, the AI and tech boom in the United States has revealed the less-than-ideal energy market in the nation.

To boost clean energy production, Amazon has announced its plans to invest in the Cascade Advanced Energy Facility in Washington. The facility will be built by Energy Northwest with funding provided by Amazon and will consist of 12 modular reactors.

The small modular reactors will be supplied by X-energy, which was granted a substantial investment of $500 million from Amazon. The “modular nature” of the project means that it will require significantly less area than a traditional nuclear facility.

“X-energy’s advanced reactor design, the Xe-100, will be used in Amazon’s partnership with Energy Northwest to develop four SMRs in the first phase of Cascade, with an initial capacity of 320 MW and the option to expand to 12 units with a capacity of 960 MW.” – Statement from Amazon

The project is expected to begin construction by the end of the decade

Amazon has noted that the construction phase is set to begin by the end of 2030, with a targeted completion date of mid-2030s. Amazon has noted that the project will create over 1,000 jobs for locals during the construction phase and an additional 100 permanent positions once operational.

“X-energy and Amazon, along with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power and Doosan Enerbility, also signed a strategic collaboration agreement in August to accelerate the deployment of new Xe-100 advanced nuclear reactors in the United States to meet increasing power demands by data centers, advanced manufacturing, and electrification.” – Press release by X-energy

As the US nuclear sector has seen a biblical revival that is unprecedented in modern society, Indiana has been selected for a new advanced small modular reactor energy park that will rival the Cascade Advanced Energy Facility in Washington, marking the triumphant return of nuclear power in the United States.

“This project isn’t just about new technology; it’s about creating a reliable source of carbon-free energy that will support our growing digital world. I’m excited about the potential of SMRs and the positive impact they will have on both the environment and local communities.” – Kara Hurst, Amazon’s chief sustainability officer

By Elena Bruess for Capital & Main

In early July, when most Americans were celebrating Independence Day, Bret Biggart was making plans to keep his Texas-based solar energy company from going dark. The Trump administration had just adopted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which fundamentally altered tax and spending policies in the United States, including phasing out federal tax credits for clean energy.

Biggart, who has worked in the solar industry for over two decades, was alarmed. Just a few years ago, the Biden administration had done the opposite by raising solar tax credits to 30% for homeowners and businesses — increasing interest, accessibility and market for solar energy. But now, Biggart prepared for that momentum to plunge in 2026.

“A lot of people are trying to install solar right now, because once you roll into January you won’t get the credit,” said Biggart, CEO of Freedom Solar Power, a residential solar installation company based in Austin. “I would say once that credit is gone, the solar market is going to go down by 30% to 40%.”

Solar energy has been on the rise in Texas for decades, but a dramatic shift in renewable federal policy and funding has left the industry unstable and industry actors like Biggart uncertain of the future. As a consequence, incentives that made solar energy installation and employment attractive, accessible and affordable have vaporized across the state — throwing a wrench in the growing market.

Before Donald Trump took office a second time, the Biden administration increased the renewable energy tax credit from 20% to 30%, and created Solar for All — a $7 billion federal fund designed to expand solar energy access to disadvantaged communities across the country through the administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

However, in an effort to halt the growth of renewable energy in favor of the oil and gas industry, the Trump administration is phasing out the tax credit by January 2026 and eliminating Solar for All — stripping recipients of any initially awarded funds. This includes nearly $250 million for California, $156 million for Pennsylvania and $400 million for Texas.

Experts, officials and businesses across the country have sounded alarm bells over the impact these funding and policy changes will have on the solar industry. In Texas, Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee sued the Trump administration and Environmental Protection Agency in October, arguing that the administration’s decision to claw back the money is unlawful. In the meantime, the funding remains frozen. As for the loss of tax credits, solar companies like Biggart’s are in a kind of purgatory, fighting to stay afloat for the foreseeable future.

“We have more projects than we can literally fill a schedule, and we’re hiring like crazy and trying to get these projects done,” Biggart said. “But there’s this cliff and how far is the cliff, and how gnarly it is, is sort of to be determined.”

Accessible Solar

Despite being home to one of the largest petrochemical industries in the world, Texas has a large and growing renewable energy market.

The state is third in solar jobs behind California and Florida, and employment in the solar industry has increased by nearly 30% between 2018 and 2023, according to the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. And, recent reporting by the United States Energy Information Administration found that in Texas, utility-scale solar — which is solar energy sold directly to the state electrical grid — generated 50% more energy within the first nine months of 2025 than in the same period in 2024, and nearly four times more than in the same period in 2021.

However, the state is not as far along when it comes to nonutility-scale residential installation and community solar programs, according to Margaret Cook, vice president of water and community resilience at the Houston Advanced Research Center, a nonprofit focused on sustainable development and science.

“We have little problems in Texas getting those large [utility-scale] installations and the jobs associated with that,” Cook said. “Our single family, multifamily, our commercial and residential solar industries are not as robust and they are seeing a lot of turnover, downsizing of companies.”

Solar for All was meant to help close that gap by expanding energy access to low-income and disadvantaged communities across Texas through various partnerships and programs. The eventual goal was to lower energy costs and create local job opportunities in the industry — meaning more affordable and accessible solar energy.

With the federal program in place, solar companies prepared for a huge influx of work by hiring more people to get ready for the expected increase in business. Now, Cook said those are sunk costs since none of the companies will be receiving the grant money they were promised.

And it wasn’t just Solar for All. Other renewable energy funding eliminated or halted left numerous programs without funding.

The Black United Fund of Texas — a nonprofit housed in Houston’s historic Fifth Ward — had expected millions in funding from the federal government for a local solar installation training program through several EPA environmental justice and resiliency grants. The organization had already hired instructors and started its first class. But all the funds it initially received have been frozen or eliminated, and the organization had to search for new funding.

“Trust is a big thing in low-income communities because everyone comes in promising so many things, and usually they don’t see anything directly change or impact them,” said Velika Thomas, chief financial officer for the Black United Fund.

Some of the students were able to graduate from the first class, but weren’t able to continue to the next phases, said Thomas. Those students got jobs at a local solar installation company, but the organization is still searching for more funding for future students.

The same type of whiplash left companies like Biggart’s pivoting on the spot after the tax credit ended. Originally, Biggart could breathe a sigh of relief. The 30% credit the Biden administration adopted would last 10 years, until 2032. It meant he could plan how the market would look for the next several years. But after July, all that planning and relief went out the window.

Freedom Solar is now rebranding as Freedom Power, Biggart said. The company launched a heating, ventilation and air conditioning installation business and a generator business in addition to the solar installation and battery business. Two years ago, Freedom Solar had 1,000 employees. This year, it has 400.

“It’s sort of like riding a bull a little bit,” Biggart said. “There are a lot of ups and downs in the solar industry.”

Bringing Solar Back

Before the Trump administration cut funds, Harris County — a leader in Solar for All in Texas — was planning for 4,300 projects across Texas that would aid 30,000 low-income households through the initiative, according to the Office of County Attorney Menefee. He sued the Trump administration and the EPA in October.

Initially, when the Big Beautiful Bill passed in early July, the administration repealed only the unobligated funds — the funds that had not yet been distributed. This came to only $19 million out of the total $7 billion allocation and wasn’t deemed a massive concern, said Menefee.

“But then in August this year, the EPA administrator announced that Solar for All, all $7 billion, would be eliminated,” Menefee said. “So that’s when we started getting ready to take action, which is what led to the lawsuit.”

In an August statement, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said that the EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or to access the appropriated funds to “keep this boondoggle alive.”

Menefee disagrees. The Constitution and the laws of this country don’t allow a president to unilaterally eliminate a program that was appropriated by Congress and for which the funds have been fully obligated, he said. And Texas isn’t the only state taking action: nearly two dozen other states have also sued the Trump administration over Solar for All.

Experts point out that the administration’s move against solar and renewable energy is contrary to market demands. Solar is still on the rise in Texas, especially for the large utility-scale companies, said Cook, the vice president of the Houston Advanced Research Center.

Energy prices across Texas are also increasing, widening the gap that already exists between those who can afford electricity and those who struggle to pay the bills. For years, renewable energy, like solar, has been a growing solution to this concern since solar has proven to be more cost effective than traditional energy in the long term — at least for those who can pay the upfront installation cost.

In this new economy, the administration isn’t limiting access for everyone in the same way, said Cook. Solar is moving forward, but it’s leaving people behind at the same time.

“Texas has a lot of sun, a lot of land. It makes a lot of sense to do a utility-scale project in [the state]. It’s just very economically advantageous,” Cook said. “But Solar for All is for people to access what they might never have had access to without this program.”",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1500530/story_image/AP25282669678087.jpg?1763664981,N,,2025-11-23 14:59:44.865239

It’s easy to think compliance is there to slow you down, to make business harder.
There’s no headline that says, “Shipment Arrives Safely.” No TV cameras waiting outside a warehouse because every battery was documented correctly.
The victories in compliance are invisible, and that’s why they’re so easy to undervalue.
They’re deliberate habits that turn compliance from a reactive task into a built-in strength.","If you handle, store or ship hazardous materials, you’re operating with almost no margin for error. That margin seems to vanish during peak season when volumes surge and shortcuts slip in. There’s already a fallout. Cargo fires tied to undeclared or mislabeled dangerous goods are climbing in maritime shipping, pushing carriers to turn to AI for detection. Aviation regulators keep logging lithium battery smoke and fire events. These aren't isolated incidents, but why do they keep happening?

On the surface, the reasons seem obvious: mislabeling, sloppy storage, and missing documentation. Nevertheless, this negligence leads to full-blown emergencies that significantly threaten public safety.

What compliance really means

Hazard compliance is often seen as dull or boring, nothing more than printing the right label. Just another round of hoops to jump through because some regulator said so. It’s easy to think compliance is there to slow you down, to make business harder. And the hardest part is this: you rarely see the disasters you prevent. There’s no headline that says, “Shipment Arrives Safely.” No TV cameras waiting outside a warehouse because every battery was documented correctly. The victories in compliance are invisible, and that’s why they’re so easy to undervalue. But invisible doesn’t mean unimportant. It means you only notice when it’s too late.

The truth is brutal. Every label, every form, every rule is there to protect people. The worker stacking pallets in your warehouse, the flight crew cruising at 30,000 feet, the crew hundreds of miles at sea with a ship full of containers. Compliance is what keeps your products from turning into poison in a customer’s hands.

Lithium batteries have become the clearest test. They look ordinary, but one mislabeled package can turn a routine shipment into an inferno. The difference between a safe shipment and a disaster can come down to whether your team knows one UN number from another. Standards groups like NFPA have already added new fire-prevention guidance, which is best viewed as a starting line. Not the finish line.

How companies keep getting it wrong

The most damaging mistakes are often the simplest. Everyday goods, toys, vapes, cosmetics, cleaners, etc., get shipped as if they’re harmless when they’re anything but. Safety data sheets disappear, leaving employees to guess. Packages are repacked or relabeled without the paperwork ever catching up. Training gets watered down or skipped altogether, especially when temporary workers are thrown into chaos during the holidays.

On paper, none of this sounds dramatic. Yet these are the sparks that light the fires, trigger the fines and destroy customer trust.

Building resilience into compliance

So, what does success look like? It’s not about heroics, it’s about discipline. Companies that get this right maintain live inventories that map every SKU to the correct classification. They refuse to move products without complete documentation. They embed compliance checks into their systems, so rules aren’t left to memory or luck. They make training continuous, role-specific, and designed for real-world pressure, not just for passing a test.

And they build strong relationships with local fire departments so that when the worst-case scenario happens, first responders already know what they’re walking into. These aren’t expensive programs. They’re deliberate habits that turn compliance from a reactive task into a built-in strength.

Why it matters now more than ever

The stakes are high on three levels.

1. There’re risk and cost. Fires destroy inventory and shut down operations, but the reputational fallout can be worse. No company wants to see its name tied to a community evacuation or environmental disaster.

2. There’s continuity. Carriers tighten capacity after headline-grabbing incidents. Shippers with a clean record and complete documentation keep moving while others get left behind.

3. There’s customer trust. Consumers expect speed, but never at the expense of safety. They won’t forgive brands that cut corners and put people at risk.

The bottom line

Hazard compliance isn’t about boxes, labels, or checklists. It’s about the people who trust you to get it right. The worker who goes home safe at the end of their shift. The pilot who doesn’t have to fight smoke at 30,000 feet. The family who doesn’t wake up to sirens and evacuation orders because someone thought a shortcut was good enough.

Every time you treat compliance like a nuisance, you’re playing roulette with lives. And when the wheel stops, it won’t just be your product in flames.

This industry doesn’t need more companies checking boxes. It needs leaders with the guts to say: safety isn’t optional, it’s who we are. Because in the end, you can rebuild a warehouse, you can repair a balance sheet, but you cannot undo the damage when a preventable fire steals someone’s life.

That’s what’s at stake. Not paperwork. Not process. People. Always people.",https://img.sdcexec.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/nattawit-adobestock-1323129602.zqTBKs7yfw.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-11-23 16:01:05.867926

This includes a pledge made by President Von der Leyen, on behalf of Team Europe, of over €10 billion, as well as significant additional bilateral contributions by European financial institutions, member states, and their Development Finance Institutions, and estimated private investment mobilised.

This follows a year-long campaign to mobilise investments in renewable energy in Africa, led by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.

The campaign, organised in collaboration with the international advocacy organization Global Citizen and with the policy support of the International Energy Agency, was aimed at driving public and private investment in supporting the clean energy transition in Africa, expanding access to electricity, and promoting Africa’s sustainable economic growth and decarbonised industrialisation.

Speaking on the fund, President von der Leyen said, “Today, the world has stepped up for Africa. With €15.5 billion, we are turbocharging Africa’s clean-energy transition. Millions more people could gain access to electricity, real, life-changing power for families, for businesses, for entire communities. This investment is a surge of opportunity: thriving markets, new jobs, and reliable, clean energy that meets the needs of partners across the globe. President Ramaphosa and I both look forward to a clean-energy future for the continent. A future led by Africa, with strong support from its friend and partner, Europe.”

The Team Europe package announced by President von der Leyen includes new Global Gateway projects co-financed with contributions from Germany, France, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain, as well as the European Investment Bank (€2.1 billion) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (€740 million). In addition, Italy (€2.4 billion), Germany (over €2 billion), the Netherlands including FMO (€250 million), Portugal (€113 million), Denmark (€81 million), Sweden (€44 million), Austria (€5 million), Ireland (€5 million) made bilateral contributions, worth over €5 billion, while the EBRD announced a separate bilateral investment of over €600 million.

In the context of the campaign, the African Development Bank pledged to allocate at least 20% of the African Development Fund’s 17th replenishment to renewable energy. Norway pledged approximately €53 million through its contribution to the African Development Fund over 2026-2028.

The campaign also secured additional commitments that will generate 26.8 GW generated renewable energy and bring renewable electricity to 17.5 million households that currently live without reliable access.

From the €10 billion pledged by President von der Leyen on behalf of Team Europe, €3.1 billion were announced previously on the occasion of the EU-South Africa summit in March 2025, the Mattei Plan for Africa and Global Gateway event in June 2025, the Africa Climate Summit and the United Nations General Assembly in September 2025 and the Global Gateway Forum in October 2025, while €7 billion were announced by the President during the final pledging event in Johannesburg on 21 November.

A list of projects included in today’s announcement is available online.

In addition to the campaign pledges, a number of Team Europe actors have indicated their intention to increase investments in renewable energy by 2030. This amounts to another €4 billion.

The ‘Scaling up Renewables in Africa’ campaign was launched in November 2024 in Rio de Janeiro by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. It aimed to drive new commitments on policy and finance from governments, financial institutions, the private sector, and philanthropists. The campaign also created momentum more broadly towards the ambitious targets of tripling renewable energy and doubling energy efficiency worldwide, set at COP28.

Currently, 600 million people still lack access to electricity in Africa. With Africa’s population set to double by 2050, providing affordable, sustainable energy is crucial for both the continent’s development and global climate goals. Africa holds 60% of the world’s best solar resources, offering a significant opportunity for renewable energy.

Despite this, the continent attracts only 2% of global energy investment and faces challenges like high capital costs, limited investment, geographic barriers, and supply chain constraints.

Through the Global Gateway investment strategy, and in particular through the Africa-Europe Green Energy Initiative (AEGEI), the European Union is working with African partners to seize this opportunity.

It also calls for new drilling off the Florida coast in the Gulf of Mexico at least 100 miles from shore.
Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his second term to reverse Biden’s ban on future offshore oil drilling on the East and West coasts.
This is the entire California coast, every inch of Alaska, even the eastern Gulf of Mexico,” said California Rep. Jared Huffman.","The oil industry has been seeking access to new offshore areas, including Southern California and off the coast of Florida, as a way to boost U.S. energy security and jobs. The federal government has not allowed drilling in federal waters in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, which includes offshore Florida and part of offshore Alabama, since 1995, because of concerns about oil spills. California has some offshore oil rigs, but there has been no new leasing in federal waters since the mid-1980s.

Since taking office for a second time in January, Trump has systematically reversed former President Joe Biden’s focus on slowing climate change to pursue what the Republican calls U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market. Trump, who recently called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,” created a National Energy Dominance Council and directed it to move quickly to drive up already record-high U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas.

Meanwhile, Trump’s administration has blocked renewable energy sources such as offshore wind and canceled billions of dollars in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects across the country.

The drilling proposal drew bipartisan pushback in Florida, where a spokesperson for Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said the Trump administration should reconsider and Republican Sen. Rick Scott said the state’s coasts “must remain off the table for oil drilling.” California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, a frequent Trump critic, called the administration’s plan “idiotic.”

Tourism and access to clean beaches are key parts of the economy in both states.

Plans to allow drilling off California, Alaska and Florida’s coast

The administration’s plan proposes six offshore lease sales between 2027 and 2030 in areas along the California coast.

It also calls for new drilling off the Florida coast in the Gulf of Mexico at least 100 miles from shore. Drilling leases would be sold in the newly designated South-Central Gulf region, adjacent to the central Gulf’s thousands of wells and hundreds of drilling platforms.

The new designation distinguishes the targeted area from the Eastern Gulf where drilling is prohibited under a moratorium Trump signed in his first term. Industry representatives said the change was aimed at addressing concerns from Florida officials who oppose drilling near their tourism-friendly coasts.

The five-year plan also would compel more than 20 lease sales off the coast of Alaska, including a newly designated area known as the High Arctic, more than 200 miles offshore in the Arctic Ocean.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in announcing the sales that it would take years for the oil from new leases to get to market.

“By moving forward with the development of a robust, forward-thinking leasing plan, we are ensuring that America’s offshore industry stays strong, our workers stay employed, and our nation remains energy dominant for decades to come,” Burgum said in a statement.

The American Petroleum Institute called the new plan a “historic step” toward unleashing more offshore resources. Industry groups point to California’s history as an oil-producing state and say it already has infrastructure to support more production.

Opposition from California and Florida

Scott, a Trump ally, helped persuade officials in Trump’s first term to drop a similar offshore plan in 2018 when Scott was governor. Scott and Florida Republican Sen. Ashley Moody introduced legislation this month to maintain the drilling moratorium from Trump’s first term.

Newsom, who often touts the state’s status as a global climate leader, said in response to Thursday’s announcement that California would “use every tool at our disposal to protect our coastline.”

California has been a leader in restricting offshore drilling since an infamous 1969 Santa Barbara spill helped spark the modern environmental movement. While no new federal leases have been offered since the mid-1980s, drilling from existing platforms continues.

Newsom expressed support for greater offshore controls after a 2021 spill off Huntington Beach and has backed a congressional effort to ban new offshore drilling on the West Coast.

A Texas-based company, with support from the Trump administration, is seeking to restart production in waters off Santa Barbara damaged by a 2015 oil spill. The administration has hailed the plan by Houston-based Sable Offshore Corp. as the kind of project Trump wants to increase U.S. energy production.

Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his second term to reverse Biden’s ban on future offshore oil drilling on the East and West coasts. A federal court later struck down Biden’s order to withdraw 625 million acres of federal waters from oil development.

Environmental and economic concerns over oil spills

Lawmakers from California and Florida warned new offshore drilling would hurt coastal economies, jeopardize national security, ravage coastal ecosystems, and put the health and safety of millions of people at risk.

“This is not just a little bit offshore drilling. This is the entire California coast, every inch of Alaska, even the eastern Gulf of Mexico,” said California Rep. Jared Huffman. “Basically, everywhere Big Oil has been salivating to drill for decades.”

Rep. Jimmy Patronis of Florida led a group of Republican lawmakers who asked Trump in a Thursday letter to withdraw some parcels off the Florida coast from leasing. They warned that oil exploration could interfere with a training area for nearby military airbases. Allowing the parcels to go forward “would have a chilling effect on the military’s ability to test new munitions, including hypersonic and counter drone weaponry,” they wrote.

The state is also still recovering from the environmental and economic havoc caused by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill, which fouled coasts across the Gulf, said Florida Democratic Rep. Kathy Castor.

A Santa Barbara group, the Environmental Defense Center, formed in response to the 1969 California spill, said the plan puts at risk the Santa Barbara Channel off Southern California, an important feeding ground for endangered blue, humpback, and fin whales.

“There is no way to drill for oil without causing devastating impacts,” said Maggie Hall, deputy chief counsel at the advocacy group. “The risk is unacceptable.”

If you live in one of the more wintry states, ’tis the season to race and put on your winter tires before the next heavy snowfall drops. For electric vehicle (EV) drivers, tires aren’t the only thing that need sorting out before winter really hits.

As InsideEVs noted, battery-powered cars have an edge over internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles when it comes to tire traction. However, there are things specific to EVs that owners should be aware of, especially when colder temperatures take over.

Here are five things every EV driver needs to do with their ride before winter hits.

1. Get a Battery Check

EV battery performance and range are reduced in cold weather, so if you anticipate freezing temperatures, plan on losing range. According to Car and Driver, “It’s not a massive decline, but some owners report 10 to 20 percent lower range at temperatures below freezing, and generally the colder it gets the more your EV’s range will be reduced.”

If your car has diagnostics, get the condition of your battery examined. Make plans for a reduced winter range if you know your battery is deteriorating.

2. Practice Preconditioning

Using your car’s timer system or the manufacturer’s app, the preconditioning feature warms the battery and cabin while your EV is still connected to the charger.

Not only will preconditioning improve your car’s range and preserve your battery’s life by using grid power, but it’ll give you a more convenient and comfortable ride right from the start, according to SlashGear.

3. Buy Winter Tires

Like gas vehicles, EVs really benefit from specialized winter tires in snowy or icy weather because an EV’s quick torque can make their tires more prone to wheel spin on slick conditions and EVs are generally heavier than ICE cars, according to EV Magazine.

There are specific tires made for EVs that are designed for low rolling resistance, but any regular performance-oriented snow tires should suit any EV adequately.

4. Use Your EV’s Heated Features

Like regular cars, EVs behave worse in winter for several reasons. However, an EV’s performance and range are dependent on its battery’s health, and heating up the cabin before driving in winter eats energy quickly. Luckily, a couple of your vehicle’s heated features will serve you well in cold conditions.

According to Kelley Blue Book, you should “consider using the EV’s heated seats and heated steering wheel instead of heating the entire cabin. These features use significantly less energy than the car’s climate control, which can affect how quickly the battery drains.”

5. Plan Ahead

Winter is the cruelest season for drivers, and its extreme temperatures and weather affect your car more than you think. Vehicles need extra patience and kindness in winter, and EVs are no exception. Park inside if you can, allow extra time for charging and do it more frequently when it’s cold. Planning your charges and knowing the locations of nearby charging stations will give you an extra sense of comfort while you’re driving.",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/car-driving-in-winter-snow-iStock-1042936318.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 13:00:51.737561

India continues to benefit from the discounted prices that Moscow is offering to counter the ongoing international sanctions on Russian energy products.
Meanwhile, last week, Trump threatened to introduce tariffs of up to 500 percent on countries that continue to buy Russian energy.
The move is expected to encourage President Trump to reduce U.S. tariffs on Indian goods to help restore trade relations.
However, this may depend on whether India is willing to cut energy trade ties with Russia.","India has agreed to deepen its energy trade with the United States in a bid to avoid the introduction of higher tariffs on exports by President Donald Trump. In recent months, Trump has threatened several countries with tariffs if they do not import larger quantities of U.S. gas, to varying success. India, like several other Asian countries, has decided that agreeing to increase imports is the best way to help avoid its economy being hit hard by restrictions on trade with the U.S.

This week, India’s Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, announced that a deal had been made for the U.S. to supply almost 10 percent of India’s liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) imports. The agreement was made to decrease the trade surplus between India and the U.S. The two powers have agreed to a one-year deal to import roughly 2.2 million tonnes a year of LPG from the U.S. Gulf Coast. The LPG purchase price will be based on the Mount Belvieu benchmark.

On the X social media site, Puri said, “A historic first! One of the largest and the world’s fastest-growing LPG market opens up to the United States. In our endeavour to provide secure affordable supplies of LPG to the people of India, we have been diversifying our LPG sourcing.” This marks the “first structured contract of U.S. LPG for the Indian market”, according to Puri.

India’s LPG demand has increased by 74 percent over the last decade, supported by both higher incomes and Prime Minister Modi’s Ujjwala program, which provides subsidised cooking gas to low-income households.

India sources most of its LPG from the Middle East at present, primarily from Qatar (27 percent), the UAE (26 percent), and Saudi Arabia (19 percent). The deal suggests that the Southeast Asian country may now be looking to diversify its energy sources following disruptions in the Red Sea, as well as OPEC+ cuts. At present, India imports between 20 to 21 million tonnes of LPG a year. If the U.S. provides 10 percent of its LPG supply, this could equate to around $1 billion in imports. Meanwhile, India’s trade surplus with the U.S. stands at around $40 billion.

In August, the Trump administration announced it would be imposing a 50 percent tariff on Indian goods to address trade imbalances and encourage India to halt the import of Russian oil. While the tariffs have negatively affected the U.S.-Indian partnership, India has yet to reduce its imports of Russian crude. India continues to benefit from the discounted prices that Moscow is offering to counter the ongoing international sanctions on Russian energy products. In 2024, India bought $52.7 billion of Russian crude, contributing around 37 percent of its oil bill.

Meanwhile, last week, Trump threatened to introduce tariffs of up to 500 percent on countries that continue to buy Russian energy. “The Republicans are putting in legislation that is very tough, sanctioning, etcetera, on any country doing business with Russia,” Trump told reporters. As well as India, the tariffs could hit China hard as it continues to purchase significant quantities of Russian oil.

Following the agreement to purchase more U.S. LPG, Trump said he plans to remove the 25 percent tariffs imposed on India for importing Russian oil in November, while the 25 percent reciprocal tariffs will remain in place through 2026. The LPG deal is part of a larger bilateral trade agreement between the two countries. Trump recently stated that the two powers were “pretty close” to a “fair trade deal”.

In October, following the agreement, India’s exports to the U.S. increased for the first time in five months, rising by 14.5 percent from September. Chevron, Phillips 66, and TotalEnergies are expected to transport the LPG to India in 48 tankers starting in January. The state-run oil majors, the Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), will manage the supplies once on Indian soil.

In the long term, India hopes to diversify its energy sources in a bid to decarbonise and boost its energy security. At present, India is the third-largest carbon dioxide emitter worldwide, after China and the U.S.

India’s energy demand is set to double from current levels by 2045 as the economy continues to grow, yet the government has introduced a net-zero carbon emissions target for 2070. To achieve this, India will have to diversify its energy sources and significantly increase its renewable energy capacity, as outlined in the national roadmap for energy transition.

India’s new energy agreement will see it import more LPG from the United States over the next year, with the possibility of extension. The move is expected to encourage President Trump to reduce U.S. tariffs on Indian goods to help restore trade relations. However, this may depend on whether India is willing to cut energy trade ties with Russia.

Ohioans are seeing increased energy costs for two primary reasons: generation costs and transmission costs.
In Ohio, utilities like AEP Ohio are legally prohibited from building new generation sources.
If customers are struggling with their electric bills, AEP Ohio can help.
She makes like $50 more, too much to qualify for the assistance programs,” Orban said.","OHIO — The holidays are around the corner with Christmas songs on radio and movies decorated in red and green shiny colors, and while it’s a joyous time for many people, for others the holidays may be jarring.

Julia Orban is a community advocate who said, this holiday season, there’s a problem brewing.

“People are really struggling right now. I work with a lot of families that are having to choose between whether or not they pay their rent or their utilities or food for their kids,” Orban said. “There’s a woman who was on oxygen, she requires, to live and she had her power turned off.”

Orban said that woman couldn’t afford to pay her electric bill, and she’s not the only one.

“It’s been an unprecedented amount of people coming to me with disconnect notices really struggling,” Orban said. “And I’ve been trying to help them get connected to assistance, but a lot of the assistance programs that were out for different things are starting to go away.”

In the meantime, there’s another threat to higher bills lurking around the corner.

The American Electric Power or AEP has filed a request with the state to increase its distribution base rates.

The company told Spectrum News 1 they would not provide an interview but they sent a statement as a response to the story.

“AEP Ohio has requested the PUCO approve a 2.14% increase in distribution base rates,” according to AEP Ohio Media Relations. “Those rates cover the costs of equipment like power poles, lines and transformers, and pay the salaries of the line workers who restore power after storms and other outages and of those people who manage the electric grid to keep the lights on. AEP Ohio’s distribution rates have been essentially flat for the last 10 years — distribution rates like the one before the commission now are not the reason energy costs have been increasing for our customers. If this rate increase is approved, an average customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a month would see their monthly bill increase by $3.95.”

Morgan Harper is the co-founder of grassroots organization Columbus Stand Up, and she said they’re fighting back.

They have a petition and are knocking on doors asking people to attend the public hearing to testify against the increase.

“So, we launched a campaign called lights out on AEP to prevent the public utilities commission of Ohio from allowing AEP to raise electricity prices,” Harper said. “Even for people who are making decent money, they’re noticing that their price, their bills are getting up to $600, $700 a month they’re like, ‘I don’t know that I can continue to take this.”

Harper said there's also another concern regarding the request for the increase.

“Look at the public utilities commission of Ohio staff report,” Harper said. “They’re also asking for more money to be able to improve the fitness center and the executive compensation retirement packages.”

AEP Media Relations explained how customers get billed within their statement:

“AEP Ohio customers’ bills are made up of three parts: generation, transmission and distribution. Ohioans are seeing increased energy costs for two primary reasons: generation costs and transmission costs. Generation costs are those that cover electricity generation to meet a person’s energy needs — the power plants, wind farms and other generation sources that provide electricity to the system. Transmission costs are the costs of building and maintaining high-voltage lines that move energy over large distances, from generation sources to communities. Simply put, there is not enough electricity being generated in Ohio to meet our state’s electricity needs, creating an imbalance in the supply of energy and the demand for it. That imbalance is now forcing Ohio to import electricity from other states through high-voltage transmission lines. As generation supply has decreased, both generation and transmission costs have increased. AEP Ohio shares our customers’ concerns about the imbalance between the supply of energy and demand for it, and we are frustrated, too. In Ohio, utilities like AEP Ohio are legally prohibited from building new generation sources. We sincerely hope the market will respond soon with additional generation sources in Ohio to help alleviate this burden for our customers.”

“We serve Ohioans in 61 counties, and we care about them and their communities — we live in these communities, too. If customers are struggling with their electric bills, AEP Ohio can help. We offer programs to spread out the costs of electricity over multiple months, which can help families budget, and we can connect customers with programs that cover parts of their electric bill, depending on their income. Our energy dashboard can help customers understand how much energy they are using, and find ways to use less energy, which can help them save money. Customers can learn more about those programs or log in to view their personalized dashboard at AEPOhio.com/Savings/Home, or they can call us at 800-672-2231 for more information.""

“Finally, we wanted to mention that we know energy bills can be complicated, and we hope to clarify those for our customers by providing more transparent and easier to understand information on bills. We have started sending weekly emails to customers to help them track their electricity usage, and we have filed a separate request with the PUCO to create a more transparent and easy-to-understand bill. We hope that request will be approved to help our customers better understand their bills.”

But Orban said the assistance programs that are meant to help are often really hard to get.

And while the holidays are supposed to be a time of hope, Orban said her hope is for the state to hear their testimonies at public hearings, starting on Dec. 3

“There was a woman that I was just working with a couple weeks ago, she’s a single mom, she has a five-year-old son, she’s fighting breast cancer and works full time at a school. She makes like $50 more, too much to qualify for the assistance programs,” Orban said. “I’m planning and just sharing just how hard it is for people right now.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/web_photo_harper,N,,2025-11-23 12:00:56.435353

According to Kelley Blue Book, you should “consider using the EV’s heated seats and heated steering wheel instead of heating the entire cabin. These features use significantly less energy than the car’s climate control, which can affect how quickly the battery drains.”

5. Plan Ahead

Winter is the cruelest season for drivers, and its extreme temperatures and weather affect your car more than you think. Vehicles need extra patience and kindness in winter, and EVs are no exception. Park inside if you can, allow extra time for charging and do it more frequently when it’s cold. Planning your charges and knowing the locations of nearby charging stations will give you an extra sense of comfort while you’re driving.

Additionally, Car and Driver suggested that you keep your EV a bit more charged in winter than you normally would during other times of the year. “Most miles covered by today’s EV drivers come from overnight home charging, meaning many EVs can start every day with a fully charged battery,” it said.

The pesticide is a “forever chemical” — one of a group called PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances.

Today’s announcement marks the second approval of a PFAS pesticide since Trump took office, with the first approval coming just two weeks before. The administration plans to approve three more PFAS pesticides in the coming year.

“To approve more PFAS pesticides amid the growing awareness of the serious, long-term dangers from these forever chemicals is absurdly shortsighted,” said Nathan Donley, environmental health science director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “The undeniable reality is that the Trump administration is knowingly putting the nation’s children at greater risk of developing serious reproductive and liver harms for generations to come.”

Isocycloseram is classified as moderately persistent to persistent and is known to transform into 40 smaller PFAS chemicals, some of which are much more highly persistent.

Among the most concerning harms from isocycloseram is reduced testicle size, lower sperm count, and liver toxicity. While the agency found that people would not be exposed to enough isocycloseram in their diet to cause these harms, it opted not to implement a child-safety buffer to account for the fact that children are more sensitive to chemical pollutants than adults. If that safety buffer were included, as it is with some other pesticides, young children would have been found to be at high risk of those effects from dietary exposure.

“For all of the rhetoric about caring about children’s health and well-being, this administration is quick to throw them under the bus whenever it suits their polluting benefactors,” said Donley. “Instead of erring on the side of safety, we get a quick, reckless approval of a new forever chemical without any real thought given to its serious harms.”

Isocycloseram is also highly toxic to bees and other pollinators, with the EPA finding that vital pollinators could be exposed to 1,500 times the lethal level of the pesticide just by collecting nectar and pollen near treated fields. One out of every 3 bites of food we eat — and nearly all nutrient-dense foods like fruits and vegetables — come from plants that need to be pollinated by bees and other pollinating animals.

In 2024 a report from researchers at the Center for Biological Diversity, Environmental Working Group, and Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility found that forever chemicals are increasingly being added to U.S. pesticide products, contaminating waterways and posing potential threats to human health.

While some PFAS differ in their toxicities, potential to bioaccumulate, and potential to pollute water, all are highly persistent and have chemical bonds that essentially never break down. PFAS ingredients in pesticide products have been found to contaminate streams and rivers throughout the country.

As it pushed to approve PFAS pesticides, the EPA created a new webpage earlier this month to try to assure the public of its “robust, chemical-specific process” that it uses to approve any pesticide, even one that is a PFAS. This bold new push from the EPA comes directly from the recent Make America Healthy Again strategy report. Following pressure from the pesticide industry, the report shifted its focus from highlighting pesticide harms to directing the EPA to convince the public of its “robust review procedures” for pesticides.

Why Canada may need to rethink 'transition' EV | CBC Climate Change News,"Anand Ram, CBC News",,,,,https://www.cbc.ca/news/climate/plug-in-hybrids-pollution-explained-9.6987863,"Pitched as a great compromise for the environmental ly conscious yet road-tripping driver, plug-in hybrids — or PHEVs — have a few problems.
“The first generation of plug-in hybrids was not used in electric mode very much,” said Colin McKerracher, who leads the Transport and Energy Storage Group at Bloomberg NEF.
“A lot of the early plug-in hybrids that were on the market were really compliance cars,” he told CBC News from Oslo.
In Canada, PHEVs helped manufacturers meet the Trudeau government’s roadmap to make all new car sales electric by 2035 — a mandate currently paused by the Carney government.
McKerracher expects around eight million PHEVs to be sold globally this year, compared to 14 million battery electric cars.","Pitched as a great compromise for the environmental ly conscious yet road-tripping driver, plug-in hybrids — or PHEVs — have a few problems.

For one, people aren’t plugging them in.

Study after study show these vehicles — which boast an electric motor for emission-free rides and a gas engine for longer range — are actually being used more in gas mode. This means they’re polluting a lot more than a customer might think.

Critics argue this discrepancy lets manufacturers get an attractive fuel consumption rating based on ideal conditions that aren’t being met by many drivers.

And as Canada considers the future of its electric vehicle regulations, there are questions about how plug-ins should count.

Lab vs. real world

PHEVs are about one per cent to three per cent of new Canadian car registrations in the last five years. Despite being the smallest chunk of electric car sales, that still amounts to hundreds of thousands of these vehicle s on Canadian roads.

The most recent criticism of PHEVs comes from an umbrella group of environmental NGOs, which used real-world fuel consumption data from hundreds of thousands of plug-in hybrids in Europe. The data is collected in the EU as part of regulation to prevent misrepresentation and fraud, taken wirelessly or during maintenance on any new cars after 2021.

The analysis found that electric mode was only used around 30 per cent of the time, despite official assumptions it would be used more than 80 per cent of the time. Carbon emissions were nearly five times higher than projected, and dr iver behaviour was part of the problem.

“The first generation of plug-in hybrids was not used in electric mode very much,” said Colin McKerracher, who leads the Transport and Energy Storage Group at Bloomberg NEF.

Typically, they had battery ranges of 50 to 80 kilometres and couldn’t fast charge, making it inconvenient for drivers to keep them topped up. In Europe, he says, a lot of these were company cars, further disincentivizing drivers who didn’t have to pay for gas anyway.

Compliance cars

For manufacturers, the incentive to make these cars was clear, experts say. As governments pushed to decarbonize transportation, PHEVs helped meet those new standards, McKerracher says.

“A lot of the early plug-in hybrids that were on the market were really compliance cars,” he told CBC News from Oslo. “They were either to satisfy [environmentally stricter] California regulations or European vehicle CO2 regulations to try and allow automakers to comply with tightening targets.”

At the same time, adding an electric motor could allow cost-savings through the same manufacturing process as non-electric models.

In Canada, PHEVs helped manufacturers meet the Trudeau government’s roadmap to make all new car sales electric by 2035 — a mandate currently paused by the Carney government.

Under that plan, both fully electric and plug-in hybrid cars count towards a manufacturer’s zero-emissions fl eet, while traditional hybrids would not. PHEVs could be as much as 45 per cent of a carmaker’s offerings until 2026, eventually decreasing to 20 per cent after a few years.

In a statement, Environment and Climate Change Canada said the pause on the EV mandate will “help reduce the economic pressure due to tariffs” and that its review “will consider the way PHEVs are treated under the regulations, among all other relevant considerations.”

David Adams, president and CEO of Global Automakers of Canada, a trade association, said that some flexibility is likely required when applying emissions credits to plug-in hybrids.

At the same time, he warns against treating PHEVs too equally, as automakers have invested heavily into full EV platforms.

“You don't necessarily want your commitment in that regard undermined by governments providing almost an equivalent credit for something that's not the same cost,” Adams explained.

The promise of compromise

For consumers, PHEVs can represent a stepping stone between traditional hybrid cars and fully battery-electric vehicles, addressing both range anxiety and a scarcity of charging stations.

As McKerracher puts it, “So that you can still go on that long road trip, but get some of the benefits of electric driving.”

That’s the reality for Marcia Scrimgeour, a retired senior living in Ottawa.

Scrimgeour's city driving is served well by her 2024 Kia Niro’s 55 kilometre electric range, which she charges at her condo. But when she travels to a cottage in the summer, ""there's no electrical facility — period,” she said.

Canada's electric charging infrastructure has improved over the years, but forecasts suggest a completely electric future requires hundreds of thousands more charging stations.

On a fixed income, Scrimgeour says her plug-in hybrid helps her save money and she only filled it with gas twice last winter. But Scrimgeour did confirm the other criticism of PHEVs and their greater-than-advertised fuel consumption: the sudden switchover from electric motor to engine.

“The only time it does it unexpectedly is if I accelerate unexpectedly. Like, from a stoplight, if I start up too quickly, despite the fact that I've still got lots of electrical charge available,” Scrimgeour said, adding that it switches back after braking.

Scrimgeour is the ideal use-case. But unlike in Europe, there is no widely available data about charging habits of Canadian plug-in drivers. Adam Thorn, director of the transportation program at the Pembina Institute, says it represents an “educational opportunity.”

“To really make sure that those who purchase those vehicles are aware of that opportunity to charge the vehicles overnight, for example,” Thorn explained, “[and] recognize that they're really not going to get the full fuel savings if they don't do so.”

In that recent European an alysis, the authors also found the real-world consumption meant paying about $800 more than expected at the pump.

After the speed bumps

Thorn sees a future for PHEVs in Canada, which doesn’t involve completely scrapping the mandate, as automakers have called for.

“We really do think it's a key policy to drive down emissions,” Thorn told CBC News from Oakville, Ont. Pembina’s position recommends letting PHEV models count towards 45 per cent of a manufacturer’s fleet until 2030.

Despite tariff uncertainty and the dismantling of EV supports in the U.S., there is still promise in this category.

McKerracher expects around eight million PHEVs to be sold globally this year, compared to 14 million battery electric cars. What’s more, even with the loss of consumer rebates earlier this year, PHEV sales seem to be holding year over year, especially compared to fully electric cars, which are down by 28,000 registrations compared to the same time last year.

“Right now, the mood seems to be that these represent actually potentially a growing segment of the zero emission vehicle portfolio,” Adams said.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/3ea67b93-f38d-439a-aefc-c994c2d9d996,1763743894648/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C308%2C5867%2C3300%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-11-23 11:03:23.645074

The funding comes from the Colorado Geothermal Energy Tax Credit Offering, which will go towards three installations and a feasibility study.

Geothermal energy is heat energy that comes from the earth, usually from reservoirs of hot water, according to the Department of Energy. The heat can be used to generate energy or for heating and cooling by using the earth for either heat storage to cool temperatures or a heat source for warmth.

There are a lot of benefits to geothermal technology, first and foremost being that it's renewable and sustainable. It's a clean energy source, so there's no planet-warming gases coming from geothermal energy plants, which also have a smaller footprint than a traditional fossil fuel power plant. That translates into better air quality.

According to the Clean Air Task Force, a study showed that the reduction in air pollution connected with geothermal development could result in health benefits worth between $6 and $23 billion.

In Vail, a thermal energy network will be installed between the Vail Public Library and Dobson Ice Arena. The Colorado Springs School District will create a thermal energy network between new and old buildings at a high school, while the Colorado Bathhouse in Denver will retrofit two buildings from 1948 with the tech. The feasibility study is being conducted in Steamboat Springs to assess a system for municipal buildings.

Colorado has become a leader in the United States in geothermal projects, having already invested a total of $23.2 million across 40 projects.

As drafted, the rule would be much less restrictive than versions that were opposed by the Metals Service Center Institute (MSCI) and the broader manufacturing industry in the past.

Understanding which bodies of water require federal oversight under the CWA is critical for manufacturers and metals companies that are developing new infrastructure projects. More specifically, clarifying which waters are covered could reduce delays for mining projects, including those involving rare earths and other critical minerals that manufacturers need.

The draft rule aims to bring WOTUS in line with a 2023 U.S. Supreme Court 2023 ruling that had reduced the scope of federal jurisdiction over waters and wetlands. Key proposed revisions include:

Defining key terms like “relatively permanent,” “continuous surface connection,” and “tributary” to appropriately delineate the scope of WOTUS consistent with the CWA and Supreme Court precedent;

Establishing that jurisdictional tributaries must connect to traditional navigable waters either directly or through other features that provide predictable and consistent flow;

Reaffirming that wetlands must be indistinguishable from jurisdictional waters through a continuous surface connection, which means that they must touch a jurisdictional water and hold surface water for a requisite duration year after year;

Strengthening state and tribal decision-making authority by providing clear guidelines and recognizing their expertise in local land and water resources

Preserving and clarifying exclusions for certain ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems;

Adding a new exclusion for groundwater; and

Incorporating locally familiar terminology, such as “wet season,” to help determine whether a water body qualifies as WOTUS.

The newly proposed rule is intended to be a “durable” definition that would end the more than-decade long cycle of successive administrations redefining the WOTUS standard, Administrator Zeldin said.

A new report from the International Energy Agency suggests there has never been a better time to go all-in on climate tech. In comparing it with the IEA’s stance from a decade ago, it’s clear the world’s expectations about the future have changed dramatically in less than a generation.

In 2014, the International Energy Agency assumed that, absent any international effort to rein in carbon pollution, emissions would continue to go up and to the right. Even the most optimistic forecast at the time predicted a linear increase, just with a lower slope. Those scenarios essentially took the trend line from the previous few years and extended it through 2050.

Fast forward to today, and the IEA’s current worst-case scenario is essentially 2014’s best case. A decade ago, without any major changes, the world was headed toward 46 metric gigatons of CO2 per year by 2040. If countries cut emissions as they had pledged, the best we could have hoped for was 38 metric gigatons per year by 2040.

Today, if countries continue with business as usual, the IEA expects emissions will level off at 38 metric gigatons per year. If countries follow through on their pledges, the IEA suggests we’ll hit about 33 metric gigatons per year by 2040. It’s still far off from what’s needed to hit net zero by 2050, but it’s a significant shift in a short amount of time.

If the IEA’s earlier projections turned out to be overly pessimistic compared with where we are today, what does that say about today’s projections?

How you answer that question depends on how you interpret trend lines.

When forecasting the future, do you analyze today’s data? Or do you look at that data in conjunction with how our expectations about the future have changed over time? (An even nerdier way to look at it is, do you view the world through a lens of algebra or calculus?)

Put another way, will the world hit net zero in 2050? Today’s trend lines suggest we’ll miss that target by a wide margin. But if you look at how expectations have changed over the last decade, you might come up with a different answer. Instead, you might think the rate of change has increased, that we might be in the middle of an inflection point that starts to bend global emissions downward.

There are a few recent anecdotes to support the idea that we’re at an inflection point.

In Germany, sales of electric vehicles have set new records even after the government repealed incentives in 2023. In developing countries, renewables are reshaping the economies of developing countries, which were long thought to be among the last to adopt clean power. And China, which had previously refused to commit to reducing its carbon emissions, has now said its emissions will peak before 2030.

How the world views the future of carbon emissions has changed significantly over the past decade. A range of technologies have made that happen, including cheap solar and wind power paired with inexpensive batteries.

In the near future, geothermal energy and grid-optimizing software could propel the next leaps in optimism. For investors who agree, the upside could be dramatic.

For many climate tech investors, these days probably feel pretty gloomy. But amidst the gloom, there are still bright patches to be found.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1328659820.jpg?resize=1200,675",N,,2025-11-23 09:58:51.411567

We got all kinds of interesting responses. Prices could drop considerably due to the $4,000 used EV tax credit going away, or they could rise because the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs would be gone (pushing more people to the used market, increasing demand), or they could drop due to the rush to buy EVs before October and much more limited demand, or … well, there were plenty of arguments for why they could go up or down. Now it’s time to start doing some comparisons.

Well before the tax credits ended, in late February, I went and searched out some of the best deals I could find on Autotrader. There is no perfect comparison to the cars I found then, since there are at least small differences across every used car — as well as the fact that even cars that are the same model year are now 9 months older. Anyway, though, I tried to find models close to what I had found before. Let’s see how things changed. (I recommend opening the older article next to this one in order to be able to switch back and forth for more comparisons.)

Volkswagen ID.4

Starting with the Volkswagen ID.4, in February I found a 2021 Volkswagen ID.4 Pro S in my area with 27,844 miles on it for just $21,495. Looking today, here are some similar vehicles I found on Autotrader:

So, this first car has about 20,000 more miles on it, but it is the same trim (Pro S) and year (2021). The cost is $5,000 lower, though.

This one is more similar to the original, as it’s also a 2021 Pro S but it is 10,000 miles closer, actually having almost 10,000 fewer miles on it than the one I found in February. In this case, the price is still lower (despite lower mileage), but just about $1,500 lower.

This option has about 10,000 miles more than the original, but it’s a Pro rather than Pro S trim. (Big difference for buyers? I don’t know, but I doubt it.) The car is almost $5,000 cheaper than the one I found in February! And it also comes with the ID.4 Protection Package.

So, any broad conclusions? Well, you can get some used car options at the moment that have an upfront price that’s several thousand dollars lower than in February. That seems notable.

Hyundai IONIQ 5

Looking at another model, here’s what I wrote in February: “There are a several Hyundai IONIQ 5 options just above $25,000, but if you want that $4,000 tax credit, there’s just one Hyundai IONIQ 5 underneath that price. That would be a 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5 SE w/ Cargo Package … with 42,363 miles on it. But, with a price of just $19,995 before the tax credit, that’s a wicked good deal.”

So, what’s available now? Here are three options I found:

This car is the same year as the one I found earlier in 2025, is an SEL instead of an SE, and has 37,000 miles instead of 42,000, among other small differences. But it costs ~$16,000 instead of ~$20,000. That’s basically a straight $4,000 cut!

If we go up a little bit in terms of model year, from 2022 to 2023 — but, admittedly, select a car with about 80 miles less range (but also more than 20,000 fewer miles on it) — we find an option with about the same price as the February find.

And here’s a 2023 model with more range and more miles on the clock but coming in at an even $20,000.

Kia EV6

Last but not least, let’s check out some Kia EV6 options. Here’s what I wrote in February: “I found a few models under $25,000, and several with more miles just above that marker, but here’s the one I’d highlight: 26,090 miles, 2022 Kia EV6 Wind, for just $21,998. Yes, please!”

This 2022 Kia EV6 Wind has a bit more mileage on it and is red, but is otherwise very similar to the original find in February. As it turns out, the price is almost the same as well, costing just about $600 more. That breaks the trend from above of costs coming down, though.

This 2022 EV6 Wind has more miles on it but does come in considerably cheaper, about $3,000 cheaper than the February low-price find.

And here’s another model with about twice as many models as my original find but costing about $2,000 less. Again, it’s also one model year younger, but otherwise very similar.

Last but not least, this car’s price is exactly the same as the one found in February! Differences include: it’s a Light rather than a Wind (meaning 80 fewer miles of range when new), it’s white instead of grey (yay!), and it has about 12,000 fewer miles on the odometer. Hmmm.

The initiative, jointly led by the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, seeks to expand clean-energy generation, improve electricity access for millions of households, and support sustainable economic growth across the continent.

A statement issued by the EU Delegation in Abuja on Sunday said, “The European Union led the pledging effort, with more than €15.1bn. This includes a pledge made by President von der Leyen, on behalf of Team Europe, of over €10bn, as well as significant additional bilateral contributions by European financial institutions, member states and their development finance institutions, and estimated private investment mobilised.”

Von der Leyen said, “Today, the world has stepped up for Africa. With €15.5bn, we are turbocharging Africa’s clean-energy transition. Millions more people could gain access to electricity — real, life-changing power for families, businesses and entire communities.

“This investment is a surge of opportunity: thriving markets, new jobs, and reliable, clean energy that meets the needs of partners across the globe. President Ramaphosa and I both look forward to a clean-energy future for the continent — a future led by Africa, with strong support from its friend and partner, Europe.”

The Team Europe package includes new Global Gateway projects co-financed by Germany, France, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, as well as the European Investment Bank (€2.1bn) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (€740m).

Additionally, Italy (€2.4bn), Germany (over €2bn), the Netherlands including FMO (€250m), Portugal (€113m), Denmark (€81m), Sweden (€44m), Austria (€5m) and Ireland (€5m) made further bilateral commitments worth more than €5bn, while the EBRD announced a separate bilateral investment of over €600m.

Beyond European contributions, the African Development Bank pledged to allocate at least 20 per cent of the African Development Fund’s 17th replenishment to renewable energy. Norway also committed approximately €53m through its contribution to the same fund for 2026–2028.

According to campaign organisers, the pledges are expected to deliver 26.8 gigawatts of renewable-energy capacity and provide clean electricity to 17.5 million households currently without reliable power.

Of the €10bn pledged by von der Leyen for Team Europe, €3.1bn had been previously announced at major events, including the EU–South Africa Summit in March 2025, the Mattei Plan for Africa and Global Gateway event in June 2025, the Africa Climate Summit and UN General Assembly in September 2025, and the Global Gateway Forum in October 2025. The remaining €7bn was pledged at the final campaign event held in Johannesburg on 21 November.

The “Scaling up Renewables in Africa” campaign was launched in November 2024 in Rio de Janeiro to mobilise public and private financing for the continent’s energy transition. It aligns with global COP28 objectives to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy-efficiency improvements worldwide.

Africa remains one of the regions most affected by energy deficits, with 600 million people lacking electricity access. Despite possessing 60 per cent of the world’s best solar resources, the continent attracts just 2 per cent of global energy investment, hampered by high capital costs, geographic constraints and supply-chain barriers.

Redwood Materials Inc. raised $350 million in a Series E financing round that values the battery recycling company led by Tesla Inc. co-founder JB Straubel at more than $6 billion.

The round was led by Eclipse, a venture capital firm focused on startups in real-world industries like manufacturing, and NVentures, the venture arm of Nvidia Corp., Redwood said in a statement Thursday.

The round values Redwood at more than $6 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the information is private.

Redwood plans to use the fresh financing to speed energy-storage deployments, refining capacity and its engineering and operations teams, the company said.

Founded by Straubel in 2017, Redwood started out with a mission to onshore critical pieces of the EV battery supply chain by recycling batteries from aging electric vehicles and consumer electronics. With US EV sales failing to meet expectations and the Trump administration eliminating EV incentives, the company is now working to fulfill demand for clean, reliable energy to fuel data centers powering artificial intelligence.

“Many people think of us as a battery recycler only, but on top of that platform we’ve built a growing energy storage business that’s really quite exciting,” Straubel said in an interview with Bloomberg Television Thursday.

Redwood has said that adding batteries to power grids is key to fulfilling demand from energy-hungry data centers. The EV batteries it processes have reached the end of their useful life for transportation. But they’re still usable for grid-scale storage, which is the focus of the company’s Redwood Energy unit.

And while the Trump administration has ended government support for electric cars, its focus on securing critical minerals it deems essential to national security is a boon to Redwood and its business of extracting and processing battery metals, Straubel said.

“We’re a quite substantial source of cobalt, nickel and lithium and copper, all of which is domestically sourced,” he said. “From that point of view I’m perhaps even more excited about the core recycling business than I have been in the past.”

Implementation of the Critical Minerals Strategy will be reviewed, typically on an annual basis, with appropriate input from industry and bodies such as the Critical Minerals Expert Committee (CMEC).","Ministerial foreword

Critical minerals are integral to our modern way of life, from lithium in the smartphones we rely on to Rare Earth Elements (REEs) in the permanent magnets that drive the wind turbines and electric vehicles which will help power the green transition. These vital metals and minerals are used in communications, critical infrastructure, defence, renewable energy, transport and life sciences. Without them, our lives would grind to a halt. Industries would shut down overnight and communities would not be able to function.

In the UK alone, we anticipate that between now and 2035 yearly demand for copper will almost double, while demand for lithium will increase by 1,100%. As economies across the globe undertake the green transition, the demand for these minerals will only increase as their energy sources and transport systems become increasingly reliant on low-carbon technology.

In the global market, we have seen increasingly concentrated processing and mining supply chains in recent years. Such concentration means that the supply chain is particularly vulnerable to shocks such as natural disasters, war or geopolitical fallout. It is vital, therefore, that we have a plan to secure critical minerals for our industries and to diversify our supply chains.

This government recognises the huge opportunities on offer for both our critical minerals industry and the vital growth sectors it serves, which is why we are setting out our strategy to both take advantage of those opportunities and guard against the dangers of shortages or disruption.

Through this government’s Growth Mission, we are on the path to making the UK a world leader in technological innovation and a clean energy superpower. The Industrial Strategy launched in July 2025 underpins that Growth Mission, setting out a blueprint for 10 years of sustained economic growth through our most important growth sectors. This Critical Minerals Strategy – Vision 2035 – is key to making this a reality.

Our strategy sets out how we will grow our domestic production and use our international partnerships across the globe to support the resilience of the country’s Industrial Strategy growth sectors. In England, critical mineral strengths span areas such as the North East of England, including County Durham and Teesside, and the South West, including Devon and Cornwall. Scotland is embedding critical minerals’ resilience in its broader commitment to meeting net zero and creating a more circular economy. Wales has leveraged the geology and skills of the local workforce to retain nickel and titanium product manufacturing to this day. In Northern Ireland, research from the Queens University Belfast is contributing to new ways of recycling permanent magnets used in applications from wind turbines to vehicles.

By strengthening our own capabilities for mining, refining and recycling, we can create a more circular economy, support British industry, and reduce reliance on imports. This will be especially important in areas like the South West and the North East, which could see an industrial renaissance through the mining, processing and recycling of critical minerals.

Partnerships with resource-rich countries, alongside leveraging the UK’s capital markets, delivering our Trade Strategy and considering industry-led resilience measures in sensitive sectors like defence, will help secure the supply of critical minerals we need to meet future demand while supporting global diversification of critical minerals supply chains. We will promote supply chains that are responsible and transparent, upholding high Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) standards.

We will also strengthen the sector by utilising our world-leading credentials in academia, research and development (R&D), finance and trade – including the City of London and world leading institutions, like Camborne School of Mines. This will not only help expand our domestic production, but also enhance our ability to pursue our international growth partnerships, tap into global markets, and maintain reliable links with overseas supply chains during global shocks.

Vision 2035 directly links critical mineral demand to the UK’s growth sectors. We are not only identifying how short-term demand for critical minerals can be addressed, but also how the UK can create a thriving critical minerals industry which rejuvenates industrial communities and spurs growth in those sectors, including Advanced Manufacturing, Clean Energy Industries, Digital and Technologies, Defence and Life Sciences.

Through this strategy we are taking bold steps to make the UK one of the most advanced, resilient and future-facing economies in the world.

Executive summary

Critical minerals are essential to the UK’s economy, national security, and clean energy transition. UK economic resilience is a core objective of the UK’s Industrial Strategy. As foundational inputs to sectors driving the Industrial Strategy, critical minerals are vital to achieving the government’s mission of stimulating long-term economic growth. However, the global geopolitical landscape and complex supply chains pose persistent challenges to securing these vital resources. In this global, dynamic context, a new approach to critical minerals is required.

This new, targeted Critical Minerals Strategy sets the UK’s long-term ambition for securing critical minerals and harnessing our competitive advantage in recycling and innovative midstream processing – the transformation of mined or recycled materials into refined or upgraded forms suitable for manufacturing. This approach is based on proactively addressing market challenges and anticipating future demand for key minerals to ensure a reliable, sustainable and future-proof supply of critical minerals.

Achieving our ambitions requires a whole-of-society effort – from the choices we make about recycling our old smartphones, through to the technologies we adopt to warm our homes, like heat pumps. Critical minerals are embedded throughout the UK economy, in the new technology consumers buy, the IT our businesses rely on, and in our critical national infrastructure.

The UK’s global positioning on critical minerals shares similarities with partners but also reflects distinct national characteristics. As a net importer of critical minerals, the UK faces strategic vulnerabilities, shared by partners such as the EU. Like the EU, we depend on geographically concentrated global supply chains for key sectors such as advanced manufacturing and defence. Unlike major producing countries, our domestic mining sector is smaller in scale, but it remains an important contributor to global markets.

In the context of increasing state intervention in critical mineral markets, the UK must prioritise how best to deploy its resources to achieve its aims. So, the UK must set out a path which reflects our unique set of strengths in securing critical minerals for the UK.

To reduce our vulnerability, the UK will make strategic use of its own available mineral resources and capabilities. At the same time, we will work with international partners, whether net importers similar to the UK, such as the EU, or major producers, like Canada or Australia, to build more resilient and diversified supply chains. By leveraging our strengths – such as world-class research and development, midstream processing and recycling capabilities, and vibrant capital markets – we will secure a resilient, sustainable supply of critical minerals for the Industrial Strategy’s 8 growth-driving sectors.

To focus efforts across government and support collaboration with industry, we have 2 key policy objectives:

optimise domestic production

build resilient UK and global supply networks

Optimising domestic production of critical minerals will help protect UK supply against global trade and supply chain disruptions. It is key that the UK makes the most of its mineral deposits while cultivating our midstream processing and recycling to help enable a circular economy and reduce the impact of external shocks.

We will do so by supporting UK businesses through our strong public finance offer, including the National Wealth Fund (NWF) and UK Export Finance (UKEF). We will provide support on energy prices for eligible businesses, including a new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme (BICS) and will launch a consultation on eligibility for the scheme shortly.

We will support permitting for innovative projects through the Environment Agency’s priority tracked service and understand and support the skills required in the UK, in collaboration with Skills England and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). And following the 2025 Spending Review, the Department for Business and Trade (DBT) will provide funding support of up to £50 million for critical mineral projects in the UK, as part of the wider innovation landscape.

We will work with industry to explore a demand aggregation platform to map their demand for critical minerals across the UK. This will support government and industry to have a much richer picture of UK industrial demand across many downstream sectors. In doing so, it will enable better decisions on where to target government engagement and support to help UK companies invest to secure a critical mineral supply internationally and de-risk their further business.

We will also consider options to implement targeted, industry-led resilience measures for the UK defence sector. Measures could include stockpiling, including through procurement mechanisms. This aligns with the Ministry of Defence’s commitments to build resilience in critical mineral supplies for UK defence and use its procurement levers to promote resilient defence supply chains set out in the Defence Industrial Strategy 2025 sector plan.

To ensure the UK has a secure, diverse supply of critical minerals and to limit our exposure to global shocks, we will support UK industry and identify investment opportunities in shared supply chains by building and leveraging international partnerships. Our international partners will benefit from the UK’s world class capital markets, financial services sector, public finance institutions, world leading academic research, technological innovation, and geological, mining and technical expertise, in developing these deeper partnerships.

We will support this more targeted international approach through engagement in multilateral forums such as the G7, G20, Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), International Energy Agency (IEA) and NATO, along with promoting responsible and transparent supply chains through initiatives such as the Global Clean Power Alliance (GCPA). These multilateral organisations and initiatives play an important role in coordinating investment and action on supply chains, setting common standards and promoting responsible and transparent supply chains.

Finally, to support our 2 key policy objectives, we are building on the existing list of critical minerals by also introducing the UK’s first growth minerals list. This will complement the Critical Mineral Intelligence Centre’s UK 2024 criticality assessment by anticipating future demand of minerals for the Industrial Strategy’s growth-driving sectors. As we plan for future criticality and growth assessments, we will evaluate which additional minerals and materials will need to be in scope to reflect the UK economy’s growing demands amidst evolving global supply chain dynamics.

To drive progress towards Vision 2035, we are setting out our ambition in tangible terms, ensuring progress can be measured and tracked. We recognise the fast-changing nature of the critical minerals landscape, so we will be agile and responsive to new, emerging challenges in our strategy implementation while ensuring we are delivering our long-term vision.

Vision 2035

The UK’s Industrial Strategy and the accompanying sector plans set out how the government’s mission of kick-starting economic growth will be achieved. Critical minerals are identified as a foundational industry to the majority of the Industrial Strategy’s growth-driving sectors and are vital to delivering the growth mission. However, the current geopolitical and trade environment reflect the complexity of critical minerals’ supply chains and persistent market challenges.

A proactive approach is needed to ensure the UK retains and future-proofs our supply of critical minerals. Working in close partnership with industry, including producers, traders and users of critical minerals, this new, targeted Critical Minerals Strategy sets a shared long-term ambition for addressing these complex market challenges and supporting the growth-driving sectors.

To anticipate future demand for growth-driving sectors and to help realise government’s missions over the next 10 years, our strategy sets out a clear vision for UK critical mineral supply chains to 2035:

The UK has the critical minerals it needs to drive economic growth and the clean energy transition, harnessing our competitive advantage in midstream processing and recycling of critical minerals.

Features of the ambition

To ensure clear industry and government progress towards delivering the Vision 2035 in partnership, we define success as:

at least 10% of annual UK demand for critical minerals (see Table 1) in the aggregate is met through domestic production (primary extraction, processing and refining of critical minerals) by 2035

as part of this, at least 50,000 tonnes of lithium (or lithium carbonate equivalent ) is produced domestically by 2035

20% of total annual UK demand for critical minerals is met through recycling of products to recover critical minerals by 2035

supply is diversified, so that no more than 60% of the UK’s annual demand for critical minerals in the aggregate is supplied by any one country by 2035

Success will require sustained effort, delivered by private investment and through the actions and choices of critical mineral producers, traders and users. the government will set the conditions for success by facilitating and assisting private sector activity through the measures in this strategy.

UK strengths

We will leverage the UK’s range of existing strengths in critical minerals to boost our domestic production while demonstrating what the UK brings to international growth partnerships. The UK’s strengths are outlined as follows.

Research and development (R&D) and innovation

The UK has an extensive network of universities and academic centres of research on critical minerals. Institutions such as the Camborne School of Mines, University of Birmingham, and Queens University Belfast are developing key technologies and knowledge to support UK industry and unlock innovation across disciplines – including chemistry, metallurgy, geology, midstream processing, recycling and mining engineering. The British Geological Survey, a world-leading geological survey and global geoscience organisation, supports innovation, through monitoring and innovative projects which address the changing scientific challenges of stakeholders. We also need to ensure we maintain and grow our human capital across such institutions to achieve our Vision 2035.

Midstream processing and recycling expertise

In April 2025, Frazer-Nash Consultancy, in partnership with the Critical Minerals Association (CMA) and the Materials Processing Institute (MPI), delivered a report assessing the potential to grow the UK’s midstream processing and recycling capability. The report highlights the UK’s well established and growing capabilities in refining and recycling specific critical minerals, such as lithium, REEs and PGMs, all to high Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) standards.

Expertise across the value chain and the UK’s mineral wealth

The UK offers outstanding capabilities across the full mining and minerals value chain (the stages of turning mined minerals into finished products) at home and overseas. Hosting both global mining major and junior miners, UK companies provide expertise across the mining lifecycle from extraction to midstream processing and recycling to supporting services such as finance, legal, and consultancy.

Furthermore, the UK has distinct pockets of mineral wealth with a deep mining history, such as:

tungsten and tin in Devon and Cornwall

lithium in Cornwall, Teesside and County Durham

exploration underway for copper and zinc in Anglesey

tellurium and antimony in Mid-Tyrone

nickel and cobalt in Aberdeenshire

Centre of mining finance and metals trading

London plays a key role in developing domestic projects and mobilising finance internationally, contributing to the development of resilient and sustainable supply chains. A range of mining companies are listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), and the City of London continues to operate as a centre for mining finance. The London Metal Exchange (LME) is a global hub for metals trading which supports critical minerals trading with physically settled exchange traded contracts in aluminium, cobalt, nickel, copper, tin and zinc, and a cash settled contract in lithium. It is planning to launch an expanded market for sustainably sourced metals which will support responsible transparent supply chains. The exchange is closely consulting with stakeholders on proposals for 4 key metals: aluminium, zinc, copper, and nickel.

In addition, ICE Futures Europe – the UK exchange that hosts trading in half the world’s crude and refined oil futures – has recently expanded into critical minerals with the introduction of 4 battery material contracts in lithium and cobalt. Through this, the UK can help facilitate solutions to the price transparency challenges and also provide certainty and stability to businesses.

Regional clusters

UK strengths are concentrated in clusters across the UK – including Aberdeen, Belfast, Birmingham, Cornwall, Devon, County Durham, Fort William, South Wales and Teesside – where the right expertise, geological and geographical assets make these places optimal for domestic production. Additionally, the UK’s investment zones and freeports, such as Teesside, offer a strong base on which to build and scale up critical mineral businesses. These will be strengthened through the Industrial Strategy Zones Action Plan.

International development and diplomacy

We have a strong diplomatic network with expertise across commercial and development issues to support investments, exports and local development. Our networks and UK mining services expertise means we can support countries’ delivery of critical minerals projects, helping to reduce negative impacts on local communities, environmental damage and risks around the initiation or exacerbation of conflict.

The UK has been a part of crucial standards bodies such as the International Standards Organisation (ISO). Our ISO membership through the British Standards Institution (BSI) ensures we can influence global standards to increase transparency while promoting responsible practices. In turn, this creates highly visible and resilient global supply.

Policy objectives

Optimise domestic production

The critical minerals sector contributes £1.79 billion to the UK economy and directly supports over 50,000 jobs. Currently there are over 50 critical mineral projects based in the UK. Spanning established production facilities, alongside mining, processing or recycling projects at various stages of development, these projects represent the UK’s domestic capabilities across the supply chain, particularly in the midstream.

Producing more critical minerals domestically to high Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) standards will become increasingly vital to meet UK demand, in a world of shifting geopolitics and potential for supply chain disruptions. To do so, we will need to address the key challenges facing many of our domestic businesses, from high energy costs to planning and permitting to skills and access to finance.

We have 2 domestic sources of critical minerals: those in the ground and those in our homes and businesses. Building an innovative circular economy to not only recycle, but also reuse, repair and prolong the life of products containing critical minerals allows us to fully utilise the second source. In doing so, we use the resources already within the UK, reduce import reliance and reduce waste, pollution and carbon emissions. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ (Defra) upcoming Circular Economy Growth Plan will drive England’s transition away from a “take-make-waste” model by promoting resource efficiency, reducing waste and supporting green jobs and infrastructure.

To support optimisation of domestic capabilities while better securing our supply of critical minerals, greater visibility is needed of UK supply chains at each stage, from mining to downstream manufacturing, by both industry and government. Mapping UK supply chains will deepen our understanding of any gaps in UK supply chains and help us focus on international collaboration and investment opportunities.

UK-wide approach

White this is a UK government Critical Minerals Strategy, we work together with devolved administrations to ensure that the strategy is tailored to the needs of industry and leverages strengths across the whole of the UK.

The Scottish Government is advancing its approach to critical minerals as part of its broader commitment to resilient and sustainable supply chains that support the transition to net zero in Scotland. Core to the Scottish Government’s approach is creating a more circular economy, where critical materials are recovered and recycled as recognised within Scotland’s Draft Circular Economy Strategy. Its Scottish National Adaptation Plan 3 and Green Industrial Strategy also recognise the importance of strengthening the resilience of critical minerals supply chains against external shocks. The Scottish Government and its national economic development agency, Scottish Enterprise, are building a stronger evidence base on future vulnerabilities and opportunities for critical minerals in the Scottish economy.

During the 19th century, Wales was a world centre for metal smelting and processing, including steel, zinc, lead and copper. With this strong history in metal production, Wales has utilised the advantages of the local geology and the skills of the local workforce to retain nickel and titanium product manufacturing to this day. Building on legacies of past practices, Wales is global leader in the transition to a circular economy. The Welsh Government’s circular economy strategy, Beyond Recycling, highlights the need to capture and feed key materials back into the economy to build supply chain resilience.

Northern Ireland has a diverse mineral heritage, with historic mining focused on the productions of iron ore, salt and gold. Building on this, Northern Ireland recognises that security of supply is critical for high-value manufacturing and renewable energy technology, and that moving towards a circular economy is vital to reducing pressure on primary supply. Northern Ireland is pioneering innovation in the field of critical minerals recovery from end-of-life products, with research from the Queens University Belfast contributing to new ways of recycling permanent magnets used in applications from wind turbines to vehicles.

In England, critical mineral strengths span areas such as the North East of England, including County Durham and Teesside, and the South West, including Devon and Cornwall. For example, the Critical Minerals Challenge Centre, based at the University of Exeter with funding from UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), was created in autumn 2024 in partnership with multiple businesses, Cornwall, Devon and Somerset Councils, Great South West and regional non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

Produce more and better

Domestic production is vital to develop our domestic supply of critical minerals in the UK. And it is only possible by addressing the key challenges facing many of our domestic businesses, in particular high energy costs, planning, permitting, skills and access to finance. Our aim is that production in the UK is focused on both mining and processing critical minerals to high ESG standards as well as recycling, repurposing and reusing critical minerals in a circular economy.

Energy costs and infrastructure

Our new Critical Minerals Strategy aligns with the Industrial Strategy’s commitment to tackle unreasonably high energy costs, continually cited as a key barrier across industry. The introduction of the new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme (BICS) will bring Great Britain energy costs more in line with other major economies in Europe across the most electricity-intensive manufacturing industries of the Industrial Strategy’s 8 growth-driving sectors, and the foundational industries, including critical minerals. Eligibility of BICS will be informed by an upcoming consultation. From 2027, this new scheme will reduce electricity costs by up to £40 per megawatt hour, which could benefit over 7,000 businesses.

The British Industry Supercharger already supports many electricity-intensive industries, including some existing producers of critical minerals. We are planning to review eligibility for this scheme in 2026 to ensure that it targets those businesses most at risk of carbon leakage from high electricity costs. We will actively consult with stakeholders as part of the review and ensure that businesses in the critical minerals industry engage in this process. Furthermore, we have committed to increasing the level of relief offered through the Network Charging Compensation Scheme from 60% to 90% from 2026. This will further reduce electricity prices for the 500 most electricity-intensive businesses by £7 to £10 per megawatt hour, bringing the total discount offered by the British Industry Supercharger to around £78 per megawatt hour.

A number of critical mineral producers already benefit from energy support, but many critical mineral projects are not yet fully operational and producing commercially. With long project life cycles from mineral exploration to production, the early-stage projects of today are the producers for 2030 to 2035 and beyond. We will need to support these future projects to commercialisation through competitive energy costs and the associated grid infrastructure to access energy. The Industrial Strategy also sets out its commitment to build up electricity network supply chains to this end.

Environmental planning and permitting

To support growth sectors, the Environment Agency’s priority tracked service allows developers in England to work with a dedicated team for innovative projects requiring complex permitting solutions. The scope of this service has been extended to include the critical minerals industry. Coordinators will bring together the expertise and advice required to successfully navigate the requirements of the Environmental Permitting Regulations and ensure the process meets critical deadlines . These service improvements will result in quicker timeframes and more flexible decision-making in moving developers through the system.

The government recently consulted on reforms to modernise environmental permitting for industry and energy sectors – with the government response to the consultation planned for early 2026. The reforms aim to support industrial innovation through regulatory sandboxes, to streamline regulation of low-risk sectors and to ensure necessary standards are developed promptly for high-growth sectors to enable rapid permitting. The consultation included a section on mining and treatment of metals and minerals.

National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) consultation

The revised National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), published in December 2024, sets out the government’s planning policies for England and how these are expected to be applied. This includes setting out policies in relation to facilitating the sustainable use of minerals. The government remains committed to delivering a streamlined, plan-led planning system that is pro-growth, accessible, and offers greater certainty. The government will consult on a clearer set of national policies to support decision-making this year.

Skills in the UK’s critical minerals and mining industry

Domestic production relies on people’s skills and capabilities in the UK that span the critical minerals value chain as well as across industry, academia, and research. Just as we anticipate demand for critical minerals to grow, so will the need for the commensurate workforce and talent to help meet this demand.

It is therefore imperative to explore the skills needed by the critical minerals and mining industry, working collaboratively with Skills England and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to ensure a joined-up understanding of current and future skills needs, while supporting people to pursue careers in the industry through Jobcentre Plus and the new Jobs and Careers Service in England. This collaboration will build on the skills development activity led by the Critical Minerals Association, funded by the Department for Business and Trade, which brings industry, academia and government together to consider the skills required to grow the UK critical minerals industry and identify barriers and solutions for retaining and attracting talent.

Access to finance for domestic companies

Lack of access to finance is a key barrier to the market’s ability to respond to the anticipated rise in demand for critical minerals. Price decreases and volatility hit new and emerging projects the hardest as investors look to invest in stable and diversified supply chains. For example, in 2024, lithium spot prices fell by 75%, and cobalt, nickel and graphite prices dropped by 30% to 45% . The long lead time for a mine to come online after mineral discovery, and the uncertainty associated with future commercial success, present additional risks to investment. Therefore, providing access to finance to help reduce risk for these projects is often essential.

The UK has a strong public finance offer available to support UK critical minerals companies, from the National Wealth Fund (NWF) to UK Export Finance (UKEF) and the British Business Bank (BBB), as detailed in this section. However, the mandates of our public finance institutions (PuFins) can constrain their ability to address emerging risks and market volatility associated specifically with critical minerals projects. This has resulted in some critical mineral companies and projects finding it difficult to access government-backed support.

To address this, we will work with UK PuFins to identify ways in which critical minerals projects with high potential and strategic value can be supported more effectively by government in a more coherent way. In doing so we will boost jobs, growth and the resilience of UK critical mineral supply chains.

As part of our review of the role of UK PuFins, we have agreed to expand the eligibility criteria for UKEF’s Critical Minerals Supply Finance. This will ensure the scheme remains responsive to current and future UK offtake demand, while also supporting the development of bilateral and multilateral supply chains. As a first step, UKEF has updated its eligibility to include the new growth minerals list.

While the UK has some financing and grant processes in place to support certain critical mineral projects at specific levels, there is an opportunity to provide more bespoke, targeted grant funding to help deliver our growth mission. Following Spending Review 2025, funding of up to £50 million will be made available by DBT to support critical mineral projects, which could include expanding research and innovation as well as supporting commercialisation. Further detail will be announced in 2026.

To date, the government has provided over £165 million of support to critical businesses right across the UK. Looking forward and taken together, the government fully supports the UK’s growing critical mineral sector through the new up to £50 million critical mineral fund, as well as DRIVE35 and the PuFins outlined in this section.

Attracting investment

A whole-of-government approach is being taken to attract and enable investment into the UK. DBT is working with over 50 critical minerals growth projects across the critical minerals value chain. We have worked closely with the Critical Minerals Association and industry to produce a new investment prospectus showcasing the UK’s capabilities and helping to attract investment.

DBT’s Office for Investment (OfI) and the UK’s extensive network of embassies and high commissions around the world will continue to support investors interested in these opportunities. The expanded OfI is responsible for driving a strategic cross-government approach to investment, streamlining the government’s approach to securing investment aligned to the Industrial Strategy priorities. OfI will bring together expertise from industry and business to provide a bespoke service to support investors, land investment and overcome barriers to growth.

Driving Research and Investment in Vehicle Electrification (DRIVE35)

As announced in the Advanced Manufacturing Sector Plan, Driving Research and Investment in Vehicle Electrification (DRIVE35) will support the latest R&D in strategic vehicle technologies, accelerate their commercial scale-up, and unlock capital investments in zero-emission vehicles, batteries and their supply chains. DRIVE35 builds on the Advanced Propulsion Centre R&D programmes and the Automotive Transformation Fund, which has funded a number of critical mineral projects that strengthen the UK’s electric vehicle (EV) supply chains from lithium refinery Green Lithium to battery recycler Altilium.

National Wealth Fund

The National Wealth Fund (NWF) is at the forefront of investing public money across the UK. It has £27.8 billion financial capacity to help deliver the government’s growth and clean energy missions, generate a return for the taxpayer, and crowd in significant private investment.

The NWF finances investment in capital-intensive projects across the UK and has the mandate to support projects in the critical minerals sector where they meet NWF’s investment criteria. NWF has a range of tools including loans, guarantees and equity investments which it can deploy. NWF prioritises investments across the clean energy, digital and technologies, advanced manufacturing and transport sectors, and can also play a role in supporting the delivery of the wider industrial strategy, including the defence sector. This includes investments to support supply chain resilience across these sectors to better support the UK’s resilience and economic security.

In the last 2 years, NWF has completed equity investments of £24 million into Cornish Lithium (2023) and £28.6 million into Cornish Metals (2025) to support UK critical mineral supply chain resilience. In 2025, the NWF announced a further £31 million commitment to invest in Cornish Lithium .

UK Export Finance

UK Export Finance (UKEF), the UK’s export credit agency, has a mission to ensure that no viable export fails for lack of finance or insurance, doing that sustainably and at no net cost to the taxpayer. UKEF has a suite of products comprising of guarantees, loans and insurance that can support domestic and international critical minerals projects. Through its flexible working capital support to UK exporters, UKEF can support domestic businesses and those that are seeking to invest in the UK (with plans to export in future), and can also come alongside other UK public finance institutions and government funding schemes.

UKEF recently expanded its domestic financial support to include both the domestic producers and suppliers of UK exporters who are involved in critical minerals supply chains. The Critical Goods Export Development Guarantee enables suppliers of critical minerals products to UK exporters, to access working capital, helping them to secure long-term import contracts or invest in domestic capability building. These suppliers play an important role in the value chain as producers and importers of critical minerals. To qualify for this support, 50% of the supplier’s critical minerals-related production needs to go to a UK exporter or exporters. This support aims to give these firms the finance they need to make investments that will protect them from geopolitical risks and bolster supply chain resilience.

British Business Bank

As announced in the Industrial Strategy, a new £4 billion initiative, British Business Bank (BBB) Industrial Strategy Growth Capital, will be invested through the BBB’s existing capabilities across the 8 growth-driving sectors. There is also BBB’s Nations and Regions Investment Funds, which supports innovation and creating local opportunity for new and growing businesses across the UK. Given critical minerals are a foundational industry to the growth sectors, and considering the regional clusters of critical minerals expertise, BBB will explore how their initiatives may ensure that critical minerals SMEs can access the appropriate finance options to start and scale in the UK.

Promote a circular economy

Given the significant increase in demand for critical minerals over the next 10 years, primary sources cannot meet this demand alone, as highlighted by our demand signals in Annex 2 of the Critical Minerals technical annex. That is why the UK will look to build on its strengths in recycling to maximise the amount of critical minerals which can be recovered, and R&D and innovation to reduce, substitute or prolong critical mineral usage. This presents not only an economic opportunity, but reduces waste, cuts carbon emissions, and increases the UK’s security of supply.

Currently, recycling of critical minerals is held back by a low availability of critical mineral-rich waste streams, low collection rates and the high cost and difficulty of recovering critical minerals from end-of-life products like electronic equipment, EV batteries and wind turbines.

Despite this, some critical minerals have a good recycling rate at end of life because of their value and high technical recyclability. For example, PGMs that enter secondary production directly from industrial processes, such as industrial catalysts, are recycled at a rate near the 95% maximum potential . This success rate is evidenced by the UK being home to the largest PGM secondary refiner in the world, Johnson Matthey.

Due to timescales at which clean energy technologies will reach end of life, recycled sources of critical minerals will ramp up from 2030 and become a significant source of critical minerals by 2040 . This timescale grants government and industry a window of opportunity to consider appropriate action and build on the available domestic opportunities.

Promoting a circular economy in the UK will also support the UK’s wider commitment to circularity in global supply chains, and efforts through the Global Clean Power Alliance, a multilateral initiative to speed up the clean energy transition.

Circular Economy Growth Plan

DBT is working closely with Defra and other government departments on the forthcoming Circular Economy (CE) Growth Plan for England. The plan will be England only in scope and will consider policy areas that are a reserved competence, such as waste exports. The government will actively look for opportunities to align with the work that devolved governments have underway.

The EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act includes measures that aim to incentivise the recyclability of critical materials, which are compatible with the aims of our Critical Minerals Strategy. In April 2025, the government agreed to add the relevant provisions of the Act to the Windsor Framework, applying them in Northern Ireland, and to consider equivalent arrangements in Great Britain where necessary. This commitment has been taken into account in development of the CE Growth Plan for England.

The CE Growth Plan will outline regulatory reform to incentivise the recovery of critical minerals from end-of-life products alongside reducing demand. Boosting the UK’s domestic recycling skills and infrastructure is a prerequisite to delivering an effective resilient circular economy for critical minerals. Development of the CE Growth Plan has encompassed key insights from the Critical Minerals Intelligence Centre alongside the new UK Technology Metals Observatory and Met4Tech’s circular economy roadmaps on battery materials and rare earth magnets.

Map and secure UK supply chains

Tracing the journey of critical minerals from mine to end product, across multiple geographies and numerous entities, is complex. Due to the opaque nature of supply chains, and depending on the sector in which critical minerals are used, there is often a lack of clear data on supply chains which fulfil UK demand.

Building on work to date, we will continue to work closely with CMIC and DBT’s Supply Chains Centre in collaboration with industry stakeholders to better understand both the reach, gaps and vulnerabilities in UK supply chains. The UK Technology Metals Observatory will work alongside CMIC to provide data on the stocks and flows of technology metals in the UK and globally.

We will work with industry to explore a demand aggregation platform to help unlock opportunities for the UK, both domestically and internationally. This platform will help to identify where the UK’s growing domestic capabilities can meet specific growth sector requirements, allowing us to focus investment and government support. It will also facilitate decisions on where joint action between industry and government can secure supply from international partners in a more coordinated way.

A key limiting factor in the data on critical mineral supply chains is the lack of visibility on critical minerals in embedded components. To date, and as demonstrated by Annex 2 of the Critical Minerals technical annex, we have focused on the UK’s need for primary and midstream resources needed for the growth sectors. Future data and analysis including by CMIC and the UK Technology Metals Observatory will help increase our understanding of the current and anticipated future flow of minerals in specific technologies and for industrial decarbonisation.

Supply chain resilience for UK defence sector

Recognising the increasing complexity of global supply chains and their implication for national security, the UK will support industry-led supply chain resilience in the UK defence sector. We will consider mechanisms for establishing and building resilience in critical mineral supply into the UK defence sector. This could, for example, take the form of industry-held stockpiles mandated through government procurement mechanisms, or ensuring defence equipment always source critical minerals from more than one country.

We will also explore opportunities to collaborate on increasing strategic resilience with other partners implementing similar approaches. This approach will help to reduce the economic security risks in key supply chains. In the long-term this can be used to help to build diverse sources of critical mineral supply more broadly.

As one of the UK’s established economic tools, the National Security and Investment (NSI) Act gives the government powers to intervene in investments and other acquisitions of control in the UK economy to protect national security.

The government is currently reviewing the Notifiable Acquisition Regulations (NARs), which define the areas of the economy subject to mandatory notification under the NSI Act. Proposals in the NARs consultation, which closed on 14 October 2025, include the creation of a standalone Critical Minerals area (currently covered within the Advanced Materials area). The government will report on changes to the regulations in due course.

As shown by both these case studies, UK critical mineral supply chains are part of broad and complex global networks. They span mining, intermediate processing and manufacturing, across multiple jurisdictions. The UK’s projected increase in demand of minerals vital to growth-driving sectors is set to rise (see Annex 2 of the Critical Minerals technical annex. Rise in global demand and reliance on finite sources is creating supply pressures and unstable markets. Initiatives to optimise domestic capabilities must work hand in hand with our international collaboration. Working with international partners is crucial to delivering Vision 2035.

Resilient global supply networks

We will continue to be reliant on imports of critical minerals, even as we ramp up our domestic capabilities, and improve our circular economy. Our future demand for critical minerals cannot be met by domestic production alone, and we will therefore need to diversify our supply of critical minerals through working with international partners. Currently, we are seeing increased global protectionism, unfair market practices, and increasingly concentrated processing and mining supply chains, threatening the UK’s economic security.

Meeting the future mineral needs of the UK’s industrial strategy sectors will require a step change in the way we build international partnerships. Those partnerships will drive direct relationships between industries, governments and other key stakeholders and will be essential to building global diversity and resilience, enabling the global energy transition, and promoting equitable international development.

Along with countries across the world, diversification of processing and mining internationally is a key goal of this strategy in order to safeguard access to these minerals for our business and to bring economic growth to the country. The 60% success feature supporting diversification set out in our Vision 2035 is ambitious.

China’s central position in global critical mineral production has created highly concentrated supply chains. For example, China dominates the rare earths supply chain, controlling 70% and 90% of rare earth mining and refining, respectively. We will continue to work closely with China while building wider international partnerships to diversify supply to ensure the UK has the sustainable long-term supply our businesses and people need.

To deliver greater diversification, we will form strong strategic relationships with partners to help mitigate supply disruptions and potential export restrictions risks. We will develop international growth partnerships, mobilise investment and leverage our country’s central role in mining finance – particularly the UK’s strengths in capital and commodity markets, and continue to promote responsible and transparent supply chains.

Developing international growth partnerships will set the UK and our industries in the right direction to meet our 60% success feature to diversify supply chains as we look to secure supplies of critical minerals from key trading partners, resource-rich countries and technology partners. Working with these partners, we will also look at ways to secure global supply where joint action will be most successful while identifying where we can support local value creation, economic diversification and sustainable jobs through our international development expertise and programming. Multilaterally, we will continue to work through international forums including the G7, G20, International Energy Agency, Minerals Security Partnership and NATO to promote high ESG standards which incorporate conflict sensitivity, ensure responsible business practices and share data.

International growth partnerships

We will deepen relationships with key trading partners and develop international growth partnerships with resource-rich countries and technology partners to help UK industry secure its critical mineral supply, complementing domestic initiatives and supporting broader international objectives shared by the UK and international partners.

Given the global nature of supply chains, shared approaches to developing supply chains are essential. Working with partners, we can also identify joint solutions for project development, financing, construction and offtake. The UK will export its expertise in standards, R&D capability, surveying, and finance, working with partners across a complex security and economic landscape.

We will draw upon the deep and varied expertise available in partner countries, pooling our knowledge, relationships and tools to achieve our collective aims and drawing upon the strengths of others. We will align policies in areas like standards and traceability where possible.

As well as the UK’s expertise, international growth partnerships will be underpinned by:

supply chain collaboration, including demand aggregation and industry offtake facilitation (supporting long-term supply agreements between UK buyers and international producers)

access to finance for international supply chains

using trade policy tools to promote and protect the UK’s security of supply for critical minerals

reinforcing multilateral action

Supply chain collaboration

As we develop international growth partnerships with other countries, we will gain an increased understanding of how collaboration can help meet the UK’s demand requirements and achieve broader goals and ambitions set in collaboration with like-minded partners internationally.

Through conducting supply chain analysis both across the UK and in conjunction with our international partners, we will be able to identify priority projects and scope the potential for both private investment and public finance for these projects. This will support the UK in diversifying its supply of critical minerals and focusing our international engagement on the highest value partnerships.

Priority partners include but are not limited to the United States, EU, Canada, Australia, Saudi Arabia, India and Japan. We will also continue to refine our partnership with countries with whom the UK has existing Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs).

China is our fifth largest single country trading partner and an important player in critical minerals markets. We will be guided in our engagement by the principles set out in the UK’s Trade Strategy.

International offtake agreements

The UK will take a more active role in helping to facilitate offtake contracts, potentially through a demand aggregation platform that DBT will explore, taking account of the experience of partners developing or considering other similar initiatives. Such a platform could make it easier for UK buyers to collaborate on securing offtake from overseas critical minerals projects in partner countries by benefitting from economies of scale. This approach will be supported by UKEF’s Critical Minerals Supply Finance support described in the ‘Access to finance for international supply chains’ section.

This more proactive approach to securing offtake agreements by the UK will increase the likelihood of identifying new sources of supply in partner countries. This will have an additional mutual benefit to our relations with these countries. Further, by aggregating demand, the UK can promote sustainable credentials and sourcing of critical minerals for upstream suppliers.

A system for aggregating UK demand will broaden the UK’s scope for collaboration with international partners and support the development of targeted international growth partnerships.

Access to finance for international supply chains

Developing new, diverse supply chains to support UK industry requires investment. This can come from private investors and industry, or public sources like development finance institutions and export credit agencies, like UKEF.

UKEF can provide support to UK supply chains through its Critical Minerals Supply Finance. This support is available to overseas critical minerals projects or companies (including producers of goods containing critical minerals) that supply UK exporters with long-term offtake or import contracts.

UKEF can also work with other international export credit agencies and overseas governments’ public finance institutions, including development banks, to co-finance projects in third countries. This support helps to de-risk projects, crowd-in private finance and secure UK supply chains. UKEF’s standard international buyer finance support (where eligibility is based on the procurement of UK goods and services contracts) is also available to support critical minerals companies and projects.

UKEF also recently launched the Early Project Services Guarantee which can support critical minerals projects. This provides a guarantee to a bank making a loan to an overseas buyer to finance the purchase of design, engineering or technical services from a UK supplier for early-stage project work such as feasibility studies, conceptual designs, and surveys.

We will commit to working with UK public finance institutions to explore how they can further support critical minerals supply chains.

Alongside these targeted efforts, the UK will seek to encourage more investment into mining globally, working with multilateral development banks, and address barriers to investment.

Trade policy

We will continue to identify and address market access barriers in key export markets, which cause additional costs to companies in the UK’s critical minerals supply chains. We will help to ease regulatory burdens, unlock new overseas investment, and assess the impact of export controls on critical minerals. Where consistent with the Trade Strategy, we will consider the use of trade policy levers to ensure the supply of critical minerals into the UK, and support domestic extraction and recycling.

In line with the Trade Strategy, we will consider where we can deepen relationships with established trading partners. Using growth minerals and accompanying demand signals, we will develop agreements with new partners to support greater investment in new secure and transparent supply chains of critical minerals across borders, helping to diversify global supply chains. For future free trade agreements (FTAs) the UK will seek to pursue higher ambition outcomes regarding critical minerals, for example with the inclusion of specific chapters on critical minerals collaboration or supply chains. We will also seek to make use of bilateral critical mineral agreements with international partners to foster supply chain collaboration, and open and expand markets for UK industry and investors.

The Trade Strategy outlined our strengthened approach to trade defence, ensuring we can guard UK businesses – and the critical minerals sector – against an increasingly turbulent trading environment. This includes introducing new legislation to expand our powers to raise tariffs in response to unfair trading practices.

As announced in the Industrial Strategy, the new Supply Chain Centre, will help identify and mitigate supply chain risks for UK companies in the critical minerals sector. The Supply Chain Centre will undertake data-driven, business-informed reviews of critical supply chains to identify actions needed to ensure resilience. We will also introduce legislation to expand our powers to respond to unfair trade practices, and guard against global turbulence in critical sectors.

Reinforcing multilateral engagement

Our bilateral international growth partnerships will complement the UK’s existing and well established participation in multilateral initiatives. We will leverage similar finance, trade policy and partnership tools where possible to build global resilience in critical mineral supply chains.

The UK will continue working multilaterally through international forums, including the G20, G7, World Trade Organization (WTO), NATO and the IEA. We will work alongside the respective presidencies to ensure that action in the G20 and G7 focuses on delivering genuine changes that seek to improve global supply chain resilience, diversification and sustainability. The UK will leverage its international equities, expertise, UK capital markets, emerging market relationships and public-private partnerships to increase coherence in international critical mineral systems and build distributed growth partnerships to counterbalance dominant national interests.

We will promote projects and markets that meet internationally recognised responsible business practices and standards. This includes building the capacity in resource-rich countries to meet these standards in the long term.

The UK: a centre of mining finance, trading and services

The UK uniquely offers access to vibrant capital markets, world-class commodity exchanges, standards bodies, investment funds and a full suite of professional services. These will be instrumental in realising our domestic and international critical minerals ambitions.

Together, these UK strengths can play a crucial role in mobilising the capital needed to develop diverse and resilient critical minerals supply chains around the world that better serve UK industry and support our international partners’ mining sectors.

Around $580 billion (US dollars) in capital investments will be required globally by 2040 to develop new critical minerals mines under the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), according to the IEA Global Critical Minerals Outlook 2024. However, the international market for critical minerals features structural imbalances due to the concentration of existing supply chains in a small number of markets. The resultant price opacity undermines private capital’s appetite to invest in critical minerals projects around the world, including in the UK.

The UK, with its expertise in financial services, is well positioned to facilitate solutions to these challenges by mobilising investment where it is most needed. Domestically, we will work to ensure that UK projects have the financing they need to reach production and offtake positions and that viable late-stage projects receive the funding they need to reach production. Internationally, we will promote the UK as a market for raising capital for global projects, while working to leverage UK financial services strengths to tackle collective critical minerals market challenges.

To mobilise investment both domestically and internationally, we will focus on facilitating the following:

promoting the UK’s capital markets to attract investment into critical minerals supply chains

providing access to capital

strengthening the international market for sustainable critical minerals

Promoting the UK’s vibrant capital markets

The UK’s capital markets are some of the strongest and deepest globally, delivering capital to support high growth and innovative businesses around the world. This includes a wide range of companies involved in critical minerals production.

The LSE has a critical role in developing our domestic projects and mobilising financing for projects internationally, contributing to the development of resilient and sustainable supply chains. The UK’s 2 growth markets – Alternative Investment Market (AIM) and Aquis Growth Market – are particularly relevant for smaller companies operating across the critical minerals value chain and are seeking to raise investment to advance their projects to commercialisation. AIM is the largest growth market in Europe: over the past 5 years, more than 50% of all capital raised on European growth markets was raised on AIM.

We will take advantage of the opportunities offered by ongoing capital markets reforms delivered by HM Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to encourage companies with projects operating across the critical minerals supply chain to choose London as a venue to raise capital. This includes overhauling the UK Prospectus regime, as well as legislating for an innovative new type of stock exchange for trading private company shares. These will complement the new UK Listing Rules, providing more flexibility to firms and founders raising capital on UK markets.

Providing access to capital

There are many sources of capital in the UK, and these include the public equity market, institutional investors, capital funds, private equity, family offices, pension funds, government grants and more. Overlaying these sources are the variety of instruments that can be used to secure capital. Some midstream projects and many junior mineral companies are often small with leadership teams that are mining and technically focused, making navigating capital markets time consuming and inefficient.

The UK has world-leading service companies that can assist businesses to source funding, trade minerals, and operate. This includes legal services, banking, insurance, market analysis and commodity tracking, feasibility, engineering and design. We will promote these UK capabilities both domestically and overseas, alongside the benefits of new companies headquartering in the UK to access these services and other available support.

Strengthening the international market for sustainable critical minerals

The international critical minerals market is currently exposed to manipulation and non-market practices, undermining both our domestic and international ambitions. This is a global challenge, and we will work with like-minded partners to seek consensus on action to address imbalances, including in international forums like the G7 and G20.

The UK supports free market approaches. Market failures and volatility can deter investment in critical minerals supply chains. UK PuFins, including NWF and BBB are committed to environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles. UKEF’s commitment to internationally recognised standards such as the OECD Common Approaches, International Finance Corporation and the Equator Principles, means that UKEF support helps to raise the ESG credentials of overseas projects and encourages adherence to responsibility and transparency in the projects it supports. We will promote UKEF support as a key tool to encourage investment across the critical minerals supply chain.

The UK also has world-class commodity markets, with the majority of all non-ferrous (non-iron containing) metal futures business being transacted on the LME’s platforms. Prices discovered on UK commodity markets are used as the global reference price around the world. We believe these UK strengths in commodity trading and standard setting offer critical components that will underpin solutions. We see opportunities to use these strengths to facilitate solutions to price transparency challenges and promoting price premia for sustainably sourced metals.

We will also consider wider approaches in coordination with our like-minded partners. Solutions like traceability mechanisms, long-term offtake agreements, and targeted stockpiling measures (both industry and government led) offer options to promote effective price discovery and support demand for sustainably sourced metals, but we will work to ensure that any policies deployed have a clear, tangible benefit to UK industry.

Responsible and transparent supply chains

The UK has a leading role in ensuring critical minerals are produced responsibly and transparently. Currently, some critical mineral supply chains are associated with significant ESG harms, including human rights abuses, biodiversity loss, deforestation and corruption. The government is committed to promoting improved governance, increased supply chain transparency, and greater adoption of responsible business practices that protect the local environment and surrounding communities. ESG risks also create added vulnerability to supply disruption: critical mineral supply chains are not secure unless they are also responsible and sustainable.

We also recognise that mining and processing operations take place in very different contexts across the globe, so maintaining standards is crucial. Transparent supply chains enable the UK to anticipate and mitigate external shocks. Responsible supply chains built on robust standards are resilient to sudden changes. Limited access to financial resources and technical expertise pose challenges to achieving this.

We are committed to the responsible and sustainable development of resources in the UK and encouraging due diligence in supply chains. In Cornwall, domestic critical mineral projects are exploring low-impact extraction methods, such as Direct Lithium Extraction, and innovative low-carbon processes, including using geothermal energy to power operations. We want the UK to contribute this expertise in responsible mining.

The government expects all UK companies to respect human rights, workers’ rights and the environment throughout their operations and supply chains in line with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).

We will promote responsible and transparent supply chains through:

inclusive development and responsible business practices

international development finance

global initiatives and multilateral forums

Inclusive development and responsible business practices

Critical mineral production can support inclusive and sustainable economic development under the right conditions. The UK will focus on ensuring the extraction of critical minerals works for the benefit of resource-rich countries, particularly in emerging markets and developing economies. We will identify where we can support local value creation, economic diversification and localise benefits through our growth partnerships. This encourages transparency in global supply networks, resulting in a secure supply of critical minerals for the UK.

Irresponsible mining practices can exacerbate geopolitical risks and social harm, including impacts on Indigenous peoples’ rights, and increase the risk of modern slavery. The UK is committed to eradicating all forms of modern slavery, forced labour and human trafficking in line with achieving Sustainable Development Goal 8.7. The UK will continue to provide international leadership on this agenda, working with multilateral partners to promote joint action to tackle modern slavery and enhance responsible business practices in critical mineral supply chains.

As announced in the Trade Strategy, the UK is reviewing its approach to responsible business conduct policy. The review will focus on the global supply chains of businesses operating in the UK, including businesses who extract, import or use critical minerals, where human rights abuses and environmental harms are more pertinent. This will cover all areas of the economy, including businesses linked to critical minerals.

In addition, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) is carrying out a National Baseline Assessment (NBA) on the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles. An NBA will contribute to the evidence base to inform the UK’s approach to tackling business related human rights abuses, including in global supply chains.

International development finance

The development of new, diverse critical mineral supply sources requires significant responsible investment. The UK’s development finance institution, British International Investment (BII), currently supports investments in the enabling infrastructure around critical mineral projects. For example, BII is invested in the Owendo Bulk Port in Gabon, which facilitates the export of locally mined manganese ore, and the import of aggregates and cement constituents. FCDO and BII continue to explore opportunities to invest more in infrastructure for critical minerals through BII’s next 5-year strategy.

Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) play a crucial role in the development and management of critical minerals, providing significant funding for projects related to the extraction and processing of critical minerals. The UK works with multilateral development banks such as the World Bank Group, supporting the delivery of the Resilient and Inclusive Supply-Chain Enhancement (RISE) Partnership to diversify and help create enabling investment environments in mineral-rich, low and middle-income countries.

Global initiatives and multilateral forums

We will promote responsible investment through the Global Clean Power Alliance (GCPA). The GCPA’s Supply Chain Mission will identify and deliver the most critical changes needed to diversify clean energy supply chains, drive investment, shorten lead times and hasten the clean energy transition at lower cost. We are developing a 2-year roadmap for the Supply Chain Mission alongside like-minded, ambitious partners, which could include support to responsible critical mineral supply chains and midstream opportunities to increase local value addition in emerging markets and developing economies.

As Chair of the Voluntary Principles for Security and Human Rights initiative, the UK will seek to influence other governments and businesses to lower the risk of violence, conflict and human rights abuses in the extractives sector. As Chair, we will focus the impact of the Voluntary Principles at a grassroots level and aim to foster a more stable business environment while reducing the risk of human rights abuses.

The UK was the driving force behind the inception of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and continues to support their mission, working to ensure that countries benefit from a higher percentage of revenue from natural resource extraction, and encouraging robust governance systems which aid stable investment climates.

International standards can help to reduce risk in investment jurisdictions. Globally agreed technical standards, such as those developed through the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), play an important role in enabling transparency and credibility of critical minerals markets. Enhancing such standards will in turn strengthen data on origins and enable consistency with ESG standards.

The UK will promote building capacity in resource-rich countries to meet these standards in the long term. We also support partners to consolidate the number of existing standards, with the ambition of raising the floor on the minimum acceptable standard of behaviour, rather than creating additional standards.

Growth minerals

To drive both government and industry efforts towards achieving Vision 2035, future demand of minerals vital to the UK economy’s growth sectors needs to be better understood. A demand forecast of key minerals required by the growth sectors provides a lens to inform proactive domestic and international initiatives across government and industry, and to support prioritisation of resources.

We are introducing a new growth minerals list to sit alongside the critical minerals identified in the 2024 Criticality Assessment, to provide an expanded focus on the current and future mineral needs in the growth sectors. The growth minerals list is accompanied by demand signals across key technologies in the growth sectors. Growth minerals and the demand forecast complement the existing critical minerals list by offering a forward-looking assessment linked to the Industrial Strategy’s growth sectors. This identifies minerals significant for the future of UK-based manufacturing across the relevant growth sectors, based on the end use of minerals in these key sectors.

The estimates will inform domestic production by identifying where secure supply of minerals is most important for the UK’s growth sectors. This approach also provides direction to our international growth partnerships, which can assess mineral-specific opportunities for collaboration. A long-term mineral forecast will signal government priorities to projects and businesses across the critical mineral industry and support the existing critical minerals list.

There is an overlap between the critical and growth minerals lists, reflecting the fact that the demand for a high number of critical minerals in the growth sectors is expecting to increase in future. Currently the Critical Minerals Intelligence Centre (CMIC) assesses minerals against 2 dimensions to determine criticality:

global supply risk

UK economic vulnerability

Some growth sectors depend on minerals which are not currently assessed to be critical – this has resulted in the identification of beryllium (used in aerospace and defence), chromium (used in aerospace), copper (used across advanced manufacturing, particularly clean energy applications), uranium (used in defence and nuclear), and synthetic graphite (used in the automotive sector) as growth minerals.

The critical and growth mineral lists complement each other. Risk of global supply disruption and the UK’s vulnerability to disruption is captured by the critical minerals list on the basis of past data. Growth minerals identify the key future requirements for the UK economy’s growth sectors. Together both lists provide government with the ability to respond to global supply risk while adopting a forward-looking approach to securing critical minerals for the UK.

International partners have also been using multiple lists to help guide their approach to securing mineral supply in strategic sectors. For example, the EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act of 2024 updated the EU list of critical raw materials and introduced strategic raw materials for strategic technologies such as green, digital, defence, and aerospace applications. However, we recognise the potential for lack of clarity with 2 lists and have accordingly set out the key similarities and distinctions.

Support for growth minerals only

Support is available for the following growth minerals:

beryllium

chromium

copper

uranium

graphite (natural and synthetic)

Available support for these growth minerals includes:

eligibility for NWF finance for business in the critical mineral value chain

eligibility for Environment Agency’s (EA) priority tracked service for early development projects

In terms of future support, we are exploring extending UKEF’s mandate to support overseas growth mineral projects for UK industry.

To secure future supply of minerals needed for the growth sectors and harness competitive advantage, we intend to align government public finance support to include these growth minerals. Alongside critical minerals projects, projects in England with growth minerals will also be able to use the Environment Agency’s priority tracked service for permitting pathway. Given the overlap between critical minerals and growth minerals, in practice this means extending eligibility across these support schemes to beryllium, chromium, copper, uranium and synthetic graphite. As a result, government efforts will be expanded to include minerals the UK anticipates needing most in future, for use within the growth sectors.

For growth minerals, we have compiled signals of expected demand up to 2035 in line with the timescale of the vision for this strategy. The signals are tailored to UK manufacturing using raw and intermediate critical minerals, to quantify the needs of the Industrial Strategy growth sectors. Annex 2 of the Critical Minerals technical annex highlights the expected rise in demand up to 2035 for selected growth minerals. These demand signals are a first step in understanding UK demand, upon which future developments can be made.

Use case for growth minerals

A deep dive into copper illustrates how the list will enable initiatives across government to secure supply of critical minerals for growth sectors.

Copper is identified as a growth mineral with the accompanying demand forecast, signalling a sharp rise in copper demand for growth sectors alongside concerns about potential copper shortfalls by 2035 . The National Wealth Fund is able to support existing and new growth mineral projects, including copper projects across the value chain. For copper projects that meet NWF’s investment criteria, NWF is able to help crowd further private investment into projects which ensure a secure supply of these minerals for the UK’s growth sectors.

Following the inclusion of copper in the growth minerals list, early-stage copper projects in England will also be able to leverage the Environment Agency’s (EA) priority tracked service for complex permitting solutions. This service will provide co-ordinated advice and support to copper projects to help avoid delays and navigate the permitting and licensing system.

UKEF will update its eligibility to include growth minerals as part of its critical minerals-focused international and domestic support to help strengthen copper supply chains for UK businesses and projects. This support will help to enable the UK to meet the expected rise in future demand and complements CMIC’s criticality assessment given copper was not deemed critical at the time of assessment based on historical data.

A summary of the methodological approach for creating demand signals on a mineral-by-mineral basis can be found in Annex 4 of the Critical Minerals technical annex. Demand estimates for Defence industry have been excluded.

Implementation

Having set out our new strategy and Vision 2035, our focus will pivot to ensuring government activities deliver on these objectives, while ensuring the strategy itself remains fit for purpose.

We will leverage the UK’s strengths and close collaboration with industry to deliver our vision of securing the UK’s critical mineral supplies for the growth-driving sectors, harnessing our competitive advantage in midstream processing and recycling. We outline a high-level implementation plan up until 2028, which we will further develop and deliver across government and with industry. Implementation of the Critical Minerals Strategy will be reviewed, typically on an annual basis, with appropriate input from industry and bodies such as the Critical Minerals Expert Committee (CMEC).

To co-ordinate effort, workstreams closely linked to the policy objectives of the strategy are identified through which to deliver progress:

international collaboration – delivering domestic security of critical minerals and contributing to global resilience through international partnerships and multilateral forums

building critical minerals security – initiatives designed to secure supply of critical minerals critical for the UK’s security, including supporting domestic production and recycling, developing a new critical mineral fund, and building resilience in defence supply chains, working with devolved governments

opening up access to finance – leveraging existing strengths and developing new and existing tools to enable critical mineral businesses and projects to access finance

critical minerals intelligence – enabling informed policymaking by continuing to develop the Critical Minerals Intelligence Centre and seeking independent advice from the Critical Minerals Expert Committee

Updates on the progress made across the strategy will be provided as we undertake delivery.

Medium to longer term

Critical minerals is a rapidly evolving industry in a fast-moving geopolitical context. The government’s approach needs to remain agile to respond to market changes and state intervention across global networks. Therefore, we will consider and develop additional specific initiatives as necessary in the medium and long term to meet the objectives of the UK’s Critical Minerals Strategy, as we report on delivery progress.

We will also continue to work across government to make Vision 2035 a reality through delivery of the Industrial Strategy and its growth sector plans.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/static/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-11-23 12:00:43.332722

EV owners are unlikely to change their minds: the study showed most EV drivers are happy with their ownership experience and do not wish to switch to a gas-powered vehicle.","Consumer choices are a very complex thing. Figuring out what the next market trend is, what brands people like and don’t like, and the reasons why, involves a multitude of factors: anything from the latest marketing campaigns, to celebrity endorsements, to simply a brand’s reputation for good or poor quality. This is especially true in the automotive world, as a car is a major purchase; people are also more likely to be influenced by brand loyalty if they have consistently stuck with the same automaker over the course of years.

The world of electric vehicles, however, is a little different than the mainstream car market, although it is rapidly becoming a part of it. As the EV industry is fairly young, patterns are still emerging, and it’s difficult to predict where the market will go next. A recent study by the Global EV Alliance, the Global EV Driver Survey, has attempted to get a complete picture of what the electric vehicle world currently looks like.

One particular trend has emerged: prospecting buyers avoiding certain brands for political reasons. In this part of the survey, Tesla has emerged as the most frequently mentioned brand, with 41% of respondents saying they would avoid the brand due to politics. It’s not hard to make a connection to Tesla’ CEO, Elon Musk, who has become a highly controversial figure in recent years.

Let’s take a closer look at Tesla’s journey so far, the aftermath of its change in fortune, and some of the other findings revealed in the study.

CarBuzz, its writers, editors, and owners have no affiliation with any political entity or party. The CarBuzz team comprises members with a variety of differing political and social views. This article does not support either side of the current political landscape.

From Hype To Cringe: How Did Tesla Ruin Its Reputation?

At the start of its journey as a brand, Tesla was synonymous with innovation and brought a great deal of excitement to the automotive world and beyond. Its cars, more like smartphones on wheels than actual vehicles, anticipated (or helped create) several of the trends that would later be seen across the car market as a whole. The seamless integration of tech and the concept of the car as a constantly connected item were futuristic, fascinating ideas: to many, Tesla represented the future of the automotive industry.

A sizable part of this image was built by Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk. In part thanks to his own personal branding as a Tony Stark-esque tech guru and entrepreneur, Musk shaped the public’s perception of the company in its early years, pushing Tesla to become a household name and a leader in the world of electric vehicles.

Over the past five years or so, however, things began to change. Musk’s activities expanded beyond the world of tech and entrepreneurship, as he began to get involved in politics. He also adopted a more confrontational, hostile, and downright bizarre online persona; after his takeover of the website now known as X, he infamously set up an auto-reply system that responded to questions from journalists with a single poop emoji.

As Musk’s personal identity and the identity of the Tesla brand were so deeply intertwined, it wasn’t long before his actions began to affect the brand’s commercial prospects. Sales began to drop, as did the company’s stock; many existing Tesla owners began to distance themselves (jokingly or seriously) from Musk as an individual.

Today, although Tesla still occupies a major role in the EV market (the Model Y is the world’s best-selling EV for 2025 so far, with the Model 3 following behind at a close second), its brand image has changed, and not for the better. This has resulted in dropping sales and stock, leading to global concerns about what the company’s future looks like.

Just Rumors Or Something More? The Possible Quest For A New CEO

Given the level of controversy now associated with the Tesla brand, you might be wondering if the company’s own management has thought about taking some sort of action to mitigate the negative impact on sales and stock. Although the idea of Tesla without Musk in the picture is unlikely to become a reality any time soon, a few months ago rumors implied that it may have been considered as a possible outcome.

In May this year, the company’s sales and profits were trending sharply downwards, as was its stock. Around this time, a report surfaced that suggested the company may be looking for new leadership. The Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla board members got in touch with executive search firms, with the goal of finding Tesla a new, hopefully less controversial, CEO.

Soon after the report was published, Tesla’s Chair Robyn Denholm quickly denied its contents through a public statement on X. According to her statement, the WSJ had already been informed that the contents of the report were false before its publication.

""This is absolutely false [...] The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead."" -Robyn Denholm, Tesla Chair

Musk himself denounced the contents of the report through his own statement, also on X:

""It is an extremely bad breach of ethics that the WSJ would publish a deliberately false article and fail to include an unequivocal denial beforehand by the Tesla board of directors!"" -Elon Musk, Tesla CEO

The WSJ, however, denied having been given any kind of information by Tesla regarding the report before it was published, saying that the company had been given an opportunity to provide a statement but failed to do so. It has now been six months since the publication of the report and the ensuing controversy, and although there have been no further major rumors about Musk being ousted, it might not be quite as remote a possibility as some might think.

How Existing Tesla Owners Are Distancing Themselves From Musk

Although prospective buyers and their willingness (or lack thereof) to buy a Tesla are a more pressing concern, there’s also the question of what existing Tesla owners are doing in response to the brand’s shifting image. Many Tesla drivers have taken action to publicly distance themselves from Elon Musk, with humorous bumper stickers (“I Bought This Before He Was Crazy” and the like) and even full rebadging jobs (although we’re not convinced a Toyota-branded Cybertruck is likely to fool anyone).

Some Tesla owners even sold their cars and went for a different brand instead. Singer Sheryl Crow donated the proceeds of her Tesla’s sale to charity, letting the public know about her action through social media (with the caption “My parents always said… you are who you hang out with”).

There have, unfortunately, also been some people out there (whether or not they’re Tesla owners is uncertain) who have taken things too far and into criminal territory, attacking other people’s Tesla vehicles and even burning down some of the brand’s dealerships. Though this has had no personal impact on Musk, it has affected the lives and livelihoods of ordinary people who had no personal connection to the man or his views and actions. The disturbing phenomenon shows how strong anti-Tesla sentiment can be and how, in some cases, it can end up hurting unrelated people as well.

The Global EV Driver Survey's Other Findings: What The EV Landscape Looks Like Today

The Tesla issue, and the wider phenomenon of customers avoiding brands for political reasons, was not the only aspect of the Global EV Driver Survey. The study also offers insight into several other aspects of the electric vehicle world today. Here are some of its most crucial findings.

Myths about EVs are influencing adoption rates: The study looked at the biggest barriers to EV adoption, and myths about EV emerged as the top culprit. Vehicle prices and availability of charging opportunities followed in second and third place.

Environmental concerns are a major factor: 74% of EV drivers responded “Agree” or “Strongly Agree” to the statement “I care about the environmental impact of the production of my car”. 89% did the same for the statement “Climate change is a big problem”. This suggests that concern for the environment is widespread among EV owners, and may be a major influencing factor in their choice of vehicle.

The deal finalized at the COP30 conference pledges more money to help countries adapt to climate change, but lacks explicit plans to transition away from the fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas that heat the planet.

The conference didn't do as much as scientists thought the world needed. It wasn't as meaningful as activists and Indigenous people demanded. Few countries got everything they wanted. And the venue even caught fire.

But that disappointment is mixed with a few wins and the hope for countries to make more progress next year.

Here's what you need to know about the outcome.

Leaders tried to nail down specifics on fighting climate change

Leaders have been working on how to fight the impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather and sea level rise, for a decade. To do that, every country had the homework of writing up their own national climate plans and then reconvened this month to see if it was enough.

Most didn't get a good grade and some haven't even turned it in.

Brazil, host of the climate conference known as COP30, was trying to get them to cooperate on the toughest issues like climate-related trade restrictions, funding for climate solutions, national climate-fighting plans and more transparency on measuring those plans' progress.

More than 80 countries tried to introduce a detailed guide to phase out fossil fuels over the next several decades. There were other to-do items on topics including deforestation, gender and farming.

Countries reached what critics called a weak compromise

Nations agreed to triple the amount of money promised to help the vulnerable countries adapt to climate change. But they will take five more years to do it. Some vulnerable island countries said they were happy about the financial support.

But the final document didn't include a road map away from fossil fuels, angering many.

After the agreement was reached, COP President André Corrêa do Lago said Brazil would take an extra step and write their own road map. Not all countries signed up to this, but those on board will meet next year to specifically talk about the fossil fuel phase out. It would not carry the same weight as something agreed to at the conference.

Also included in the package were smaller agreements on energy grids and biofuels.

Responses ranged from happy to angry

“Given what we expected, what we came out with, we were happy,” said Ilana Seid, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States.

But others felt discouraged. Heated exchanges took place during the conference’s final meeting as countries snipped at each other about the fossil fuel plan.

“I will be brutally honest: The COP and the U.N. system are not working for you. They have never really worked for you. And today, they are failing you at a historic scale,” said Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez, a negotiator for Panama.

Jiwoh Abdulai, Sierra Leone’s environment and climate change minister said: “COP30 has not delivered everything Africa asked for, but it has moved the needle.” He added: ""This is a floor, not a ceiling.”

The real outcome of this year’s climate talks will be judged on “how quickly these words turn into real projects that protect lives and livelihoods,” he said.

Talks set against the Amazon rainforest

Participants experienced the Amazon’s extreme heat and humidity and heavy rains that flooded walkways. Organizers who chose Belem, on the edge of the rainforest, as the host city had intended for countries to experience firsthand what was at stake with climate change, and take bold action to stop it.

But afterward, critics said the deal shows how hard it is to find global cooperation on issues that affect everyone, most of all people in poverty, Indigenous people, women and children around the world.

“At the start of this COP, there was this high level of ambition. We started with a bang, but we ended with a whimper of disappointment,"" said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, now at Greenpeace International.

Indigenous people, civil society and youth

One of the nicknames for the climate talks in Brazil was the “Indigenous peoples' COP.” Yet some in those groups said they had to fight to be heard.

Protesters from Indigenous groups twice disrupted the conference to demand a bigger seat at the table. While Indigenous people's rights weren't officially on the agenda, Taily Terena, an Indigenous woman from the Terena nation in Brazil, said so far she is happy with the text because for the first time it includes a paragraph mentioning Indigenous rights.

She supported countries speaking up on procedural issues because that’s how multilateralism works. “It’s kind of chaotic, but from our perspective, it’s kind of good that some countries have a reaction,” she said.

Tucson Electric Power’s business is built on the investments we must make to provide safe, reliable service — investments that increasingly include clean energy resources.

Between 2025 and 2027, we’re adding 340 megawatts (MW) of new solar generation and 400 MW of four-hour battery storage. The first half of that storage system came online this summer, thanks to a $350 million investment that represents the largest cost we’re seeking to recover in our pending request for new, higher rates in late 2026.

In light of all this, it’s hard to believe anyone would say TEP refuses to invest in renewable energy. Yet chronic op-ed critics keep making that claim along with an equally implausible motive: that we won’t invest in clean energy because it’s cheaper than other alternatives.

The truth is that while renewables provide great value as part of a diverse energy mix, they require more upfront investment. Wind and solar power systems cost significantly more per MW than a new natural gas power plant, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Moreover, they only provide energy part of the time, requiring utilities to build significantly more renewable capacity and pair them with storage or other resources to produce output that’s comparable to conventional generation.

A recent example: When TEP considered the best ways to replace two units at our coal-fired Springerville Generating Station, we determined that doing so with a new 750-MW natural gas-fired unit would cost about $1.5 billion. Providing comparable output with renewables would have required a 1,225 MW solar array plus 1,255 MW of four-hour battery storage at an eye-watering cost of $4.5 billion.

We ended up choosing a third option — converting the coal-fired units to run on natural gas — with much lower capital costs: about $200 million. In addition to promoting affordability, this option preserves local jobs and will help us maintain top-tier reliability.

Real-world energy needs typically aren’t considered in levelized cost comparisons that show renewables are cheaper than conventional alternatives. We don’t need to buy fuel for solar arrays and wind farms, helping to make their output affordable — but only when it’s available. That’s why TEP is working to integrate them with other, more reliable options that let us leverage their value.

The truth is that TEP needs a balanced energy mix to serve customers’ diverse energy needs. In more than 130 years of service, we’ve learned that clean and conventional energy resources work better together as part of an “all of the above” approach. It’s the best way to preserve reliable, affordable service as we work toward our environmental goals, including net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs acknowledged TEP’s clean energy leadership earlier this month at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for our new battery storage system, named Roadrunner Reserve. “Tucson Electric Power has been an outstanding partner in making sure that Arizonans have the power that they need,” the governor said, “and the Roadrunner Reserve system is a prime example of their leadership and commitment to our shared future.”

We know these facts don’t sit comfortably with some folks who think “corporate utility” sounds like an insult. Critics on this page prefer a cartoonish vision of utilities represented by Mr. Burns from “The Simpsons,” the boss of a nuclear power plant who once hatched a scheme to block the sun. In reality, though, TEP is working to make the most of Southern Arizona’s abundant solar resource as part of a balanced energy mix that provides affordability and reliability for our customers.

Q: (Via: Nathan Adlen Journalist Facebook) RE: Why do you love Mitsubishi so much?","In this week’s Ask Nathan:

Nissan needs to keep going, but they also need to stop?

I am supposed to explain my “love” for Mitsubishi.

This week’s first question comes from a Nissan fan who has a few issues where the automaker’s design direction is headed.

Q: RE:Nathan! Nissan needs to cease and desist from over-styling their SUVs!

Do you remember when you did that Pathfinder video with your gold one, the R51? I loved it and I was grateful that Nissan began to bring the Pathfinder back to a more off road feel. Then I saw the 2026 model and I became very upset. They made it look like a Rogue. It is all squinted and weak. I can’t believe that when they desperately need to sell more models, Nissan makes their vehicles look worse and worse! I want them to succeeded and they keep letting me down.

It’s been 10 years since I bought my Frontier and it is still running strong. I even brought it all the out to California for the Overland Expo. You commented on it which I am grateful for. But even my brother’s Titan still runs strong and looks good. Nissan has lost their way and I am so worried that they will ruin the new X-Terra when it comes out.

I want them to do better, and I want them to STOP!

— Luca N

A: Yes, I am not sure where they are going with their new design ethos.

I’m not exactly sure where Nissan is heading. The front end styling seems to work with vehicles like the new Leaf. It’s slick and aero-friendly. I am a bit confused by the images of the new Pathfinder, but that may change in person. Yes, it does look a lot like the Rogue.

The R51 Pathfinder is a body-on-frame Nissan SUV produced from 2004 to 2012, built on the F-Alpha platform. It came with a choice of engines, including a 4.0L V6 – which was in mine. The Pathfinder once represented a serious, body-on-frame small truck-based SUV that competed on a high level. In time, it evolved into (what many consider to be) a front-wheel drive station wagon with a CVT and soft styling. A few years back, they remade the Pathfinder, bringing it closer to its roots, and it was a bit more aggressive in terms of styling. Recently, they released photos of its newest Pathfinder, and it has moved paste the beefier look, and have adopted a nose that fits their current design language.

Here’s what’s going on, and why the design language feels both familiar and a little confusing:

1. The “Aero-First” Front-End Direction

Nissan’s newer EVs, like the Leaf and the Ariya, are clearly leaning into a smoother, more sealed-off, aerodynamic nose. That look works on EVs because:

They don’t need a traditional grille.

The slippery shape helps boost range.

The minimalistic front end fits the EV vibe.

So on something like the new Leaf, it fits naturally.

2. The Pathfinder’s New Look… and Why It Feels “Rogue-ish”

The Pathfinder adopting this cleaner, more curved front-end design is what throws people off. Traditionally, Pathfinder leaned boxy, rugged, squared-off, especially after the last redesign. The new one in photos:

Has softer edges

Shares a lot of lighting and grille cues with the Rogue

Doesn’t immediately scream “three-row adventure SUV”

That creates a visual overlap in the lineup—suddenly the Rogue, Murano, and Pathfinder look like they came from the same stencil.

In person, proportions usually fix some of that confusion, so you might indeed see it differently when you stand next to one. Photos flatten out the nose and make the vehicles look more similar than they are.

3. Nissan’s Current Design Strategy (as it appears from the outside)

It looks like they’re trying to:

Unify the brand look (like Hyundai did with the pixel theme, or BMW with… whatever those grilles are)

Transition more models toward EV-like aero styling even if they’re not EVs

Simplify surfaces because clean design ages better

Reduce aggressive shaping, which seems to be falling out of favor

The result?

Some models look sleek and modern… and others start to blend together.

4. Where the Confusion Comes From

Nissan used to have very distinct visual personalities across models:

Frontier looked different from Pathfinder

Pathfinder looked different from Rogue

Altima looked different from Maxima

Now the faces, lighting signatures, and surfacing are getting closer together. Good for brand identity… But not great for enthusiasts who like each model to stand apart.

The last question comes from Facebook (@NathanAdlenJournalist), and it’s coming from a fan who is looking at two pricey electric pickup trucks.

Q: (Via: Nathan Adlen Journalist Facebook) RE: Why do you love Mitsubishi so much?

I heard from a few in your industry that you are a diehard Mitsubishi fanboy. Why?!

— JB788

A: It’s a bit of an exaggeration.

Or, I guess you could say it’s a bit of a misunderstanding. It is true that I do have a little bit of a Mitsubishi Montero fetish, but that’s strictly based on that particular SUV. You see I’ve owned one of each model, date all the way back from the mid 80s all the way to a third generation Mitsubishi Montero.

Rather than convince you that they are outstanding off-road machines, and just a lot of fun to drive, I would rather point out that they have a remarkably successful race in history for the Dakar rally. Additionally, I’m not the only one who thinks that the Mitsubishi Montero is something special. You would be surprised to find many Automotive journalist own one. Or have owned one and lament selling them.

Well, I own another one in the future? There is a good chance that I will, or something similar. I really do like the old off-road from the 80s and 90s that were offered from Japan. Some of them are remarkably flexible, fairly efficient and a lot of fun to modify.

The oil industry, free market folks they are, oppose such choice.

The American Fuel and Chemical Manufacturers has been consistent in its disdain for ethanol. It’s used hundreds of lobbyists and billions in profits to thwart ethanol at every turn, most recently getting 27 members of the U.S. House to write a letter to leadership citing concerns that ethanol could “disadvantage the U.S. refining sector.”

That comes on the heels of the American Petroleum Institute reneging its support for 15% ethanol blend and setting conditions to reconsider support. Those conditions, of course, are to continue to gut the Renewable Fuel Standard.

The oil industry continues to push the narrative that the RFS is only about energy security and how we produce so much oil that the standards are obsolete. The reality is that it is an environmental program with roots all the way back to the Clean Air Act when oxygenates like ethanol were required to get the cancer-causing, smog-forming, deadly compounds refiners use for octane out of gasoline.

Those requirements remain on the books. The single highest value of ethanol is as clean octane replacing toxic carcinogenic aromatics. C. Boyden Gray, White House counsel to George Bush, was a key architect of the Clean Air Act and was often asked why he supported ethanol. His answer was direct.

“Because it saves lives.”

The natural question is why we haven’t addressed this, and the answer is simple. Our leaders in the ethanol industry have failed us. Our leaders in the agricultural industries have failed us. Our leaders in Congress have failed us.

We beg with hat in hand to be “allowed” to add more than 10% ethanol, while the oil industry poisons that same gasoline with 25% or more toxics, contributing to everything from respiratory diseases to neurological ailments.

Why aren’t the ethanol and corn industries suing the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to enact non-discretionary toxic controls? Are they afraid of the oil industry they sell to — the same oil industry that is slowly ensuring ethanol remains a bit player in the fuel mix?

Could it be a backroom deal was struck that the oil industry would give its blessing to E15 if the ethanol industry would not go after aromatics?

Spare us any talk that Donald Trump loves farmers and will support ethanol. Anyone who has ever spent five minutes in Washington understands if Trump really supported ethanol, E15 would have been in the “Big Beautiful Bill.” One phone call from him and it would be done.

We are on our own if we want to save our farmers and have any hope of growing the ethanol industry. While exports have been a welcome addition to the portfolio, enforcing toxic controls with an E30 program here at home would double corn demand and bring aromatics down to minuscule levels.

Ethanol producers and corn growers need to sue the EPA to enforce the law. The South Dakota Farmers Union represents family farmers, and, even with modest resources, has waged this battle for years. We have the data, but have never had the support of national organizations with multimillion dollar budgets who could easily take on the fight.

The future of U.S. LNG dominance will depend on how effectively the industry can adapt to these shifting global dynamics.","As the United States solidifies its position as a global leader in liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, the landscape of international energy trade is undergoing significant shifts. While American LNG vendors have enjoyed robust sales to Europe, recent trends suggest that this Euro-centric focus may not be sustainable in the long term. With European nations increasingly turning to renewable energy sources and reducing their dependency on fossil fuels, U.S. exporters face the dual challenge of finding new markets and competing with established players like Qatar and Australia. The coming years will test the adaptability and strategic foresight of the U.S. LNG industry as it navigates these changing dynamics.

Challenges of a Euro-Centric Strategy

Europe has been a cornerstone of the U.S. LNG export market, accounting for two-thirds of American shipments in 2025. This reliance on Europe began in earnest following the geopolitical upheaval of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which prompted European countries to seek alternatives to Russian gas. However, this heavy focus on Europe now poses risks. As the continent accelerates its transition to renewable energy and enhances energy efficiency, its LNG demand is predicted to decline. The International Energy Agency forecasts a 10% reduction in European Union gas demand by 2035.

U.S. exporters must therefore reassess their strategies to maintain growth. Current trends indicate that the European market will not provide the same level of demand in the future. The shift towards renewables is a logical step for Europe in its quest for energy independence and sustainability, but it leaves American LNG vendors at a crossroads. The question remains: can U.S. exporters find equally lucrative markets elsewhere?

Exploring New Markets Amidst Stiff Competition

As European demand wanes, U.S. LNG exporters are eyeing Asia, the world’s largest LNG importing region. However, penetrating this market is fraught with challenges. Qatar and Australia already dominate Asian LNG imports, bolstered by shorter shipping routes to key consumers like Japan, China, and India. In contrast, U.S. shipments must travel longer distances, incurring higher transit costs and longer delivery times. For example, a journey from Sabine Pass, Louisiana, to India takes more than 30 days, doubling the trip time compared to European destinations and increasing costs.

To compete, U.S. exporters must offer more attractive pricing, which could further erode profit margins. Currently, only 8% of U.S. LNG reaches the top five Asian importers, highlighting the uphill battle American vendors face. The necessity to lower prices while managing rising transit expenses poses a significant financial challenge, potentially impacting the creditworthiness of those in the industry.

Potential Trade Tensions and Geopolitical Implications

The U.S. push into Asian markets may also stir geopolitical tensions. Qatar, for instance, heavily relies on LNG exports for national revenue and has plans to expand its export volumes. Aggressive U.S. maneuvers to capture Asian market share could disrupt these plans and strain diplomatic relations. Moreover, Qatar’s commitment to invest in U.S. LNG facilities may be jeopardized if American expansion efforts threaten its market position.

Other countries like Canada, Russia, and Mozambique are also gearing up to increase their LNG exports, intensifying the competition the U.S. faces in securing new markets.

This crowded field means that U.S. exporters are not only competing with existing players but also with emerging ones that are eager to claim their slice of the pie. The strategic choices made by U.S. LNG companies in navigating these relationships will have far-reaching consequences for the global energy trade landscape.

Economic Considerations and Future Prospects

In light of these challenges, U.S. LNG exporters must carefully evaluate their economic strategies. The financial viability of expanding into new markets hinges on balancing competitive pricing with profitability. The increased cost of shipping to distant regions and the necessity to offer competitive prices are significant hurdles. Moreover, selling to markets with less robust credit profiles than Europe adds an element of financial risk.

Region U.S. Market Share (%) Comparison to Other Exporters Top 5 LNG Importers 8% Low compared to Qatar and Australia Next 5 Largest Importers 44% Higher market share

Despite these challenges, the potential rewards of successfully tapping into Asian markets are substantial. However, U.S. exporters must remain nimble and innovative in their approach, leveraging technological advancements and strategic partnerships to enhance competitiveness. The future of U.S. LNG dominance will depend on how effectively the industry can adapt to these shifting global dynamics. Will American LNG vendors rise to the occasion and secure their place in an increasingly competitive global market?

This move marks a strategic pivot and sharpens its focus on Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing operations.

Hut 8’s latest move to divest its Ontario power plants and sharpen its Bitcoin mining focus has put a spotlight on its recent share price swings. The company’s 32.5% one-year total shareholder return hints at improving long-term momentum, even as the past month’s 27.9% share price pullback follows a stellar 56.9% year-to-date run and strong 46.4% gain over the last quarter.

But with Hut 8’s renewed focus and a share price still well below analyst targets, is this the moment to catch an undervalued disruptor, or is the market already factoring in all the future gains?

Most Popular Narrative: 38.7% Undervalued

Hut 8’s last close of $34.34 sits well below the narrative’s fair value, indicating major upside according to the most closely followed analysis. The narrative’s bullish stance is rooted in Hut 8’s evolving business model and future platform scale.

The Power First strategy, featuring sizable pipeline origination (10.8 GW under diligence; 3.1 GW under exclusivity) and dual-purpose sites for both Bitcoin mining and AI compute, provides scalability and flexibility to benefit from rising institutional adoption of digital assets and accelerating demand for clean energy-powered blockchain infrastructure. This is expected to bolster future revenue and earnings growth.

Analysts are banking on a business pivot and a massive operational leap driving revenue to new heights. Find out the hidden assumptions and aggressive forecasts behind the most optimistic price target Hut 8 has seen to date.

Result: Fair Value of $56 (UNDERVALUED)

However, Hut 8’s heavy dependence on Bitcoin pricing and significant exposure to regulatory shifts around natural gas remain major risks that could derail these optimistic forecasts.

Another View: A Look Through Market Ratios

Taking a step back from the narrative-driven valuation, market ratios paint a less optimistic picture. Hut 8 trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 18.2x, which is comfortably below the US Software sector’s 28.8x but above its own fair ratio of 11.7x. This gap suggests the market may be pricing in more future growth than fundamentals currently support, introducing valuation risk alongside opportunity.

""Faster EV charging is around the corner,"" Singh wrote.","One of the country's leading electric vehicle charging station operators is partnering with a power management specialist to connect ports to direct current grids, making a 10-minute recharge a reality, according to USA Today.

It's ""a major innovation,"" ChargePoint CEO Rick Wilmer said.

It's energizing news for America's EV sector from a company that already has a million places to charge in North America and Europe. ChargePoint's network has powered 17 billion electric miles, according to the California-based business.

Now, Ireland-based Eaton is helping ChargePoint add high-wattage and efficient stations that are directly connected to the grid, providing DC fast charging akin to Tesla's Supercharger network but even faster, according to the newspaper. Superchargers can provide 200 miles in about 15 minutes, for reference.

""The United States may even catch up to China's record EV charging time of five minutes for a partial recharge,"" USA Today's Charles Singh wrote.

Home charging remains the cheapest option, according to Qmerit. It's a trusted resource that can help you compare quotes for Level 2 chargers and installation.

Level 2 units can juice 25 miles an hour, which is great for overnight power-ups at home when motorists can reap lower-cost electricity rates during off-peak times, Qmerit reported.

The company added that home charging can save hundreds to thousands of dollars a year compared to gas fueling. Motorists can save money using faster public chargers, too, but the amount is less and can vanish, depending on utility rates and other factors. A standard wall outlet is the slowest method, providing about five miles an hour.

A robust network of fast options is crucial for long trips, and Wilmer said ChargePoint's upgrades will provide smaller, faster, money-saving chargers that are more efficient, according to USA Today.

Ionna is another effort by a partnership of eight automakers working to add thousands of stations across the country in coming years. Experts in India are developing a universal charger that can work with a variety of voltages, as another example of a charging innovation.

For their part, U.S. EV sales hit an all-time high of 438,000 in the third quarter as customers rushed to take advantage of $7,500 in tax breaks that expired in September, according to Cox Automotive. Cox added that sales will be more challenging without the perks, though certain states still offer lucrative incentives for buying and charging EVs.

EV owners also enjoy around $1,500 a year in fuel and maintenance savings with no more pesky oil changes. Home solar adds to the benefits by providing free sun energy to charge the rides. The Cool Down's trusted Solar Explorer has partners that can help you compare quotes, find an installer, and secure tax breaks that can save up to $10,000. Those tax credits expire Dec. 31.

That's in addition to preventing thousands of pounds of planet-warming air pollution when replacing a dirty fuel-burning ride, according to the Department of Energy. The fumes are linked by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to lung, heart, and other health risks.

As for fast public charging, USA Today reported that ChargePoint expects to start delivering the upgraded components next year.

This shift comes amid rising U.S. shale oil production costs and a seeming scarcity of profitable drilling locations. Key players in the industry are making strategic moves, including Calgary-based Baytex Energy Corp. and Denver-based Ovintiv Inc., indicating a potential pivot towards Canadian resources. This article delves into the implications of these developments and examines the factors driving U.S. interest in Canada’s oil and gas sector.

U.S. Companies Make Strategic Canadian Moves

In recent weeks, significant transactions in the Canadian oilpatch have caught the attention of U.S. energy producers. Baytex Energy Corp. announced its decision to sell its U.S. shale operations for $3.25 billion, signaling a strategic shift back to its Canadian roots. The move is part of a broader trend observed among energy companies rebalancing their portfolios to capitalize on Canadian resources. This shift is exemplified by Ovintiv Inc.’s $3.8 billion acquisition of NuVista Energy Ltd., marking its second major Montney purchase in two years.

According to industry experts, these acquisitions reflect a strategic realignment. Jeremy McCrea, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, suggests that companies like Ovintiv are finding more value and potential for growth in Canadian assets compared to their U.S. counterparts. The promise of higher returns and better deals north of the border is appealing to companies operating in both countries. As U.S. producers face increasing operational costs and limited drilling opportunities, Canada’s competitive advantages are becoming more attractive.

Canada’s Appeal: Inventory and Profitability

The resurgence of interest in Canadian energy assets is not without reason. Canada’s oil and gas sector offers significant advantages in terms of drilling inventory and well profitability. Regions like the Montney and the Duvernay have become focal points for U.S. producers seeking more sustainable and cost-effective operations. Unlike many U.S. shale regions, these Canadian plays feature wells with slower decline rates and reduced capital requirements for maintenance.

Scott Barron from TD Securities highlights the growing interest among U.S. producers in Canadian opportunities. Companies are actively signing confidentiality agreements and evaluating potential acquisitions. Canada’s deep drilling inventory and attractive asset pricing relative to the U.S. make it an appealing destination for expansion. However, complexities remain, particularly regarding pipeline infrastructure and regulatory challenges. U.S. companies are conducting thorough due diligence to navigate these issues effectively.

Impact of Regulatory and Export Developments

Recent regulatory and export developments in Canada have contributed to the renewed interest from U.S. and foreign investors. Prime Minister Mark Carney’s initiatives to fast-track major resource projects have instilled confidence in the market. Additionally, the startup of LNG Canada and expanded export capacity from projects like the Trans Mountain pipeline have alleviated some investor concerns.

These infrastructure improvements are crucial for addressing the bottlenecks and capacity challenges that have historically impacted Western Canada’s energy sector. With enhanced export potential, Canadian oil and gas assets are becoming more appealing to investors seeking long-term growth. However, the market is still awaiting a significant transaction that could signal a broader shift in investment patterns.

Private Equity’s Role in the Canadian Oilpatch

U.S. private equity firms are playing a pivotal role in the resurgence of interest in Canada’s energy sector. Firms like NGP Energy Capital Management LLC and Carlyle Group Inc. have provided substantial backing for recent transactions. Cygnet Energy’s all-cash offer for Kiwetinohk Energy Corp., largely funded by these U.S. private equity backers, underscores the growing confidence in Canada’s oil and gas potential.

These private equity investments indicate a belief in the improving regulatory environment and export prospects. While U.S. producers are showing interest, the market is still anticipating a major transaction that could solidify Canada’s position as a prime destination for energy investments. As regulatory conditions continue to evolve, the role of private equity in facilitating these deals is likely to grow.

The renewed interest in Canada’s oil and gas sector from U.S. producers and investors signifies a potential shift in investment dynamics. As companies navigate regulatory complexities and pipeline infrastructure challenges, the Canadian oilpatch offers substantial opportunities for growth and profitability. Will these developments lead to a lasting transformation in North American energy investment patterns, or are we witnessing a temporary trend driven by current market conditions?

“The technology to implement the Coke Oven Rule is not available,” Trump stated in the proclamation.
The administration said the exemption will prevent supply chain disruptions affecting military hardware, construction materials, transportation, and critical infrastructure.
Trump’s energy and industrial policy has consistently leaned toward regulatory rollback, citing job preservation and national security.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — President Donald J. Trump has temporarily rolled back key federal emissions requirements on coke oven facilities, issuing a two-year exemption that the administration says is necessary to safeguard America’s steelmaking capacity, national security, and industrial resilience.

In a proclamation signed Friday, the president suspended compliance deadlines in a 2024 Environmental Protection Agency rule that imposed new hazardous-air-pollution standards on coke ovens. Metallurgical coke — a specialized fuel essential to blast furnace steelmaking — supports roughly 70 percent of all domestic steel production.

The administration argues that the EPA rule requires emissions-control technologies that do not yet exist in a commercially viable form, placing operators in an “impossible position” of attempting to engineer unproven systems on accelerated timelines. The White House said the risk of shuttered coke facilities, stalled production, and long-term damage to the steel sector justified the temporary regulatory relief.

“The technology to implement the Coke Oven Rule is not available,” Trump stated in the proclamation. “It is in the national security interests of the United States to issue this exemption.”

Under the proclamation, the stationary sources identified in an accompanying annex will follow pre-2024 emissions standards for the next two years. The administration said the exemption will prevent supply chain disruptions affecting military hardware, construction materials, transportation, and critical infrastructure.

A fact sheet released by the White House emphasized that the Biden-era rule relied on monitoring and testing methods the industry cannot yet implement safely or reliably. Without relief, officials warned, the United States could face diminished steel capacity and increased reliance on foreign producers for core industrial metals.

The administration framed the move as part of a broader strategy to balance environmental protections with economic security. Trump previously issued similar delays for emissions rules affecting copper smelting, coal plants, taconite iron ore processing, and chemical manufacturers tied to defense and semiconductor production.

Trump’s energy and industrial policy has consistently leaned toward regulatory rollback, citing job preservation and national security. The proclamation notes earlier actions, including the repeal of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, a pause on wind energy expansion, and the use of Section 232 tariffs to curb foreign steel imports.

Big plans

The Prime Minister visited the Damlaagte and Ilikwa solar power plants in the Free State province in South Africa. The facilities were developed by Mainstream Renewable Power, in which Norway’s Aker Horizons ASA is a major shareholder. Together, These two power plants will be able to supply electricity equivalent to the annual consumption of roughly 120 000 households.

South Africa is currently highly dependent on coal, which accounts for approximately 85 % of the country’s power production.

‘Norway is an energy nation, and our knowledge and expertise are making a difference far beyond our own borders. These solar power plants are an excellent example of how Norwegian investments are being used to advance the green transition across the world. Plants such as this also create new jobs,’ said the Prime Minister.

The Damlaagte project employed more than 1 700 workers during its construction and has a permanent staff of 19 to oversee operations. Mainstream Renewable Power has developed and built 850 MW of renewable energy generation assets in South Africa and is planning to establish a further 12 GW in the coming years. This is equivalent to the electricity consumption of 2.8 million households.

Public and private

‘This project demonstrates how private companies and the public sector can work together to achieve common goals. Norad provided NOK 20 million in grants for feasibility studies. This made it possible to identify and lower potential risks to companies, which facilitated realisation of the project. Norway can help to accelerate the energy transition by making profitable investments, and sharing its technology, knowledge and experience. This is an approach that we are proud to support,’ said the Prime Minister.

Norway is investing widely in renewable energy development in South Africa. Norway is supporting South Africa’s long-term plan to phase out coal, and helping to mitigate the country’s energy crisis and implement the green transition. Norwegian companies such as Scatec, Aker ASA (through Mainstream Renewable Power), Magnora, and Valinor/Norsk Renewables have won numerous tenders for projects in South Africa since 2010, including projects involving large solar power plants, wind farms and hybrid systems combining solar power and battery storage systems.

Norfund (the Norwegian investment fund for developing countries) has invested approximately NOK 5 billion in South Africa, predominantly in renewable energy efforts. These investments have helped to boost capacity, create new jobs and reduce emissions.

The shift towards electric vehicles means the government will get less revenue from fuel duties in the coming years.
""EV [drivers], like drivers of petrol and diesel cars, are driving on roads that require maintenance.""
""We need to have a fair taxation system that is future-focused, but we're not going to do anything to jeopardise the transition to electric vehicles,"" she said.
""Ordinary families are facing increased taxes and spiralling inflation under Labour, yet the government's priority is handing out discounts on new electric cars,"" the Conservative MP said.","The government is expected to announce an extra £1.3bn in funding for a scheme encouraging the use of electric vehicles (EVs) at next week's Budget.

The Electric Car Grant scheme started in July as part of the move to zero emission vehicles. The government says it has helped 35,000 switch to EVs.

However, early research suggests there is little indication the scheme has attracted entirely new buyers.

There will also be money to create more charging points, and a consultation on helping people without driveways to charge their cars.

It is also possible EV owners could face a new tax elsewhere in Wednesday's Budget in the form of a pay-per-mile charge in future.

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander the told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that subsidising EV sales would support economic growth.

""This is an investment in the country's future... and the good quality manufacturing jobs associated with that,"" she said, pointing to production of the Nissan Leaf in Sunderland.

""So making sure that we are enabling people to buy a new electric vehicle if that's what they want to do, whilst also investing in charging infrastructure, it is the right long-term decision.""

All new cars will have to be electric or hybrid from 2030, when a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars comes into force.

The Electric Car Grant scheme, which provides a discount of up to £3,750 on eligible vehicles, was launched with an initial fund of £650m.

New AutoMotive, a non-profit organisation supporting the UK's transition to electric vehicles, found in a recent study that the scheme had yet to expand the market for EVs.

EVs covered by the scheme made up 23.8% of new registrations in September, the same as their share before the Electric Car Grant was announced, New Automotive said.

""It isn't yet clear that it's prompting consumers to consider buying cars that they wouldn't have gone ahead and bought anyway,"" David Farrar, policy manager for New AutoMotive, said at the time.

The Budget is also expected to announce a further £200m for speeding up the rollout of chargepoints across the UK.

Data from Zapmap shows almost 87,000 points across the UK, in about 44,000 locations. Those include places like supermarket car parks and lamppost chargers.

""The proposed funding will support the creation of thousands of charge points and provide extra resources for local authorities to ramp up charging infrastructure on local streets - making it easier for everyone to access reliable charging, including those without off-street parking,"" the government said.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves, it added, was ""expected to publish a consultation on Permitted Development Rights to make it easier and cheaper for people without a driveway to charge"".

However, it is also possible that EV owners could face a new tax in the Budget in the form of a pay-per-mile charge from 2028 to mirror the fuel duty that drivers of petrol and diesel cars pay.

The shift towards electric vehicles means the government will get less revenue from fuel duties in the coming years.

The transport secretary did not rule out a new tax on EV drivers' road use, saying support for the transition to EVs needed to be balanced with a ""fair vehicle taxation system for all motorists"".

""EV [drivers], like drivers of petrol and diesel cars, are driving on roads that require maintenance.""

""We've got ageing infrastructure, motorways that were built back in the sixties and seventies,"" Alexander said.

""We need to have a fair taxation system that is future-focused, but we're not going to do anything to jeopardise the transition to electric vehicles,"" she said.

Reeves is being urged not to raise taxes on drivers overall, with campaigners preparing to deliver a petition to Downing Street early next week which calls for fuel duty, long frozen, not to be increased.

Richard Holden, the shadow transport secretary, said that ""handing out £1.5bn in EV subsidies while hard-working taxpayers are squeezed dry"" was ""madness"".

""Ordinary families are facing increased taxes and spiralling inflation under Labour, yet the government's priority is handing out discounts on new electric cars,"" the Conservative MP said.

Reeves is expected to increase some taxes in the Budget after saying she means to bring down NHS waiting lists, the national debt and the cost of living.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lmsI_4hvvk5bJ0WUtjZwiw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/9b88648e89c5b2181d706e484817f494,N,,2025-11-23 12:01:19.008952

EYEING GLOBAL MARKET Already the world's largest exporter of passenger cars, China is turning its sights to the global electric truck market.","HANOI, Vietnam -- China is replacing its diesel trucks with electric models faster than expected, potentially reshaping global fuel demand and the future of heavy transport.

In 2020, nearly all new trucks in China ran on diesel. By the first half of 2025, battery-powered trucks accounted for 22% of new heavy truck sales, up from 9.2% in the same period in 2024, according to Commercial Vehicle World, a Beijing-based trucking data provider. The British research firm BMI forecasts electric trucks will reach nearly 46% of new sales this year and 60% next year.

Heavy trucks carry the lifeblood of modern economies. They also contribute significantly to global emissions of carbondioxide: In 2019, road freight generated a third of all transport-related carbon emissions.

Trucking has been considered hard to decarbonize since electric trucks with heavy batteries can carry less cargo than those using energy-dense diesel. Proponents of liquefied natural gas have viewed it as a less polluting option while technology for electric heavy vehicles matures.

Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid fuel for easy storage and transport.

China's trucking fleet, the world's second-largest after the U.S., still mainly runs on diesel, but the landscape is shifting. Transport fuel demand is plateauing, according to the International Energy Agency and diesel use in China could decline faster than many expect, said Christopher Doleman, an analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Electric trucks now outsell LNG models in China, so its demand for fossil fuels could fall, and ""in other countries, it might never take off,"" he said.

The share of electrics in new truck sales, from 8% in 2024 to 28% by August 2025, has more than tripled as prices have fallen. Electric trucks outsold LNG-powered vehicles in China for five consecutive months this year, according to Commercial Vehicle World.

While electric trucks are two to three times more expensive than diesel ones and cost roughly 18% more than LNG trucks, their higher energy efficiency and lower costs can save owners an estimated 10% to 26% over the vehicle's lifetime, according to research by Chinese scientists.

""When it comes to heavy trucks, the fleet owners in China are very bottom-line driven,"" Doleman said.

Early sales were buoyed by generous government incentives like a 2024 scheme for truck owners to trade in old vehicles. Owners can get up to about $19,000 to replace older trucks with newer or electric models.

Investments in charging infrastructure are also boosting demand for electric trucks.

Major logistics hubs, including in the Yangtze River Delta, have added dedicated charging stations along key freight routes. Cities like Beijing and Shanghai have built heavy-duty charging hubs along highways that can charge trucks in minutes.

CATL, the world's largest maker of electric vehicle batteries, launched a time-saving battery-swapping system for heavy trucks in May and said it plans a nationwide network of swap stations covering about 93,000 miles out of China's about 114,000 miles of expressways.

The surge in sales of electric trucks is cutting diesel use and could reshape future LNG demand, analysts say.

Diesel consumption in China, the second-largest consumer of the fuel after the U.S., fell to 3.9 million barrels per day in June 2024, down 11% year-on-year and the largest drop since mid-2021, partly reflecting the shift to LNG and electric trucks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

""The rise of China's electric truck sector is one of the more under-reported stories in the global energy transition, especially given its potential impact on regional diesel trade flows,"" said Tim Daiss of APAC Energy Consultancy.

LNG truck sales peaked in Sept 2023 and March 2024 after China eased transport restrictions imposed during the covid-19 pandemic, said Liuhanzi Yang of the International Council on Clean Transportation Beijing. By June 2025, sales had slipped 6% as electric trucks gained ground.

Shell's 2025 LNG Outlook projects that demand for imported LNG in China, the world's largest LNG importer, will continue to rise partly due to LNG trucks. It also suggests LNG trucking might expand to other markets, such as India.

China's electric trucks are already cutting oil demand by the equivalent of more than a million barrels a day, estimates the New York-based research provider Rhodium Group.

But Doleman views LNG as a ""transitional step"" unlikely to be seen apart from in China, where a vast pipeline infrastructure, abundant domestic gas production and byproducts like coke oven gas created conditions conducive to LNG-fueled trucking not seen elsewhere.

China is planning new emission standards for vehicles that will limit multiple pollutants and set average greenhouse gas targets across a manufacturer's fleet. This will make it ""almost impossible"" for companies relying solely on fossil-fuel vehicles to comply, Yang said.

A 2020 ICCT study found LNG-fueled trucks cut emissions by 2%-9% over 100 years but can be more polluting in the short run due to leaks of methane, a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide.

Modern diesel now nearly matches LNG in air-quality performance.

EYEING GLOBAL MARKET

Already the world's largest exporter of passenger cars, China is turning its sights to the global electric truck market.

Chinese automakers have kept costs down and sped up truck manufacturing while ensuring different parts work seamlessly together with in-house production of most key components, from batteries to motors and electronics, said Bill Russo, founder and CEO of the Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility Limited.

China's hyperactive delivery industry, particularly urban freight trucks, has been an early proving ground for these vehicles, he noted.

In 2021-2023, exports of Chinese heavy-duty trucks including EVs to the Middle East and North Africa grew about 73% annually while shipments to Latin America rose 46%, according to a McKinsey & Company report. The share of electrics is expected to grow, though limited charging infrastructure could pose a challenge.

China's Sany Heavy Industry says it will start exporting its electric trucks to Europe in 2026. It has already exported some electric trucks to the U.S., Asian countries like Thailand and India, and the the United Arab Emirates, among others.

In June, Chinese EV maker BYD broke ground in Hungary for an electric truck and bus factory, with an eye toward a mandatory European target of cutting carbon emissions from new trucks by 90% by 2040 compared to 2019 levels.

Prices of zero-emission trucks in Europe must roughly halve to become affordable alternatives to diesel, according to another study in 2024 by McKinsey.

Volvo told The Associated Press that it didn't comment on competitors but welcomed ""competition on fair terms,"" while Scania did not respond.

It was welcomed by some as a decent outcome amid fraught negotiations -- and the absence of the United States -- but dismissed as falling short by others.

Here's a round-up of key reactions:

- Lula -

Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva -- who had staked political capital in the success of what he dubbed ""the COP of truth"" -- applauded that ""science prevailed"" and ""multilateralism won"" during the talks.

""We mobilized civil society, academia, the private sector, indigenous peoples, and social movements, making COP30 the COP with the second-highest participation in history.""

- Europe -

""We're not going to hide the fact that we would have preferred to have more, to have more ambition on everything,"" EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra told reporters, while saying the deal was still ""the right direction.""

French ecological transition minister Monique Barbut was more frank: ""I couldn't call this COP a success,"" she said.

But while ""this deal won't raise our overall level of ambition,"" she said ""it doesn't disrupt any of the previous momentum"" either.

British energy secretary Ed Miliband told AFP ""that's what this COP process is like. You look over the long sweep of history -- it had delivered change.""

""Every COP has frustrations.""

- Colombia -

The president of Colombia Gustavo Petro slammed the deal's lack of plan to phase out fossil fuels, saying Colombia ""does not accept"" that the declaration ""doesn't say with clarity, as science does, that the cause of the climate crisis is fossil fuels.""

- India, South Africa, Brazil, China -

But India praised the deal as ""meaningful.""

""We fully support the (COP30) presidency and recognize the outstanding efforts of the presidency team, including spending many sleepless nights working to ensure that we leave with something meaningful from Belem,"" said a representative from India, speaking on behalf of the BASIC coalition of Brazil, South Africa, India, and China.

China meanwhile was ""happy with the outcome.""

China's Vice Minister of Ecology and Environment, Li Gao, told AFP that COP 30 would go down as ""success in a very difficult situation.""

- Less-developed countries -

Evans Njewa, who represented a group of 44 less-developed countries, said ""we didn't win on all fronts, but we got tripling adaptation finance by 2035.""

""Thanks for siding with 1.6 billion vulnerable people,"" Njewa said of the inhabitants of the African, Asian and island countries he reps. ""This was our priority, and we made it a red line.""

And the Alliance of Small Island States called the deal ""imperfect"" but still a step towards ""progress.""

- Guterres -

The head of the United Nations commended the weeks of efforts but said he understood that ""many may feel disappointed"" with the results, including Indigenous people, youth, and those now feeling the worst impacts of climate change.

""I cannot pretend that COP30 has delivered everything that is needed,"" read a statement from Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who said ""the gap between where we are and what science demands remains dangerously wide.""

""I will continue pushing for higher ambition and greater solidarity.""

- NGOs -

The talks also were closely watched by non-governmental organizations working in the climate sector.

The head of the World Resources Institute, Ani Dasgupta, heralded COP30 for delivering ""breakthroughs to triple adaptation finance, protect the world's forests and elevate the voices of Indigenous people like never before.""

But the formal negotiations fell short in many respects, he said, notably on the lack of a fossil fuel phaseout plan, leading to a ""weakened"" deal.

Ilan Zugman, Latin American and Caribbean director for the organization 350.org, said that ""the lack of concrete commitments in the final text of COP30 shows us who is still benefiting from the delay: the fossil fuel industry and the ultrarich, not those living the climate crisis every day.""

We focus on multiple SDGs and they form the main pillars of our sustainability strategy across E,S&G.","Aramex centres its sustainability work on its supply chain and fleet as it links global markets.

The company adopts a light-asset model, which means it relies on partners for many transport assets rather than owning them and this lets it adjust its network with less waste and lower emissions. It places climate action, renewable energy and fleet transition inside its market plans so each country team owns delivery.

Group Chief Sustainability Officer Manosij Ganguli leads this work across strategy and daily operations. His aim is to embed sustainability in every link of the chain so it supports competitiveness and resilience for Aramex and for customers.

He applies experience from the Energy Transitions Commission and the Mission Possible Partnership, where he shapes net zero pathways for aviation, shipping and road transport, as well as his earlier roles at BP, Shell and in strategy consulting.

Manosij focuses on scale. He states that “connecting the world” and “net zero by 2050” are goals that reinforce each other, so fleet and logistics choices must match both.

Aramex sets out action on fuel use, route efficiency, asset choice, circularity and ESG reporting to build a cleaner network. In this Q&A for World Sustainable Transport Day, he sets out how this delivery model works.

How is Aramex building on sustainability in the Middle East?

Aramex was founded in the Middle East, so the region is not just a geography for us; it is our beginning. The Middle East is emerging as an important global logistics hub, with increasing trade flows and substantial infrastructure investments.

At the same time, it is already vulnerable to climate risks such as extreme heat and water scarcity. This combination means a logistics company in this region cannot ignore sustainability and still claim to be a long-term player.

Our response has been to develop a sustainability strategy that complements our commercial strategy, rather than being subordinate to it.

In practice, this means setting clear climate targets and focusing on three key areas in the region.

First, decarbonising operations: we are investing in solar power at facilities in markets such as the UAE, Jordan and Egypt and improving energy efficiency in our hubs and offices.

Second, transforming our fleet: our strategy is to convert vehicles to low-emission models, introduce EVs and use sustainable fuels where they are available and viable.

Third, we are embedding circularity by reducing material use, shifting to degradable pouches and tightening our waste management systems. I also examine the regional signalling effect, which means that when a Middle East-based logistics company can expand, uphold service excellence and reduce emissions simultaneously, it sends a powerful message to the market.

It proves that the region can be a leader in sustainable logistics innovation, rather than merely being a consumer of global ideas. This is the role we envision for Aramex.

What is Aramex doing to decarbonise its journey?

When you examine logistics through an honest lens, the most significant environmental issue is clear: carbon.

Emissions from vehicles, facilities and the broader transport value chain are where we have the largest impact.

For a light-asset company like Aramex, this includes not only what we own, but also what we contract with airlines, sea lines and road partners. So, decarbonisation is not a “nice to have”; it is our core environmental priority.

We have worked on and created our new sustainability strategy which is grounded in real world data, which has since been blessed by our board.

Our new sustainability strategy commits to a significant reduction in carbon emission by 2030 and sets out a Net Zero Emission target for 2050. We will be focusing on reducing direct and indirect emissions, including the electrification and use of HVO in our owned fleet as well as switching to renewable energy deployment and purchasing renewable energy from the grid.

Further gains can be expected through the development and delivery of new green products.

The new strategy both reaffirms our dedication to transparency and accountability, while seeking to create value for the business, customers and shareholders.

What does circularity and green innovation look like for/in the Middle East?

In this region, circularity is not an abstract concept. You feel it when you design a warehouse cooling system for a 45-degree summer, or when you think about water use in a desert environment.

For a logistics company like Aramex, the circular question is straightforward: how do we move more parcels with less energy, fewer materials and less waste?

We started by mapping where our material and resource use is most intense. To give you an example of real world change - Aramex has accelerated its sustainability initiatives across global operations, driving measurable environmental, social and operational impact.

From renewable energy and fleet electrification to smart logistics and water management, Aramex’s projects demonstrate innovation, efficiency and commitment to the ESG strategy, circular economy and decarbonisation roadmap.

We have already generated 12,610,363 kWh of renewable energy in 2024, equivalent to 19% of electricity consumed and avoided 5190 tonnes of CO₂e.

Innovation here is also digital. As someone who has worked on sector roadmaps, I know that “green” and “smart” often go hand in hand.

We are using better data and optimisation tools to cut empty kilometres, improve load factors and plan smarter routes. These changes reduce emissions and fuel use and they also improve service reliability.

Over time, I envision the Middle East serving as a test bed for circular logistics models under real-world constraints.

If we can make these models work in hot, fast-growing cities with complex supply chains, they will be robust enough to scale. That is where Aramex can add value to the sector, not just to our own operations.

How is Aramex aligning with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals?

The UN Sustainable Development Goals help frame a simple question: are we solving problems in a narrow way, or are we contributing to broader economic and social resilience as well?

At Aramex, we use the SDGs as a reference point to balance climate, people, communities and governance. We focus on multiple SDGs and they form the main pillars of our sustainability strategy across E,S&G.

From a climate perspective, Climate Action (SDG 13) and Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7) underpin our net zero 2050 ambition, our 2030 emissions reduction targets and our drive for renewables and energy efficiency.

For me, a credible logistics business in this region must demonstrate not only that it is creating jobs but also doing so in a way that protects and develops its people.

Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12) guides our work on packaging, circularity and resource use. We also place strong emphasis on Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17).

From a sectoral view, logistics decarbonisation and circularity cannot be delivered by a single company alone.

We engage with the UN Global Compact, regional business councils, green building councils and other platforms to share our experiences and push for clear, transparent standards. Our reporting backs the SDGs.

Aramex has a long-standing track record of sustainability and integrated reporting and we are aligning with emerging standards, including IFRS.

For me, this is about discipline. If we claim to contribute to the SDGs, we must be prepared to share our numbers, identify our gaps and outline our plans.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/66cd8d3d501f8ca9b2c9980f71ddcc3c:c5e3ea60cb1b711a7d29caeb8493dd5a/mg-image-1.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 08:58:56.317857

His company, X-energy, is making progress on possibly becoming the first to energize a small modular nuclear reactor in the U.S. The four planned reactors are set to power a Dow Chemical facility on the Texas coast.

Sell's company has a lot to boast about. At the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin on Thursday, he ticked off what he sees as groundwork for his company to become a leader in the nuclear power industry, which has seen a surge of interest in recent years as political and regulatory forces have aligned behind nuclear power.

X-energy has raised $2 billion in capital. Amazon bought a 20% stake in the company in hopes of using it to power data centers, and the company is working through the federal regulatory process -- sped up thanks to a Trump administration -- to obtain approval to build reactors at the Dow Chemical site in Seadrift.

""We have a lot of really important players that bought into our story that believe in us,"" Sell said during the panel.

In Texas, enthusiasm about nuclear energy has exploded in the past three years. It enjoys bipartisan support at the Capitol and has a major cheerleader in Gov. Greg Abbott, who helped promote what became a $350 million grant program for nuclear power research and development.

X-energy has been at the forefront of the shift in attitudes toward nuclear power, playing a role in getting Abbott's attention in 2023 on an industry that has atrophied in recent decades, said Reed Clay, a former Abbott staffer and head of the advocacy group Texas Nuclear Alliance. Now, the state is working to build a supply chain for nuclear power.

For instance, the Texas A&M University System has created a nuclear proving ground at a campus in Bryan. Abilene Christian University is designing a research reactor on its campus with some funding from the state. Both are focused on small modular reactors.

The selling point behind smaller reactors is the promise of creating an industry that relies on an assembly line that builds reactors quickly and avoids the cost overruns and delays of large, legacy nuclear power plants.

Sell lives in Dallas but leads a company with major operations in Maryland and Tennessee. He said it is a foregone conclusion that a lot of nuclear power will be built in the U.S. Many energy experts view it as a national security imperative as the U.S. competes with foreign adversaries over dominance in developing power-hungry artificial intelligence.

BUT CAN TEXAS LEAD?

""How does Texas rise to the top? Same way it always does: an incredibly business-friendly environment, an incredibly rich and well-resourced talent base, people that want to live here, an educational system that produces great talent,"" Sell said in an interview. ""It's the story that has been written about Texas for the last 25 years.""

Sell added that Texas is on track to be the leader in nuclear energy.

The worry, he said, is that competitors might trip up the momentum. Support for nuclear power has increased in recent years, but the industry is susceptible to sudden shifts in public opinion when something goes wrong.

""The failure of my competitors affects me worse than their success,"" Sell said.

""There are serious players and there are less-serious players,"" he added. ""There are folks playing it for the long haul, and there are folks playing it for the near-term game.""

Sell said X-energy is on track for regulatory approval of its Texas reactors in the fourth quarter of 2026.

SOURCE: XCF Global, Inc.","Policy Momentum: Federal and state policy alignment is accelerating nationwide SAF adoption

Market Opportunity: U.S. SAF market projected at $7 billion by 2030, with a $25 billion global opportunity

Strategic Investment: $350 million invested in the New Rise Reno facility, advancing America’s push to decarbonize aviation

XCF Global, Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”), today commented on the expanding policy momentum supporting SAF adoption across the United States.

Momentum is building fast. Under the U.S. SAF Grand Challenge, federal targets call for 3 billion gallons of annual production by 2030 – scaling to 35 billion gallons by 2050 to meet 100% of domestic demand. Today, production remains below 1% of U.S. jet fuel use, underscoring both the urgency and the scale of the opportunity.

The U.S. SAF market is expected to grow more than seven-fold – from approximately $860 million in 2024 to nearly $7 billion by 2030 – representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~47%. Globally, the SAF market is projected to exceed $25 billion, with worldwide demand surpassing 5.5 billion gallons over the same period.

At the state level, momentum is accelerating in parallel. California, Oregon, Washington, and New Mexico have adopted low-carbon fuel standards that include SAF, and five additional states are advancing similar frameworks. Collectively, these states represent nearly 40% of total U.S. jet fuel consumption, creating a rapidly expanding incentive landscape for SAF deployment.

“Policy momentum is transforming aspiration into execution,” said Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global. “The U.S. is making it clear that sustainable aviation fuel is essential to the future of aviation. With supportive federal and state frameworks, airlines and energy companies can move beyond pilot programs and commit to long-term, scalable decarbonization strategies. At XCF, we’re building one of America’s leading SAF platforms – designed to scale production, strengthen domestic supply chains, and meet the growing demand for home-grown, low-carbon fuels.”

From inception, approximately $350 million has been invested in XCF’s flagship New Rise Reno facility. The company is advancing a project pipeline of three additional sites. The second facility, New Rise Reno 2, located adjacent to the existing site, will share utilities and logistics infrastructure to maximize efficiencies. XCF expects construction to begin in 2026 and operations from 2028, following an additional $300 million investment that is expected to double production capacity to ~80 million gallons per year.

As global demand accelerates, the U.S. has an opportunity to not only meet its own decarbonization goals but also to become a leading exporter of low-carbon fuels. Expanding domestic SAF production supports the Make More in America Initiative, creates high-tech, clean-energy jobs, and strengthens the nation’s competitiveness in the global energy transition.

“America’s aviation industry has always thrived on innovation,” Cooper continued. “With clear policy alignment and accelerating demand, the U.S. has a generational opportunity to lead the world in sustainable aviation. XCF is committed to turning that opportunity into action – transforming today’s policy commitments into tomorrow’s progress.”

As the Trump administration methodically throws up roadblocks to slow, if not stop, carbon-free renewable solar and wind power, carbon-free nuclear appears to be the go-to idea for large amounts of power that are presumed to be needed in the future for data centers, AI and more.

Nevermind that before two new nuclear plants opened in Georgia in 2023 and 2024 — seven years late and double their original budget — there had been no new nuclear power plants in the U.S. in more than 30 years.

Now the chatter is around so-called small modular and micro-reactors — touted as easier, cheaper, and faster, leading to a public perception they are ready to be pulled off the shelf and plugged in.

But here’s the problem with that. They don’t exist yet.

Former Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chair Allison Macfarlane, now director of the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at the University of British Columbia, is among those who are frustrated with the public and governmental belief about small modular reactors, also known as SMRs.

“They do think that,” she said of the public perception that small nuclear reactors are an immediate option to help meet energy needs. “A lot of the media writes about these things as if they do exist. ‘We know that they’re cheap, we know that they’re safe.’ But we don’t know anything, because they don’t exist.”

But they are in development. As of last summer, the Nuclear Energy Agency dashboard listed 127 different small modular reactor designs in existence globally, with about 60% of them in active stages of research and development.

There are three reactors operating around the world that are reported to be small reactors: A floating one in Russia powering a remote Arctic region and two in China, but details about those projects have not been shared.

The SMRs are often bundled under the category of advanced nuclear energy. That advanced designation generally refers to the supposedly newer ways they are cooled, and changes to pressurization and uranium formulation common to the water-cooled light-water reactors that comprise most of the world-wide nuclear reactor fleet today.

“Advanced is rather a misnomer of a term,” Macfarlane said, echoing the views of others. “It should really be non-light-water, because ‘advanced’ suggests there’s something new here, and there isn’t anything new. Most of these technologies have been tried for 50 to 70 years.”

She said eight countries have tried to build more than 25 different versions of one of the technologies — sodium-cooled fast reactors. “No one has been able to get them to produce electricity economically, viably and reliably.”

What do we know and what don’t we know about updated nuclear power options? And how realistic are any of them — including in Connecticut?

The short answer — even the owner of the one nuclear station in Connecticut sees the challenges of building new nuclear in the state. And if those could be overcome, it would be a long way off.

The basics of nuclear power haven’t changed much in decades. It’s carbon-free. The classic units — like the 94 stations operating in the U.S. — can generate a lot of power. The two units at the Millstone Nuclear Power Station total about 2,100 megawatts. Plants can provide that power 24/7 with planned interruptions for re-fueling and maintenance. Despite a plant’s large footprint compared to similarly sized fossil fuel power, it takes up far less space than renewables such as wind and solar fields.

It’s more efficient than other forms of power, including renewables, which means nuclear doesn’t lose as high a percentage of its power as other power sources do. Some nuclear systems require a lot of water for cooling — but so do conventional power plants — leaving both vulnerable to droughts, floods and warming water, some of which are due to climate change.

But nuclear power is not renewable and its radioactive waste is not really recyclable, as some claim. Plants take a long time to build and they cost a lot of money.

Enter the notion of small nuclear power plants broadly, and SMRs specifically.

Smaller nuclear units

“I find the name SMR a little bit misleading because it should be called smaller modular reactor, because they’re still 300 megawatts,” said Jacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering at MIT. “This is a substantial facility, requires a lot of civil work, site excavation. So it’s not a factory-produced reactor by any stretch of the imagination.”

Buongiorno said the first one likely to be built in North America is from BWRX — a longstanding nuclear company — at the Darlington nuclear site in Canada. It’s slated for 300 megawatts.

An early-stage project in Wyoming by TerraPower, a private company founded by Bill Gates, will be 345 megawatts. In October the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC, approved its environmental impact statement, the first such designation for new technology nuclear.

The federal government-owned Tennessee Valley Authority, TVA, is also building what it calls an advanced nuclear SMR that uses molten-salt cooling. The unit by Kairos, a startup, is not expected to go online before 2030.

Prior to these efforts, the Biden administration had approved one new project by another startup — NuScale — for a unit in Idaho. But that plan dissolved when costs increased. A larger NuScale design was approved in May by the Trump administration.

Also in May, President Donald Trump signed four executive orders to speed up several aspects of nuclear development. They include adding 300 gigawatts — that’s 300,000 megawatts — of nuclear power by 2050. And they order the NRC to speed up licensing, which some see as dangerous rubber stamping. Earlier this month, Trump nominated a former executive at Westinghouse, a longtime player in the nuclear space, to the NRC.

But Buongiorno and others said, as an alternative to the SMR, there is a proven modernized reactor already available in the U.S. — the AP1000 — Westinghouse’s full-size reactor.

“It’s a great design. It’s an American design. And my personal opinion is that our best bet if we want to grow nuclear is to build more of those AP1000s,” he said. “The downside of the AP1000 and any other large reactor is it takes time to build these units, and it costs a lot of money.”

That is also the reactor used in the two new units added to Georgia’s existing Vogtle plant. But Buongiorno said it would be a mistake to judge the economics of a new big reactor like the AP1000 by the Vogtle experience. It was the first of its kind so likely to be more expensive and slower, though he admitted overall the U.S. nuclear industry does not have the greatest construction track record.

Westinghouse also hadn’t built a nuclear plant in a generation, which brings up another category of problems. The kind of skilled workforce and expertise needed to build and maintain a nuclear facility has all but vanished in the U.S., as has the supply chain that once supported nuclear construction. While the fuel supply is the same for old and new nuclear plants, there’s not enough of it and some of what is needed comes from Russia.

Then there is the question of whether SMRs and micro-reactors will be cheaper and easier to build. The answer depends on the definition of cheaper and easier, especially considering the cost per unit of power.

Ask Buongiorno if it’s cheaper: “The answer is absolutely no. We expect, actually, small, modular reactors to produce energy that will be more expensive than large reactors. This is a mathematical certainty.”

Ask Macfarlane: “It’s quite realistic — at least the light water reactor designs are realistic. The advanced designs less so.” In fact, Macfarlane has just co-written a paper on the cost question. “We conclude that economies of scale still will hold. It’s just simply cheaper to build a single, large light water reactor than 10 small ones,” she said.

Ask Jeff Semancik, the Radiation Division director at the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP): “There’s a trade-off that you’re looking at between what are the upfront capital costs versus the long term cost of electricity.”

On the other hand, Buongiorno points out that investors will perceive the upfront risk as smaller.

“If the check that you need to write at the beginning of the project to build the plant is $3 billion instead of $10 billion, the risk associated with the project is significantly smaller. And that’s really the value proposition for the smaller reactors, the overall project risk, financial as well as execution. There is less to build.”

It’s generally thought the footprint for an SMR won’t be that much smaller, especially if the plan is to install several at once. Siting might be a little easier because of new safety systems that require a smaller perimeter, though factors like access to transmission lines or availability of transmission capacity could impact siting and cost.

The lower the power, the less potential radioactivity if a problem arises. There’s also less radioactive waste, though there’s still no U.S. repository to store it.

As the scale continues to shrink, Buongiorno believes his point about the cost per kilowatt hour continues to hold true. Power from microreactors would be even more expensive per unit, but they are a different animal. They are envisioned to be 10-15 megawatts, but could be as small as one megawatt. The concept is also more as a standalone system that’s not necessarily tied to the grid, so the need for transmission and distribution and its costs may be avoided even though the power itself costs more.

Their use, experts say, would be more for out-of-the-way or hard-to-access locations where connecting to a grid would be extremely expensive or even impossible and where the alternative might be diesel generators. Think remote mining camps or extreme rural Alaska without connecting highways. Or for use by the military, which the Trump executive orders specifically target. The military has a history of small reactor use in things like submarines and aircraft carriers going back decades, though the technologies are not the same as land units.

“The business model is very different. These are not grid-connected electric generators. These are co-located with their end users” Buongiorno said. “So the devil is in the detail of these things, which means it’s all going to be site- and customer-dependent.”

Microreactors are expected to be easily transportable with other needed components, but they are even less developed than SMRs. An initial testing pilot project in the U.S. is expected next summer, which may be aggressive timing, even though some of the well-known and experienced nuclear companies are looking at them. So true deployment, even if everything goes well, is still years away.

What it means for Connecticut

New nuclear is on the table here.

In the last few legislative sessions, lawmakers cleared a slight path. They lifted the state’s nuclear moratorium for the Dominion site in Waterford, which houses Millstone, thereby allowing for nuclear expansion at that location. They also established a process for municipalities to begin consideration of hosting new nuclear facilities and authorized $5 million in bond funds for DEEP to give grants for technical assistance for early site permitting.

To that end, in October DEEP announced informational sessions beginning in December to help municipalities better understand what nuclear power and its new iterations entail.

DEEP is aware of the realities of potential new nuclear power, as evidenced in this 2024 report that noted advanced nuclear technology, SMRs and more are in early stages and that “cost competitiveness has not yet been demonstrated and is unlikely to be realized unless or until such technologies move beyond ‘first of a kind’ projects and are deployed at scale.”

In other words, there’s a long way to go.

“It’s a significant amount of time that’s required to get these large projects off the ground,” said DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes, noting that a project like Revolution Wind, under construction now, first solicited proposals in 2017. “Many of the resources that we’re talking about now and planning and engaging on, we’re contemplating deployment and commercial operation timelines that are in the late 2030s. That’s not unique to nuclear.”

But Connecticut does have some unique circumstances with nuclear — some helpful, some less so.

Dykes thinks the national lack of a nuclear workforce is less of an issue here with existing training at Three Rivers Community College in partnership with Dominion, as well as the skill sets associated with the state’s large defense industry — especially submarines and their nuclear components. And she said DEEP already is responsible for nuclear safety.

On the other hand, she and others point out that a deregulated utility market like Connecticut’s could face challenges with nuclear’s expense.

“How do we create the right balance in terms of the investment approach here to making our market an attractive place to invest while not burdening ratepayers with all of the risks of cost increases?” she asked.

In the meantime, in late October, Connecticut signed on as the 12th observer state to an effort known as Advanced Nuclear First Movers, which also has 11 full state members. Its inception was several years ago through the National Association of State Energy Officials, NASEO, as an education mechanism around advanced and other new nuclear.

Now more formalized, the group is working through the variables and unknowns as states consider the various technologies in the face of state climate policies, electricity needs and costs.

Nuclear, while promising, is not a panacea, said David Terry, NASEO’s president. “It’s kind of flashy in the news right now for good reason, because people are interested. But it’s not a panacea,” he said.

And with trying to figure out what kind of power to use 30 years from now and a lead time that could be a decade, the message, he said, is to weigh the pros and cons carefully. “And, oh, by the way, if you choose the wrong thing and you choose too many of the wrong thing, you’re going to pay dearly.”

CT history

Connecticut’s nuclear history dates to the 1968 opening of the Connecticut Yankee in Haddam, which stopped producing electricity in 1996. Millstone Unit 1 began operation in 1971 and it stopped producing electricity in 1995. Units 2 and 3 — which are still running — opened in 1975 and 1986 respectively, with Unit 2 just celebrating its 50th year. Each has had its license extended, to 2035 and 2045 respectively.

The Millstone units constitute about one-third of the power generated in Connecticut and along with the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant in New Hampshire, the only other nuclear plant operating in New England, supply one-quarter to one-third of the region’s power.

The Millstone units have older technology systems that use Long Island Sound, which is literally outside their doors, for intake and discharge water. In the summer of 2012 after a very warm winter and summer, Unit 2 shut down for 12 days due to intake water temperatures that exceeded what was allowable. The NRC subsequently approved an increase in allowable water temperature and Dominion spokesperson Susan Adams said via email there have been no issues since.

That incident followed a situation in August of 2011 when water from the Sound overtopped the seawall around the plant during Tropical Storm Irene. Adams did not respond directly to the question of whether this has happened since.

The company has clear procedures in place to respond immediately to prevent any impact to operations, she said in an email. “If a storm is coming, we have in our procedures to build a 2-foot-high wall with sandbags around the doors of specific locations.”

The Union of Concerned Scientists has tracked nuclear power safety for years. The director of that effort, Ed Lyman, said climate issues such as rising water temperatures, drought that causes reduced water, flooding and more intense storms are not necessarily safety issues. “But they could be a real operational issues if it has to shut down for some period of time.” He also said plants in Europe, in particular, have had to lower power output during heat waves in recent years.

After the flooding of the Fukushima plant in Japan in 2011, the U.S. looked at the flood standards for its plants. “It turns out that nearly every plant in the country, when they did these assessments, they found out that they were probably vulnerable to more severe flooding than they were designed to withstand,” Lyman said.

With the moratorium now removed for additional building on the Millstone site, there has been some chatter that, despite its proximity to the water, it might be a good location for SMRs given that transmission and interconnections are already available.

Semancik at DEEP said the effects of climate change are considered when sites are selected. “You’re required to do a meteorological, hydrological study of all the sites, including what the potential exists going forward,” he said.

While Dominion has expressed interest in SMR development, Adams noted in a lengthy written response that their focus on SMRs at the moment is at a location in Virginia.

“While we’re not opposed to an SMR at Millstone Power Station, Connecticut might not have the regulatory environment for one. The upfront costs for an SMR, though less expensive than traditional nuclear, are significant enough that Connecticut’s deregulated market might not support such a project,” Adams said, echoing Dykes’ concern. “However, we still plan to work with Connecticut’s policymakers on potential paths to taking advantage of SMR’s next-generation nuclear technology.”

Now what?

Buongiorno offers three thoughts on why nuclear can still be considered worthwhile.

One is that in the face of Trump administration policies that don’t advocate decarbonization, if that is a still a state goal, nuclear is the lowest carbon energy source available and it’s scalable. Another is its reliability. It can run 24/7, which means it is stable and therefore keeps the grid stable. And third is its local economic benefits. It provides high-paying permanent jobs in addition to the initial construction jobs. And a facility will pay local taxes.

But he said: “If we need more power between now and the end of 2030, then nuclear can play a fairly limited role.”

And, of course, you have to be willing to pay. “But I got news for you — you got to be willing to pay for any of the energy technology that you choose,” Buongiorno said. “There is no free lunch.”

That’s something Dykes knows all too well.

“How do you do that? What will it cost? How can you de-risk it?” the DEEP commissioner asked. “How can we make sure the costs are shared equally among those who benefit from the investment?”

Former NRC Chair Macfarlane offers a stark answer when asked whether it’s realistic to move ahead with the new reactor designs.

“I don’t think so,” she said. “It depends on what you want to do. And if you either want to A, address climate change or B, address the energy needs from AI, … it means you have to address it immediately, like yesterday, and none of these technologies are available.”

She said it may be something to continue to develop and see if will work. But she said it will probably take a couple of decades to commercialize.

Philanthropy just doesn’t give that kind of capital to Indigenous communities.
Others lean into the equally problematic idea that Native communities are just inherently resilient and capable of doing more with less.
According to the Center for Democratic and Environmental Rights, “the ‘rights of nature’ is the recognition and protection of legal rights of nature, including rights of ecosystems and species.
If the answer is Indigenous communities, we must go beyond slogans and into action—action that redistributes land, wealth, power, and legal agency.","Within the first few months of the second Trump administration, as the outcome of a widely criticized Republican proposal to sell off up to 3.3 million acres of federal public lands remained undecided, a pressing question began to echo: Could Tribes or Indigenous communities purchase these public lands if they were truly put up for sale?

The question, while grounded in hope, revealed a deeper anxiety about the future of land stewardship in the United States. Since early 2025, when the Trump administration began dismantling proper management of public and federal lands by laying off or forcing out thousands of National Park Service employees, proposing $1.2 billion in cuts (a staggering 35–40% of the agency’s funding), and proposing the logging of 59% of U.S. Forest Service lands, the public discourse has reflected mounting unease. What happens when the federal government walks away from the very lands it is entrusted to protect?

The idea that Indigenous communities might take over that role is, on the surface, a promising one, borne of the belief that Tribes exercising sovereignty over more land would benefit people and planet alike. But to realize that vision in any meaningful way, Tribes need to be properly resourced—in terms of capital, infrastructure, training, and legal authority.

Seeking some clarity on what it might take for that dream to become a reality, I called Thomas Linzey, a friend and Senior Legal Counsel at the Center for Democratic and Environmental Rights (CDER), to cut through the fog of wishful thinking.

Linzey didn’t mince words. “If the public lands were really being sold, the only way Tribes could protect those lands would be to buy [them]. That means raising a huge amount of money,” he told me. “Sadly, that’s not likely. Philanthropy just doesn’t give that kind of capital to Indigenous communities. It’s also unlikely that nonprofits could buy up large amounts of land either. Developers with lots of money would likely win those bids.”

Plus, he went on, “if we had the capital to do these types of purchases, we would’ve done that already, not with public lands per se, but in other large chunks of land.”

It’s a sobering assessment, but for me, it wasn’t surprising. I’ve spent years working alongside Indigenous-led groups focused on conservation, restoration, biodiversity, and regenerative land practices. The barrier of capital—of having reliable, sizable, long-term funding—comes up constantly. And buying land, monumental as that is, is only the beginning.

What we don’t discuss as much is what happens after a “land back” win. How do communities maintain stewardship, build infrastructure, and regenerate ecosystems while simultaneously supporting their people?

One place I often turn to for inspiration—and reality—is the Native Conservancy, an Indigenous-led nonprofit based in Alaska that protects both land and ocean ecosystems through Native-led trusts and regenerative mariculture. After years of activism and advocacy in the wake of the devastating Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, Dune Lankard founded the Native Conservancy in 2003. He and his team have helped protect over one million acres along the Gulf of Alaska coastline in the years since.

When I asked him about misconceptions surrounding Indigenous conservation, he didn’t hold back.

“People think Indigenous-led conservation is mostly symbolic—prayers, land acknowledgments, or protecting ‘sacred’ wilderness. But the truth is, it’s about survival. It’s about sovereignty, stewardship, and feeding our people—today, not someday,” Lankard told me. “At Native Conservancy, our daily work includes harvesting kelp, delivering wild foods to elders, building community-owned seed nurseries, training youth in dive safety and ocean farming, and outfitting hybrid vessels for clean marine operations. It’s about equipping Native communities with the tools, training, and rights to protect the places we come from.”

Far too often, there’s a deeply unproductive romanticization of “land back” or Indigenous stewardship. People imagine a kind of decolonized Eden—free from modern machinery or material needs. The assumption is that because this work is Indigenous-led, it requires less: less capital, less infrastructure, fewer tools.

Others lean into the equally problematic idea that Native communities are just inherently resilient and capable of doing more with less. While it’s true that Indigenous Peoples have shown remarkable adaptability over generations of dispossession and neglect, it is unjust to use resilience as an excuse to deny them what’s truly needed: investment, infrastructure, trust-based funding, and legal authority.

If we’re serious about equity—and especially if we’re serious about repair—we need to resource Indigenous stewardship with the same urgency and scale as we fund top-down climate tech or conservation NGOs.

In the context of the U.S., the question of whether Tribes could assume management of federal lands that are currently at risk of mismanagement or sale has a tragically straightforward answer. Under the Trump administration’s current policy trajectory, the answer is no.

Co-management or co-stewardship agreements, which commit Tribes and the Federal government to collaboration and shared approaches to land management—and which can align with treaties, uphold sovereignty, and promote environmental resilience and strengthen climate adaptation—already exist. But instead of expanding these kinds of agreements, the federal government is stripping away basic supports that Indigenous communities rely on—not to mention stripping funds away from current co-management projects such as Badlands National Park and its unique relationship with the Oglala Sioux Tribe.

Funding for Medicaid, the largest source of health coverage for Native Americans, is being slashed. Clean energy infrastructure projects are being halted. Tribal economic development programs, Native agriculture support, and even Tribal media funding are under attack.

“Those lands should go back to Tribal management and ownership. But you have to believe that this administration is not going to do that,” Linzey told me. “This Administration didn’t even consult the Tribes on the draft rule that was being made on the sale of the public lands, even though most of the public lands are in traditional Tribal territory…This administration is not going to do anything to help the Tribes. They’re stripping the federal government for parts, and they’re going to sell to the highest bidder.”

We’re living in an anti-democratic moment, in which short-term political gains are being financed by long-term environmental destruction. The colonial myth of Manifest Destiny still lingers, not only in ideology, but in active policy: extract, sell, profit, repeat. What makes this moment so disorienting—and painful—is that even as Indigenous leaders continue to offer solutions, their access to land, power, and capital remains minimal.

Consider what happened to the Native Conservancy earlier this year. In 2024, the organization and a Tribal partner in Southeast Alaska were awarded a significant grant from the Environmental Protection Agency under the Biden administration, tied to the historic Inflation Reduction Act. This grant would have been transformative.

But in the spring of 2025, it was terminated.

“We’re expected to lead climate solutions, but without land, without investment, and without power in the system. That’s the real barrier,” Lankard reflected. “We’ve built Native-owned kelp cooperatives, created a Guardian Ocean Monitoring program to track ocean health, launched dive and kelp farming training for rural and Native youth, and developed mariculture planning frameworks grounded in culture. But we’re doing this with short-term grants and constant uphill battles for access and recognition. We don’t lack vision or capacity—we lack long-term, trust-based investment and land and ocean access that reflects our rights and relationships.”

As I listened, I couldn’t help but think of how often I’ve heard one particular statistic quoted at climate conferences: “Indigenous Peoples and local communities manage 54% of the world’s remaining intact forests.”

It’s repeated like a mantra. But rarely does it come with the acknowledgment of what it actually takes—financially, emotionally, spiritually, logistically—to manage those forests. More often than not, this statistic is used to inspire, but not to fund. It fuels the narrative without supporting the people holding the line.

That’s beginning to shift. The nonprofit One Earth, for example, recently released their “Minding the Gaps: Climate Finance Report” and launched the One Earth Solutions Finance Tracker. Through One Earth’s tools and research, we now have clear data telling us that nature-based solutions, specifically conservation efforts that center Indigenous land tenure, are some of the most effective ways to combat climate change, but they are drastically underfunded.

When I spoke with Justin Winters, Executive Director of One Earth, she shared these alarming findings: “Our Solutions Finance Tracker project highlights the overconcentration of capital in certain ‘charismatic’ areas and a critical underfunding of essential and highly effective nature conservation efforts. Our findings show that a significant portion of the $17 trillion expected to be deployed by 2030 could be misallocated without a clear, science-based strategy that prioritizes not only the specific solutions we need to scale, but also where we most urgently need to focus our collective efforts.”

Tools like this are extremely necessary so that we can direct meaningful capital to Indigenous-led solutions, moving beyond lip service toward structural change.

But funding alone won’t solve the problem. As we look toward more permanent protections that last beyond the boom and bust cycle of federal policy, we must consider legal frameworks that recognize nature’s own rights.

According to the Center for Democratic and Environmental Rights, “the ‘rights of nature’ is the recognition and protection of legal rights of nature, including rights of ecosystems and species. Rights of nature laws, policies, and court decisions recognize nature as a living entity with legal rights. Further, they institute mechanisms for people and governments to implement, enforce, and defend these rights on behalf of, and in the name of, nature.”

In 2023, CDER launched the Land that Owns Itself program, a bold legal initiative that envisions ecosystems not as property, but as self-owning, self-governing entities. The program is meant to help the law take the “next big systemic leap, such that nature is not only protected with legal rights, but is moved out from under human control and ownership, to become self-owned and self-governed,” according to the CDER program overview.

This framework resonates deeply with Indigenous worldviews, while providing enforceable legal structures that are sorely needed. After all, one of the greatest frustrations of environmental advocacy is watching hard-fought gains rolled back every election cycle. The Rights of Nature legal strategy could provide the long-term protection that our communities, and the planet, deserve.

So we return to the question: Who gets to care for the land when the state walks away? If the answer is Indigenous communities, we must go beyond slogans and into action—action that redistributes land, wealth, power, and legal agency. We must stop asking Indigenous Peoples to protect biodiversity without giving them the land or resources to do it.

And we must remember: Nature is not ours to own. It is a living system we belong to, and our task—at this late and urgent hour—is to learn how to live in right relationship again.",https://atmos.earth/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/landback-badlands-national-park-hor-1280x720.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 08:59:11.848137

Two weeks of climate negotiations hardly ended in triumph Saturday, following a U.N. summit whose final days included a fire that interrupted discussions about how to stop burning the planet.

But they did end, with a deal that even critical delegates said shows that a divided, leaderless collection of nearly 200 nations can make some progress toward the goal of averting heat waves, deepening droughts and increasingly destructive storms.

Dear Chancellor,

UK Autumn Budget – Scottish Government priorities

I am writing to set out Scottish Government priorities for the UK Autumn Budget. I look forward to further discussion with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury at the Finance: Interministerial Standing Committee (F:ISC) on 17 October.

Investment in public services

The UK Spending Review (UK SR) set out our expected funding over the next three years for day-to-day spending. While I welcomed the funding uplift that you announced in your Autumn Budget last year, the UK SR settlement did not build sufficiently on this increase in investment. We are set to receive a real terms increase in resource funding of on average 0.8% a year over the UK SR period. This was both below our forecast funding ahead of the UK SR and the average real terms funding uplift of 1.2% for UK government departments. As I set out in the Scottish Government’s Medium-Term Financial Strategy, this means that we face an increasingly challenging budget situation in the years ahead with demand for services and costs increasing at a much faster rate than funding.

I appreciate the financial challenges that you are facing, with reports suggesting that you need to find around £30 billion of additional headroom. This is clearly of concern to all governments across the UK, and I would not want to see constraints on our funding as you seek to address these challenges. I would urge you to consider all alternatives to spending cuts. As you are aware, we are already having to deal with the impact of the increase in employer National Insurance contributions within our budget, as the additional funding from HM Treasury fell well short of the actual cost to public services, a shortfall which we estimated at around £400 million.

It is vital that the funding outlook in the UK SR is maintained, and indeed enhanced, to support the public services on which we rely. I will be setting out the Scottish Budget and a Scottish Spending Review in early January and this will be based on the levels of funding in the UK SR, as baked into our own Medium Term Financial Strategy and Fiscal Sustainability Delivery Plan. Clearly any reduction in this level of funding would have severe consequences for public services in Scotland.

Investment in infrastructure

The UK SR also set out the future funding for infrastructure investment, which is vital to support economic growth, meet our net zero ambitions and fund maintenance across the public sector estate. However the funding we expect to receive represents a 1.1% real terms reduction to our capital block grant between 2025-26 and 2029-30. We will be publishing a renewed Infrastructure Investment Pipeline alongside the Scottish Budget and want to maximise the value of our capital investment, but face persistent high inflation and rising costs in construction, which puts our budget under further pressure.

The UK SR provided a welcomed increase in Financial Transaction funding for capital investment, however this falls far short of a fair share for Scotland (at around 3.4% of the overall UK allocation). Financial Transactions funding has played a crucial role in underpinning our Affordable Housing programme and the investments made by the Scottish National Investment Bank. It is vital that we receive a fair share of future financial transactions funding, so that Scotland does not miss out on this important funding for economic growth. We are already in discussions with HM Treasury about the role that the Scottish National Investment Bank and other Scottish bodies can play in the new funding context and I am keen that we work together to realise the contribution that these bodies can make. I am also aware that institutions such as the British Business Bank will be investing across the UK and it is important that Scotland receives its fair share.

Working together to support economic growth

As part of the UK SR I set out how the Scottish Government can work with the UK Government to support economic growth. It is imperative that this budget is targeted at realising the significant economic opportunities arising from the clean energy transition, both for the growth of the UK’s domestic supply chain, and in terms of export opportunities. Supporting local content and resilient home-grown supply chains should be a key priority.

I welcomed the announcement on support for the Acorn Carbon Capture and Storage project in the UK SR and am keen that this progresses. I also set out the key role that Scotland can play in renewable energy and on offshore wind in particular, highlighting that in order to deliver, the UK Government will need to ensure sufficiency of budget for forthcoming Contracts for Difference allocation rounds and support for Floating Offshore Wind in particular. Given AI’s potential for transformative growth, it is vital that our governments work together, to deliver on the recommendations in the AI Opportunities Action Plan. This should include the establishment of an AI Growth Zone in Scotland at the earliest opportunity.

As you take forward investment through the National Wealth Fund and GB Energy, it is important that you take account of Scotland’s unique public sector investment landscape and work with us to maximise the benefits. Scotland should secure an above-population share of total GB Energy funding, given its disproportionately large contribution to UK clean energy goals and the significant clean energy supply chain opportunities for growth. More broadly, wider funding under the Industrial Strategy, through mechanisms such as Investment Zones, and from bodies such as the OFI and Innovate UK, needs to be mobilised to attract maximum inward and private investment in our clean energy sectors and their supply chains.

There also needs to be agreement on how the apportioning of the £2.5 billion that was ring fenced for the steel sector will give proportionate support to the maintenance and development of a green steel industry in Scotland, which will be key to supporting areas such as defence, green energy transition and Net Zero targets.

The UK Modern Industrial Strategy was published in June and we are keen to ensure that there is appropriate consideration of how to deliver programmes within the Industrial Strategy in Scotland given the differences in the delivery landscape between Scotland and England. In particular there needs to be discussion and agreement on how funding to deliver the strategy in Scotland is allocated. In particular there needs to be discussion and agreement on funding to deliver the strategy in Scotland to support cross cutting themes such as innovation and our priority sectors of Advanced Manufacturing, Digital and Data Technologies and Life Sciences. In particular, we need to see support for our priority sectors of Critical Technologies, Space and Robotics Cluster. We are also keen to engage your teams on the allocation of the funds as part of the Defence Growth Deal for Scotland, which we are keen to continue to support engagement with your teams on design and implementation.

The UK SR set out the UK Government's plans for future local growth funding, successor to the UK Shared Prosperity Fund. Along with the other devolved governments, we have been clear that there must be a role for the Scottish Government is delivering this. The UK Government has announced its plans for Wales but is yet to clarify how this will be delivered in Scotland, how we will be involved in this process, and whether the role of the Scottish Parliament will be respected. As you will be aware, Scottish Ministers have been clear in their opposition to the UK Government’s use of the UK Internal Market Act to spend directly in devolved areas. I would welcome your assurance that your approach to this and other growth funding respects the devolution settlement.

The marine and agriculture sectors make a hugely important contribution to the Scottish economy and our rural communities. I have previously raised our concern that the way in which funding is now provided to Scotland does not reflect Scotland’s share of land and seas, nor the contribution that we can make to climate change and food security. I encourage you to look again at how this funding is calculated. I am also keen to see a fair share, based on previous EU funding allocations, of the UK Government’s £360 million Fishing and Coastal Growth Fund to be devolved to Scotland.

Welfare reforms and eradicating child poverty

The UK Autumn Budget will underpin the first year of action in the UK Government’s forthcoming Child Poverty Strategy, and it is critical that you are ambitious and take this opportunity to drive forward the progress that is sorely needed at a UK level. As the Scottish Government has demonstrated, through our investment in the Scottish Child Payment and other measures, it is possible to drive meaningful progress on child poverty. Through our correspondence with co-chairs of the Child Poverty Taskforce, we have set out a range of priorities which I would urge you to support.

The First Minister has made clear our commitment to eradicating child poverty and we are already taking action to effectively scrap the two-child limit in Universal Credit from next March. We have of course long-called for the UK Government to abolish this damaging policy and I am heartened to see reports that this now appears to be a prospect you are considering. I urge you to scrap the cap in full and, as the Cabinet Secretary for Social Justice set out in her recent correspondence, it is vital that the UK Government provide detail on its plans at the first available opportunity.

There has been a great deal of uncertainty with regard to the UK Government’s approach to welfare reform over the past year. We welcomed the halt to changes to Personal Independence Payment (PIP), as well as the reversal of your original decision on Winter Fuel Payment, which impacted on the equivalent devolved payment. I would however take this opportunity to reiterate calls to halt the planned changes to Universal Credit at least until you have undertaken a full and comprehensive assessment of the impacts the changes will have on disabled people.

It is important that the UK Government engage early with the Scottish Government on any planned policy changes emerging from the Timms Review of PIP. This is especially so where these changes will impact on the funding received through the BGA to deliver Adult Disability Payment and if they could impact on delivery of Scottish benefits, i.e. requiring devolved disability benefits to passport to reserved benefits. These interactions are complex and it is important the UK Government work with us to understand the impact on Scotland.

The Scottish Government is already spending £142 million in this year’s budget to mitigate policies put in place by the previous UK Government that contribute to poverty. In addition to continued investment in our Scottish Welfare Fund, this includes allocating over £99 million to local authorities to spend on Discretionary Housing Payments, helping to mitigate the ‘bedroom tax’, Benefit Cap and shortfalls in Local Housing Allowance rates. These policies impact on child poverty and I would urge you to consider reversing them as part of your forthcoming Child Poverty strategy. This would remove the need for the Scottish Government to provide such mitigations, enabling us to use that funding for further ambitious anti-poverty measures.

Fuel poverty continues to be a significant issue in Scotland. In 2023, an estimated 34% (around 861,000 households) of all households in Scotland were in fuel poverty. It is clear that high energy prices must be addressed, and the fundamental fiscal and policy levers to make a real difference lie with the UK Government. Progress towards heat decarbonisation also depends on wider urgent UK Government action, which includes rebalancing policy costs from electricity to gas bills to incentivise the installation of clean heating in a way that alleviates fuel poverty.

We have previously called on the UK Government to implement a social tariff in the form of a targeted bill discount, as it will address high costs at source and ensure energy bills are both more affordable and sustainable in the longer-term, reducing the likelihood of building up energy debt that will likely never be repaid. We welcome the UK Government’s Warm Home Discount scheme, but this is an interim solution and we require urgent action from UK Government that is sustainable in the long term and supports households who are struggling to pay their fuel bills. The powers to deliver a social tariff rest with the UK Government but we would urge you to consider its role in tackling poverty and would welcome further discussion.

Taxation measures

There is currently a lot of speculation about what tax changes may be included in the Autumn Budget. As you will be aware, changes you make to taxes that are devolved can have significant and direct impacts on the Scottish Government’s funding via Block Grant Adjustments, while there can also be important cross-border effects to consider in setting Scottish Government policy. Even when taxes are fully reserved, there can still be substantial implications where they interact with devolved taxes.

The limited time between the UK Budget and the Scottish Budget on 13 January means that we will have little time to consider the implications of any tax policy changes for Scotland. I would appreciate any engagement on proposals so we can understand potential impacts and to help us prepare effectively for the Scottish Budget.

We have used the limited tax powers that we have available to deliver a fair and progressive tax system which has raised significant revenue for public services. We think there is scope for the UK Government to learn from the ambitious Scottish approach and consider how it best uses the range of tax powers at its disposal.

In the run up to the UK Budget, we encourage you to listen carefully to the concerns being expressed by businesses around the impacts of the Energy Profits Levy. The UK Government needs to set out how a stable and long-term fiscal regime will be used to deliver business and investor certainty for the North Sea. The Energy Profits Levy was always supposed to be a temporary measure and we want to see the earliest possible end date, as it is now affecting investment and jobs in the North East of Scotland. The aim of the successor regime must be to give the offshore energy sector much needed certainty and treat it fairly, alongside other parts of the UK economy.

The Scottish Government has also long called for stability, clarity, and fairness in the approach to alcohol duty. The decision in the last UK Budget to raise alcohol duty whilst reducing draught duty widened the disadvantage facing Scotland’s iconic national drink. The near 14% raise in the duty levied on spirits in recent years disproportionately affects the Scotch whisky industry and we would welcome action to address this disparity in the upcoming UK Budget.

The impact of the UK Government’s changes to Agricultural Property Relief continues to be a real concern to Scotland’s agricultural community. While the Scottish Government continues to call for inheritance tax powers to be devolved, I welcome the ongoing constructive dialogue between the Scottish Government and HMRC officials to seek to mitigate the impact of these changes on heritable Scottish agricultural leases.

I am copying this letter to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Rt Hon James Murray MP.

Your sincerely

The media tour was led by Chief Technology Officer Shashidhar Mathapati, who guided media representatives through the 61,000 sq. metre, LEED Gold–certified campus, detailing how the facility has rapidly scaled its engineering strength. The centre currently houses 385+ R&D engineers, with plans to increase this to 750 over the next three years.

The visit opened inside the high-voltage labs, where 33 kV test systems, renewable inverters, and containerised data-centre solutions, all designed in India, undergo rigorous validation. Products are stress-tested in walking chambers simulating –40°C to 125°C, ensuring performance across extreme operating conditions. “Investing in advanced labs saves engineering hours and accelerates product development,” Mathapati said.

The tour then shifted to the automotive engineering division, backed by 100 specialists working on onboard chargers, DC-DC converters, and integrated powertrains. Thousands of automated test cases scrutinise lifecycle performance. “Automotive applications demand million-dollar precision. Our lifecycle management ensures 10-year customer support,” he added.

Delta’s market heft was unmistakable. The company commands over 63 percent share of India’s telecom-rectifier market and supplies UPS systems to global data-centre clients. The centre also develops a full stack of EV-charging solutions, from 700W portable chargers to battery-swapping stations for two- and three-wheelers.

Long-term investment continues to fuel this expansion. Of the USD 500 million pledged in 2015, 65 percent has already been deployed, with the remainder slated for completion by 2027. This pipeline is strengthening Delta’s smart-manufacturing and high-voltage product capabilities. “We’re among the few Indian players capable of designing and producing high-voltage systems at scale without relying on external platforms,” Mathapati noted.

Climate negotiations at the United Nations COP30 Conference ended this afternoon in Belem, Brazil, with a last-minute deal. The resolution calls for an increase in money going to nations affected by global warming to help them adapt. But it doesn't really address phasing out the primary driver of climate change, fossil fuels. NPR's climate correspondent Julia Simon is at the conference center in Brazil and joins us now. Hi, Julia.

JULIA SIMON, BYLINE: Hi, thanks for having me.

PFEIFFER: This conference lasted two weeks. I've read there were bitter negotiations up to the end. What ultimately came of it?

SIMON: It has been a tense conference. Ultimately, it did not deliver as much as many hoped. Let's start with what it did manage to do. The final agreement calls to triple the amount of financing to help nations adapt to a hotter world. That tripling of money will happen within a decade.

But a lot of the tension, Sacha, at this COP30 has been around this question - will the negotiations explicitly address phasing out fossil fuels? More than 80 countries were calling for this conference to emerge with a clear road map to move away from fossil fuels. Burning oil, gas and coal make up about 70% of the greenhouse gases driving global warming. The final agreement did not mention fossil fuels, and this is where it gets really interesting because one of the most important things to come out of this conference is actually the announcement of another conference.

PFEIFFER: And why, after finishing one lengthy conference, would they have another one?

SIMON: This is an important question. But the problem is that in recent years, there have been countries and NGOs saying, this United Nations process, these conferences, aren't enough. We need another process to really get countries to phase out fossil fuels, a complementary process. So yesterday, Irene Velez Torres, Colombia's environment minister, along with ministers from Europe, Latin America, the Pacific Islands - Torres announced that they are making a new conference next year in Santa Marta, Colombia. This conference is explicitly dedicated to discussions around phasing out fossil fuels. Here is Minister Torres.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

IRENE VELEZ TORRES: The idea of the Santa Maria Conference is to have this first space in which we are completely clear that the phasing out is necessary because it's not easy. No one is saying that it is easy. But if we don't face the problems, we cannot build the solutions.

SIMON: It is a big deal that Colombia is hosting this new conference. They are an oil, gas and coal producer. The co-host will be the Netherlands, the birthplace of Shell oil. And at this conference, you likely will not see Russia and Saudi Arabia, who have been an obstacle for this phaseout of fossil fuels.

PFEIFFER: Julia, for these previous gatherings, there have often - they have often ended with commitments from countries to reduce their climate pollution. What's the assessment of how that effort is going?

SIMON: To answer that, I spoke to Alden Meyer. He's senior associate at climate change think tank E3G about this. He says, scientists say, collectively, country commitments are not nearly enough to avoid catastrophic warming. Right now, he says, countries are pursuing policies that would lead to their climate emissions falling by about 12% by 2035.

ALDEN MEYER: The science says we need five times that much. What I'm saying is, we're not even close.

SIMON: And this is why, again, many countries are looking to transition away from fossil fuels, the main driver of global warming.

PFEIFFER: I understand that the issue of trade was also a really big factor in this conference.

SIMON: Yeah, trade really took center stage. China is exporting massive amounts of solar, batteries, electric vehicles, all around the world. China has been pushing for free trade of this climate tech. So trade's becoming a climate issue, and this is actually an area where the U.S. is missing out. Climate tech is good for the climate, but it can also be good for a country's pocketbooks. China is now making more money exporting clean energy technologies than the U.S. is making exporting fossil fuels.

PFEIFFER: So China was at this conference. The U.S. was absent. It did not send an official delegation for the first time. What about Brazil, the host of this meeting, a meeting in a rainforest?

SIMON: Yes, we're in the Brazilian rainforest, in the Amazon. Brazilian hosts did play a key role in getting the agreement through, as contested as it was, and the Brazilians will be continuing to lead the negotiations, the discussions, until the next COP in Turkey.

PFEIFFER: That's NPR's Julia Simon reporting for us from Brazil. Thanks, Julia.

At a “Hydrogen Day’’ event the following year, Cummins officials said they anticipated the company’s hydrogen production business to grow quickly over the next few years.
“When Cummins first manufactured hydrogen electrolyzers, they had to make them overseas,” Biden said during the visit.
“The overall impact is having major consequences for the use of electrolyzers, the production of green hydrogen and green ammonia,” Moberg said.
Last month, the Chinese government announced plans ramp up its green hydrogen capacity by the end of the decade.","Experts warn that the Trump administration’s rollback of climate initiatives could slow the adoption of technologies and development of infrastructure that Columbus’ largest employer considers central to its future in a world moving away from fossil fuels.

Those concerns are already reverberating through the clean hydrogen sector, which experts say is feeling the strain as the administration cancels billions of dollars in grants for hydrogen hubs, winds down hydrogen production tax credits ahead of schedule and steers the U.S. Department of Energy back toward fossil fuels.

Cummins Inc. — the largest employer in Columbus — has spent years investing in hydrogen technologies, including electrolyzers, which are devices that use electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The resulting hydrogen can be used to power energy-intensive industries such as steelmaking, maritime transport and other applications that solar and wind alone cannot easily support.

Experts say the policy shift risks ceding the electrolyzer market to China, where government investment and adoption are accelerating. Beijing has been pouring money into hydrogen production and infrastructure, positioning Chinese firms to dominate the global market of a technology the United States helped pioneer.

“What this could potentially do is just put (the United States) behind in that technology push and just leave us watching as China and others just pump out electrolyzers and basically build facilities on a backbone of non-U.S. technologies,” said Gabriel Fillipelli, professor of earth sciences at IU Indianapolis and executive director of the IU Environmental Resilience Institute.

‘Strategic review’

Signs of market instability have already emerged. Danish manufacturer Topsoe recently paused a $400 million electrolyzer project in Virginia, citing the administration’s policy changes. German electrolyzer maker Thyssenkrupp Nucera told investors it would abandon several U.S. green-hydrogen projects after incentives were scaled back.

And on Nov. 6, Cummins said it would begin a “strategic review” of its electrolyzer business after seeing “rapidly deteriorating conditions” in hydrogen markets. The company pointed to “significantly weaker prospects for demand” and reduced federal support as key factors.

“During the third quarter of 2025 … we observed rapidly deteriorating conditions in our electrolyzer markets and overall hydrogen markets, along with significant uncertainty in the alternative-power markets resulting from reductions in government incentives,” the company said.

Cummins Chair and CEO Jennifer Rumsey told analysts this month that the review will help the company “assess the best path forward” as the company responds to “to a very weak demand outlook.”

Despite the strategic review, Cummins said that it remains committed to “zero-emissions investments on the most promising paths to ensure we are set up for long-term success.”

Shift in momentum

The announcement of the strategic review comes after years of momentum in Cummins’ hydrogen and low-carbon ambitions — including a rebranded business segment, federal grants, White House visits, Senate testimony and even a presidential stop at one of its facilities.

Experts say that today’s landscape stands in stark contrast to just two and a half years ago, when President Joe Biden visited a Cummins facility in Minnesota and touted the company’s electrolyzer production.

“Clearly, the political change (in the United States) has been quite significant,” said Jonas Moberg, CEO of Green Hydrogen Organisation, a Switzerland-based not-for-profit that seeks to accelerate the production and use of green hydrogen across a range of sectors globally.

“There is a … challenging situation (globally) amplified in the U.S. by the political changes and the dismantling of much of the (Biden-era climate initiatives),” Moberg added.

Many of the changes in U.S. energy policy can be traced back to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Trump administration’s signature piece of legislation, experts said. The bill phases out green hydrogen production tax credits ahead of schedule, which experts said has prompted companies to pause or abandon projects.

Additionally, the Trump administration cut $2.2 billion in grants for regional hydrogen hubs in California and the Pacific Northwest last month, as well as an additional $5.4 billion for other clean energy projects across 16 states, The Associated Press reported.

In an interview with One America News, a conservative outlet, Trump said, “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place.”

For many experts, the administration’s shift in priorities was not entirely surprising.

“If you stop and think of the changes being made, part of the platform during the election cycle was, ‘Drill, baby, drill,’” said Steven Mohler, assistant professor of management at IU Columbus. “That’s one of those flags that go up and say, ‘Oh, maybe we’re going to slow down the progress on green energy and concerns with climate change.’”

Hydrogen efforts

Cummins’ turn toward clean hydrogen long predates the recent policy reversals. The company began expanding into the sector several years ago as part of a broader effort to secure its place in a global economy that is shifting away from fossil fuels and the diesel engines the company is most known for.

Clean hydrogen, often referred to as “green hydrogen,” is produced by using renewable electricity to separate hydrogen atoms from oxygen atoms in wager molecules, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. However, most hydrogen produced today is not green but rather extracted from natural gas in a process that generates carbon dioxide emissions. But unlike fossil fuels, the only byproduct of hydrogen combustion is water vapor.

In recent years, several Cummins officials have said they expect green hydrogen and electrolyzers to play an important role in cutting emissions in some of the industries that are most dependent on fossil fuels, including being a “key piece in the decarbonization of transportation and industry.”

In 2019, Cummins acquired Hydrogenics Corp., adding what the company describes as key electrolyzer and fuel-cell technologies to its portfolio. At a “Hydrogen Day’’ event the following year, Cummins officials said they anticipated the company’s hydrogen production business to grow quickly over the next few years.

Then-Cummins Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger said during the event that the company already had more than 500 electrolyzer installations across five continents and projected that the business would generate roughly $400 million in revenue by 2025.

“All in all, hydrogen technologies, particularly electrolyzers, will be a fast growing and increasingly important part of our business over the next few years,” Linebarger said during the event.

Cummins executives also made the case for green hydrogen in the nation’s capital. In March 2021, then-Cummins Vice Chairman Tony Satterthwaite urged the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to help accelerate the development and adoption of green hydrogen.

“Infrastructure is a fundamental chicken-and-egg problem,” Satterthwaite told The Republic on March 17, 2021, following his Senate testimony. “…Without infrastructure, you don’t get adoption, and without adoption, nobody invests in infrastructure. And so, we see a definite role for the federal government to kick start that chicken-and-egg cycle and provide some incentives for early investment in infrastructure.”

Waves of incentives

Later that year, Congress would enact the first of two pieces of legislation that provided billions of dollars in incentives for green hydrogen production and technologies.

In November 2021, Congress passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, which steered $9.5 billion toward green hydrogen, including $1 billion for electrolysis technologies such as electrolyzers, $500 million for clean hydrogen manufacturing and $8 billion for regional hydrogen hubs to accelerate the development of a hydrogen supply chain.

Rumsey, who was Cummins president and chief operating officer at the time, traveled to the White House to attend the signing ceremony for the bill. Following the ceremony, she told The Republic, “There was a piece of this infrastructure bill that was focused on starting to build out an infrastructure that we think is key for decarbonization and our country. It includes substantial investment in hydrogen infrastructure and charging infrastructure and also recognition of the importance of low-carbon fuels.”

In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which provided additional policies and incentives for green hydrogen, including a hydrogen production tax credit of as much as $3 per kilogram produced.

Shortly after the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, Cummins announced that it would be dedicating 89,000-square-feet of its Minnesota facility to start producing electrolyzers in the United States in what the company described at the time as a “milestone.”

In March 2023, Cummins rebranded its new power business as Accelera to emphasize its portfolio of zero emissions technologies, including electrolyzers.

Following the announcement of the rebrand, Srikanth Padmanabhan, former president of Cummins’ engine business, told The Republic that “this (new brand) provides an opportunity for us to move into areas like electrolyzers that others don’t recognize Cummins as a player in because historically we’ve been in the transportation and mobility spaces.”

The following month, Biden visited Cummins’ Minnesota facility, speaking for around 30 minutes and touting the company’s efforts to ramp up its hydrogen production business in the United States.

“When Cummins first manufactured hydrogen electrolyzers, they had to make them overseas,” Biden said during the visit. “…But now, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, with the tax credits for renewable energy, Cummins is going to manufacture these electrolyzers here in America for the first time.”

By December 2024, Cummins had secured tens of millions of dollars in federal grants related to electrolyzer manufacturing and testing, including around $18 million for a project funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, according to federal records. Around the same time, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., announced that Cummins had also received a $10.5 million tax-credit allocation under the Inflation Reduction Act for investing in electrolyzer manufacturing and testing.

But over the past several months, the Trump administration and Congress have undone much of the climate initiatives in the two bills.

Congressional votes

While Columbus’ largest employer strongly supported the hydrogen provisions in the two Biden-era bills, the city’s congressional delegation opposed the legislation.

Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., and then-Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., voted against the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, while then-Rep. Greg Pence, R-Ind., voted against it twice, according to congressional records.

Braun, who is now Indiana governor, said in a tweet on X on Aug. 10, 2021, “Through borrowing from our kids and grandkids we’re going to take this country to a level of debt and deficits we’ve never been to before, and Republicans are complicit in it for going along with this infrastructure bill that’s part of it.”

The delegation also opposed the Inflation Reduction Act. Young and Braun voted against the bill, while Pence voted against an initial version of the bill but did not cast a vote on the final version, according to congressional records.

At the same, Columbus’ congressional delegation unanimously supported Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” according to congressional records.

Young and Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., voted in favor the bill, as did Rep. Jefferson Shreve, R-Ind., and Rep. Erin Houchin, R-Ind. Both Shreve and Houchin said following the vote that the bill “unleashes American energy consumption.”

At least for now, the outlook for green hydrogen in the United States is “pretty negative,” experts said.

“The overall impact is having major consequences for the use of electrolyzers, the production of green hydrogen and green ammonia,” Moberg said. “There are so many consequences, and some of them are outside of the (Inflation Reduction Act). So, the fact that the president has been very negative on offshore wind and on solar, that also slows down the development of the production of renewable energy. And of course, you need a lot of renewable energy to run these electrolyzers. …I think the overall current situation, in particular in the U.S., is pretty negative.”

Falling behind China

While the Trump administration is pulling back from clean hydrogen, China is going in the opposite direction, experts said.

Last month, the Chinese government announced plans ramp up its green hydrogen capacity by the end of the decade. The country is already home to the largest green hydrogen project in the world, as well as roughly 40% of all hydrogen refueling stations, according to a report by the World Economic Forum in January. Almost 60% of the world’s electrolyzers are made in Chinese factories, according to Bloomberg.

U.S. and China green hydrogen forecasts once tracked closely. But since the policy reversal in Washington, the gap is expected to sharply widen. S&P Global Commodity Insights now projects China will produce 33.4 million metric tons of green hydrogen by 2050, almost three times its previous estimate before Trump took office in January.

By comparison, the United States was estimated to be on track to reach 9.3 million metric tons by 2050 before Trump’s reelection. SP Global Commodity Insights has since sliced that projection in half.

“We’re already well behind,” Fillipelli said. “All the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill were going to do is kind of get us slightly more caught up. We were already losing ground. And frankly, the country we’re losing ground to is China. …They’re investing so much in this. It’s shocking.”

“If you look across the board, they, where we’ve been pulling back, they’ve been leaning in,” Fillipelli added. “…Had we maintained the funding that we had set aside for this in the last administration, we very well might be able to catch up. Now, it seems less likely that we’ll be able to catch up.”

In the short run, the shake-up in federal clean-energy policy could have an impact on engineering and research efforts in Columbus — particularly when paired with the Trump administration’s recent move to raise the cost of an H-1B visa for skilled foreign workers to $100,000, experts said.

“As Cummins goes, we go — we have to say that up front,” Mohler said, referring to the local economy. “But the most impact I would see for our area would probably be in innovation (and) engineering activity. …The H-1B visa may have an impact on that as well. …With H-1B visas going up so high, and this hydrogen technology not readily accepted in the U.S., but it is in the Asia Pacific Area, you wonder if this doesn’t benefit those economies. Because Cummins (could) go ahead and hire the engineers and the scientists, let them stay where they’re at, do things remotely, and produce this technology for the growing China market.”

“Clean energy is something that will continue to move forward because climate change is becoming more and more evident,” Mohler added. “But without government support and assistance, we may consider … that progress will slow temporarily. …Who knows what the next administration will do? …The Biden administration put a lot of U.S. dollars behind it. The Trump administration is stepping back from that.”",,N,,2025-11-23 07:01:49.848490

Achieving progress in such uncertain and challenging times is never guaranteed, yet the talks in Belém have shown that the Paris Agreement is working and delivering results, including a call to triple adaptation finance by 2035, a Just Transition Mechanism to ensure the emerging green economy benefits everyone, and new dialogues on how trade can support climate-resilient economic transformation and how to integrate the protection of mountains into climate policy.

UNEP science and data reinforce the significant size of the challenge ahead, but equally reinforces proven solutions exist and a pathway remains to meet our global commitments. No one is saying this will be easy or we are on track. We must do much more, move much faster, and stretch our collective ambition even further. Countries should see their new national climate plans as a baseline to build on, not a ceiling for ambition. Keeping 1.5°C within reach requires us to accelerate the era of implementation at an unprecedented rate, so we can deliver the benefits people deserve: affordable clean energy, good jobs, clean air, and a safer, more resilient future for all. And as escalating climate impacts continue that spare no nation, we have to better finance, implement and prioritise adaptation efforts.

But COP30 also reinforced the growing global momentum, both in and outside of the negotiating halls, to transition away from fossil fuels as agreed in Dubai at COP28, halt deforestation - including the launch of the Tropical Forest Forever Facility that now stands at US$6.7 billion - and pursue rapid, high-impact measures such as cutting methane emissions. The Action Agenda, the foundation to such an inclusive COP from the Brazil Presidency that saw unprecedented Indigenous Peoples leadership from the Amazon and across the world, reinforced momentum is coming from all sources, including businesses, cities and regions, local communities, civil society, women, people of African descent, youth, and many more.

The deal finalized at the COP30 conference pledges more money to help countries adapt to climate change, but lacks explicit plans to transition away from the fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas that heat the planet.

The conference didn’t do as much as scientists thought the world needed. It wasn’t as meaningful as activists and Indigenous people demanded. Few countries got everything they wanted. And the venue even caught fire.

But that disappointment is mixed with a few wins and the hope for countries to make more progress next year.

Here’s what you need to know about the outcome.

Leaders tried to nail down specifics on fighting climate change

Leaders have been working on how to fight the impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather and sea level rise, for a decade. To do that, every country had the homework of writing up their own national climate plans and then reconvened this month to see if it was enough.

Most didn’t get a good grade and some haven’t even turned it in.

Brazil, host of the climate conference known as COP30, was trying to get them to cooperate on the toughest issues like climate-related trade restrictions, funding for climate solutions, national climate-fighting plans and more transparency on measuring those plans’ progress.

More than 80 countries tried to introduce a detailed guide to phase out fossil fuels over the next several decades. There were other to-do items on topics including deforestation, gender and farming.

Countries reached what critics called a weak compromise

Nations agreed to triple the amount of money promised to help the vulnerable countries adapt to climate change. But they will take five more years to do it. Some vulnerable island countries said they were happy about the financial support.

But the final document didn’t include a road map away from fossil fuels, angering many.

After the agreement was reached, COP President André Corrêa do Lago said Brazil would take an extra step and write their own road map. Not all countries signed up to this, but those on board will meet next year to specifically talk about the fossil fuel phase out. It would not carry the same weight as something agreed to at the conference.

Also included in the package were smaller agreements on energy grids and biofuels.

Responses ranged from happy to angry

“Given what we expected, what we came out with, we were happy,” said Ilana Seid, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States.

But others felt discouraged. Heated exchanges took place during the conference’s final meeting as countries snipped at each other about the fossil fuel plan.

“I will be brutally honest: The COP and the U.N. system are not working for you. They have never really worked for you. And today, they are failing you at a historic scale,” said Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez, a negotiator for Panama.

Jiwoh Abdulai, Sierra Leone’s environment and climate change minister said: “COP30 has not delivered everything Africa asked for, but it has moved the needle.” He added: “This is a floor, not a ceiling.”

The real outcome of this year’s climate talks will be judged on “how quickly these words turn into real projects that protect lives and livelihoods,” he said.

Talks set against the Amazon rainforest

Participants experienced the Amazon’s extreme heat and humidity and heavy rains that flooded walkways. Organizers who chose Belem, on the edge of the rainforest, as the host city had intended for countries to experience firsthand what was at stake with climate change, and take bold action to stop it.

But afterward, critics said the deal shows how hard it is to find global cooperation on issues that affect everyone, most of all people in poverty, Indigenous people, women and children around the world.

“At the start of this COP, there was this high level of ambition. We started with a bang, but we ended with a whimper of disappointment,” said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, now at Greenpeace International.

Indigenous people, civil society and youth

One of the nicknames for the climate talks in Brazil was the “Indigenous peoples’ COP.” Yet some in those groups said they had to fight to be heard.

Protesters from Indigenous groups twice disrupted the conference to demand a bigger seat at the table. While Indigenous people’s rights weren’t officially on the agenda, Taily Terena, an Indigenous woman from the Terena nation in Brazil, said so far she is happy with the text because for the first time it includes a paragraph mentioning Indigenous rights.

She supported countries speaking up on procedural issues because that’s how multilateralism works. “It’s kind of chaotic, but from our perspective, it’s kind of good that some countries have a reaction,” she said.

Now, the joint venture has announced a $250 million investment to expand its operations in California.

Over the next three years, IONNA will spend that lump of money to set up more than 1,000 DC fast charging bays across the Golden State, and announced its investment commitment with kickoff ceremonies in San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego, San Jose and Westminster. California’s first Rechargery location will open in Westminster, which IONNA is calling a “flagship location,” and the JV is also launching an “EV Education Program” to inform new EV drivers about the benefits of electric mobility in addition to showing off their nationwide network plans. Each Rechargery opening will be accompanied by an on-site event rounding up local dealerships and EV enthusiast groups.

Climate negotiations at the United Nations COP30 Conference ended this afternoon in Belem, Brazil, with a last-minute deal. The resolution calls for an increase in money going to nations affected by global warming to help them adapt. But it doesn't really address phasing out the primary driver of climate change, fossil fuels. NPR's climate correspondent Julia Simon is at the conference center in Brazil and joins us now. Hi, Julia.

JULIA SIMON, BYLINE: Hi, thanks for having me.

PFEIFFER: This conference lasted two weeks. I've read there were bitter negotiations up to the end. What ultimately came of it?

SIMON: It has been a tense conference. Ultimately, it did not deliver as much as many hoped. Let's start with what it did manage to do. The final agreement calls to triple the amount of financing to help nations adapt to a hotter world. That tripling of money will happen within a decade.

But a lot of the tension, Sacha, at this COP30 has been around this question - will the negotiations explicitly address phasing out fossil fuels? More than 80 countries were calling for this conference to emerge with a clear road map to move away from fossil fuels. Burning oil, gas and coal make up about 70% of the greenhouse gases driving global warming. The final agreement did not mention fossil fuels, and this is where it gets really interesting because one of the most important things to come out of this conference is actually the announcement of another conference.

PFEIFFER: And why, after finishing one lengthy conference, would they have another one?

SIMON: This is an important question. But the problem is that in recent years, there have been countries and NGOs saying, this United Nations process, these conferences, aren't enough. We need another process to really get countries to phase out fossil fuels, a complementary process. So yesterday, Irene Velez Torres, Colombia's environment minister, along with ministers from Europe, Latin America, the Pacific Islands - Torres announced that they are making a new conference next year in Santa Marta, Colombia. This conference is explicitly dedicated to discussions around phasing out fossil fuels. Here is Minister Torres.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

IRENE VELEZ TORRES: The idea of the Santa Maria Conference is to have this first space in which we are completely clear that the phasing out is necessary because it's not easy. No one is saying that it is easy. But if we don't face the problems, we cannot build the solutions.

SIMON: It is a big deal that Colombia is hosting this new conference. They are an oil, gas and coal producer. The co-host will be the Netherlands, the birthplace of Shell oil. And at this conference, you likely will not see Russia and Saudi Arabia, who have been an obstacle for this phaseout of fossil fuels.

PFEIFFER: Julia, for these previous gatherings, there have often - they have often ended with commitments from countries to reduce their climate pollution. What's the assessment of how that effort is going?

SIMON: To answer that, I spoke to Alden Meyer. He's senior associate at climate change think tank E3G about this. He says, scientists say, collectively, country commitments are not nearly enough to avoid catastrophic warming. Right now, he says, countries are pursuing policies that would lead to their climate emissions falling by about 12% by 2035.

ALDEN MEYER: The science says we need five times that much. What I'm saying is, we're not even close.

SIMON: And this is why, again, many countries are looking to transition away from fossil fuels, the main driver of global warming.

PFEIFFER: I understand that the issue of trade was also a really big factor in this conference.

SIMON: Yeah, trade really took center stage. China is exporting massive amounts of solar, batteries, electric vehicles, all around the world. China has been pushing for free trade of this climate tech. So trade's becoming a climate issue, and this is actually an area where the U.S. is missing out. Climate tech is good for the climate, but it can also be good for a country's pocketbooks. China is now making more money exporting clean energy technologies than the U.S. is making exporting fossil fuels.

PFEIFFER: So China was at this conference. The U.S. was absent. It did not send an official delegation for the first time. What about Brazil, the host of this meeting, a meeting in a rainforest?

SIMON: Yes, we're in the Brazilian rainforest, in the Amazon. Brazilian hosts did play a key role in getting the agreement through, as contested as it was, and the Brazilians will be continuing to lead the negotiations, the discussions, until the next COP in Turkey.

PFEIFFER: That's NPR's Julia Simon reporting for us from Brazil. Thanks, Julia.

Georgia will add 26 new electric vehicle charging stations across the state.

GDOT approved a $24.4 million grant through the federal NEVI program.

Each site will include fast chargers capable of fully recharging vehicles in 20 minutes.

GEORGIA - More than two dozen new electric vehicle charging stations will be built across Georgia, according to the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT).

What we know

GDOT said the Georgia State Transportation Board approved a $24.4 million grant to build 26 new charging stations around the state. The grant is part of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Program, funded through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which allocated $5 billion nationwide over five years for states to expand EV charging networks.

Six privately owned companies will design, install, finance, operate, and maintain stations equipped with Direct Current Fast Charging (DCFC) ports for at least five years, in accordance with federal requirements.

Each site will include four DCFCs capable of operating simultaneously, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Depending on the vehicle, drivers will be able to fully recharge in as little as 20 minutes.

Charging stations will be built in the following counties: Atkinson, Baldwin, Bartow, Bibb, Bryan, Bulloch, Carroll, Cherokee, Clarke, Clay, Coweta, Decatur, Dougherty, Early, Franklin, Gilmer, Gordon, Greene, Habersham, Hall, Haralson, Harris, Hart, Liberty, McDuffie, McIntosh, Morgan, Muscogee, Pickens, Troup, Towns, Twiggs, Union, Ware, Warren, Wilkinson, and Worth.

What they're saying

""Our robust infrastructure network has set Georgia apart in attracting business, promoting travel, and providing reliable transportation for all Georgians,"" said Governor Brian P. Kemp. ""This investment will help further secure our status as a national leader in innovation and infrastructure for years to come. We appreciate Georgia DOT for fulfilling the state’s commitment to a robust, reliable fast-charging network that meets federal standards and serves communities across Georgia.""

A detailed communication addressed to senior officials in the Karnataka government and the Union Ministries of Power and New and Renewable Energy has warned that the state is entering a phase of structural power imbalance in which annual energy surplus coexists with rising peak-time shortages.

The letter, written by Shankar Sharma, a power and climate policy analyst and former power-sector professional from Sagara in the Western Ghats, draws attention to what he describes as Karnataka’s “ renewable paradox”: a projected surplus of 5,300 million units (MU) in 2027, alongside a forecast deficit of nearly 500 hours during peak demand in the same period. Citing a recent report in Down To Earth magazine, he argues that this mismatch is becoming increasingly common across states and could create significant financial and operational stress for the national power sector.

According to Sharma, the combination of daytime surplus solar generation, inflexible coal power schedules, and inadequate energy storage means that valuable renewable power is being routinely wasted or curtailed, compelling utilities to pay private generators to back down. He notes that curtailment losses in some states have reached 20–25 percent, and on certain days in October 2025, nearly 40 percent of solar output was denied grid access. The situation, he warns, is emerging as a nationwide concern, with media reports indicating that nearly 44 GW of renewable projects are unable to secure buyers in state utilities. If unaddressed, he states, this may jeopardize the country’s target of achieving 500 GW of clean energy capacity by 2030.

The communication attributes the crisis primarily to the absence of effective demand-side management and the lack of timely investments in energy storage. Sharma argues that India’s power planning continues to rely on outdated methods, leaving peak-hour deficits unmitigated and forcing coal power plants to operate below optimal plant load factors. At the same time, the transition toward large-scale renewable parks has not been matched by expansion of storage capacity. He criticises what he sees as an over-reliance on pumped storage projects (PSPs), which typically require five to eight years for completion and may involve major ecological impacts.

A major section of the letter focuses on Karnataka’s proposed 2,000 MW Sharavati pumped storage project, which is facing strong opposition due to its location in the Western Ghats. Sharma argues that the project is based on inadequate assessment, overlooks faster and less destructive alternatives such as battery energy storage systems (BESS), and fails to justify its siting within a protected biodiversity hotspot. He notes that BESS technology offers higher efficiency, shorter gestation periods of under a year, minimal land requirements, and negligible environmental impact. He contrasts this with the national government’s reported identification of nearly 200,000 MW in potential PSP sites, warning that widespread construction of such projects could seriously damage fragile river-valley ecosystems.

The letter points out that many states, including Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh, have already floated tenders for stand-alone BESS in the 1,500–2,000 MW range, indicating the growing acceptance of the technology. Karnataka itself has initiated two projects of around 100–120 MW. Sharma argues that if BESS were not economically viable, such tenders would not exist, and he questions why long-gestation PSPs continue to receive priority despite better alternatives.

He also highlights the absence of a national energy policy and criticises the lack of coordinated planning across states and ministries. A draft national energy policy prepared in 2017, he notes, has yet to be finalised, resulting in fragmented strategies that fail to account for India’s changing energy landscape.

The communication proposes multiple measures to address the emerging crisis, including mandatory storage components for large renewable projects, deployment of BESS at substation level in every taluk, expansion of distributed solar—especially rooftop and farm-based systems—development of smart mini-grids in rural areas, and shifting energy-intensive industries and new sectors such as data centres and electric mobility toward self-supplied renewable energy backed by storage. He also argues that solar-powered irrigation pumps with grid export capability could transform rural energy economics by reducing subsidies and enabling farmers to earn revenue from surplus power.

In conclusion, Sharma warns that without urgent corrective action, Karnataka and India may face escalating financial losses, environmental impacts, and grid-management challenges. He calls for political will, transparent public engagement and rigorous long-term planning to prevent deeper crises. “The dangers ahead are clearly written on the wall,” he writes, urging central and state authorities to act decisively to avoid a cycle of energy surplus and scarcity that could undermine the country’s clean-energy transition and economic growth trajectory.

Several of these enactments will play a pivotal role in long-term economic development, helping ensure the state is well-positioned going forward.

One crucial measure involved setting aside significant funds for the Texas State Technical College (TSTC) System for capital needs. TSTC provides training for numerous in-demand fields such as cybersecurity, welding, advanced manufacturing, automotive maintenance and repair, HVAC and other construction-related areas, and a variety of health care occupations. Many of these categories of workers are facing shortages which could constrain growth, and an expanding population and economy will only increase needs. Providing a meaningful endowment for current and future resource requirements (TSTC does not levy property taxes) is a key catalyst for growth.

Voters also approved setting aside $1 billion per year from sales tax revenue for the Texas Water Fund to invest in much needed water and wastewater infrastructure. Reliable water supplies are essential to growth in population, housing, expanding industry segments, and utilities. Strengthening water resilience helps support economic expansion, urban development, and quality of life. This amount represents only a small fraction of requirements but will undergird ongoing local and private-sector initiatives.

Funds were also allocated for the Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, which is modeled after the state’s cancer research institute. Investing in medical research not only addresses major public-health challenges, but it also fosters biotech, life-sciences, and research jobs in Texas. These industries, in turn, lead to significant multiplier effects throughout the economy. This measure addresses an enormous need and supports the ongoing expansion of the life sciences sector across the state.

Several measures will work to reduce tax burdens related to property taxes, though some will necessitate State support to make up for the reductions (including the increase in the school homestead tax exemption). By freeing up additional resources, these provisions will generate additional consumer spending (although maintaining them may pose fiscal challenges down the road).

Other amendments ensure that state-level capital gains and inheritance taxes will not be implemented. Taxes on stock- or securities-trading entities and related transactions are also prohibited. These measures are highly significant for the burgeoning finance industry in Texas and for investment more broadly. The state has a highly favorable environment for investors, startups, venture capital, and asset managers, and these policies strengthen the capital markets ecosystem by structurally securing a favorable climate for capital-intensive and finance-driven enterprises.

As always, there are tradeoffs, including reducing future fiscal flexibility and unencumbered receipts. On balance, however, voters have decidedly improved long-term prospects. By increasing emerging industry competitiveness, workforce preparedness, and infrastructure resources, these policies will facilitate future prosperity. Stay safe!

Nuclear power is gaining renewed interest due to increasing electricity demand from advances in AI.

Centrus Energy plays a critical role in the nuclear supply chain, providing low-enriched uranium and advanced uranium enrichment services.

It has an opportunity to become a domestic producer of high-assay, low-enriched uranium used in the next generation of nuclear reactors.

10 stocks we like better than Centrus Energy ›

Nuclear power may have taken a back seat in the last decade, but it's roaring back to the forefront thanks to the electrification of our grid and advances in artificial intelligence (AI).

According to the Bank of America Institute, U.S. electricity demand is projected to skyrocket at an impressive 2.5% compounded annually -- 5 times faster than the previous decade. Nuclear power is the largest source of low-carbon, clean energy, accounting for 18% of U.S. electricity today. With interest in nuclear energy surging, now may be the time to get in.

Centrus Energy (NYSEMKT: LEU) is one nuclear company that could play a pivotal role. As the U.S. aims to reduce reliance on foreign energy, Centrus could become a vital player in the domestic nuclear fuel supply chain.

The stock has been volatile, trading as low as $50 and as high as $464 this year. Today, the stock is down 47% from its 52-week high, and shares are priced below $270. Does that make Centrus a buy today? Let's dive into the investment opportunity ahead to find out.

Centrus plays a key role in the nuclear supply chain

Centrus Energy provides nuclear fuel components, along with enrichment and technical services, to customers. The bulk of its revenue comes from its low-enriched uranium (LEU) segment. Here, it sells LEU, the fissile component of most nuclear fuel, to utilities that operate commercial nuclear power plants. To fulfill its delivery commitments to customers, it sources uranium and related products from a range of global suppliers.

In its technical solutions segment, Centrus provides advanced uranium enrichment for the nuclear industry and the U.S. government, along with advanced manufacturing, engineering, and other technical services to both government and private-sector customers. A significant portion of this segment's revenue is derived from the high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU) operation contract with the Department of Energy.

At the moment, there are no commercially active HALEU reactors. The only HALEU reactors are test reactors, and these may not be operational until the late 2020s or early 2030s. A few companies are developing HALEU or HALEU-capable reactor designs, including TerraPower, Kairos Power, Westinghouse Electric, and Oklo.

Domestic nuclear fuel production is a huge opportunity

Centrus Energy is uniquely positioned as the only producer of HALEU for both commercial and national security applications that is licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). It's also the only company capable of producing HALEU outside of Russia, which is vital as HALEU will power the next generation of nuclear reactors.

Centrus is also the only U.S. company with a proven enrichment technology capable of meeting both commercial and national security needs. Stifel analysts have noted Centrus is ""uniquely positioned"" to play a significant role in rebuilding the nuclear enrichment supply chain.

Right now, Centrus relies on outside sources to deliver LEU. It has two commercial agreements to sell LEU, one of which is with TEXEX, a Russian entity, which it will need to diversify away from in the coming years. The company currently has a waiver from the Department of Energy that allows it to import LEU for all of its committed deliveries to U.S. customers in 2026 and 2027. However, the Russian LEU import ban is expected to be fully phased in by 2028 -- creating an urgent need to replace about 25% of enriched uranium currently imported from Russia.

Centrus aims to produce LEU and HALEU in-house using its advanced centrifuge technology. To do this, it will need to expand the uranium enrichment capacity at its Piketon, Ohio, plant. This hinges on Department of Energy funding, private investment, and long-term customer commitments. If Centrus succeeds, it could transition from reseller to a producer of key nuclear fuels.

Is Centrus Energy stock a buy?

Centrus is well positioned to become a key player in the nuclear fuel supply chain. The stock isn't cheap by any means, priced at 48.6 times this year's projected earnings per share (EPS). However, with the recent decline in the stock price, it's well off its high valuation of 88 times this year's EPS. Its growth trajectory is heavily dependent on becoming a primary domestic supplier of nuclear fuel. The timing of the growth is uncertain, as it's tied to the build-out of its Piketon plant, which will require significant upfront investment.

Centrus' valuation remains on the high end, but reflects investor optimism about its potential role in the future of nuclear energy. The stock is pricey, which makes it vulnerable to large price swings, so it's not ideal for conservative investors with a short time frame.

That said, I believe nuclear is the future, and Centrus Energy could be an important player, which is why I think this dip is a good opportunity for investors to build a small position in the nuclear company.

According to the New York Times, the new guidelines could remove millions of acres of wetlands from Federal protection including those in the Lake Houston Area.

Those wetlands help soak up water, reducing flood risk. They also clean water and provide habitat for wildlife. And that’s a large part of what makes living in this area so attractive.

Before the EPA

Those of us old enough to remember a time before the EPA can remember the stinking, fetid, poisonous messes our rivers and lakes had become. The Cuyahoga River near where I was born in Cleveland, Ohio, had caught on fire 13 times before the EPA was formed. It was a testament to the failure of local governments to withstand industry pressures.

We had reached a tipping point. That’s why in 1970, Congress formed the EPA – to set national standards that protected the environment.

But this week, Washington moved to weaken the Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act, two bedrock laws of environmental protection. The moves come as part of a broader deregulatory effort.

Ironically, the announced motive for the federal government getting out of the wetlands-protection business was to return authority for that to the states. That theory proved ineffective decades ago. But almost two thirds of Americans alive today, weren’t even born in 1970.

The regulatory vacuum left by the Federal government will open up a window for wetlands exploitation before the Texas legislature meets again for two more years. Developers are already lined up waiting to develop wetlands in the Lake Houston Area. Yesterday, I posted about Scarborough, Holley and Signorelli.

You can bet this will trigger a “swamp rush” among developers who see the opportunity to buy low and sell high. Unfortunately, we’ve seen over and over again, how wetlands tend to be in areas that flood. It will only be a matter of time before they do.

And then all those homes sold to unsuspecting couples – who were promised that their homes met all government requirements – will be left holding a soggy title to a home they will have trouble selling for dimes on the dollar.

Clearly, the pendulum has swung back in the other direction already.

The Houston Chronicle recently documented 65,000 homes built in Houston-area floodplains since Hurricane Harvey. How soon people have forgotten! We are witnessing another disaster in the making – one that could be even harder to recover from next time.

But the changes aren’t a done deal yet. America still has a choice.

Speak Up, Speak Out

Fight back. Make your voice heard. Make sure you register your opinion about the threat to wetlands here. And write your Federal representatives. Make this an election issue.

It just explains why some people in polo shirts try so hard to talk you out of it.","EV maintenance costs are not the problem for you. They’re a problem for your dealer. New-car margins are thin, so the real money comes from the “fixed ops” side of the house — parts and service — where gross margins often live in the 45–55% range, far higher than new-vehicle sales. When you pay for an oil change, a coolant flush, or a brake job, you’re feeding the profit engine that keeps the doors open.

This chart compares a “typical” gas SUV and a similar electric SUV over ten years of ownership. Each bar shows where your maintenance money goes — and how much of that stack simply disappears when you go electric.

Over time, a loyal gas-car owner becomes an annuity. Every 5,000–7,500 miles, back you come. The service department gets labor hours, parts markup, and a fresh chance to “find” something else that needs attention. That repeat business is baked into dealership planning. Take away that stack of gas car maintenance visits and the model starts to wobble.

What EV Owners Actually Spend on Maintenance

Now flip the view to your side of the key fob. Real-world data from a large Consumer Reports analysis shows EV owners spend about half as much on maintenance and repairs over the life of the vehicle as gas-car owners. Fewer moving parts, no oil changes, no exhaust, no spark plugs. That’s not marketing spin; it’s what people actually paid.

AAA’s Your Driving Costs numbers back it up. In 2023, they pegged average maintenance for new EVs at about 8.12 cents per mile, the lowest of any vehicle category they track. The U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne lab found the same pattern: battery-electric cars run about 40% cheaper per mile to maintain than gas cars.

This chart shows how much profit a dealer makes from one owner over about eight years, split into four towers. The two blue bars are the thin profit on the new-car sale (EV and ICE), which is basically the same. The green bar is what the dealer earns from servicing an EV over time, and the tall orange bar is what they earn from servicing an ICE car. The picture makes one point very clear: your EV doesn’t hurt the dealer on the sale — it hurts them because the big orange after-sales tower shrinks.

For you, that means the maintenance list on an EV shrinks to a short, boring lineup: tires, cabin filter, brake fluid checks, general inspections. Regenerative braking stretches pad life. There’s no timing belt hanging over your head at 100,000 miles, no turbocharged sludge drama, no “fuel system service” surprise on the invoice.

Why Your Dealer Isn't Rooting for EVs

Put yourself in the dealer’s chair for a second. A gas crossover with good fuel economy, decent ride comfort, and clean handling brings you back to the store again and again. Each visit adds to dealership profits and helps hit service targets. The EV version of the same model slices that revenue stream down. Same customer, less service, less money.

That incentive shapes the story you hear. Concerns about battery replacement, resale value, and repair costs for EVs get plenty of airtime. The boring math of lower EV maintenance costs gets a softer sell. Industry explainers openly describe service as the financial backbone of the business, with fixed-ops margins far above the front-of-house sales desk.

How to Cut Through the Sales Floor Static

So treat EV advice from a showroom or service lane the way you treat finance offers: assume there’s a house edge. When you’re cross-shopping an EV and a gas car, ask for a written maintenance schedule and estimated costs for five to eight years on both.

If the EV needs fewer trips to the shop, that’s less time wasted, less money burned, and less drama. The fact that it also trims dealership profits doesn’t make it a bad choice. It just explains why some people in polo shirts try so hard to talk you out of it.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/autoblog_arena_articles_145/5c05aef891021974dafc692c1df7e542,N,,2025-11-23 03:57:34.089919

The deal finalized at the COP30 conference pledges more money to help countries adapt to climate change, but lacks explicit plans to transition away from the fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas that heat the planet.

The conference didn't do as much as scientists thought the world needed. It wasn't as meaningful as activists and Indigenous people demanded. Few countries got everything they wanted. And the venue even caught fire.

But that disappointment is mixed with a few wins and the hope for countries to make more progress next year.

Here's what you need to know about the outcome.

Leaders tried to nail down specifics on fighting climate change

Leaders have been working on how to fight the impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather and sea level rise, for a decade. To do that, every country had the homework of writing up their own national climate plans and then reconvened this month to see if it was enough.

Most didn't get a good grade and some haven't even turned it in.

Brazil, host of the climate conference known as COP30, was trying to get them to cooperate on the toughest issues like climate-related trade restrictions, funding for climate solutions, national climate-fighting plans and more transparency on measuring those plans' progress.

More than 80 countries tried to introduce a detailed guide to phase out fossil fuels over the next several decades. There were other to-do items on topics including deforestation, gender and farming.

Countries reached what critics called a weak compromise

Nations agreed to triple the amount of money promised to help the vulnerable countries adapt to climate change. But they will take five more years to do it. Some vulnerable island countries said they were happy about the financial support.

But the final document didn't include a road map away from fossil fuels, angering many.

After the agreement was reached, COP President André Corrêa do Lago said Brazil would take an extra step and write their own road map. Not all countries signed up to this, but those on board will meet next year to specifically talk about the fossil fuel phase out. It would not carry the same weight as something agreed to at the conference.

Also included in the package were smaller agreements on energy grids and biofuels.

Responses ranged from happy to angry

“Given what we expected, what we came out with, we were happy,” said Ilana Seid, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States.

But others felt discouraged. Heated exchanges took place during the conference’s final meeting as countries snipped at each other about the fossil fuel plan.

“I will be brutally honest: The COP and the U.N. system are not working for you. They have never really worked for you. And today, they are failing you at a historic scale,” said Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez, a negotiator for Panama.

Jiwoh Abdulai, Sierra Leone’s environment and climate change minister said: “COP30 has not delivered everything Africa asked for, but it has moved the needle.” He added: ""This is a floor, not a ceiling.”

The real outcome of this year’s climate talks will be judged on “how quickly these words turn into real projects that protect lives and livelihoods,” he said.

Talks set against the Amazon rainforest

Participants experienced the Amazon’s extreme heat and humidity and heavy rains that flooded walkways. Organizers who chose Belem, on the edge of the rainforest, as the host city had intended for countries to experience firsthand what was at stake with climate change, and take bold action to stop it.

But afterward, critics said the deal shows how hard it is to find global cooperation on issues that affect everyone, most of all people in poverty, Indigenous people, women and children around the world.

“At the start of this COP, there was this high level of ambition. We started with a bang, but we ended with a whimper of disappointment,"" said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, now at Greenpeace International.

Indigenous people, civil society and youth

One of the nicknames for the climate talks in Brazil was the “Indigenous peoples' COP.” Yet some in those groups said they had to fight to be heard.

Protesters from Indigenous groups twice disrupted the conference to demand a bigger seat at the table. While Indigenous people's rights weren't officially on the agenda, Taily Terena, an Indigenous woman from the Terena nation in Brazil, said so far she is happy with the text because for the first time it includes a paragraph mentioning Indigenous rights.

She supported countries speaking up on procedural issues because that’s how multilateralism works. “It’s kind of chaotic, but from our perspective, it’s kind of good that some countries have a reaction,” she said.

With the right policy direction, the shift away from coal could help expand clean energy industries and boost long-term economic resilience.
The report highlights that nuclear energy will play a key role in meeting future demand.
Czechia can achieve deeper savings by refining existing support mechanisms, including its well-regarded New Green Savings (NZÚ) home improvement programme.
Expanding the use of district heating networks could improve the efficiency of low-emissions energy sources, reduce waste, and enhance electricity grid stability.","A new report released by the International Energy Agency (IEA) highlights that Czechia has the potential to unlock major economic opportunities as it advances toward its energy and climate goals, but emphasizes that strong planning and consistent policy implementation will be essential for success. The publication, Czechia 2025, provides a comprehensive review of the country’s energy policies across all major sectors and lays out a series of recommendations aimed at strengthening energy security, ensuring affordability, and cutting emissions.

One of the central messages of the report is the need for Czechia to move quickly away from coal, which currently supplies more than one-third of the country’s electricity and half of its district heating. Although Czechia has committed to phasing out coal-fired power plants by 2033, rising carbon prices and broader economic factors could accelerate closures, making it urgent for the country to scale up alternative energy sources while managing the social and economic impacts in coal-dependent regions, supporting workforce transitions, and maintaining public support.

The report stresses that the clean energy transition also brings significant opportunities for industrial growth. Czechia already hosts a strong heat pump manufacturing base, and domestic production of electric vehicles exceeded 150,000 units in 2024. With the right policy direction, the shift away from coal could help expand clean energy industries and boost long-term economic resilience.

However, the IEA notes that clear and coordinated policies are necessary to guide this transformation. While the country has set ambitious climate and energy targets, it now needs a new long-term energy strategy that aligns plans with national goals, provides predictability for markets, and strengthens investor confidence.

In recent years, Czechia has made notable progress in strengthening energy security, reducing its dependence on Russian oil, gas, and nuclear fuel, and diversifying its supply sources. It is also developing new mechanisms to encourage investment in dispatchable power generation. Yet as electrification accelerates, and with projections that Czechia may become a net electricity importer by 2030, ensuring a secure electricity supply will become increasingly important.

The report highlights that nuclear energy will play a key role in meeting future demand. Extending the life of existing nuclear plants, moving ahead with new large reactors, and advancing plans for small modular reactors (SMRs) could allow nuclear power to remain a central pillar of Czechia’s low-carbon electricity system through the middle of the century while supporting thousands of skilled jobs.

At the same time, Czechia is steadily expanding its renewable energy capacity. Rooftop solar installations have grown rapidly, but wind and utility-scale solar projects continue to lag behind targets due to permitting challenges and local opposition. To accelerate progress, the IEA recommends that the government set binding targets for renewable energy deployment, improve auction schedules, reform regulatory frameworks to strengthen corporate power purchase agreements, and expand access to the electricity grid for new projects.

Consumer affordability remains a key policy priority, and the report indicates that greater demand-side flexibility, supported by widespread smart meter rollout, could help lower electricity prices. Electricity tariff reforms could further support the electrification of transport, heating, and industrial processes, leading to greater energy savings and reduced emissions.

The IEA also points to additional opportunities for energy efficiency. Czechia can achieve deeper savings by refining existing support mechanisms, including its well-regarded New Green Savings (NZÚ) home improvement programme. Expanding the use of district heating networks could improve the efficiency of low-emissions energy sources, reduce waste, and enhance electricity grid stability. As part of its long-standing practice, the IEA’s review provides detailed recommendations to support policy development and encourages the exchange of best practices among member countries to strengthen global progress on energy and climate goals.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/4-3.png,N,,2025-11-22 22:58:12.301421

Several of these enactments will play a pivotal role in long-term economic development, helping ensure the state is well-positioned going forward.

One crucial measure involved setting aside significant funds for the Texas State Technical College (TSTC) System for capital needs. TSTC provides training for numerous in-demand fields such as cybersecurity, welding, advanced manufacturing, automotive maintenance and repair, HVAC and other construction-related areas, and a variety of health care occupations. Many of these categories of workers are facing shortages which could constrain growth, and an expanding population and economy will only increase needs. Providing a meaningful endowment for current and future resource requirements (TSTC does not levy property taxes) is a key catalyst for growth.

Voters also approved setting aside $1 billion per year from sales tax revenue for the Texas Water Fund to invest in much needed water and wastewater infrastructure. Reliable water supplies are essential to growth in population, housing, expanding industry segments, and utilities. Strengthening water resilience helps support economic expansion, urban development, and quality of life. This amount represents only a small fraction of requirements but will undergird ongoing local and private-sector initiatives.

Funds were also allocated for the Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, which is modeled after the state’s cancer research institute. Investing in medical research not only addresses major public-health challenges, but it also fosters biotech, life-sciences, and research jobs in Texas. These industries, in turn, lead to significant multiplier effects throughout the economy. This measure addresses an enormous need and supports the ongoing expansion of the life sciences sector across the state.

Several measures will work to reduce tax burdens related to property taxes, though some will necessitate State support to make up for the reductions (including the increase in the school homestead tax exemption). By freeing up additional resources, these provisions will generate additional consumer spending (although maintaining them may pose fiscal challenges down the road).

Other amendments ensure that state-level capital gains and inheritance taxes will not be implemented. Taxes on stock- or securities-trading entities and related transactions are also prohibited. These measures are highly significant for the burgeoning finance industry in Texas and for investment more broadly. The state has a highly favorable environment for investors, startups, venture capital, and asset managers, and these policies strengthen the capital markets ecosystem by structurally securing a favorable climate for capital-intensive and finance-driven enterprises.

As always, there are tradeoffs, including reducing future fiscal flexibility and unencumbered receipts. On balance, however, voters have decidedly improved long-term prospects. By increasing emerging industry competitiveness, workforce preparedness, and infrastructure resources, these policies will facilitate future prosperity.

At a “Hydrogen Day’’ event the following year, Cummins officials said they anticipated the company’s hydrogen production business to grow quickly over the next few years.
“When Cummins first manufactured hydrogen electrolyzers, they had to make them overseas,” Biden said during the visit.
“The overall impact is having major consequences for the use of electrolyzers, the production of green hydrogen and green ammonia,” Moberg said.
Last month, the Chinese government announced plans ramp up its green hydrogen capacity by the end of the decade.","Experts warn that the Trump administration’s rollback of climate initiatives could slow the adoption of technologies and development of infrastructure that Columbus’ largest employer considers central to its future in a world moving away from fossil fuels.

Those concerns are already reverberating through the clean hydrogen sector, which experts say is feeling the strain as the administration cancels billions of dollars in grants for hydrogen hubs, winds down hydrogen production tax credits ahead of schedule and steers the U.S. Department of Energy back toward fossil fuels.

Cummins Inc. — the largest employer in Columbus — has spent years investing in hydrogen technologies, including electrolyzers, which are devices that use electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The resulting hydrogen can be used to power energy-intensive industries such as steelmaking, maritime transport and other applications that solar and wind alone cannot easily support.

Experts say the policy shift risks ceding the electrolyzer market to China, where government investment and adoption are accelerating. Beijing has been pouring money into hydrogen production and infrastructure, positioning Chinese firms to dominate the global market of a technology the United States helped pioneer.

“What this could potentially do is just put (the United States) behind in that technology push and just leave us watching as China and others just pump out electrolyzers and basically build facilities on a backbone of non-U.S. technologies,” said Gabriel Fillipelli, professor of earth sciences at IU Indianapolis and executive director of the IU Environmental Resilience Institute.

‘Strategic review’

Signs of market instability have already emerged. Danish manufacturer Topsoe recently paused a $400 million electrolyzer project in Virginia, citing the administration’s policy changes. German electrolyzer maker Thyssenkrupp Nucera told investors it would abandon several U.S. green-hydrogen projects after incentives were scaled back.

And on Nov. 6, Cummins said it would begin a “strategic review” of its electrolyzer business after seeing “rapidly deteriorating conditions” in hydrogen markets. The company pointed to “significantly weaker prospects for demand” and reduced federal support as key factors.

“During the third quarter of 2025 … we observed rapidly deteriorating conditions in our electrolyzer markets and overall hydrogen markets, along with significant uncertainty in the alternative-power markets resulting from reductions in government incentives,” the company said.

Cummins Chair and CEO Jennifer Rumsey told analysts this month that the review will help the company “assess the best path forward” as the company responds to “to a very weak demand outlook.”

Despite the strategic review, Cummins said that it remains committed to “zero-emissions investments on the most promising paths to ensure we are set up for long-term success.”

Shift in momentum

The announcement of the strategic review comes after years of momentum in Cummins’ hydrogen and low-carbon ambitions — including a rebranded business segment, federal grants, White House visits, Senate testimony and even a presidential stop at one of its facilities.

Experts say that today’s landscape stands in stark contrast to just two and a half years ago, when President Joe Biden visited a Cummins facility in Minnesota and touted the company’s electrolyzer production.

“Clearly, the political change (in the United States) has been quite significant,” said Jonas Moberg, CEO of Green Hydrogen Organisation, a Switzerland-based not-for-profit that seeks to accelerate the production and use of green hydrogen across a range of sectors globally.

“There is a … challenging situation (globally) amplified in the U.S. by the political changes and the dismantling of much of the (Biden-era climate initiatives),” Moberg added.

Many of the changes in U.S. energy policy can be traced back to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Trump administration’s signature piece of legislation, experts said. The bill phases out green hydrogen production tax credits ahead of schedule, which experts said has prompted companies to pause or abandon projects.

Additionally, the Trump administration cut $2.2 billion in grants for regional hydrogen hubs in California and the Pacific Northwest last month, as well as an additional $5.4 billion for other clean energy projects across 16 states, The Associated Press reported.

In an interview with One America News, a conservative outlet, Trump said, “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place.”

For many experts, the administration’s shift in priorities was not entirely surprising.

“If you stop and think of the changes being made, part of the platform during the election cycle was, ‘Drill, baby, drill,’” said Steven Mohler, assistant professor of management at IU Columbus. “That’s one of those flags that go up and say, ‘Oh, maybe we’re going to slow down the progress on green energy and concerns with climate change.’”

Hydrogen efforts

Cummins’ turn toward clean hydrogen long predates the recent policy reversals. The company began expanding into the sector several years ago as part of a broader effort to secure its place in a global economy that is shifting away from fossil fuels and the diesel engines the company is most known for.

Clean hydrogen, often referred to as “green hydrogen,” is produced by using renewable electricity to separate hydrogen atoms from oxygen atoms in wager molecules, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. However, most hydrogen produced today is not green but rather extracted from natural gas in a process that generates carbon dioxide emissions. But unlike fossil fuels, the only byproduct of hydrogen combustion is water vapor.

In recent years, several Cummins officials have said they expect green hydrogen and electrolyzers to play an important role in cutting emissions in some of the industries that are most dependent on fossil fuels, including being a “key piece in the decarbonization of transportation and industry.”

In 2019, Cummins acquired Hydrogenics Corp., adding what the company describes as key electrolyzer and fuel-cell technologies to its portfolio. At a “Hydrogen Day’’ event the following year, Cummins officials said they anticipated the company’s hydrogen production business to grow quickly over the next few years.

Then-Cummins Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger said during the event that the company already had more than 500 electrolyzer installations across five continents and projected that the business would generate roughly $400 million in revenue by 2025.

“All in all, hydrogen technologies, particularly electrolyzers, will be a fast growing and increasingly important part of our business over the next few years,” Linebarger said during the event.

Cummins executives also made the case for green hydrogen in the nation’s capital. In March 2021, then-Cummins Vice Chairman Tony Satterthwaite urged the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to help accelerate the development and adoption of green hydrogen.

“Infrastructure is a fundamental chicken-and-egg problem,” Satterthwaite told The Republic on March 17, 2021, following his Senate testimony. “…Without infrastructure, you don’t get adoption, and without adoption, nobody invests in infrastructure. And so, we see a definite role for the federal government to kick start that chicken-and-egg cycle and provide some incentives for early investment in infrastructure.”

Waves of incentives

Later that year, Congress would enact the first of two pieces of legislation that provided billions of dollars in incentives for green hydrogen production and technologies.

In November 2021, Congress passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, which steered $9.5 billion toward green hydrogen, including $1 billion for electrolysis technologies such as electrolyzers, $500 million for clean hydrogen manufacturing and $8 billion for regional hydrogen hubs to accelerate the development of a hydrogen supply chain.

Rumsey, who was Cummins president and chief operating officer at the time, traveled to the White House to attend the signing ceremony for the bill. Following the ceremony, she told The Republic, “There was a piece of this infrastructure bill that was focused on starting to build out an infrastructure that we think is key for decarbonization and our country. It includes substantial investment in hydrogen infrastructure and charging infrastructure and also recognition of the importance of low-carbon fuels.”

In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which provided additional policies and incentives for green hydrogen, including a hydrogen production tax credit of as much as $3 per kilogram produced.

Shortly after the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, Cummins announced that it would be dedicating 89,000-square-feet of its Minnesota facility to start producing electrolyzers in the United States in what the company described at the time as a “milestone.”

In March 2023, Cummins rebranded its new power business as Accelera to emphasize its portfolio of zero emissions technologies, including electrolyzers.

Following the announcement of the rebrand, Srikanth Padmanabhan, former president of Cummins’ engine business, told The Republic that “this (new brand) provides an opportunity for us to move into areas like electrolyzers that others don’t recognize Cummins as a player in because historically we’ve been in the transportation and mobility spaces.”

The following month, Biden visited Cummins’ Minnesota facility, speaking for around 30 minutes and touting the company’s efforts to ramp up its hydrogen production business in the United States.

“When Cummins first manufactured hydrogen electrolyzers, they had to make them overseas,” Biden said during the visit. “…But now, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, with the tax credits for renewable energy, Cummins is going to manufacture these electrolyzers here in America for the first time.”

By December 2024, Cummins had secured tens of millions of dollars in federal grants related to electrolyzer manufacturing and testing, including around $18 million for a project funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, according to federal records. Around the same time, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., announced that Cummins had also received a $10.5 million tax-credit allocation under the Inflation Reduction Act for investing in electrolyzer manufacturing and testing.

But over the past several months, the Trump administration and Congress have undone much of the climate initiatives in the two bills.

Congressional votes

While Columbus’ largest employer strongly supported the hydrogen provisions in the two Biden-era bills, the city’s congressional delegation opposed the legislation.

Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., and then-Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., voted against the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, while then-Rep. Greg Pence, R-Ind., voted against it twice, according to congressional records.

Braun, who is now Indiana governor, said in a tweet on X on Aug. 10, 2021, “Through borrowing from our kids and grandkids we’re going to take this country to a level of debt and deficits we’ve never been to before, and Republicans are complicit in it for going along with this infrastructure bill that’s part of it.”

The delegation also opposed the Inflation Reduction Act. Young and Braun voted against the bill, while Pence voted against an initial version of the bill but did not cast a vote on the final version, according to congressional records.

At the same, Columbus’ congressional delegation unanimously supported Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” according to congressional records.

Young and Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., voted in favor the bill, as did Rep. Jefferson Shreve, R-Ind., and Rep. Erin Houchin, R-Ind. Both Shreve and Houchin said following the vote that the bill “unleashes American energy consumption.”

At least for now, the outlook for green hydrogen in the United States is “pretty negative,” experts said.

“The overall impact is having major consequences for the use of electrolyzers, the production of green hydrogen and green ammonia,” Moberg said. “There are so many consequences, and some of them are outside of the (Inflation Reduction Act). So, the fact that the president has been very negative on offshore wind and on solar, that also slows down the development of the production of renewable energy. And of course, you need a lot of renewable energy to run these electrolyzers. …I think the overall current situation, in particular in the U.S., is pretty negative.”

Falling behind China

While the Trump administration is pulling back from clean hydrogen, China is going in the opposite direction, experts said.

Last month, the Chinese government announced plans ramp up its green hydrogen capacity by the end of the decade. The country is already home to the largest green hydrogen project in the world, as well as roughly 40% of all hydrogen refueling stations, according to a report by the World Economic Forum in January. Almost 60% of the world’s electrolyzers are made in Chinese factories, according to Bloomberg.

U.S. and China green hydrogen forecasts once tracked closely. But since the policy reversal in Washington, the gap is expected to sharply widen. S&P Global Commodity Insights now projects China will produce 33.4 million metric tons of green hydrogen by 2050, almost three times its previous estimate before Trump took office in January.

By comparison, the United States was estimated to be on track to reach 9.3 million metric tons by 2050 before Trump’s reelection. SP Global Commodity Insights has since sliced that projection in half.

“We’re already well behind,” Fillipelli said. “All the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill were going to do is kind of get us slightly more caught up. We were already losing ground. And frankly, the country we’re losing ground to is China. …They’re investing so much in this. It’s shocking.”

“If you look across the board, they, where we’ve been pulling back, they’ve been leaning in,” Fillipelli added. “…Had we maintained the funding that we had set aside for this in the last administration, we very well might be able to catch up. Now, it seems less likely that we’ll be able to catch up.”

In the short run, the shake-up in federal clean-energy policy could have an impact on engineering and research efforts in Columbus — particularly when paired with the Trump administration’s recent move to raise the cost of an H-1B visa for skilled foreign workers to $100,000, experts said.

“As Cummins goes, we go — we have to say that up front,” Mohler said, referring to the local economy. “But the most impact I would see for our area would probably be in innovation (and) engineering activity. …The H-1B visa may have an impact on that as well. …With H-1B visas going up so high, and this hydrogen technology not readily accepted in the U.S., but it is in the Asia Pacific Area, you wonder if this doesn’t benefit those economies. Because Cummins (could) go ahead and hire the engineers and the scientists, let them stay where they’re at, do things remotely, and produce this technology for the growing China market.”

“Clean energy is something that will continue to move forward because climate change is becoming more and more evident,” Mohler added. “But without government support and assistance, we may consider … that progress will slow temporarily. …Who knows what the next administration will do? …The Biden administration put a lot of U.S. dollars behind it. The Trump administration is stepping back from that.”",,N,,2025-11-22 20:58:20.073710

In Michigan, a new battery storage project is serving as a prime example of the potential energy gains battery storage offers.

According to a press release by Michigan's newsroom, the state has opened its first utility-scale battery project, the Tibbits Energy Storage Facility. Located in Coldwater, the project is the result of a joint effort by Jupiter Power and Consumers Energy.

Battery storage facilities play a crucial role in meeting energy demands and stabilizing the grid. Wind turbines, for example, generate a surplus of clean energy on windy days. By pairing those turbines with a battery storage system, companies can optimize how that energy is used, storing it on days when extra energy isn't needed and releasing it during times when energy demands are high.

Likewise, solar panels produce more power on sunny days than on cloudy or rainy days. To prevent that extra energy from getting wasted, battery storage systems conserve that energy for times when energy supplies are low.

As a result, battery storage systems ""stabilize electricity prices and strengthen reliability for local providers,"" according to the press release, providing clean energy to the local community while decreasing energy prices.

The Tibbits Energy Storage Facility doesn't just provide 100 megawatts of power, though. It also provides ""$1.7 million in benefits to Coldwater Township"" and creates ""good-paying jobs.""

""Battery storage is the backbone of a clean, affordable and reliable energy system,"" Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy Director Phil Roos noted in the press release. ""Projects like the Tibbits Energy Storage Facility are a testament to what's possible when innovation, forward-thinking policy and strong partnerships come together.""

As states continue to prioritize clean energy goals, they help improve air quality, combat rising global temperatures, and strengthen local grid resilience.

A statement follows from NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council) president Manish Bapna:

“Despite pressure from Washington and the fossil fuel industry, the world refused to backslide at this year’s climate talks. Though the pace of progress was slower than what the climate crisis demands, countries continued to march forward in the face of unprecedented headwinds.

“While much more work lies ahead, the climate conference concluded with most countries around the world, including almost all major emitters, setting new climate pollution reduction targets.

“Importantly, countries also set a new goal to at least triple adaptation finance by 2035 to provide critical support to the countries that are suffering the most from the climate crisis, yet have contributed to the problem the least, and have the fewest resources to address it.

“There is growing global consensus that cutting the pollution driving the climate crisis, and protecting against its impacts, is a matter of survival, of security, and of economic opportunity. Leaders around the world are increasingly recognizing that the costs of inaction—as well as the benefits of the solutions—are both simply too great to ignore.

“Progress made still falls short of what we need to meet the moment. But we saw large coalitions of countries and businesses setting the stage for future actions.

“While negotiators did not agree to roadmaps to transition away from fossil fuels and reverse deforestation and degradation by 2030 as many had hoped, over 85 countries supported the development of each. In a welcome surprise at the end of the conference, however, Brazil announced they will advance both roadmaps through a parallel political process. These action plans are needed to deliver on goals the global community has already set and must remain top priorities for ongoing global climate collaboration.

“While the targets set were stronger than in the past, they must be the floor not the ceiling. Promises made in Brazil must be kept at home—from pollution cuts, to scaling up climate finance.

“The good news for the climate fight is: Momentum continued to build at COP30 and does not stop when leaders go home. Ten years after the historic Paris Climate Agreement, the economics have undeniably shifted in favor of clean energy—and the world is inevitably moving in that direction. The bad news for America is: The U.S. opts out of this multi-trillion-dollar market at its own peril—and the countries that step in will bring the jobs and economic opportunity home for themselves.”

The halted project, intended for Baytown, Texas, was set to become one of the world’s largest hydrogen plants. This strategic shift underscores the complexities involved in transitioning from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources, especially when market demand doesn’t align with early expectations. The suspension not only reflects Exxon’s cautious approach but also mirrors broader industry trends impacted by economic uncertainties and fluctuating consumer interest.

Exxon Mobil’s Ambitious Hydrogen Venture

In 2022, Exxon Mobil unveiled plans for a pioneering hydrogen production facility at its Baytown, Texas complex. The project aimed to generate 1 billion cubic feet per day of “blue hydrogen,” a type of hydrogen that promises environmental benefits by producing water when burned. This initiative was part of Exxon’s broader strategy to diversify its energy portfolio beyond conventional oil and gas. The facility was expected to play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions by capturing and storing carbon dioxide produced during hydrogen production.

Despite these environmental aspirations, the project has encountered significant financial and logistical hurdles. The production of blue hydrogen involves capturing and storing carbon dioxide, a process that incurs higher costs compared to traditional hydrogen production methods. These added expenses have made potential customers hesitant to commit, leading to a lack of demand necessary to push the project forward. As a result, Exxon has invested $500 million into a venture now paused indefinitely.

Economic Factors Affecting Hydrogen Demand

The economic landscape has played a critical role in Exxon’s decision to pause the hydrogen project. CEO Darren Woods cited weak customer demand as a primary reason for the suspension. The industrial slowdown in Europe, coupled with broader economic uncertainties, has further suppressed interest in hydrogen as a viable energy alternative. Potential clients are wary of the high costs associated with hydrogen, especially when cheaper, albeit less environmentally friendly, energy sources are available.

Moreover, the global economic climate remains unpredictable, with factors such as geopolitical tensions and fluctuating energy prices influencing market dynamics. These uncertainties make long-term investments in new technologies like hydrogen riskier for both producers and potential customers. Consequently, Exxon’s cautious approach reflects a broader industry hesitation to fully commit to clean energy projects without assured profitability or demand.

Challenges in Transitioning to Clean Energy

The halt of Exxon’s hydrogen project is emblematic of the challenges traditional energy companies face in transitioning to cleaner energy sources. While there is a growing consensus on the need for sustainable alternatives, the path to achieving this transition is fraught with obstacles. One significant barrier is the economic viability of clean energy projects, which often require substantial upfront investment and face competition from established fossil fuel-based technologies.

Exxon’s experience underscores the importance of securing committed customers who are willing to sign contracts for hydrogen off-take. Without these assurances, companies are reluctant to proceed with large-scale investments. This scenario highlights the need for supportive policies and incentives that can encourage both producers and consumers to embrace cleaner energy solutions. As the world seeks ways to reduce carbon emissions, the interplay between market forces and regulatory frameworks will play a decisive role in shaping the future of energy.

The Road Ahead for Exxon’s Hydrogen Ambitions

Despite the current pause, Exxon remains optimistic about the future potential of hydrogen as an energy source. CEO Woods expressed confidence that the demand for hydrogen will eventually materialize, allowing the company to restart the project. He emphasized that the Baytown facility would be an advantaged project once market conditions improve. This belief underscores Exxon’s long-term commitment to integrating hydrogen into its energy portfolio.

However, the timing of this resurgence in demand remains uncertain. As economic conditions and technological advancements evolve, Exxon must navigate a complex landscape to align its business strategies with market realities. The company’s ability to adapt to these changes will be crucial in determining the success of its hydrogen ambitions. The question remains: can Exxon and other traditional energy firms effectively balance their existing operations with the growing imperative for sustainable energy solutions?

As Exxon Mobil navigates the complexities of transitioning to cleaner energy, the pause on its hydrogen plant raises critical questions about the future of energy production. With economic uncertainties and fluctuating market demands, the energy industry faces a pivotal moment in its evolution. How will traditional energy companies overcome these challenges and drive advancements in clean energy technology?

The first part of the year brought a steep decline in share price as investors grappled with declining global sales, profits, and consumer backlash from Elon Musk's political antics. The next tale was of Tesla's swift and significant rebound in share price as investors looked to the future possibilities in artificial intelligence, robotics, and robotaxis. Tesla's next small speed bump has arrived, and this one comes in the form of disappointing news in a key market.

What's going on?

Just about every automaker in China is having a rough time. The market much more quickly adopted electric vehicles (EVs) and the government helped subsidize domestic automakers to bolster their technology and innovation. It worked almost too well and the result was a plethora of advanced domestic electric vehicle makers that created a brutal price war. It dealt massive blows to foreign automakers that couldn't compete on product, price, or both. To make matters worse the overall industry has a problem with production overcapacity and now Chinese automakers are rushing to export vehicles overseas, potentially bringing ultra-competitive and highly advanced EVs to the U.S. doorstep which is currently protected by steep tariffs on import vehicles.

Tesla has fared better than some competitors, but it has still felt the crunch in China. Recent data suggests more of the same: Tesla's sales in China dropped to 26,006 in October, the lowest in three years. Sales plunged 36% compared to the prior year, and the sales number was a far cry from September's figure of 71,525 when Tesla began deliveries of the Model Y L, a longer-wheelbase and six-seat version of the Model Y. Tesla's share of China's EV market checked in at a modest 3.2% in October, down substantially from 8.7% in September and its lowest again in three years.

The silver lining, although it isn't much of one, is that Tesla's exports of China-made vehicles rose to a two-year high of 35,491 last month. Unfortunately, that silver lining only extends so far, and Tesla's struggles are widespread. In October, Tesla sales fell 23% year over year in four markets: North America, Europe, China, and South Korea, according to data tracked by Wells Fargo's Colin Langan.

The road ahead

With Tesla's sales lagging in key markets around the world, and analysts expecting a slowdown in the North American EV market after the $7,500 federal tax credit expired at the end of September, one might think Tesla's stock would be in the dumps. That's far from the case -- Tesla's valuation remains insanely lofty at a price-to-earnings of roughly 290 and its market capitalization is more than Ford Motor Company and General Motors combined 10 times over.

That's simply because investors and analysts are focused on Tesla's future potential. In fact, shareholders just approved with a 75% rate a compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that's valued at up to $1 trillion. The kicker is that many of Musk's milestones are based on future businesses: He needs to sell cars but also 10 million driver assistance subscriptions, 1 million robots, and commercially operate 1 million robotaxis.

Ultimately, shareholders' vote on Musk's compensation package comes at an ideal time for investors to also revisit their investing thesis on Tesla. Tesla has the ability to innovate its way to a lucrative future based on AI, robotics, and driverless vehicles, but right now it's still mostly an automaker and that business isn't great currently. Investors would be wise to expect a few bumpy quarters from Tesla as it tries to navigate choppy waters that include an aging lineup, mounting lawsuits, consumer backlash and declining sales, struggling profits, a slow ramp in its robotaxi business, among other headwinds.",https://finviz.com/favicon_2x.png,N,,2025-11-22 19:59:21.885638

Texas Pacific Land Investment Narrative Recap

To be a shareholder in Texas Pacific Land, you need to believe in the continued demand for Permian Basin oil and gas royalties and the steady growth of its water services business, despite industry volatility. The recent earnings miss may not materially impact these short-term drivers, but does highlight the sensitivity of future performance to fluctuations in commodity prices and operational revenues.

Among the recent announcements, the company’s Q3 2025 earnings report is most relevant here, as both revenue and earnings per share came in below analyst forecasts. This is especially important given the company’s high price-to-earnings ratio and investor expectations for ongoing robust royalty and water segment growth, making future quarterly results a key catalyst for sentiment shifts.

By contrast, investors should be aware that Texas Pacific Land’s high dependence on Permian activity could pose a risk if...

Texas Pacific Land is expected to generate $895.3 million in revenue and $610.3 million in earnings by 2028. This is based on an assumed annual revenue growth rate of 7.2% and represents a $150.1 million increase in earnings from the current level of $460.2 million.

ENDS Notes to editors: Read the UK’s new Critical Minerals Strategy: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-critical-minerals-strategy The UK currently produces 6% of the UK’s critical minerals needs domestically.
Our activities within magnets and other critical materials perfectly align with the new focus of the Critical Minerals Strategy.","New Critical Minerals Strategy sets out the ambition to produce 10% of UK’s mineral needs domestically and 20% through recycling by 2035.

At least 50,000 tonnes of lithium to be produced in the UK by 2035 – more than the weight of the Titanic.

Up to £50 million fund backs UK businesses by boosting critical minerals projects and turbocharging domestic production and processing, helping UK move ahead in the global race.

Britain’s supplies of the vital materials powering everyday essentials like smartphones and fridges are set to be shored up as the Prime Minister launches the UK’s new Critical Minerals Strategy today [22 November].

The strategy, backed by up to £50 million new funding, will aim to reduce the UK’s overreliance on foreign imports of critical minerals essential for everyday life by ramping up domestic production, protecting the UK from shortages in global shocks like natural disasters or war.

The move comes as the Government doubles down on shoring up supply chains as part of its push on national security.

China currently dominates global critical mineral production and supply chains, for example controlling 70% and 90% of rare earth mining and refining respectively, making Britain vulnerable from overreliance on a select few exporters for its supplies of materials needed to power things like electric vehicles and wind turbines.

But in the UK alone, demand for copper – used for electric plugs in our homes and the brakes in our cars – is set to almost double by 2035, while demand for lithium – vital for powering our laptops and electric cars – will increase by 1,100%.

That is why the Government is taking decisive action to ensure no more than 60% of the UK’s supply of any one critical mineral is imported from any one country by 2035.

The strategy will see the Government work with the sector to harness the UK’s world leading capability with Europe’s largest lithium deposit in Cornwall, one of the largest sources of tungsten globally, one of the largest nickel refineries in Europe in Clydach, Swansea and the only Western source of rare earth alloys used in the magnets found in wind turbines and F-35 fighter jets, amongst others.

It will help the UK meet 10% of its demand through domestic production, with 20% to come from recycling of products to recover minerals. This is the first time the UK has set out clear, tangible ambitions to grow domestic production and recycling, while reducing our reliance on third countries.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said:

Critical minerals are the backbone of modern life and our national security – powering everything from smartphones and fighter jets to electric vehicles and wind turbines.

For too long, Britain has been dependent on a handful of overseas suppliers, leaving our economy and national security exposed to global shocks.

That is why we are taking decisive action to change that, boosting domestic production, ramping up recycling, and backing British businesses with the investment they need to compete on the international stage and drive down the cost of living for people at home.

Industry Minister Chris McDonald said:

We need critical minerals for everything – from the phones we use to the cars we drive – and for too long we’ve been dependent on a select few sources for our supplies of them, putting our national security at risk.

Now, we’re taking the bold action needed to shore up our supply chains, ramp up domestic production and back businesses with the investment they need to create new jobs and drive growth, as part of our Plan for Change.

The new strategy also has the ambition to produce at least 50,000 tonnes of lithium in the UK in the next decade – more than the weight of the Titanic (around 46,000 tonnes).

The Government will deliver on the strategy by supporting UK businesses to grow and scale up their production with up to £50 million funding to boost critical minerals projects, as well as through our strong public finance offer, including investments via the National Wealth Fund and UK Export Finance.

In September the National Wealth Fund announced a £31 million commitment to Cornish Lithium to advance the Trelavour Lithium Project towards a construction decision and the Cross Lanes Geothermal Lithium Project to commercial drilling.

Businesses’ industrial electricity costs will also be slashed through the government’s British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme (BICS), encouraging firms to grow and drive new investment into the UK. The Government will launch a consultation on eligibility for BICS shortly.

To achieve the strategy’s bold aims the Government will also support permitting for innovative projects in domestic production and recycling through the Environment Agency’s priority tracked service, and work with Skills England and the Department for Work and Pensions to support the skills required in the UK to meet the Strategy’s goals.

For the first time, the new Critical Minerals Strategy is also laser-focused on growing the economy in line with the Government’s wider Plan for Growth, with critical minerals earmarked as a foundational sector to the modern Industrial Strategy.

The critical minerals sector contributes £1.79 billion to the UK economy and directly supports over 50,000 jobs, while there are currently more than 50 critical mineral projects based in the UK aimed at extracting and refining these vital materials.

Key regions including across North East England, in County Durham and Teesside, and the South West in Devon and Cornwall, have vital resources.

Jamie Airnes, CEO of Cornish Lithium, said:

We welcome the publication of the UK Government’s Critical Minerals Strategy that provides a clear strategic framework within which industrial scale UK critical minerals production can become a reality. The strategy highlights the need to accelerate domestic capability, unlock investment, and build strategic partnerships – all of which are essential to delivering lithium production at scale.

Securing a domestic supply of critical minerals, including lithium, will create high-quality jobs, deliver supply chain resilience and support key manufacturing sectors across the UK. We look forward to working closely with Government and industry partners to turn this strategy into action.

Jeff Townsend, Critical Minerals Association, said:

We welcome the Government’s renewed commitment to securing the critical minerals that underpin the UK’s Industrial Strategy and future economic resilience. This strategy marks an important and timely step forward – one that recognises that modern industries, from advanced manufacturing to defence, clean energy, and high-tech innovation, are only as strong as the minerals and materials on which they depend.

We recognise the growth and investment opportunities that this strategy will unlock, not only for Britain’s critical minerals companies but also for the hundreds of thousands of jobs and sectors that rely on them. If fully supported and delivered with intent, this strategy can secure the UK’s position as a trusted global partner and a leader in the technologies that will define the coming decades.

The Critical Minerals Association stands ready to support its implementation and help ensure its success.

Tom McCulley, CEO of Anglo American’s Crop Nutrients business, said:

Metals and minerals are fundamental to the energy transition, improving living standards, and food security. It is important for the UK to have a clear strategy, both in terms of the supply of critical metals and minerals, as well as the opportunities that the UK’s own resource endowments offer for economic growth.

With London at the centre of global mining finance, the UK has an opportunity to drive investment and growth through partnerships along the value chain and through the emergence of a modern mining industry in the UK itself.

The new strategy will commit up to £50 million to support projects across the country, including by expanding the research and innovation which goes into extracting and refining critical minerals, and helping businesses to commercialise and scale up their projects.

Government has already backed critical minerals businesses across the UK with over £165 million, and together with support from the National Wealth Fund, UK Export Finance and other public finance streams, this fund will drive growth in the sector across the country and help the UK move ahead in the global race to secure supplies of these minerals.

To boost resilience and national security, the Government will look at stockpiling, including through defence procurement, to shore up the UK’s critical minerals supplies for UK defence – in line with their widespread uses in advanced military hardware.

The UK is a member of the NATO Critical Mineral Stockpiling Project which is considering potential options for establishing, procuring and maintaining stockpiles of critical minerals, raw materials, components such as magnets and battery cells and recycled materials.

The Government will also continue to pursue partnerships with resource-rich and like-minded countries around the world to diversify the UK’s supply chains for critical minerals, using Britain’s world-leading credentials in academia, R&D, finance and trade to boost growth opportunities for UK businesses at home and abroad.

The new Strategy will be vital to delivering on the aims of the UK’s modern Industrial Strategy, with all the UK’s leading sectors which the Industrial Strategy backs – from advanced manufacturing to clean energies – dependent on steady supplies of critical minerals, including plane engines and semiconductors.

The benefits will also be reaped across the country, with Scotland placing critical minerals resilience at the forefront of its commitment to meet net zero and create a more circular economy, while Wales has maximised the geology and skills of its workforce to retain nickel and titanium product manufacturing to this day.

And in Northern Ireland, pioneering research from Queens University Belfast and work from firms like Ionic Technologies is finding new ways of recycling permanent magnets, which are used in applications from wind turbines to vehicles.

The UK currently produces 6% of the UK’s critical minerals needs domestically.

Please see below for further reaction from industry welcoming the launch of the strategy:

Ionic Rare Earths Limited Managing Director, Tim Harrison, said:

With the release of the Critical Minerals Strategy, the Government is sending a strong message about the importance of critical minerals to the nation’s growth, prosperity and security.

We welcome the Strategy’s focus on domestic capability and the recognition of Belfast, where Ionic Technologies operates, as part of a critical minerals cluster. Our patented magnet recycling and Rare Earth Element separation technology is increasingly important in protecting UK rare earth supply chain security.

There has never been a more important time for the Government to back businesses that will have an impact on critical minerals supply chains.

Vale Base Metals, Darren Poland, General Manager of UK Operations:

As a vital part of the UK’s midstream through our Clydach Nickel Refinery in Wales, we recognise that critical minerals are the foundation of modern industry and trade.

We welcome the UK’s drive to strengthen its domestic ecosystem and its commitment to partnering with global suppliers to secure critical minerals like nickel for future growth.

Professor Allan Walton, Co-Director of the Birmingham Centre for Strategic Elements and Critical Materials (BCSECM), University of Birmingham and Director of Hypromag Ltd, said:

We are delighted to see that the new Critical Minerals Strategy focusses on midstream processing and the circular economy where the UK has significant strengths particularly in the rare earth value chain.

The University of Birmingham’s Centre for Strategic Elements and Critical Materials and Hypromag Ltd have recently commenced rare earth magnet manufacturing in the UK for the first time in over 25 years from recycled end-of-life products.

This process means it is possible to manufacture new magnets with an extremely low environmental footprint and at lower cost compared to other recycling options.

And environmental justice groups continue to view carbon trading as a way for companies to pay their way out of reducing carbon emissions, and the associated air pollution, at the source.
Forest carbon offsets were front and center in the October exchange that ultimately led to Garoupa’s departure.
The new rules were widely opposed by environmental justice groups, who see the program as driving too much funding to biofuels and hydrogen at the expense of transportation electrification.
That would leave CARB without a formal environmental justice advisory panel meeting during the cap-and-trade rulemaking, which the agency wants to finalize by the spring.","While Governor Gavin Newsom was touting California’s climate leadership last week in Brazil at the U.N.’s annual climate summit, a conflict was brewing back home between environmental justice leaders and the state’s lead air pollution regulator.

The fallout came this Tuesday, when a top advisor to the California Air Resources Board resigned in protest over what she described as “growing hostility” towards the Environmental Justice Advisory Committee, or the EJAC, which provides input to the agency.

Catherine Garoupa, executive director of the Central Valley Air Quality Coalition and one of the two EJAC co-chairs, wrote in her resignation letter that CARB has increasingly dismissed science and shown a bias toward regulated industries “at the expense of low income communities and communities of color.”

The final straw was a tense meeting last month where CARB’s Deputy Executive Officer Rajinder Sahota likened a University of California, Berkeley, researcher’s critiques of the state’s forest carbon offset program to President Donald Trump’s attacks on the endangerment finding that allows the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gases.

“That was really the catalyst, but it’s been coming for a very long time,” said Garoupa, who described Sahota’s comments as a personal attack on the scientist in a letter to CARB leadership following the meeting.

CARB said they brought in the Attorney General’s Office to conduct an independent review and concluded that the agency’s standards of conduct had not been violated. They said they would continue to support the EJAC, whose members will all reach the end of their terms in March.

Garoupa’s resignation points to the long-running disagreement between in-state environmental justice groups and regulators over the fundamental impacts of carbon markets. That argument appears to be growing increasingly intractable just as the agency prepares to update and strengthen its cap-and-trade program, recently renamed cap-and-invest.

The program puts a declining cap on state carbon emissions across sectors and allows companies to buy and trade permits to emit up to the limit. Proceeds from the permit auctions, which have raised about $4 billion annually in recent years, fund climate programs from high-speed rail to wildfire prevention to affordable housing near public transit.

The revenues have made the program increasingly popular among politicians and funding recipients, but groups on both sides of efforts to confront climate change have been skeptical of it.

The oil industry fights efforts to make the program more stringent and costly, but ultimately prefers it to direct regulation. Trump called out the program this year in an executive order that aimed to block state climate policies, but his second administration has yet to make moves to stop it. And environmental justice groups continue to view carbon trading as a way for companies to pay their way out of reducing carbon emissions, and the associated air pollution, at the source.

Studies have shown that cap-and-trade has driven improvements in air quality across the state, but that the benefits are inconsistent across neighborhoods.

“We’ve always said it’s a dangerous approach to climate policies, to leave it to the whims of the market,” said Argüello. “We’ve always said we should focus more on reducing air pollution.”

In recent years, Garoupa said, the EJAC has worked with CARB to encourage more direct pollution reduction under the program in the state’s most polluted neighborhoods. But members feel their proposals to further limit the role of offsets, exclude technology that captures carbon dioxide directly from the air and implement facility-level caps or no-trade zones have fallen on deaf ears.

Forest carbon offsets were front and center in the October exchange that ultimately led to Garoupa’s departure.

Separate from the permits that regulated companies buy and trade to meet the state’s emissions cap, cap-and-invest also allows companies to buy state-sanctioned offset credits from sectors not regulated by the program, such as agriculture and forestry. Businesses currently can use these offsets to meet up to 4 percent of their required emission reductions, a cap that will rise to 6 percent starting in 2026.

Over 70 percent of those offsets come from projects that aim to store more carbon by changing how forests are managed.

On October 16, the EJAC had invited UC Berkeley researcher Barbara Haya to present some of the science on the offset piece of the program. Haya and other researchers have found that CARB is significantly over-crediting carbon reductions from forest projects, mainly by allowing project developers to choose exaggerated baseline emissions. Developers are allowed to base their estimates of how much carbon a project would store on assumptions that, without the offset projects, there would be very large carbon losses from project areas due to timber harvesting. However, researchers have found that these risks are often not as high as stated.

“This program has been heavily studied because it’s so important,” said Haya in an interview. “I don’t know of any studies that find that the program is not over-crediting.”

Towards the end of Haya’s presentation, Rajinder Sahota, who oversees CARB’s climate policy, provided comments to clear up what she described as a “mischaracterization” of the offset program.

“It’s important to have facts on our side as we do this work,” said Sahota. “We’re seeing the federal attacks on climate science and rollbacks on public and environmental protections, and CARB, the state of California, is spending significant resources to defend against those attacks on our programs and policies,” she said, noting CARB’s defense of the EPA’s determination that greenhouse gases harm public health—the Endangerment Finding that Trump is trying to repeal.

“To date, we have been reluctant to use that same critical lens publicly on the continuing attacks against our climate programs from non-federal parties and that needs to change,” she said.

Offsets aren’t counted in the state’s own inventory of climate progress, she said. She went on to cite letters from the agency and a scientist in 2019 rebutting one of Haya’s past analyses, and characterized Haya as someone with a bias against CARB, saying that she provided unpaid support to a lawsuit environmental groups filed against the program in 2012. (The news outlet ProPublica reported in 2021 that she spoke with the plaintiff’s attorneys but was not a part of the case).

After the October meeting, a group of carbon market researchers wrote a letter of support for Haya, backing her presentation and expressing concerns about Sahota’s dismissal of the peer-reviewed literature as an “attack against [the Board’s] climate programs.” Garoupa also said that CARB’s carbon market staff have turned down numerous requests to speak at EJAC meetings, but did not provide advance notice of Sahota’s plans to attend and make comments, leaving them feeling blindsided by the deputy executive officer’s criticisms.

“It shows that they don’t respect our processes and aren’t actually engaging with us in an authentic way,” said Garoupa.

CARB said that they’re currently developing a plan to bring researchers together ahead of an upcoming review of the offset program. When it reauthorized cap-and-invest this past session, the California legislature directed CARB to produce a study by the end of next year looking at the impacts of state offset projects and potential changes. They also have to update their protocols for assessing and crediting offsets by 2029 to align them with the best available science.

“It is clear the offsets program is an area of robust academic debate and we are committed to a process that considers all perspectives,” said Buckley, the CARB spokesperson, in a statement. “This is an important issue globally and it’s essential to have open and transparent dialogue about how to translate academic findings into actionable, cost-effective policy.”

Katelyn Roedner Sutter, the California director at the Environmental Defense Fund who also sits on the state’s Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, said that “offsets play an important and appropriately limited role within the cap-and-invest program,” spreading climate finance into sectors not covered by the cap like forestry and to tribes like the Yurok who have used the money to buy back their ancestral lands. Offsets have historically been a way to make cap-and-trade compliance more affordable for companies, although she said that’s changing since a 2021 rule change requires more offsets to be located in the state, where projects are costlier.

“I think a part of the challenge here is that the forestry protocol is a decade old,” said Roedner Sutter, of the debate over offsets’ effectiveness for addressing climate change. “We have been among the many asking CARB for years to update their offset protocols, especially their forestry protocol and I am excited that SB 840 is going to make that happen and then make sure they’re updated on a regular basis.”

Haya said Sahota’s comments made her worried about the upcoming reviews. “Instead of addressing the scientific findings about the poor outcomes of their program, she attacked the scientist,” said Haya. “It makes me really concerned that CARB is not going to take the science seriously in revising their protocols.”

The dust-up comes a year after CARB approved updates to the low-carbon fuel standard, its emissions trading program for transportation fuels. The new rules were widely opposed by environmental justice groups, who see the program as driving too much funding to biofuels and hydrogen at the expense of transportation electrification. On cap-and-trade, environmental groups lobbied the legislature to remove the free allowances the program gives to the oil and gas sector when they reauthorized the program this year, and lawmakers ultimately gave CARB the authority to decide whether to do that.

Argüello said that the EJAC and CARB have a better working relationship on topics such as building decarbonization. Facing pressure from environmental justice groups, the state has also taken steps to better incorporate EJ perspectives in CARB’s processes, from establishing two environmental justice board seats in 2016 to, in 2021, changing the EJAC from a temporary body supporting the state’s 5-year climate plan updates into a standing committee.

Yet the groups remain at an impasse over carbon markets.

“On the LCFS, on cap-and-trade, we’ve had a harder time being heard and listened to,” said Argüello. “We’ve consistently had a position that has been resisted by CARB.”

In September, the agency told EJAC that October would be the group’s last formal public meeting before the new EJAC members took over next year. CARB said they plan to issue the solicitation for new members “early next year.” They told the EJAC co-chairs that new appointments would be in place by the fall of 2026, according to Garoupa’s resignation letter.

That would leave CARB without a formal environmental justice advisory panel meeting during the cap-and-trade rulemaking, which the agency wants to finalize by the spring.

Argüello said she was holding out hope for a smoother transition. She and Garoupa wrote to CARB’s new chair, Lauren Sanchez, last month, asking that the new appointments be finalized by March and the current members be allowed to keep meeting as a full committee until then.

“I’m an eternal optimist,” said Argüello. “I want to hold hope that the new board chair will continue the commitments to the environmental justice community and to the EJAC to make it a place where we can support and even push CARB, when it needs it, into that leadership position.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2187949091-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 19:00:09.178432

The Mousam River Solar Project is one of the largest solar installations in southern Maine. It spans several privately owned parcels and is expected to provide long-term commercial tax revenue for the city, while supporting the state’s broader transition to renewable energy.

“Today’s ribbon cutting at Mousam River Solar is an outstanding achievement for Sanford and for Maine,” said Dan Burgess, acting commissioner of the Maine Department of Energy Resources. “I congratulate the local community and Walden Renewables on completing this project, which will generate affordable, reliable power here in Maine, create jobs and economic investment in the region, and provide long-term benefits for the community.""

City leaders say the project reflects Sanford’s commitment to sustainable development and economic growth. With construction now complete, the facility is poised to begin delivering clean energy to the region.

“Projects like this don’t just generate clean energy — they generate real economic value for Sanford,” said Deputy Mayor Maura Herlihy. “…It’s exactly the kind of investment that supports sustainable growth for our community.”

Cait Grant, vice president of York County Community College, also highlighted the project’s workforce implications.

“As renewable energy projects come online across the state, the need for well-trained technicians, electricians, and project specialists will only continue to grow,” she said. “We’re proud to help build that next generation of skilled professionals.”

Sanford now ranks among the top communities in Maine for solar capacity, with approximately 90 megawatts installed — second only to Farmington. Officials say that momentum is no accident, pointing to strong local support, access to transmission infrastructure, and a clear vision for clean-energy investment.","https://www.seacoastonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/21/NPOH/87388529007-sanfordsolar.jpeg?crop=5711,3213,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-22 18:00:01.630986

WASHINGTON – On Nov. 20, Indiana 2nd District U.S. Rep. Rudy Yakym, a Republican, and Democratic U.S. Rep. Jimmy Panetta, of California’s 19th District, saw their bipartisan bill, the “Studying NEPA’s Impact on Projects Act” (H.R. 573), advance through the Natural Resources Committee under unanimous consent.

The legislation is intended to inform policymakers about the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) by requiring the Council on Environmental Quality to publish an annual report on NEPA projects and outcomes, with the goal of ensuring greater transparency.

“The Studying NEPA’s Impact on Projects Act is a common-sense step to bring needed transparency to a process that has too often stalled infrastructure, housing and energy projects,” Yakym said. “By restoring these reports, and with the bipartisan work of Rep. Jimmy Panetta, we can better understand NEPA’s impact on jobs and investment and ensure recent reforms are truly working for the American people.”

“The federal permitting process for new infrastructure, housing, and energy projects can be unnecessarily long and confusing,” Panetta said. “This legislation takes a practical approach by requiring yearly assessments by the Council on Environmental Quality on the permitting process’ efficiency and effectiveness. It’s encouraging to see bipartisan interest in making it easier to advance the development of affordable housing, clean energy projects, and our nation’s infrastructure.”

“H.R. 573, the Studying NEPA’s Impact on Projects Act, will give policymakers the critical information needed to make the permitting process more efficient and accountable, by reducing burdensome delays,” Rep. Bruce Westerman, chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, said. “I applaud Rep.

“The Oneka solution saves 1 ton of CO₂ emissions per year for each cubic meter of fresh water produced daily, compared with diesel-powered desalination plants,” Oneka staff said.
Fort Bragg city officials hope the system will provide a reliable source of freshwater during drought years.
Before a guided tour of the buoy, Oneka CEO and Co-Founder Dragan Tutic explained the scope of the project.
Freshwater will be piped to shore through a 3-inch line, and officials will monitor water quality and system performance,” he said.","OCEAN WAVES COULD SOON help solve Fort Bragg’s drought worries. Last week, the city and Quebec, Canada-based Oneka Technologies displayed California’s first wave-powered desalination pilot buoy.

The Noyo Harbor-based buoy, part of the ResilienSea Project, is a partnership with the city and supported by a $1.5 million grant from the state of California. The community is already benefiting from the project, with local labor, fishing boats and divers involved in support operations.

Oneka staff gave a walk-through tour of the “Iceberg-class buoy,” explaining how it converts seawater into freshwater. The unit to be deployed off Noyo Harbor is the ninth generation of wave-powered desalination systems developed over 10 years of ocean testing by Oneka. Its half-mile offshore site was carefully chosen to balance pumping efficiency, available wave energy, water depth for brine dispersion and visual impacts.

The system requires no batteries, grid connections or fossil fuels. And the results of this pilot project will determine whether a larger array of wave-powered units could eventually supplement Fort Bragg’s municipal water supply.

“The Oneka solution saves 1 ton of CO₂ emissions per year for each cubic meter of fresh water produced daily, compared with diesel-powered desalination plants,” Oneka staff said. “This means that in the pilot project, 50 tons of CO₂ emissions would be saved.”

City leaders and state officials in attendance called the project a model for climate adaptation, demonstrating how science and innovation can address water scarcity while protecting the ocean environment.

Fort Bragg city officials hope the system will provide a reliable source of freshwater during drought years.

Fort Bragg Public Works Director John Smith told the gathering, “Obviously, we are here for water. It has been a challenge for us in the 1970s. [Then] 2014 was the first wake-up call for us, pretty much we had no water in the river and only one reservoir. 2021 was also a bad year for us, extreme drought, and if you were living in town, you knew what the consequences of that were.”

The project also advances Fort Bragg’s “blue economy” initiative, promoting renewable energy, marine-tech jobs, ecosystem protection, and shoreline resilience — goals the city has prioritized.

Sarah McCormick, the city’s economic development manager, explained how the 2022 Blue Economy Symposium and Learning Festival sparked the wave-powered desalination project.

“We brought the community together to look at how we could work regionally to position our coastline for investment in emerging fields around the blue economy. Oneka found us through that effort,” McCormick said “We’re really proud that we could partner with them to try out this science. It’s not every community that’s willing to let science drive the decision-making.” She said the next year would involve monitoring and analyzing data to determine the buoy’s feasibility as a long-term solution to Fort Bragg’s water woes.

Since its founding in 2015, Oneka has deployed similar buoys in Florida, Nova Scotia and Chile to help communities address water shortages.

Before a guided tour of the buoy, Oneka CEO and Co-Founder Dragan Tutic explained the scope of the project.

“The Iceberg-class buoy is expected to produce roughly 13,200 gallons of freshwater per day during a 12-month trial. Freshwater will be piped to shore through a 3-inch line, and officials will monitor water quality and system performance,” he said.

“The project delivers a reliable supply of fresh water using clean, zero-emission energy, protects the environment by avoiding lead and employing a low-concentration, chemical-free design safe for marine life.” He explained that 60 sensors, including cameras, monitor the buoy’s performance and environmental impact.

The system uses a 60-micron mesh to filter out incoming debris. “To put it in perspective, 60 microns — or 0.06 millimeters — is even smaller than the mesh typically used for capturing fish larvae,” he said.

“Oneka’s freshwater technology does not require obtaining land-based operations,” Tutic said. “The unit that you see today is the same as the unit that was installed in Nova Scotia last fall, and it withstood waves converging at 20 feet on average and at extremes of 30 feet.”

Tutic then turned to a clear cube-like apparatus set up near the buoy to demonstrate how the seawater was processed.“The system has three main components: one handles the seawater intake, from there, it moves through pre-filters to remove impurities, and finally passes through the membranes for purification.”

The membranes separate freshwater from the seawater. Water with excess salt, or brine, is released back into the ocean while the freshwater is collected for use.

The Mendocino Voice interviewed officials and Oneka staff about the project’s goals and expected impact on the community.

Mary Rose Kaczorowski: How is the project financed and what are the next steps?

Fort Bragg City Manager Isaac Whippy: We got [$1,490,000] from the California State Department of Water Resources to fund this project. Next spring if all the permits go well, we will start to install the buoy moorings. We’re looking at next summer for the entire system to go live and be deployed for a 12-month trial period.

We will be using that data, and part of our plan for the next five years is to see if this could supplement our current water supply. The trial period is primarily about learning, gathering data, and studying the science.

We have a lot of whale migrations and many species of fish passing through this area, and there have been strandings. How can you prevent entanglements, especially of larger marine mammals?

Oneka Technologies CEO and Co-Founder Dragan Tutic: There are two aspects to consider regarding entanglement risks, and both are addressed as part of the permitting process. First, the design of the system itself minimizes the risk of physical entanglement: all ropes are properly secured and capped, and heavy chains are used, making first-degree entanglements extremely unlikely.

Second, for indirect risks—such as fishnets or debris getting caught—we have monitoring and mitigation processes in place to ensure that nothing in the system poses a threat to marine life. To provide some context, similar systems have been installed in Florida, Chile, and Nova Scotia, and there have been no recorded entanglements of marine animals.

Who will monitor operations? Who will facilitate rapid response to the Iceberg if needed?

Oneka Technologies Quality-Assurance Engineer Emily Veinot: “We’re now locally based so we can manage the installation, day-to-day operations and handle community relations, and work with local suppliers and laborers. If any issue comes up, once the buoy is positioned, we can quickly reach the buoy and address the situation.”

How would you describe the importance of this project?

California 2nd District Assemblymember Chris Rogers, D-Santa Rosa: This project is a great example of advancing innovative solutions to address climate change while mitigating impacts already being felt. Fort Bragg has been ground zero for drought in the past, creating challenges for both the local economy and residents. There has been a significant energy cost — and a major cost to marine life — associated with previous solutions, often pitting people against fish and against the climate. What’s different here is that this project has been designed to truly strike a balance between human needs and the needs of the ocean.

This project is exactly the kind of model we wanted to highlight here in California — another first for this coast, alongside innovative research at the Noyo Center for Marine Sciences.

Necessity is often the mother of invention, and here on the Mendocino Coast, challenges like drought and sea urchin overpopulation have spurred new businesses and ideas. Projects like this serve as a test bed for innovations that could expand along the California coast.

What brought you here to see this project in person?

California 12th District Assemblymember Damon Connolly, D-San Rafael: I represent Assembly District 12, which is southern Sonoma County and Marin County to the south of Roger’s district. A lot of the work I do in the Assembly centers on climate policy and the environment. There’s also Proposition 4, the climate bond, which is opening up an entirely new world of funding opportunities, including support for technology and breakthrough ideas that can help us confront the climate crisis. I was one of the principal authors of the climate bond that authorized $10 billion for safe drinking water, wildfire prevention, drought preparedness and clean air. That measure was approved by voters in the November 2024 election.

How do you think the California Assembly and Senate members are dealing with federal pushback?

Connolly: It’s a number of different strategies. We are pushing hard against the feds on the legal front. State Attorney General Rob Bonta; he’s now filed about 46 lawsuits as of last week. Our residents are not receiving the benefits of taxpayer money that they’re paying out to D.C., and it’s being improperly and illegally withheld, and we want to get that back for wildfire prevention, for climate, for healthcare. We are also trying to fill gaps—as federal money is withheld on these priorities, we’re looking at things like the climate bond to fill important policy gaps.

An enthusiastic reception

More than 50 people attended the event, and enthusiasm steadily grew throughout the day. The final highlight was the chance to applaud the Oneka team gathered in front of the buoy for a photo op. For some, it was their first time on the Northern California coast, and residents gave them a memorable welcome.

There was one more special touch. Once the buoy was completed, all who worked on it gathered to sign its hull with messages in French and English — from “bon voyage” to “bonne chère.”",https://i0.wp.com/localnewsmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/BCN-20251114-DESALINATION-01-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-22 21:58:23.613901

But it seems some of them haven’t entered the modern era when it comes to their parking—or in this case, charging—situation.

Despite the rise of electric vehicles, many hotels have yet to add charging stations to their parking lots. One man is saying that this is not only a missed opportunity, but just plain bad customer service.

Where Do Hotel Goers Charge Their Cars?

In a TikTok video, Anup Parikh (@pangeacharging), owner and founder of electric vehicle charging infrastructure company Pangea Charging, calls out hotels for not offering something that, at this point, he thinks should be standard.

""What do these three hotels around me have in common? None of them offer electric vehicle charging stations on site,"" he says while filming in a parking lot near several hotels.

Parikh explains that it’s F1 weekend in Austin, Texas, which means an influx of out-of-towners staying at hotels and renting cars.

""There are a bunch of people being sent out in electric vehicle rental cars from the rental agencies showing up to hotels that don't have chargers,"" Parikh notes.

Our team of experts tracks what owners are saying about car-shopping, repairs, the daily driving experience and more on social media.

Parikh spoke to three hotel owners or operators about what they do when a guest needs to charge their car since they don’t have chargers in their parking lots. It turns out they’re sending guests to a grocery store about two miles away that has electric vehicle fast-charging stations.

""Now it always makes me wonder why hotels don't send folks away to Denny's for the continental breakfast, to Planet Fitness for the gym, or a local laundromat for laundry,"" he says.

""They provide it on-site, and that's the same value hotel should be offering for loyalty, convenience, and really just to drive more revenue.""

He adds that Austin is an especially popular city for year-round events, such as Austin City Limits, and for students and parents visiting local colleges.

""So if you wanna make more money and book more room nights at your hotel to this growing population of EVs, contact Pangea Charging will help you get set up with EV chargers and make the process seamless and simple,"" he concluded, plugging his business.

In the caption, he adds the following: ""Hotels could have booked more rooms and earned more revenue if they offered this crucial amenity.""

How to Find Hotels With EV Charging

For EV drivers, finding a hotel with charging stations can make or break a road trip. NerdWallet points out that while thousands of hotels now offer EV chargers, not all booking platforms make them easy to find.

Your best bet? PlugShare is still the gold standard for locating hotel-based chargers—you can search by hotel name or location and filter for ""lodging"" under amenities.

Major booking sites, such as Booking.com, Expedia, and Hotels.com, now offer ""electric vehicle charging station"" filters, although the listings can be outdated. Always confirm directly with the hotel about whether chargers are free, guest-only, or limited to specific hours. And here's something to keep in mind: most hotel stations are Level 2 chargers, which provide 10 to 20 miles of range per hour. If you're rolling in late with a low battery, plan accordingly.

The major hotel chains are also getting on board. More than 1,400 Hilton hotels in the US offer EV charging (though it's not necessarily free). Hyatt, IHG, and Marriott all have EV charging filters on their websites and apps. Many travelers agree that Omni Hotels is actually one of the best options—many locations offer complimentary EV charging included with standard parking.

Tips to consider:

Don't assume that all chargers are compatible with your car. Tesla Destination Chargers won't help you if you're driving a Ford, and not every plug fits every vehicle. Call ahead to confirm compatibility.

Understand the rules before you arrive. Some hotels let anyone use chargers on a first-come basis, others make you reserve a spot, and some have valets who'll move your car once it's done charging.

Parking fees make more sense when charging is included. Dropping $40-50 on parking stings less when you're getting free electricity that would've cost you $15-30 at a public fast charger.

Why Hotels Need to Offer EV Charging

Here's the thing—only 26.6% of hotels have installed EV charging stations, according to a study by Responsible Stay.

TownePark explains that EV sales have been skyrocketing, with about 1.2 million EVs sold in the US in 2023. By 2030, EVs could account for around 65% of new car sales in major markets.

For hotels, this isn't just about keeping up; it's about not losing business. EV owners plan their trips around charging availability, and they'll pick hotels that have chargers over ones that don't.

Additionally, there's the sustainability aspect to consider. Having EV chargers boosts green certifications, improves ratings on sustainability-focused platforms, and attracts corporate clients with strict environmental policies.

But it's not just about attracting guests. There's actual money to be made. While guests wait for their cars to charge, they're more likely to visit the hotel's restaurant, bar, or spa, which generates more ancillary revenue. Plus, EV owners typically earn over $100,000 per year, making them a highly sought-after demographic willing to pay premium prices.

The financial incentives are there, too. The Inflation Reduction Act offers tax credits for up to 30% of equipment and installation costs, with a max of $100,000 per charger. Some states, such as California, even mandate the installation of EV charging infrastructure in new hotels and motels. Hotels that don't adapt risk falling behind as this becomes standard, not a luxury.

People who commented on Parikh’s post were torn. Some feel that the inconvenience is a reason to eschew EVs. Others agree with the creator that hotels should add chargers if they can.

""Reason number 17282727 not to buy an electric car,"" wrote one.

""Fr even with a few basic level 2s would be great,"" said another.

""Find your own charger. Hotels also don’t provide gas. Fuel is your responsibility,"" a third griped

""Then it has to be hotel guests only for the code, or else other EV owners will tie it up,"" another added.

The approved deal established 59 indicators for the world to judge how nations are adapting to climate change.
“A climate decision that cannot even say ‘fossil fuels’ is not neutrality, it is complicity.","BELEM, Brazil (AP) — United Nations climate talks in Brazil reached a subdued agreement Saturday that pledged more funding for countries to adapt to the wrath of extreme weather. But the catch-all agreement doesn’t include explicit details to phase out fossil fuels or strengthen countries' inadequate emissions cutting plans, which dozens of nations demanded.

The Brazilian hosts of the conference said they’d eventually come up with a road map to get away from fossil fuels working with hard-line Colombia, but it won’t have the same force as something approved at the conference called COP30. Colombia responded angrily to the deal after it was approved, citing the absence of wording on fossil fuels.

The deal, which was approved after negotiators blew past a Friday deadline, was crafted after hours of late night and early morning meetings. After the deal was approved, COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago said the tough discussions started in Belem will continue under Brazil’s leadership until the next annual conference “even if they are not reflected in this text we just approved.”

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the deal shows ""that nations can still come together to confront the defining challenges no country can solve alone.” But he added: “I cannot pretend that COP30 has delivered everything that is needed. The gap between where we are and what science demands remains dangerously wide.”

Deal gets mix of lukewarm praise and complaints

Many gave the deal lukewarm praise as the best that could be achieved in trying times, while others complained about the package or the process that led to its approval.

“Given the circumstances of geopolitics today, we’re actually quite pleased with the bounds of the package that came out,"" said Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chaired the coalition of small island nations. “The alternative is that we don’t get a decision and that would have been a worse alternative.”

“This deal isn’t perfect and is far from what science requires,” said former Ireland President Mary Robinson, a fierce climate advocate for the ex-leaders group The Elders. “But at a time when multilateralism is being tested, it is significant that countries continue to move forward together.”

Absent from the talks was the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

“This year there has been a lot of attention on one country stepping back,” U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell said, referring to the United States’ withdrawal from the landmark 2015 Paris agreement. “But amid the gale-force political headwinds, 194 countries stood firm in solidarity — rock-solid in support of climate cooperation.”

Some countries said they got enough out of the deal.

“COP30 has not delivered everything Africa asked for, but it has moved the needle,” said Jiwoh Abdulai, Sierra Leone’s environment minister. What really matters, he said, is “how quickly these words turn into real projects that protect lives and livelihoods.”

U.K. Energy Minister Ed Miliband said the agreement was “an important step forward,” but that he would have preferred it to be “more ambitious.” He added: “These are difficult, strenuous, tiring, frustrating negotiations.”

Swift final push prompts complaints

The deal was approved minutes into a plenary meeting open Saturday to all nations that were present.

After the main package was approved — to applause by many delegates — angry nations took the floor to complain about other parts of the package and about being ignored as do Lago moved quickly toward approval. The objections were so strong that do Lago temporarily halted the session to try to calm things down.

Colombia’s Daniela Duran Gonzalez blasted the conference’s president for ignoring her, saying: “The COP of the truth cannot support an outcome that ignores science.”

An area that usually gets less attention became a big point of contention. The approved deal established 59 indicators for the world to judge how nations are adapting to climate change. Before the Belem conference, experts crafted 100 precisely worded indicators, but negotiators changed the wording and cut the total.

The European Union, several Latin American countries and Canada said they had severe problems with it, calling it unclear and unworkable. They complained that they tried to object but were ignored.

Do Lago apologized.

How major issues were handled

A handful of major issues dominated the talk. Those included coming up with a road map to wean the world from fossil fuels, telling countries that their national plans to curb emissions were inadequate, tripling financial aid for developing nations to adapt to extreme weather and reducing climate restrictions on trade.

“COP30 gave us some baby steps in the right direction, but considering the scale of the climate crisis, it has failed to rise to the occasion,” said Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa.

Critics complained there was not much to the deal.

""Strip away the outcome text and you see it plainly: The emperor has no clothes,"" said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, now at Greenpeace International.

Panama negotiator Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez railed against the deal.

“A climate decision that cannot even say ‘fossil fuels’ is not neutrality, it is complicity. And what is happening here transcends incompetence,” Monterrey Gomez said. “Science has been deleted from COP30 because it offends the polluters.”

Many nations and advocates wanted something stronger because the world will not come close to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid 1800s, which was the goal the 2015 Paris agreement set.

The financial aid for adapting to climate change was tripled to a goal of $120 billion a year, but the goal was pushed back five years. It was one of several tough issues to dominate the late stage of talks. Vulnerable nations have pressed the wealthier countries most responsible for climate change to help out with money to rebuild from damaging extreme weather and to adapt to more of it in the future.

Pushing back the goal leaves “vulnerable countries without support to match the escalating needs,” Adow said.

After the main deal was approved, tempers flared as the open meeting stretched on. Russia’s ambassador at large, Sergei Kononuchenko, lectured Latin American delegates who were objecting frequently that they were “behaving like children who want to get your hands on all the sweets, and aren’t prepared to share them with everyone.”

An angry Eliana Ester Saissac of Argentina said Latin Americans “are in no way behaving like spoiled children who want to stuff our mouths full of sweets” to a roar of cheers and applause.

The SMR project marks a major shift in the U.K.’s approach to nuclear energy, as it develops the first two major conventional nuclear plants in several decades and invests in new nuclear technologies.
In November, the government announced plans to develop a first-of-its-kind nuclear power station on the Welsh island of Anglesey.
Meanwhile, the U.K. energy minister, Ed Miliband, said that Britain is in the race for new reactors.
While the new project offers high hopes for the development of the U.K.’s nuclear energy industry, U.S. President Trump is less than happy with Prime Minister Starmer’s selection of Rolls-Royce for the job.","After selecting Rolls-Royce as the United Kingdom’s preferred bidder to build the country’s first small modular reactors (SMRs), the government has confirmed the start of project development in Wales. The development of SMR technology is expected to help the U.K. expand its nuclear power capacity, as well as become a competitive SMR power. However, the United States Trump administration, which recently signed an agreement with the U.K. for SMR development, does not support the choice of a British company for the development of the technology.

In June, the U.K. government announced that Rolls-Royce SMR had been selected as the preferred bidder to partner with Great British Energy – Nuclear (GBE-N) to develop SMRs, subject to final government approvals and contract signature. The government pledged almost $3.3 billion for the SMR programme, expecting to support the creation of 3,000 new skilled jobs and power the equivalent of roughly 3 million homes with clean, domestic energy.

The SMR project marks a major shift in the U.K.’s approach to nuclear energy, as it develops the first two major conventional nuclear plants in several decades and invests in new nuclear technologies. SMRs are smaller and faster to build than conventional nuclear reactors, and their modular nature means that more capacity can be added as required.

In November, the government announced plans to develop a first-of-its-kind nuclear power station on the Welsh island of Anglesey. The plant at Wylfa will be home to three SMRs, although it will have space for up to eight, with works expected to commence in 2026 and first power generation in the mid-2030s.

The existing nuclear plant at Wylfa was powered down in 2015, and previous plans for a large-scale replacement were scrapped in 2021. The new project is expected to bring a much-needed boost to Anglesey’s economy, as well as provide jobs for several decades. Prime Minister Kier Starmer said, “Britain was once a world leader in nuclear power, but years of neglect and inertia have meant places like Anglesey have been let down and left behind. Today, that changes.""

The First Minister of Wales, Eluned Morgan, supports the project and has been “pressing the case at every opportunity for Wylfa's incredible benefits”. Meanwhile, the U.K. energy minister, Ed Miliband, said that Britain is in the race for new reactors. Miliband said in a radio interview that the aim is to “work with local colleges to make sure that there are local skills providers, skills training opportunities, so local people get these jobs”.

The SMRs will be built in a modular format in factories before being shipped to site to be assembled. However, several challenges remain, including getting regulatory approval, building the SMR factories, and training the workforce to operate the sites. Rolls-Royce will build on its experience developing reactors for Britain’s nuclear submarines to develop the SMRs. Since promoting its SMR business, the British firm has attracted several investors, including the UAE’s sovereign wealth fund – the Qatar Investment Authority, the American utility Constellation, and CEZ, the Czech Republic’s power company.

While the new project offers high hopes for the development of the U.K.’s nuclear energy industry, U.S. President Trump is less than happy with Prime Minister Starmer’s selection of Rolls-Royce for the job. The U.S. was reportedly hoping that the U.K. government would choose American Westinghouse Electric Company to develop a conventional nuclear plant at Wylfa.

Before the Anglesey project was announced, the U.S. ambassador Warren Stephens published a statement saying that Britain should choose “a different path” in Wales. “We are extremely disappointed by this decision, not least because there are cheaper, faster and already-approved options to provide clean, safe energy at this same location,” Stephens stated. The ambassador’s response follows the signing of a nuclear partnership between the U.K. and the U.S. in September, with a potential value of $100 billion.

However, a source close to the U.K. government said, “This is the right choice for Britain. This is our flagship SMR programme, producing homegrown clean power with a British company, and we have chosen the best site for it.”

Nevertheless, the U.K. government said that developing SMRs at Wylfa “doesn’t close the door"" to a U.S. manufacturer working on a future project. GBE-N is also assessing different sites in the U.K. for the potential development of another large-scale nuclear power plant, like Hinkley Point in Somerset and Sizewell C in Suffolk, which are currently being developed and are expected to power around six million homes once complete.

Despite the agreement for greater cooperation between the U.K. and the U.S. on nuclear power, the U.K. government has chosen a British company to develop its first SMR project, showing its support for the development of domestic nuclear technologies. The project is expected to make the U.K. highly competitive in the field of SMR reactor development over the coming decade, as well as diversify the country’s nuclear power industry.

It's time to change that. - The Hill,"Kevin Schrum, opinion contributor, Kevin Schrum, opinion contributor",,,,,https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/5617584-guardrail-standards-electric-vehicles/,"Electric vehicles weigh more than traditional vehicles, often by 1,000 pounds or more, thanks to their batteries and reinforced structures.
Given the growing number of electric vehicles on our roads, infrastructure and the modernization of the nation’s roadway safety systems must advance simultaneously.
Immediate action is needed to reinforce highway safety systems across the country’s highways, where millions of Americans travel every day.
As previously noted, electric vehicles are significantly heavier than traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines.
Electric vehicles are here to stay, and roadway safety cannot be an afterthought.","When a 7,000-pound electric pickup truck tore through a guardrail at highway speed during a crash test, it confirmed what many safety experts fear: The protective systems lining America’s roads are not ready for the next generation of vehicles.

Electric vehicles weigh more than traditional vehicles, often by 1,000 pounds or more, thanks to their batteries and reinforced structures. Recent testing and on-road crashes have underscored the danger, with electric cars and trucks overwhelming highway barriers designed for lighter vehicles.

Although the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act’s Highway Safety Improvement Program is funding roadway upgrades through 2026, a critical safety issue is being overlooked.

Modernizing the nation’s guardrail systems has slipped behind the push to build a nationwide network of vehicle charging stations. Guidance on the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program was finalized just this past August. U.S. electric vehicle sales reached record levels in the third quarter of 2025, partly due to the expiring $7,500 federal tax credit, with overall sales reaching a 9.1 percent market share in July, and 11.7 percent in the third quarter. Continued strong growth is predicted, driven by falling battery costs and more affordable models coming to market.

Given the growing number of electric vehicles on our roads, infrastructure and the modernization of the nation’s roadway safety systems must advance simultaneously.

Electric vehicles are literally changing the physics of roadway safety. Their added weight accelerates damage to roadway pavement, increasing the risk of accidents.

And, when crashes occur, that same weight can turn a collision with a guardrail into catastrophic failure. Immediate action is needed to reinforce highway safety systems across the country’s highways, where millions of Americans travel every day.

Consider some of the dangers presented. As previously noted, electric vehicles are significantly heavier than traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines. The GMC Hummer electric SUV tops the charts weighing in at over 9,000 pounds. That extra weight increases the stress on pavement and, critically, poses new risks when vehicles collide with guardrails — the absolute last line of defense keeping cars from leaving the roadway.

Guardrails are designed to absorb and redirect the force of a crash, but many of the hundreds of thousands installed nationwide are outdated or improperly installed. In the most catastrophic failures, defective guardrails have pierced vehicles rather than protect them.

The risk escalates with Electric vehicles. Their added weight, lower center of gravity and softer structure in the front, combined with higher highway speeds, means today’s guardrails are often no match.

In fact, the first-of-their-kind crash tests at Texas A&M and the University of Nebraska over the last two years revealed that standard guardrail designs fail under electric vehicle impacts. A Tesla Model 3 and Rivian R1T both tore through guardrails during controlled tests, demonstrating the critical need for new engineering standards.

Sadly, these warnings are no longer confined to laboratories. As it stands, thousands of Americans die each year in car accidents where guardrails and other highway infrastructure fails. In recent years, electric vehicles have overwhelmed roadside protections. Each crash underscores the fact that today’s infrastructure is not designed for tomorrow’s vehicles.

An update to guardrail standards is long overdue. Many roadside safety features continue to be tested at speeds pegged at 60 to 62 mph, whereas highway speeds have climbed past 80 mph in many states. When you factor in the weight of an electric vehicle and its lower center of gravity, the deadly mismatch becomes obvious.

Additionally, it has been nearly 10 years since the Government Accountability Office reported any flaws in the Federal Highway Administration’s guardrail testing program. To close this safety gap, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy should prioritize guardrail safety across the country.

There are four specific things to be done:

The Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration, which sets federal guardrail standards for state Departments of Transportation, should update guardrail design and testing standards to reflect electric vehicle weight and current speed trends.

In partnership with state Departments of Transportation, the U.S. Department of Transportation should prioritize the replacement of outdated guardrails nationwide.

The Federal Highway Safety Administration should encourage collaboration between the makers of both EVs and traditional vehicles and highway safety engineers to develop roadway safety solutions that anticipate the realities of future vehicles for decades to come.

America is at a crossroads. Electric vehicles are here to stay, and roadway safety cannot be an afterthought. Real progress requires broad national investment. That kind of commitment ensures that all Americans in every type of vehicle are protected when traveling our nation’s roadways.

The final text did add a reference to the “UAE consensus”, the overall package from Cop28 in Dubai in 2023 that contained the first pledge to move away from fossil fuels.

Rainforest conference fails to create deforestation roadmap … Cop30 was deliberately sited in the Amazon to put focus on the vital role in climate of forests.
But it was killed after being tied to the fossil fuels roadmap.","1. Multilateralism survived … just

The negotiations between more than 190 countries came close to collapse, as ambitious countries and petrostates threatened to block any deal or walk out. But global heating requires a global response and in today’s fractured geopolitical climate sealing a deal backed by all countries keeps the UN climate show on the road.

“At a time of great political challenge, 194 countries have come together within the Paris agreement to recommit to acting on the climate crisis,” said the UK energy secretary, Ed Miliband. “This agreement does not have all the ambition we would have wanted but it commits to keeping 1.5C alive.”

The US did not send a delegation – Donald Trump has dismissed the climate crisis as a “con job”. Some at Cop30 in Belém said the US stance had emboldened Saudi Arabia and other petrostates to fight even harder to block progress.

2. Adaptation funding tripled – but critics say it isn’t enough

The nations at Cop30 agreed to triple funding for adaptation – money provided by rich countries and desperately needed by vulnerable countries to protect their people from the accelerating impacts of the climate crisis. It is a significant advance but the goal of $120bn (£92bn) a year was pushed back five years from the initial suggested date of 2030.

Many countries and observers reacted angrily. “The outcome on adaptation is an insult to every community currently underwater or on fire,” said Harjeet Singh at the Satat Sampada Climate Foundation. “The refusal to commit to scaling up finance to the necessary $300bn annually for adaptation leaves the unprepared defenceless against inevitable ruin. The timeline ignores the urgency of the climate disasters striking us today.”

3. Plan for a just transition welcomed

A major outcome was the agreement of a just transition mechanism (JTM), a plan to ensure that the move to a green economy around the world takes place fairly and protects the rights of all people, including workers, women and Indigenous people.

Climate Action Network International, a huge coalition of campaign groups, welcomed the JTM as one of the strongest rights-based outcomes in the history of the UN climate negotiations.

“The adoption of JTM was a win shaped by years of pressure from civil society,” said Tasneem Essop, the executive director of the network. “This outcome didn’t fall from the sky: it was carved out through struggle, persistence and the moral clarity of those living on the frontlines of climate breakdown. Governments must now honour this JTM with real action. Anything less is a betrayal.” Efforts early in the talks to attach funding to the JTM failed.

4. No mention of fossil fuels in final text

Fossil fuels were not mentioned in the key final decision, despite a coalition of 90 developed and developing nations having pushed for a commitment to a roadmap to phase out fossil fuels to be included. Petrostates including Saudi Arabia and its allies fought fiercely to block this and succeeded.

The final text did add a reference to the “UAE consensus”, the overall package from Cop28 in Dubai in 2023 that contained the first pledge to move away from fossil fuels. However, the obliqueness of this reference is a retrograde step according to Dr Joanna Depledge, a Cop expert at the University of Cambridge: “The UAE consensus is [a] broad package including fully eight decisions adopted in Dubai on a whole range of issues. The Dubai fossil fuel transition language is therefore being deliberately diluted and obscured, not highlighted.”

5. Roadmap for transition away from fossil fuels survives – but it is voluntary

The roadmap for the transition away from fossil fuels was blocked from the formal Cop30 decision and the Brazilian presidency announced the plan would proceed outside the UN process. It will be merged with a plan backed by Colombia and about 90 other countries, with a summit set for April. This “coalition of the willing” could push progress forward.

The Cop30 president, André Corrêa do Lago, said the plan to develop the roadmap had the support of President Lula and would involve high-level dialogues over the next year, led by science and involving governments, industry and civil society. Once complete, he said they would report back to Cop.

“Those governments committed to tackling the climate crisis at its source are uniting to move forward outside the UN, under the leadership of Colombia and Pacific Island states, to phase out fossil fuels rapidly, equitably, and in line with 1.5C,” said Nikki Reisch, at the Center for International Environmental Law. “The international conference next April is the first stop on the path to a livable future.”

6. Rainforest conference fails to create deforestation roadmap …

Cop30 was deliberately sited in the Amazon to put focus on the vital role in climate of forests. Brazil’s environment minister, Marina Silva, tried to include a roadmap on ending deforestation in the core agreement at Belém.

But it was killed after being tied to the fossil fuels roadmap. The tying of the two appears to have been either an awful diplomatic blunder or sabotage by the Brazilian foreign ministry, which has long had a focus on selling the country’s oil abroad.

Toerris Jaeger, of Rainforest Foundation Norway, said: “The Amazon insisted on being heard. She forced her way into the climate negotiations with tropical heat, torrential rain, and the largest Indigenous delegation of any previous Cop.

“It is disappointing that countries did not agree to develop concrete plans to halt deforestation.”

7. … but new fund launched to help keep trees standing

Brazil did launch the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, again outside the UN process, but a multibillion-dollar investment fund that will pay nations to keep trees standing.

“The TFFF reflects a growing recognition that climate integrity and forest protection are inseparable,” said Dr Fernando Barrio, at Queen Mary University of London. “Whether it will be effective depends on its design. But the political signal is important because there is no path to 1.5C that does not involve ending deforestation this decade.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/037a5a1f3bc501c6f59891bed429b1289c51258b/112_0_2478_1983/master/2478.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a45e322850ae4ae7484206b3f5519f1c",N,,2025-11-22 19:59:01.301807

According to a fresh assessment by rating agency ICRA, the country’s renewable contribution is likely to exceed 35% by FY2030, marking a major shift in India’s long-term energy trajectory. This projection underscores the nation’s continued push to reduce carbon emissions and strengthen sustainable power infrastructure.

Surge in RE Capacity Additions

ICRA highlights that India has been expanding its renewable capacity at a robust pace. Solar and wind projects remain at the forefront of this growth, supported by competitive tariffs, improved financing conditions, and strong policy backing. Moreover, large-scale tenders issued by central and state agencies have created a substantial project pipeline, ensuring that RE additions will maintain steady momentum through the decade.

The agency also notes that hybrid and round-the-clock renewable projects—combining solar, wind, and energy storage—are helping to address issues of intermittency and grid stability.

Policy Support and Industry Confidence

ICRA’s report emphasises that government initiatives such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for solar manufacturing, revised renewable purchase obligations (RPOs), and accelerated transmission development are further boosting investor confidence. In addition, improved land availability mechanisms and faster approval processes are drawing more private players into the sector.

As per Financial Express, industry experts believe these reforms have positioned India to achieve one of the fastest renewable growth rates globally, even as power demand continues to rise.

Impact on Thermal Generation and Grid Operations

The increasing share of renewable energy will gradually reshape the dynamics of India’s power sector. With RE steadily expanding, the reliance on conventional coal-based generation is expected to moderate. Consequently, thermal plants may see reduced utilisation levels, prompting a shift toward flexible operations and efficiency upgrades.

ICRA also points out that transmission infrastructure and energy storage solutions will remain crucial to managing the growing inflow of variable renewable power. Strengthening inter-regional transmission corridors and scaling battery storage capacity will be essential steps to ensure grid reliability.

Outlook for the Coming Years

However, the accord dodged an explicit mention of the oil, gas and coal responsible for driving the bulk of climate change, and it didn’t detail plans for shifting away from them, leaving some countries unhappy with the outcome.

The eight-page declaration forged at the COP30 summit on the edge of the Amazon rain forest won grudging acceptance. Many nations argued more must be done to counter climate change, while also conceding that an imperfect package was better than none at all.

“With an increasingly fractured geopolitical backdrop, COP30 gave us some baby steps in the right direction,” said Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa advocacy group. “But considering the scale of the climate crisis, it has failed to rise to the occasion.”

Leaders at the summit in Belém, Brazil, had encouraged countries to accept a final deal even if it didn’t have everything they wanted. They insisted it was necessary to show nations were linking arms to fight climate change at a time when other multilateral diplomacy is fraying.

“This deal isn’t perfect and is far from what science requires,” said Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland. “But at a time when multilateralism is being tested, it is significant that countries continue to move forward together.”

The agreement from the COP30 summit responds to a looming gap between what’s necessary to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and what countries are actually doing or committed to pursuing.

Under the decision adopted Saturday, the COP presidency would run a new voluntary initiative meant to “accelerate implementation” of action needed to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels — a key threshold identified in the 2015 Paris Agreement. A separate “Belém Mission to 1.5” is aimed at enabling implementation of national emission-cutting pledges.

A group of about 80 countries and the European Union had pressed for a more explicit road map to guide the transition away from oil, gas and coal toward a cleaner economy but met resistance from key oil and gas producing states from the Middle East as well as Russia.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CNus6CATEliJV5MY9uaWLw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_holding_pen_162/d003a77b6d3064b1fee219b89cff4d46,N,,2025-11-22 22:58:31.348254

From the EPA’s press release:

“The agency’s proposed definition of WOTUS would fully implement the [Supreme] court’s direction [from Sackett v.

My Unlocking Our Domestic LNG Potential Act Passes the U.S. House

I am thrilled that my legislation to slash red tape, streamline American LNG exports, and prevent a future LNG export ban like the one imposed by former President Biden passed through the U.S. House of Representatives this week.

The Unlocking Our Domestic LNG Potential Act depoliticizes the export of American liquefied natural gas (LNG) by eliminating a duplicative requirement for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to authorize its export. This gives the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) sole authority over the approval process, which provides producers certainty, strengthens global security, and lowers costs for domestic consumers.

The passage of my legislation is another major victory in achieving American energy dominance. It’s simple: Exporting American LNG strengthens our economy, stabilizes prices, drives much-needed investment in energy infrastructure, and bolsters the energy security of our global partners.

Countering Foreign Adversarial Influence in America

This week, I introduced a package of bills to counter foreign adversarial influence in America. The package includes three critical, bipartisan, bicameral bills that will prevent senior government officials from ever lobbying on behalf of an adversarial nation such as China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran.

It is the bare minimum expectation that U.S. government employees work for the betterment of America, both during their service and long after it. Yet far too often, we see individuals leave government only to lobby on behalf of foreign adversaries who wish to see America fail. This is a dangerous flaw in the incentive structure for those serving at the highest levels of government, and we must fix it to prevent foreign entities from gaining influence from within.

By permanently banning former senior government officials from lobbying for countries of concern, closing FARA loopholes, and stripping security clearances from any former Department of War (DOW) personnel who lobby for China, these commonsense measures move us one step closer to ensuring that those in Washington are here to serve America, not undermine it.

Honoring Those Who Perished in the July 4th Floods

The tragedy our state endured on July 4th, 2025, was unimaginable, and we must never forget the innocent lives lost. Earlier this year, I joined Congressman Chip Roy (TX-21) in introducing a resolution honoring those who didn’t make it home and recognizing the extraordinary bravery and selflessness of the heroes who stepped up when they were needed most.

While nothing can ever bring loved ones back, we must honor their life and legacy for years to come, and that is precisely what this resolution does. I am thankful that my colleagues in the U.S. House voted to pass it this week, and I will continue to pray for every single person and community that was impacted.

Generative AI Terrorism Act Passes U.S. House

I spent two decades as a fighter pilot, flying combat missions in the Middle East against terrorist organizations. Since then, I have witnessed the terror landscape evolve into a digital battlefield shaped by the rapid rise of artificial intelligence. To confront this emerging threat and stop terrorist organizations from weaponizing AI to recruit, train, and inspire attacks on U.S. soil, I am proud that the House passed my Generative AI Terrorism Risk Assessment Act this week.

While my uniform has changed, my mission to protect the United States from all enemies, foreign and domestic, has not.

“A climate decision that cannot even say ‘fossil fuels’ is not neutrality, it is complicity.","BELEM, Brazil (AP) — United Nations climate talks in Brazil reached a subdued agreement Saturday that pledged more funding for countries to adapt to extreme weather’s wrath. But the catch-all agreement doesn’t include explicit details to phase out fossil fuels or strengthen countries’ inadequate emissions cutting plans, which dozens of nations demanded.

The Brazilian hosts of the conference said they’d eventually come up with a road map to get away from fossil fuels working with hard-line Colombia, but it won’t have the same force as something approved at the United Nations conference called COP30. Colombia responded angrily to the deal after it was approved, citing the absence of wording on fossil fuels.

The deal, which was approved after negotiators blew past a Friday deadline to wrap up, was crafted after more than 12 hours of late night and early morning meetings in COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago’s office.

Do Lago said the tough discussions started in Belem will continue under Brazil’s leadership until the next annual conference “even if they are not reflected in this text we just approved.” Do Lago has said a fossil fuel transition plan will be in a separate proposal issued later by his team.

Deal gets mix of lukewarm praise and complaints

Many gave the overall deal lukewarm praise as the best that could be achieved in trying times, while others complained about the package or the process that led to its approval.

“Given the circumstances of geopolitics today, we’re actually quite pleased with the bounds of the package that came out,” said Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chaired the coalition of small island nations. “The alternative is that we don’t get a decision and that would have been a worse alternative.”

“This deal isn’t perfect and is far from what science requires,” said former Ireland President Mary Robinson, a fierce climate advocate for the ex-leaders group The Elders. “But at a time when multilateralism is being tested, it is significant that countries continue to move forward together.”

Some countries said they got enough out of the deal.

“COP30 has not delivered everything Africa asked for, but it has moved the needle,” said Jiwoh Abdulai, Sierra Leone’s environment minister. What really matters, he said, is “how quickly these words turn into real projects that protect lives and livelihoods.”

U.K. Energy Minister Ed Miliband said the agreement was “an important step forward,” but that he would have preferred it to be “more ambitious.” He added: “These are difficult, strenuous, tiring, frustrating negotiations.”

Swift final push prompts complaints

The deal was approved minutes into a plenary meeting open Saturday to all nations that were present.

After the main package was approved and gaveled in by do Lago — to applause by many delegates — angry nation after angry nation took the floor to complain about other parts of the package and about being ignored as do Lago as moved quickly toward approval. The objections were so strong and uniform that do Lago temporarily halted the session for more talk to try to calm things down.

Colombia’s Daniela Duran Gonzalez objected to sections on helping nations cut emissions and reaching worldwide temperature limits that were previously agreed upon. She blasted the conference’s president for ignoring her, saying: “The COP of the truth cannot support an outcome that ignores science.”

One of the areas that usually gets less attention became a big point of contention after a text was approved. The gaveled-in deal established 59 indicators for the world to judge how well nations are adapting to future climate change. Before the Belem conference, experts crafted 100 precisely worded indicators, but negotiators changed the wording and cut the total.

Country after country – including Panama, Uruguay, and Canada – said they had severe problems with it, calling it unclear and unworkable. They complained that they tried to object, raising flags to be noticed so they can speak, but were ignored.

Do Lago said he was sorry he didn’t see the flags.

How major issues were handled

A handful of major issues dominated the talk. Those included coming up with a road map to wean the world from fossil fuels, telling countries that their national plans to curb emissions were inadequate, tripling financial aid for developing nations to adapt to extreme weather and reducing climate restrictions on trade.

“COP30 gave us some baby steps in the right direction, but considering the scale of the climate crisis, it has failed to rise to the occasion,” said Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa.

Even though most nations proclaimed themselves somewhat but not wholly satisfied with the major package, critics complained there was not much to the deal.

“It’s a weak outcome,” said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, now at Greenpeace International. “Strip away the outcome text and you see it plainly: the emperor has no clothes.”

Panama negotiator Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez railed against the deal.

“A climate decision that cannot even say ‘fossil fuels’ is not neutrality, it is complicity. And what is happening here transcends incompetence,” Monterrey Gomez said. “Science has been deleted from COP30 because it offends the polluters.”

Many nations and advocates wanted something stronger because the world will not come close to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid 1800s, which was the goal the 2015 Paris agreement set.

The financial aid for adapting to climate change was tripled to a goal of $120 billion a year, but the goal was pushed back five years. It was one of several tough issues to dominate the late stage of talks. Vulnerable nations have pressed the wealthier countries most responsible for climate change to help out with money to rebuild from damaging extreme weather and to adapt to more of it in the future.

“COP30 was a failure for the communities on the front lines of the climate crisis,” said the disaster charity Mercy Corps’ policy lead Debbie Hillier. “While the COP30 outcome includes a new commitment on adaptation finance, it is deeply disappointing. It includes no baseline year, no clarity on the actual target, and no mechanism defining who is responsible for delivering the tripling.”

Pushing back the goal leaves “vulnerable countries without support to match the escalating needs,” Adow said.

The draft text, confirmed by one person close to the talks, did salvage a passing reference to a 2023 agreement to transition away from fossil fuels — while not mentioning the fuels themselves. Oil-rich Arab countries had fought to exorcise that deal from the record of climate talks.

The person was granted anonymity in order to discuss the details of the draft deal.

The proposal would also set up a meeting next year “to exchange experiences and views on related matters” — an oblique reference to a proposed post-fossil-fuel roadmap.

The deal also agreed to a tripling of funding to help poorer countries adapt to the painful effects of climate change by 2035. That’s more than wealthy governments had said they were willing to agree to in the negotiations, but poorer countries that had sought a 2030 timeline have decried it as wholly inadequate in the face of devastating droughts, floods and fires driven by the superheated climate.

The COP30 talks, which have been running for almost two weeks, have struggled to shake off the shadow of Washington’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. The Trump administration did not send delegates to the talks and is universally expected to reject any outcome.

That meant highly contentious discussions were held in the absence of the world’s largest economy and a frequent broker at these annual summits.

Guidance on the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program was finalized just this past August.
Given the growing number of electric vehicles on our roads, infrastructure and the modernization of the nation’s roadway safety systems must advance simultaneously.
Immediate action is needed to reinforce highway safety systems across the country’s highways, where millions of Americans travel every day.
As previously noted, electric vehicles are significantly heavier than traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines.","When a 7,000-pound electric pickup truck tore through a guardrail at highway speed during a crash test, it confirmed what many safety experts fear: The protective systems lining America’s roads are not ready for the next generation of vehicles.

Electric vehicles weigh more than traditional vehicles, often by 1,000 pounds or more, thanks to their batteries and reinforced structures. Recent testing and on-road crashes have underscored the danger, with electric cars and trucks overwhelming highway barriers designed for lighter vehicles.

Although the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act’s Highway Safety Improvement Program is funding roadway upgrades through 2026, a critical safety issue is being overlooked.

Modernizing the nation’s guardrail systems has slipped behind the push to build a nationwide network of vehicle charging stations. Guidance on the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program was finalized just this past August. U.S. electric vehicle sales reached record levels in the third quarter of 2025, partly due to the expiring $7,500 federal tax credit, with overall sales reaching a 9.1 percent market share in July, and 11.7 percent in the third quarter. Continued strong growth is predicted, driven by falling battery costs and more affordable models coming to market.

Given the growing number of electric vehicles on our roads, infrastructure and the modernization of the nation’s roadway safety systems must advance simultaneously.

Electric vehicles are literally changing the physics of roadway safety. Their added weight accelerates damage to roadway pavement, increasing the risk of accidents.

And, when crashes occur, that same weight can turn a collision with a guardrail into catastrophic failure. Immediate action is needed to reinforce highway safety systems across the country’s highways, where millions of Americans travel every day.

Consider some of the dangers presented. As previously noted, electric vehicles are significantly heavier than traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines. The GMC Hummer electric SUV tops the charts weighing in at over 9,000 pounds. That extra weight increases the stress on pavement and, critically, poses new risks when vehicles collide with guardrails — the absolute last line of defense keeping cars from leaving the roadway.

Guardrails are designed to absorb and redirect the force of a crash, but many of the hundreds of thousands installed nationwide are outdated or improperly installed. In the most catastrophic failures, defective guardrails have pierced vehicles rather than protect them.

The risk escalates with Electric vehicles. Their added weight, lower center of gravity and softer structure in the front, combined with higher highway speeds, means today’s guardrails are often no match.

In fact, the first-of-their-kind crash tests at Texas A&M and the University of Nebraska over the last two years revealed that standard guardrail designs fail under electric vehicle impacts. A Tesla Model 3 and Rivian R1T both tore through guardrails during controlled tests, demonstrating the critical need for new engineering standards.

Sadly, these warnings are no longer confined to laboratories. As it stands, thousands of Americans die each year in car accidents where guardrails and other highway infrastructure fails. In recent years, electric vehicles have overwhelmed roadside protections. Each crash underscores the fact that today’s infrastructure is not designed for tomorrow’s vehicles.

An update to guardrail standards is long overdue. Many roadside safety features continue to be tested at speeds pegged at 60 to 62 mph, whereas highway speeds have climbed past 80 mph in many states. When you factor in the weight of an electric vehicle and its lower center of gravity, the deadly mismatch becomes obvious.

Additionally, it has been nearly 10 years since the Government Accountability Office reported any flaws in the Federal Highway Administration’s guardrail testing program. To close this safety gap, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy should prioritize guardrail safety across the country.

There are four specific things to be done:

The Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration, which sets federal guardrail standards for state Departments of Transportation, should update guardrail design and testing standards to reflect electric vehicle weight and current speed trends.

In partnership with state Departments of Transportation, the U.S. Department of Transportation should prioritize the replacement of outdated guardrails nationwide.

The Federal Highway Safety Administration should encourage collaboration between the makers of both EVs and traditional vehicles and highway safety engineers to develop roadway safety solutions that anticipate the realities of future vehicles for decades to come.

America is at a crossroads. Electric vehicles are here to stay, and roadway safety cannot be an afterthought. Real progress requires broad national investment. That kind of commitment ensures that all Americans in every type of vehicle are protected when traveling our nation’s roadways.

Back in June, we covered Senate Republicans pushing to end the tax credit and immediately flagged the impending crisis.","US clean-energy investments hit a record $75 billion in the third quarter of 2025, driven almost entirely by consumers scrambling to buy electric vehicles before federal tax credits expired on September 30, according to new data from Rhodium Group and MIT.

But the headline number conceals a brutal truth: EV manufacturing investments collapsed 30% compared to the same period last year, and companies canceled $2 billion worth of battery projects.

The contradiction reveals exactly what happens when an industry built on government subsidies faces actual market conditions. Record consumer spending driven by desperation, paired with manufacturers abandoning ship before the policy cliff even arrives.

The Rush Before The Fall

Zero-emission vehicle sales reached $31.2 billion in Q3 2025, marking a 32% increase from the previous quarter as buyers raced to claim the expiring $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs and $4,000 credit for used vehicles.

Congress eliminated these incentives through President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” in July 2025, setting the September 30 deadline that triggered the purchasing frenzy.

The surge mirrors the pre-deadline panic EVXL documented throughout summer 2025, when dealers offered approximately $9,800 in additional incentives and Tesla prominently displayed banners warning buyers to take delivery before the cutoff.

But this wasn’t sustainable growth. It was a fire sale.

Manufacturing Investment Craters

While consumers rushed to buy, manufacturers were heading for the exits.

EV manufacturing sector investments dropped 30%, or $8 billion, compared to Q3 2024, according to the Rhodium Group analysis. Companies also canceled $2 billion worth of battery manufacturing projects during the same quarter.

The timing is critical. These investment decisions happened before the tax credit expired, signaling that manufacturers saw the collapse coming and adjusted accordingly.

General Motors announced in late October it would lay off more than 3,400 workers across battery plants and EV facilities, with CFO Paul Jacobson stating the company expects “EV demand growth to slow pretty significantly.”

Ford halted F-150 Lightning production indefinitely, while the company’s Model E electric vehicle division lost $3.6 billion through the first nine months of 2025.

The Post-Subsidy Reality

The fourth quarter validated manufacturers’ pessimism with stunning speed.

October 2025 EV sales dropped 24% in a single month after the tax credit expired, falling from 98,289 units in September to just 74,897 units.

Light vehicle sales overall decreased 6.5% to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 15.3 million units, marking the lowest sales pace in 15 months.

The carnage extended across America’s $28 billion Battery Belt, where GM idled $2 billion battery plants in Warren, Ohio and Spring Hill, Tennessee barely two months after the credit expired.

Battery plants designed for thousands of workers sit largely empty. Multibillion-dollar facilities remain unfinished shells. The promised 5,000 jobs at Ford’s Kentucky plant turned into 1,450 actual positions.

Global Context Shows US Lagging

The Rhodium report notes that globally, EVs are rising in more countries even amid US policy headwinds, though they remain heavily concentrated in China, the EU, and US, according to International Energy Agency data.

China sold over 11 million EVs in 2024, with electric cars accounting for almost half of all car sales. The country is projected to reach around 60% EV market share in 2025, supported by continued government incentives and falling prices.

Europe saw EV sales stagnate in 2024 as subsidy schemes waned, but the sales share remained around 20%. New emissions standards taking effect in 2025 are expected to drive European EV sales to a 25% market share.

The US, meanwhile, is experiencing the textbook consequences of removing subsidies without building genuine market demand.

Heat Pumps And Storage Face Same Fate

Tax credits for two other types of consumer-facing clean technology face the same September 30 fate: heat pumps and distributed power and storage systems are set to lose their incentives at year’s end.

The pattern is repeating. The question is whether those sectors will see the same panic-buy surge followed by investment collapse.

EVXL’s Take

This Rhodium Group data is the smoking gun that validates every warning EVXL published throughout summer 2025 about subsidy-dependent markets.

Back in June, we covered Senate Republicans pushing to end the tax credit and immediately flagged the impending crisis. When the bill passed on July 4, we explained exactly what would happen: a brief surge as buyers rushed to beat the deadline, followed by a devastating collapse.

The Rhodium numbers prove we were right, but the timing is even more damning than we expected. Manufacturers weren’t just pulling back after the subsidy expired. They were abandoning investments during Q3 2025 while the subsidies still existed and consumer sales were surging.

That $8 billion manufacturing investment decline happened in the same quarter that saw record consumer spending. Let that sink in. Companies watched Americans spend $31 billion on EVs and responded by cutting factory investments by 30%.

Why? Because they knew those sales were artificial. Pull-forward demand driven by policy panic, not sustainable market dynamics.

The October collapse validated their judgment. EV sales cratered 24% the moment the subsidies ended. Within weeks, GM idled $2 billion in battery plants and laid off 3,300 workers. Ford stopped making F-150 Lightnings with no restart timeline announced.

The broader pattern across America’s $28 billion Battery Belt tells the complete story: stalled construction sites, mass layoffs, and desperate pivots to non-EV products. Despite $28 billion in taxpayer subsidies, the grand vision of Midwest EV dominance collapsed just six weeks after federal tax credits expired.

Compare this to China’s approach. Chinese manufacturers achieved genuine cost advantages through integrated supply chains and manufacturing efficiency. Two-thirds of EVs sold in China in 2024 were priced lower than their ICE equivalents, even without subsidies. That’s actual competitiveness, not subsidy dependency.

European automakers are struggling too, but they’re facing genuine market forces like overcapacity and Chinese competition, not the sudden removal of the training wheels that were holding up their entire business model.

The heat pump and distributed storage sectors should be watching closely. Their tax credits expire December 31, 2025. If the pattern holds, expect a Q4 buying surge followed by a manufacturing investment collapse in early 2026.

What’s particularly galling is how the $75 billion headline number will be spun by advocates as proof that clean energy investment remains strong. That figure is technically accurate but fundamentally misleading. Strip out the panic-driven consumer purchases, and you’re left with an industry in retreat.

This echoes patterns we’ve documented at our sister site DroneXL, where protectionist policies and subsidy-dependent business models often backfire spectacularly. When you build an industry on government support rather than genuine competitive advantages, removing that support exposes the weakness immediately.

The Trump administration is now touting a vehicle loan interest deduction as a replacement benefit, but that provides a fraction of the support the $7,500 credit offered. It’s political theater designed to distract from the wreckage.

Looking ahead six months, expect continued consolidation in the US EV market. Startups without deep pockets will disappear. Traditional automakers will scale back EV commitments further. Chinese manufacturers will continue gaining global market share while American battery plants sit idle.

The Rhodium report inadvertently documents the precise moment when subsidy-dependent industrial policy hit the wall. Record investment numbers masking catastrophic structural retreat. It’s exactly what EVXL predicted, and exactly what happens when you confuse government support with actual market demand.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/img_0144.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 15:00:33.253928

The annual talks are this year being held in Belem, a Brazilian city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. They were scheduled to wrap up Friday, but negotiators blew past that deadline and it wasn’t clear when they may finish.

Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez, a top negotiator for Panama, said Friday that the decades-long United Nations process risks “becoming a clown show” for the omission. His nation was among 36 to object to a proposal from the conference president, André Corrêa do Lago of host Brazil, because it doesn’t provide an explicit guide map for the world to transition away from fossil fuels, nor to strengthen climate-fighting plans submitted earlier this year.

Before nations moved into high-level negotiations behind closed doors, Monterrey Gomez warned that talks were on “the verge of collapse.” A few hours later, he said nothing much had changed.

Do Lago started the day telling diplomats he thought they “are very close” to doing what they set out to do when they started meeting a week ago. When the all-country talks fizzled, do Lago pivoted to bringing in smaller pairings of negotiating teams for meeting in his office.

Talks behind schedule

“I would expect there needs to be another text,” veteran observer and former chief German climate negotiator Jennifer Morgan said late Friday afternoon. “I think there’s quite a lot of work to be done.”

The Brazilian proposals — also called texts — came on the heels of a fire on Thursday that briefly spread through pavilions of the conference known as COP30 on the edge of the Amazon. No one was seriously hurt but the fire meant that a day of work was largely lost.

“The problem is we’re 24 hours behind schedule,” said David Waskow, international climate director for the World Resources Institute.

Cold reception from many

The European Union said flatly that it wouldn’t accept the text. EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra reminded negotiators that countries had gathered at the edge of the Amazon to bring down emissions and transition away from fossil fuels.

“Look at the text. Look at it. None of it is in there. No science. No global stocktake. No transitioning away. But instead, weakness,” Hoekstra said in a closed-door meeting of negotiators, according to a transcript provided by the EU. “Under no circumstances are we going to accept this. And nothing that is even remotely close, and I say it with pain in my heart, nothing that is remotely close to what is now on the table.”

“After 10 years, this process is still failing,” Maina Vakafua Talia, minister of environment for the small Pacific island nation of Tuvalu, said in a speech earlier in the day. “The Pacific came to COP30 demanding a survival road map away from fossil fuels. Yet the current draft texts that came out (do) not even name the main threat for our very survival and existence.”

A key text among host Brazil’s proposals deals with four difficult issues. They include financial aid for vulnerable countries hit hardest by climate change and getting countries to toughen up their national plans to reduce Earth-warming emissions.

Then there’s the dispute over creating a detailed road map for the world to phase out the fossil fuels that are largely driving Earth’s increasing extreme weather. Any such plan would expand on a single sentence — to “transition away” from fossil fuels — agreed upon two years ago at the climate talks in Dubai. But no timetable or process was spelled out and powerful oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia and Russia oppose it.

More than 80 nations have called for stronger direction and Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva also pushed for it earlier this month.

Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore urged nations to stand firm in opposition and hailed Lula’s involvement.

“Saudi Arabia and Donald Trump and Russia under Vladimir Putin have bullied countries to support an absurd proposal,” Gore said in an interview with The Associated Press. He said the latest document “even deletes the proposal to phase out the ridiculous and self-destructive subsidies for fossil fuels. This is an OPEC text,” he said, for the organization that represents oil-producing countries.

Tackling fossil fuels

On phasing out fossil fuels, the proposal “acknowledges that the global transition towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development is irreversible and the trend of the future.”

The text “also acknowledges that the Paris Agreement is working and resolves to go further and faster,” referring to the 2015 climate talks that established the goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), compared to the mid-1800s. A key issue is that the 119 national emissions-curbing plans submitted this year don’t come close to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees.

Though the text didn’t address a fossil fuel transition road map, it could eventually end in a vaguely worded section about a plan for the next couple years in a separate road map.

The 36 nations who thought the text didn’t go far enough included wealthy ones such as the United Kingdom, France and Germany along with smaller climate-vulnerable islands Palau, Marshall Islands and Vanuatu. They said the proposal doesn’t meet “the minimum conditions required for a credible COP outcome.”

Colombian Environment Minister Irene Vélez Torres said the presidency’s proposal is unacceptable to “those of us who are committed to life on this planet, to climate justice.”

Getting everyone in one room

Agreements at these talks are officially reached when no nation objects and typically require many rounds of negotiations. In practice, the proceedings can end with agreements adopted and the presidency adjourning the meeting after noting any objections.

Instead of the usual small group meetings, the Brazilian presidency convened a meeting of nations’ top officials behind closed doors for much of Friday. It’s designed to lessen any nation feeling left out of backroom deals, but it doesn’t let the public see countries’ objections.

After a few hours it broke up with no sign of success and do Lago trying a different strategy.

The final deal emerging from a difficult final day of negotiations near the mouth of the Amazon calls for enhanced efforts by nations to curb the Earth’s rising temperatures and provide poorer, particularly vulnerable countries with assurances of funding to deal with the impacts of a hotter planet. But it offers money less quickly than those nations would have wanted, due to resistance from Europe and other rich countries.

The COP30 agreement also points to expansions of the worldwide clean energy economy, calling the transition toward reduced planet-warming pollution and more climate-resilient development “irreversible and the trend of the future.”

It was a stronger outcome than what the talks’ Brazilian hosts had proposed in the final days of the talks. The negotiations faced multiple headwinds, including the United States’ refusal to attend the summit at all.

But the agreement still only alludes to a push by 82 nations, including many in Europe, for a concrete process to speed up the worldwide transition away from fossil fuels. That proposal had drawn objections from major oil- and natural-gas-producing nations, which have pointed to rising energy demand as a driver of the continued need for output.

Instead, countries agreed to take marginal steps to accelerate their climate efforts while “striving” to do better, a phrase that China — the world’s clean energy superpower, second-biggest economy and largest greenhouse gas polluter — has used to refer to its own targets.

Brazil also pushed a side deal for creating two separate “roadmaps” that would outline a path toward winding down fossil fuel use and ending deforestation. Colombia and the Netherlands, strong advocates of a fossil fuel phase out, had announced Friday they would co-host a summit next year to move that effort forward.

“As president of this conference, it is my duty to recognize some very important discussions that took place in Belem and that need to continue during the Brazilian presidency … even if they are not reflected in these texts we just approved,” COP30 President André Aranha Corrêa do Lago said following the final gaveling.

“There was no backtracking, there was a bit of progress,” said German climate minister Carsten Schneider. “I would have liked to see much more, but we also wanted a COP that produces results and shows that multilateralism works, even if it is incredibly difficult.”

The final text is nonbinding, and even a firm reiteration of a previous summit’s 2023 pledge to eventually phase out oil, gas and coal would have no effect on countries such as the United States that are aggressively moving to expand their production and exports of fossil fuels. But the less-than-resounding support for taking that pledge forward raises questions about whether countries remained united behind a goal they had described as historic just two years ago, according to delegates who expressed disappointment Saturday.

The 13 days of talks by nearly 200 countries in the northern Brazilian port city of Belém had taken place without U.S. delegates present — a first for the annual global climate talks — after President Donald Trump dismissed the entire effort to avert the Earth’s warming as a “hoax” and a “con job.”

Trump announced in January that he was once again withdrawing the United States from the 2015 Paris Agreement, the global climate pact whose goals had provided a basis for this month’s negotiations.

The absence of a strong U.S. push for a climate deal, something Washington had provided at previous talks under former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, allowed a bloc of emerging economies and petro-states to scrub the final text of any explicit mention of the fuels driving climate change.

EU members, while initially split over whether to endorse the roadmap on fossil fuels, had railed against the snub on Friday and were prepared to walk away from the summit on the final day without a deal.

But the bloc won a handful of small concessions overnight, and after hours of discussions early Saturday morning decided to endorse the slightly tweaked text.

“We would have liked to have more,” EU climate chief Wopke Hoekstra said, but “we do think we should support it because at least it goes in the right direction.”

The 2023 U.N. climate summit in the United Arab Emirates — a major oil and gas producer in its own right — had urged countries to begin “transitioning away from fossil fuels.”

In the years since, fossil fuel production has continued rising. At the same time, though, use of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power have taken off, thanks in large part to lower costs and rising exports of gear from China.

But China, which still describes itself as a developing country, declined to step into a political leadership position at the talks, despite having a major presence at the summit and a predominant role in the world’s clean energy supply chains. That left the European Union and more progressive climate countries, such as Colombia and the United Kingdom, isolated in pushing for a more ambitious deal without U.S. backing.

As the COP30 host and president, Brazil had placed a priority on connecting the talks to the real economy and sending a message that global cooperation on climate is still alive and breathing. The final deal achieved that aim, but just.

“At a time of great political challenge, 193 countries have come together within the Paris Agreement to recommit to acting on the climate crisis,” said UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband. “We fought hard for this outcome because it is crucial to protect future generations and because of the economic opportunities today from clean energy.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/1d/0b/b5e57e0c46c3a36b514917b505c6/climate-cop30-65571.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 19:00:06.439118

That too did not make it into the final agreement.","The world edged a small step closer to the end of the fossil fuel era on Saturday, but not by nearly enough to stave off the ravages of climate breakdown.

Countries meeting in Brazil for two weeks could manage only a voluntary agreement to begin discussions on a roadmap to an eventual phase-out of fossil fuels, and they achieved this incremental progress only in the teeth of implacable opposition from oil-producing countries.

The talks were hauled back from the brink of collapse in an all-night session into Saturday morning, after a bitter standoff between a coalition of more than 80 developed and developing countries, and a group led by Saudi Arabia and its allies plus Russia.

There was disappointment from campaigners, but relief that the talks had produced at least some progress. Developing countries achieved part of their goal at the global talks, which was a tripling of the financial support available from rich countries to help them adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis. They should receive $120bn (£92bn) a year for adaptation, from the $300bn developed countries pledged to them last year, but not until 2035, instead of the 2030 deadline they were demanding. Many had also hoped the increase would be on top of the $300bn.

A roadmap to the halting of deforestation was dropped from the final deal, a bitter disappointment for nature advocates at this “rainforest Cop” held in Belém, near the mouth of the Amazon River.

The agreement among 194 countries – excluding the US, which did not send a delegation – was reached in the early morning after 12 hours of nonstop extra-time talks among ministers in deserted conference halls, and completed at a closing meeting at 1.35pm, after negotiations were hauled back from the brink of collapse on Friday evening.

Jennifer Morgan, the Cop veteran and former German climate envoy, said: “While far from what’s needed, the outcome in Belém is meaningful progress. The Paris agreement is working, the transition away from fossil fuels agreed in Dubai [at the Cop28 talks in 2023] is accelerating. Despite the efforts of major oil-producing states to slow down the green transition, multilateralism continues to support the interests of the whole world in tackling the climate crisis.”

Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: “With an increasingly fractured geopolitical backdrop, Cop30 gave us some baby steps in the right direction, but considering the scale of the climate crisis, it has failed to rise to the occasion. Despite calling themselves climate leaders, developed countries have betrayed vulnerable nations by failing to deliver science-aligned national emission reduction plans.”

Poor countries must be supported to cope with a crisis not of their making, said Ali Mohamed, special climate envoy for Kenya. “The 30th Cop has reaffirmed both the urgency of climate action, and the disproportionate risks faced by the most vulnerable. Kenya and Africa stand ready to lead in the transition to clean energy, but resilience and adaptation cannot remain afterthoughts for a continent responsible for less than 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions,” he said. “Developed countries must finally honour their finance commitments.”

Efforts to limit global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, in line with the goals of the Paris agreement, were also addressed in the final text, but less robustly than vulnerable countries had hoped. Before the conference, countries were supposed to present new national plans on cutting emissions, but they fell short of the commitments needed to maintain the 1.5C limit, which has already been breached but which analysts say could be returned to.

Instead of censuring this failure, the conference agreed to set up an “accelerator” programme to address the shortfall in the nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which will report back at next year’s Cop, to be held in Turkey but presided over by Australia. The text exhorted countries to “full implementation of NDCs while striving to do better”.

The final deal also recognised the “just transition” that social justice campaigners have been calling for, which means helping workers affected by the move away from fossil fuels and towards clean energy. But key provisions on the exploitation of “critical minerals” – which has been accompanied by soaring human rights abuses in some countries – were blocked by China and Russia.

Insiders said the talks came close to foundering on Friday, after a hectic few weeks in Brazil that began with a summit of world leaders held by Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and attended by about 50 heads or deputy heads of state.

High-level ministers from Jamaica, Cuba and Mauritius all spoke there of the devastating impact of Hurricane Melissa. “We did not create this crisis, but we refuse to stand as victims,” said Matthew Samuda, Jamaica’s economic growth minister.”

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned of temperature rises that would “push ecosystems past irreversible tipping points, expose billions to unlivable conditions, and amplify threats to peace and security”.

But after the leaders left and Cop30 formally began on Monday 10 November, discussions among ministers and high-ranking officials degenerated into a bitter standoff. A fire near the delegation offices on Thursday afternoon, in which no one was seriously hurt, forced evacuation of the conference centre and disrupted negotiations at a crucial stage.

When they resumed late on Thursday evening, the rift was clear: more than 80 countries had declared in favour of including a commitment to “transition away from fossil fuels” in the final outcome, but scores of countries – led by the Arab group, which includes Saudi Arabia – lined up against it.

That opposition forced the relegation of the “transition away from fossil fuels” – that scientists say is essential to staving off the worst effects of climate breakdown – to a voluntary commitment rather than the legally binding decision many had hoped for.

Teresa Anderson, the global lead on climate justice at ActionAid International, said: “A lack of climate finance is throwing a spanner in the works of climate progress. Global south countries, [which] are already carrying the costs of the climate crisis they have not caused, desperately need support from rich countries if they are to take on any more commitments. Nowhere was this more stark than on the issue of fossil fuels, where specific text once again ended up unfunded and on the cutting-room floor.”

Carolina Pasquali, executive director of Greenpeace Brazil, said: “We must reflect on what was possible, and what is now missing: the roadmaps to end forest destruction, and fossil fuels, and an ongoing lack of finance. More than 80 countries supported a transition away from fossil fuels, but they were blocked from agreeing on this change by countries that refused to support this necessary and urgent step. More than 90 countries supported improved protection of forests. That too did not make it into the final agreement. Unfortunately, the text failed to deliver the scale of change needed.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bd6f5163c428444ecc401fc39eadd25ec46276b/333_0_3328_2662/master/3328.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a87701f471fd18f83542d41dd56469e4",N,,2025-11-22 16:00:05.141978

Now, Möeve, formerly known as Cepsa, has announced it is preparing to break ground on Spain’s largest green hydrogen project. The company has noted the astonishing progress in developing the planned facility that will become a landmark achievement in Spain’s energy transition ambitions. The renewable energy sector is undoubtedly the way forward for the international energy sector.

The Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley will become the largest hydrogen project in Spain

Spain has long been searching for the best method to decarbonize its energy sector. Doing so requires a pragmatic approach so as not to disrupt the energy ecosystem in the region. The project, which will become the largest green hydrogen project in Spain once completed, has an eye-watering budget of 3,000 million euros, underscoring Spain’s commitment to reaching its clean energy goals.

The Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley project has been listed by Spain and the EU as an IPCEI (Important Project of Common Interest), and Möeve has stated its ambition to immediately begin construction. The astonishingly large project will consist of an electrolysis plant with a combined capacity of 2 GW, which could potentially produce up to 300,000 tonnes of green hydrogen annually.

The first phase of the project has been dubbed Onuba by the company

The initial phase will consist of a 400 MW electrolysis plant located in Palos de la Frontera, and will mostly focus on producing green hydrogen for both the company’s own facilities and for other interested third parties. According to official data from Möeve, the first phase of the project will create roughly 10,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs for the local populace.

The new green hydrogen project forms part of Spain’s national strategy for the renewable energy sector

Spain’s national strategic plan for renewable energies, known as ERHA PERTE, calls for increased spending and attention on accelerating Spain’s embrace of the hydrogen sector and the renewable one overall. That embrace has not been the trend for other nations that still rely on the gas and oil sectors. Additionally, the Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley project will create auxiliary infrastructure, such as:

220 kV underground power lines

substantial connections to local electrical substations

storage plants linked to heavy, maritime, and air transport

decarbonization of critical energy sectors in Spain

The additional necessary infrastructure for the project needs to be considered as well, with Spain needing to build robust electricity grids and industrial-scale gas transport systems. That will most likely come from the astonishing 3,000 million euro price tag to complete the construction phase.

Spain’s hope will be for the project to boost its hydrogen capacity, as the resource can be used to produce renewable fuels and green ammonia, essential to replacing traditional fuels like diesel and other fossil fuels. The European proclivity for the renewable energy sector has become all too real in recent years, with the EU awarding funds for eight hydrogen projects across the bloc.

But the catch-all agreement doesn’t include explicit details to phase out fossil fuels or strengthen countries’ inadequate emissions cutting plans, which dozens of nations demanded.

“A climate decision that cannot even say ‘fossil fuels’ is not neutrality, it is complicity.","BELEM, Brazil (AP) — United Nations climate talks in Brazil reached a subdued agreement Saturday that pledged more funding for countries to adapt to the wrath of extreme weather. But the catch-all agreement doesn’t include explicit details to phase out fossil fuels or strengthen countries’ inadequate emissions cutting plans, which dozens of nations demanded.

The Brazilian hosts of the conference said they’d eventually come up with a road map to get away from fossil fuels working with hard-line Colombia, but it won’t have the same force as something approved at the conference called COP30. Colombia responded angrily to the deal after it was approved, citing the absence of wording on fossil fuels.

The deal, which was approved after negotiators blew past a Friday deadline, was crafted after hours of late night and early morning meetings. After the deal was approved, COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago said the tough discussions started in Belem will continue under Brazil’s leadership until the next annual conference “even if they are not reflected in this text we just approved.”

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the deal shows “that nations can still come together to confront the defining challenges no country can solve alone.” But he added: “I cannot pretend that COP30 has delivered everything that is needed. The gap between where we are and what science demands remains dangerously wide.”

Deal gets mix of lukewarm praise and complaints

Many gave the deal lukewarm praise as the best that could be achieved in trying times, while others complained about the package or the process that led to its approval.

“Given the circumstances of geopolitics today, we’re actually quite pleased with the bounds of the package that came out,” said Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chaired the coalition of small island nations. “The alternative is that we don’t get a decision and that would have been a worse alternative.”

“This deal isn’t perfect and is far from what science requires,” said former Ireland President Mary Robinson, a fierce climate advocate for the ex-leaders group The Elders. “But at a time when multilateralism is being tested, it is significant that countries continue to move forward together.”

Absent from the talks was the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

“This year there has been a lot of attention on one country stepping back,” U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell said, referring to the United States’ withdrawal from the landmark 2015 Paris agreement. “But amid the gale-force political headwinds, 194 countries stood firm in solidarity — rock-solid in support of climate cooperation.”

Some countries said they got enough out of the deal.

“COP30 has not delivered everything Africa asked for, but it has moved the needle,” said Jiwoh Abdulai, Sierra Leone’s environment minister. What really matters, he said, is “how quickly these words turn into real projects that protect lives and livelihoods.”

U.K. Energy Minister Ed Miliband said the agreement was “an important step forward,” but that he would have preferred it to be “more ambitious.” He added: “These are difficult, strenuous, tiring, frustrating negotiations.”

Swift final push prompts complaints

The deal was approved minutes into a plenary meeting open Saturday to all nations that were present.

After the main package was approved — to applause by many delegates — angry nations took the floor to complain about other parts of the package and about being ignored as do Lago moved quickly toward approval. The objections were so strong that do Lago temporarily halted the session to try to calm things down.

Colombia’s Daniela Duran Gonzalez blasted the conference’s president for ignoring her, saying: “The COP of the truth cannot support an outcome that ignores science.”

An area that usually gets less attention became a big point of contention. The approved deal established 59 indicators for the world to judge how nations are adapting to climate change. Before the Belem conference, experts crafted 100 precisely worded indicators, but negotiators changed the wording and cut the total.

The European Union, several Latin American countries and Canada said they had severe problems with it, calling it unclear and unworkable. They complained that they tried to object but were ignored.

Do Lago apologized.

How major issues were handled

A handful of major issues dominated the talk. Those included coming up with a road map to wean the world from fossil fuels, telling countries that their national plans to curb emissions were inadequate, tripling financial aid for developing nations to adapt to extreme weather and reducing climate restrictions on trade.

“COP30 gave us some baby steps in the right direction, but considering the scale of the climate crisis, it has failed to rise to the occasion,” said Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa.

Critics complained there was not much to the deal.

“Strip away the outcome text and you see it plainly: The emperor has no clothes,” said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, now at Greenpeace International.

Panama negotiator Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez railed against the deal.

“A climate decision that cannot even say ‘fossil fuels’ is not neutrality, it is complicity. And what is happening here transcends incompetence,” Monterrey Gomez said. “Science has been deleted from COP30 because it offends the polluters.”

Many nations and advocates wanted something stronger because the world will not come close to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid 1800s, which was the goal the 2015 Paris agreement set.

The financial aid for adapting to climate change was tripled to a goal of $120 billion a year, but the goal was pushed back five years. It was one of several tough issues to dominate the late stage of talks. Vulnerable nations have pressed the wealthier countries most responsible for climate change to help out with money to rebuild from damaging extreme weather and to adapt to more of it in the future.

Pushing back the goal leaves “vulnerable countries without support to match the escalating needs,” Adow said.

After the main deal was approved, tempers flared as the open meeting stretched on. Russia’s ambassador at large, Sergei Kononuchenko, lectured Latin American delegates who were objecting frequently that they were “behaving like children who want to get your hands on all the sweets, and aren’t prepared to share them with everyone.”

An angry Eliana Ester Saissac of Argentina said Latin Americans “are in no way behaving like spoiled children who want to stuff our mouths full of sweets” to a roar of cheers and applause.

Key issues at COP30 included efforts to close the gap in ambition of countries’ emission reduction commitments (also known as nationally determined contributions or NDCs); addressing adaptation needs, including funding for lower-income countries working to adapt to rapidly escalating climate impacts; a transition away from fossil fuels toward a clean energy economy, with finance for lower-income countries; and a just transition work program. Recent scientific reports have made clear that the world is currently on track to surpass 1.5 C of global warming and the final outcome of the talks—including the Mutirão political package—is not strong enough to seriously address this reality and protect people and the planet, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).

Below is a statement by Dr. Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director for the Climate and Energy Program at UCS. She has been attending the U.N.’s international climate talks and has partnered with the international community on climate and energy policies for about 20 years. Dr. Cleetus attended COP30 in Belém, Brazil.

“The barely adequate outcome salvaged in the final hours of COP30 keeps the Paris Agreement alive but exposes the monumental failures of rich countries—including the United States and European Union nations—to live up to the commitments they made under that agreement.

“Scientists have warned that the world will soon overshoot 1.5 C of global warming. Yet richer countries—who are the largest historical contributors to heat-trapping emissions—continue to gobble up an unfair share of the rapidly dwindling carbon budget left to limit further dangerous climate change. Overshooting 1.5 C also has profound implications for escalating costly and deadly climate impacts, and for loss and damage people across the world are enduring.

“Although a roadmap for a transition away from fossil fuels did not make it into the text, it remains the case that countries already agreed to that transition two years ago in Dubai. In the final plenary, the Presidency made a rousing commitment to initiate a high-level science-based, inclusive process for developing two roadmaps, one on addressing tropical deforestation and one on a just, orderly and equitable transition away from fossil fuels. This important statement is a recognition of the immense support from countries for these urgent priorities, but they must be accompanied by finance and adopted at a future COP. The Presidency will also initiate collaborative processes aimed at improving fulfillment of countries’ emission reduction pledges and raising collective ambition to limit the overshoot of 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming.

“The Mutirão political package includes a nod to tripling adaptation finance, although the overall amount is unclear and will be well short of what’s needed, and the delivery date is punted out to 2035. There is also no firm assurance of public grant-based finance for lower-income nations. People in these countries are reeling from repeated blows from worsening climate impacts, primarily caused by richer nations’ emissions, as evidenced by the recent destruction wrought by back-to-back typhoons in the Philippines and Hurricane Melissa in the Caribbean.

“On a positive note, the COP30 outcome includes a very encouraging agreement to develop a just transition mechanism to help enable a fair, funded transformation to a clean energy future with social and economic safeguards for workers and communities. Real-world evidence shows that renewable energy and energy efficiency are winning solutions that help lower energy costs, cut pollution and protect people’s health. Decision-makers at all levels of government and forward-looking businesses should embrace the tremendous opportunity to accelerate global clean energy momentum because it is in everyone’s best interest.

“Despite many wealthy nations claiming to uphold the 1.5 C climate goal and a transition away from fossil fuels, their hypocrisy was on full display here in Belém as they refused to follow through on necessary actions and funding to make those words a reality. Rich nations’ emission reduction commitments are highly insufficient as they continue to be in the thrall of fossil fuels. They have also repeatedly lowballed and shirked delivering desperately needed finance for lower income countries to transition to clean energy, adapt to climate change and cope with loss and damage. Petrostates—including Saudi Arabia—and fossil fuel lobbyists also played a malign role in blocking ambitious outcomes here at COP.

“COP30 was supposed to be the COP of truth and implementation. Unless nations reckon with the ugly truths revealed here, there will be major repercussions for multilateral climate agreements and more importantly, for the lives of communities who are on the frontlines of the climate crisis. People around the world deserve far more from their leaders to meaningfully confront the existential threats brought forth by the climate crisis and advance a thriving, fair clean energy economy. The fight for climate justice does not end here because the fight cannot end here—the stakes are simply too high.”

“Despite many wealthy nations claiming to uphold the 1.5 C climate goal and a transition away from fossil fuels, their hypocrisy was on full display here in Belém as they refused to follow through on necessary actions and funding to make those words a reality. Rich nations’ emission reduction commitments are highly insufficient as they continue to be in the thrall of fossil fuels. They have also repeatedly lowballed and shirked delivering desperately needed finance for lower income countries to transition to clean energy, adapt to climate change and cope with loss and damage. Petrostates—including Saudi Arabia—and fossil fuel lobbyists also played a malign role in blocking ambitious outcomes here at COP.

“COP30 was supposed to be the COP of truth and implementation. Unless nations reckon with the ugly truths revealed here, there will be major repercussions for multilateral climate agreements and more importantly, for the lives of communities who are on the frontlines of the climate crisis. People around the world deserve far more from their leaders to meaningfully confront the existential threats brought forth by the climate crisis and advance a thriving, fair clean energy economy. The fight for climate justice does not end here because the fight cannot end here—the stakes are simply too high.”

Energy Vault is a global energy storage technology company that develops large-scale battery systems and innovative gravity-based storage solutions designed to support renewable energy and stabilize electric grids.

Scurry County was selected for its efficient permitting process and strong local workforce, including welders, construction workers, and students from Western Texas College. Officials say the project will help the electric grid better manage demand fluctuations while creating new opportunities for skilled workers in the area.

“There is a desperate need for storage to allow the grid to smooth the peaks and troughs occurring with increasing demand and to account for the much more distributed, smaller generation coming online with wind and solar,” said Joe Smith, Energy Vault Project Manager. “We’re really excited about being here. It’s been fantastic to tap into the skills that already exist in the local job market. We also have plans for further development on this site and across West Texas that will generate more opportunities.”

Energy Vault is developing both conventional battery systems and gravity-based energy storage technology designed to store energy when it is abundant and release it when demand is high. Company leaders say these systems position West Texas at the forefront of energy storage innovation while supporting the region’s growing renewable energy sector.

“The jobs we plan to create as this site grows include electrical work, mechanical work, construction work, welding work, and a wide range of engineering jobs in electrical, mechanical, software, civil, and structural fields,” said Chris Wiese, president of Energy Vault.

The company’s progress in the region builds on the Cross Trails Battery Energy Storage System, the first project Energy Vault has developed, owned, and operated. The system has an output of 57 megawatts and an energy capacity of 114 megawatt hours, and it provides energy and grid support services within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. It is also the first installation to use Energy Vault’s second-generation B VAULT AC product.

President Donald Trump’s policies targeting U.S. renewable energy have put two-thirds of Texas’ future solar and battery storage projects at risk of getting stuck in regulatory limbo.

The sector’s leading trade group, Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), found that the Trump administration’s stalling of renewable projects through slowing federal permitting and rolling back tax credits could result in more than 13,000 megawatts of planned solar and battery projects — half of all the scheduled projects — might not come online in Texas next year.

In 2027, the share of at-risk capacity jumps to more than 22,500 megawatts of the 26,000 planned. In total, SEIA identified 165 projects in Texas that are at risk of not being built.

The figures are from an analysis of Energy Information Administration (EIA) data. More than 70 gigawatts of solar and 40 gigawatts of battery projects haven’t received all the federal, state and local permits required and are at risk of being slowed down by an administration determined to halt renewable development in favor of fossil fuels.

Some projects in the interconnection queue have lost funding from canceled Solar for All grants and it’s assumed that some projects might not be built due to the loss of tax incentives, said Cyrus Reed, conservation director of the Sierra Club Lone Star Chapter. It’s too early to tell what the broad impact will be, Reed said.

In July, the Trump administration began requiring the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s office to sign off on all the agency’s decisions regarding clean energy projects. In its announcement, the Interior Department said it was “ending preferential treatment for unreliable, subsidy-dependent wind and solar energy.”

Later, in September, an agency official said the Interior Department was prioritizing permits for new fossil fuel plants over renewable energy projects because of limited resources and a desire to focus on permitting “reliable” power.

The Interior Department did not respond to questions about how many solar and storage projects were approved by the department since July.

SEIA President Abigail Ross Hopper said the administration’s policies are threatening the future of U.S. energy.

“Political attacks on solar and storage are putting half of all power planned to come onto the grid this decade at risk, just as electricity demand from AI is exploding,” Hopper said. “These are projects that would lower costs for families, strengthen our grid and cement America’s global competitiveness.”

While campaigning last year, Trump pledged to cut electricity bills across the country in half within 12 months. A new analysis by Democratic members of the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee found that the opposite is happening. Households in nearly every state are on track to pay more for electricity this year than last, upwards of $100. Texas is no exception, the congressional report found.

On average, a Texas household spent $1,960 on electricity last year. This year, they’re projected to pay $2,070, or 5.6 percent more.

Washington, D.C., is projected to have the largest bill increase, up more than 22 percent, followed by Indiana, which the analysis forecasts will see average electricity bills rise more than 16 percent.

The CEO of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the state’s grid operator, credited both solar and storage for bolstering the grid throughout the summer without ever having to make conservation calls despite record-breaking energy demand.

When the state legislature was debating bills earlier this year to restrict the growth of renewables in Texas, the Texas Energy Buyers Alliance Club, a trade group, reported that blocking future renewable energy and storage would cost Texans $115 billion in higher wholesale prices over the next 15 years, for both residential and commercial customers within ERCOT.

“Texans know how nonsensical it is for President Trump and Congress to cancel tax incentives for renewables and Solar for All grants so they can spend hundreds of millions to prop up old, polluting coal plants,” Reed said. “Texans deserve to see these projects built, not lost due to federal decisions that are bad for business, bad for bills and bad for our air and water.”

“From rapid growth to ongoing drought, Montana’s water resources and water users are facing unprecedented challenges,” Andrew Gorder, legal director of the Clark Fork Coalition, said in a press release.
“The cumulative impact of over 100,000 exempt groundwater wells can no longer be ignored.
Advocates against exempt wells have said developers have exploited the exempt well rule to build new homes and try to solve the state’s housing crunch.
“The State knows that exempt wells adversely affect senior water rights,” the lawsuit states.","Agricultural groups and environmental groups combined to file a lawsuit against the state’s Department of Natural Resources and Conservation alleging the state’s exempt well laws allow unregulated groundwater development outside the state’s permitting system.

According to the DNRC, small groundwater developments that use 35 gallons per minute or less and do not exceed 10 acre-feet per year, are known as “exempt wells.”

There may be as many as 141,000 exempt wells authorized between 1973 and 2023, the lawsuit says.

“By authorizing unregulated groundwater development, the Exempt Well Law undermines these constitutional protections afforded to senior water right appropriators and threatens the integrity of Montana’s water resources,” the lawsuit says.

The coalition bringing the lawsuit against the state is broad, including the Montana League of Cities and Towns, Association of Gallatin Agricultural Irrigators, Clark Fork Coalition, Montana Environmental Information Center, Montana Farm Bureau Federation, and Trout Unlimited.

A DNRC spokesperson said they could not comment on the suit due to litigation being active.

“From rapid growth to ongoing drought, Montana’s water resources and water users are facing unprecedented challenges,” Andrew Gorder, legal director of the Clark Fork Coalition, said in a press release. “The cumulative impact of over 100,000 exempt groundwater wells can no longer be ignored. We’re asking the court to conserve our limited water resources and ensure that the constitutional protections afforded to senior water rights, including instream flow rights, are preserved.”

The lawsuit goes on to say that some of Montana’s fastest growing areas have been “fueled” by individual exempt wells. The issue was heavily discussed during the legislative session, with some home developers and realtor associations pushing to keep rules as they are now.

Advocates against exempt wells have said developers have exploited the exempt well rule to build new homes and try to solve the state’s housing crunch.

“Exempt wells facilitate a housing development model and pattern that is unsustainable,” Mark Runkle, a Montana housing developer said in a press release. “It transfers many of the developer’s responsibilities to future homeowners and taxpayers. This model undermines responsible development on municipal services with infrastructure completed and undermines the affordability of housing.”

One bill last session — Senate Bill 358 — would have restricted usage of exempt wells in some high-growth areas of the state.

“The State knows that exempt wells adversely affect senior water rights,” the lawsuit states. “Yet, legislative attempts to address the exempt well loophole have been unsuccessful in multiple sessions, including the 2025 session, demonstrating the legislature’s unwillingness or inability to bring the Water Use Act into constitutional compliance.”

The suit seeks to end the exempt well “loophole.”

“The exempt well loophole forces cities and towns to shoulder the consequences of unregulated groundwater use,” Kelly Lynch, executive director of Montana League of Cities and Towns, said in a press release. “Municipalities are already struggling to ensure reliable water supplies for growing communities. We need a consistent, lawful permitting process that protects existing users, not a system that leaves Montana’s communities and taxpayers to clean up the mess.”

First Solar is continuing to take major steps in that direction with its new $330 million investment in South Carolina, where a manufacturing plant is slated to begin operations in 2026 and create more than 600 local jobs. The facility will handle the final production stages of the company’s thin-film modules, reinforcing the role

American manufacturing plays in long-term energy competitiveness.

At the same time, First Solar is also opening a 2.4-million-square-foot facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana—the largest single investment in the parish’s history. Once fully operational, the plant will employ more than 700 people and produce solar modules built with American-made components. This expansion strengthens domestic supply chains, boosts the regional economy, and brings more of the solar manufacturing process onto U.S. soil at a moment when global competition is intensifying.

These investments are just one major component of the United States still racing to secure the clean-energy supply chains that will define the future. We already know international competitors—especially China—are moving quickly. Maintaining American energy leadership requires supporting domestic manufacturing, high-quality American jobs, and local clean-energy projects that anchor economic security at home. Expanding this kind of homegrown industrial capacity is how the U.S. ensures the next generation of energy technology is built for, and by, the American people.

The battery energy storage industry is advancing quickly, and real-world projects across the country are showing how these systems can strengthen the grid while saving money for consumers. In Chattanooga, the local municipal utility deployed a 2.5 MW / 10 MWh battery that kept nearly 400 customers powered for half an hour after a distribution line unexpectedly went offline. The incident offered a clear demonstration of how storage can act as a frontline resilience

tool, keeping the lights on even when traditional infrastructure experiences an interruption.

Virginia is experiencing similar momentum. Danville Utilities’ first battery system, a 10.5 MW project developed with Lightshift Energy, has already improved local grid stability and is projected to save residents roughly $40 million over the next two decades. A second Danville project is expected to expand peak-shaving benefits by discharging power during the most expensive hours of the day. Other communities, including Spotsylvania County and Smyth County, are moving forward with their own battery

installations designed to support grid reliability and reduce long-term energy costs.

Taken together, these projects reflect a broader national trend. Battery storage has become a practical and cost-effective tool for improving reliability, managing peak demand, and strengthening America’s overall energy security. Even when a line goes down, storage can help ensure that homes and businesses stay powered.

Local businesses generate sales tax revenue and contribute significantly to property taxes.
Every dollar spent locally is a brick in the foundation of a stronger school system — just ask Calcasieu Superintendent Jason VanMetre.

“When you spend at an independent local business, far more of each dollar stays here and gets re-spent on local wages, local suppliers, and local taxes that fund our schools, roads, and first responders.","When one shops locally, a significant portion of that money stays right here in Southwest Louisiana, creating a powerful ripple effect that benefits everyone — especially the school system.

In the heart of Southwest Louisiana, a thriving local business community and well-funded school system go hand in hand. Local businesses generate sales tax revenue and contribute significantly to property taxes. Calcasieu Parish’s local government, in turn, allocates a large portion of these funds directly to the school district.

Every dollar spent locally is a brick in the foundation of a stronger school system — just ask Calcasieu Superintendent Jason VanMetre.

“The Calcasieu Parish School Board budget is heavily reliant on sales tax revenue,” he said. “As residents of the area shop locally, they directly impact the sales tax revenue that we receive at CPSB.”

VanMetre said without these local revenues, the board “would not be able to provide the services that we do for our students or compensate our employees. Shopping at a local business means something — especially this time of year.”

VanMetre said a healthier, more engaged community — supported by local businesses — does wonders for student well-being and enrollment.

“As our community grows, so do our students and schools,” he said. “We as a school board are a direct reflection of our community. We strive every day to create an environment that grows our students and helps to provide productive citizens for the future of our community. We are continuing to grow and we are proud of that. A healthy community, supported by local residents, means that everyone continues to grow: our businesses, our services that we can provide and our schools.”

Local businesses also contribute to student success through things like internships, mentoring and guest-speaking opportunities.

“We have businesses every day that assist us in growing our students,” VanMetre said. “From mentoring, to tutoring, to speaking on our campuses our local businesses provide a wide range of support for our schools.”

In turn, VanMetre said, the school board has been able to provide assistance to other agencies or businesses through having students assist with volunteer opportunities.

“This builds our students’ character through service and interaction with the public,” he said. “Part of creating a well-rounded student is showing them that they are part of a larger community and that in Calcasieu, that community is vibrant.”

VanMetre said local businesses have been true partners in educating Southwest Louisiana students.

“Our schools are a part of our community,” he said. “This is evident from the number of businesses that have served as Partners in Education, or donate to sports teams, events or other activities. We are so fortunate to have these businesses as true partners in educating our students.”

VanMetre said in some cases, businesses have had relationships with local schools for decades.

“This shows how important the relationship is to, not only the school, but also the business,” he said. “Everyone in Calcasieu wants to work together to ensure that our future is bright. And it definitely is thanks to the wonderful and long-standing relationships we have with our community. I can’t say thank you enough.”

Beyond the school system Cheryl Duhon, Vice President and Senior Financial Advisor of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management on Country Club Road, said multiplier effect of local spending translates into tangible financial benefits for the entire community.

“I see the local multiplier effect every day with the families I serve,” Duhon said. “When you spend at an independent local business, far more of each dollar stays here and gets re-spent on local wages, local suppliers, and local taxes that fund our schools, roads, and first responders. That creates stronger job security, rising property values, and a healthier economy that makes it easier for everyone in our community to grow and protect their wealth right here at home.”

From a wealth management perspective, Duhon said an individual can quantify the return on investment of shopping locally versus potentially saving a few dollars at a major retailer by thinking of it as a total lifetime return instead of just today’s price tag.

“Choosing to spend locally — even if it costs a few dollars more — helps keep jobs and opportunity in our community, which in turn supports home values and the income most families depend on,” she said. “Over time, the benefit of living in a strong, vibrant community almost always outweighs the small savings from shopping at a national chain.”

Supporting business also can align with an individual’s long-term financial goals — such as retirement planning, saving for education, or building an emergency fund.

“Your everyday spending choices have a real impact on your long-term goals,” Duhon said. “When local businesses thrive, our community enjoys greater job stability and rising real estate values, two of the biggest factors that help families stay on track with retirement savings, college funding, and emergency reserves. The clients I work with who intentionally shop local are, in a very real way, helping protect the same future they are planning for.”

Community investing can also be a healthy part of a diversified portfolio.

“One of the most meaningful ways to invest in our community is to work with a local wealth advisor who lives here and truly understands the lives we lead,” Duhon said. “At Merrill here in town, my clienwts get the advantage of global resources paired with the personal attention of someone who is part of this same community. That combination often leads to retirement strategies, legacy plans, and investment portfolios that feel more connected to the goals and values that matter most to them right here at home.”",https://americanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/65/2025/11/Shop-local.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 13:59:34.660754

This policy direction provides clear market expectations and development momentum for European rare earth recycling enterprises.
Rare earth recycling technology continues to advance, evolving from traditional hydrometallurgy toward more efficient and environmentally friendly methods.
Coupled with various variables such as international politics, the rare earth recycling industry may seem distant and elusive.","Against the backdrop of the current US-China rivalry, China's export control policies on rare earths have prompted Western countries to deeply recognize the strategic importance of rare earth elements. To reduce their reliance on China, the West is actively attempting to build a complete rare earth industry chain, from mining to magnet manufacturing. However, the development cycle for rare earth resources is lengthy, and China holds an absolute technological advantage and economies of scale in rare earth mining, separation, and smelting. This makes it extremely difficult for the West to achieve breakthroughs in the industry chain in the short term, unable to meet their urgent immediate needs.

Confronted with this dilemma, Western enterprises and governments are channeling more resources into the field of rare earth recycling, viewing it as a crucial pathway to alleviate short-term supply pressures and enhance supply chain resilience. Several companies have begun deploying strategies to recover rare earth elements from waste materials such as discarded electronic products and industrial magnets, attempting to compensate for the shortfall in raw material supply through a circular economy model.

Recently, recycling companies including the US-based HyProMag, Australia's IonicRE, and Canada's Cyclic Materials have entered into new raw material supply and technical cooperation agreements with industry chain partners, driving the transition of rare earth recycling from pilot projects to commercial scale.

These collaborations cover multiple stages, from scrap collection and technical processing to high-end magnet production, aiming to significantly increase the rare earth recovery rate from the current level of less than 1%.

In June, a US-India joint venture launched a magnet recycling project aimed at improving the efficiency of ReElement chromatographic separation technology. The project is expected to process 2,000 metric tons per year of retired magnets from electric vehicles and wind power equipment, with a projected recovery rate of up to 90%.

In the following months, the rare earth recycling strategy led by US companies gradually became clearer and more established. HyProMag expanded the scope of its raw material agreements to include new sources such as electric motors and wind turbine rotors. The company formed a joint team with electronics recycler ILS to accelerate procurement progress at its Fort Worth, Texas plant. Over its 40-year operational period, the plant plans to recycle 750 metric tons of sintered NdFeB magnets and 807 metric tons of NdFeB by-products annually. HyProMag also plans to expand its operations to Nevada and South Carolina using a hub-and-spoke model, aiming to triple its recycling capacity. Australia's IonicRE has signed an agreement with US Strategic Metals (USSM) to produce rare earth oxides using recycled magnets. IonicRE will provide recycling technology through its UK subsidiary Ionic Technologies to produce Pr-Nd oxide and heavy rare earth elements (dysprosium, terbium, samarium, gadolinium, and holmium) with a purity exceeding 99.5%.

Canada's Cyclic Materials has entered into an exclusive ten-year agreement with German magnet producer VAC to specifically handle magnet production scrap from VAC's new plant in Sumter, South Carolina.

Cyclic Materials expects its recycling process to reduce carbon emissions by 75% compared to raw ore mining. The company is constructing a facility in Mesa, Arizona, with an annual processing capacity of 25,000 mt of scrap magnets, which is expected to commence operations in early 2026. Rare earth supply security has become a strategic priority for the US and European countries.

The EU's Critical Raw Materials Act requires that 15% of the EU's rare earth capacity be achieved through recycling by 2030. This policy direction provides clear market expectations and development momentum for European rare earth recycling enterprises.

The US is actively promoting the development of the rare earth recycling industry, primarily motivated by the desire to reduce dependence on rare earths from a single country, establish a multi-channel rare earth supply landscape, and safeguard the expansion of key industries such as military applications.

A rare earth recycling plant, jointly established by France and Japan in Lacq, France, is expected to produce 800 mt of light rare earths and 600 mt of heavy rare earths annually upon commissioning, accounting for approximately 15% of global production. This output will meet about 20% of Japan's future demand for dysprosium and terbium.

Rare earth recycling technology continues to advance, evolving from traditional hydrometallurgy toward more efficient and environmentally friendly methods. The EU's ""nano-droplet emulsion separation"" technology requires only hundreds of purification steps and achieves 95% selectivity. The HyProMag project, a collaboration between the UK and Germany, uses hydrogen processing technology to recover NdFeB magnets from electronic waste with a purity exceeding 99%. Meanwhile, industrial collaboration models for rare earth recycling are also being innovated.

The cooperation between Cyclic and VAC has established a closed-loop model of ""production-recycling-reproduction."" This partnership not only addresses the issue of scrap treatment but also provides a stable source of raw materials for new magnet production, reducing risks across the entire supply chain. The sustainable procurement requirements for rare earth magnets from end-users such as automakers like General Motors have further driven the development of the recycling industry. VAC's Sumter plant will prioritize supplying magnets for multiple EV models of General Motors over the next decade, and such long-term collaborations ensure demand stability for the recycling industry.

Currently, overseas rare earth recycling, much like mining at the ore end, is still in the early stages of technological research and exploration, with commercial operations still a long way off. Coupled with various variables such as international politics, the rare earth recycling industry may seem distant and elusive. However, as global industrial technology continues to advance, rare earth recycling will gradually move forward.",https://static.metal.com/common.metal.com/images/header-en/smm-logo.png,N,,2025-11-22 13:59:25.251212

The expansion of solar and storage benefits the environment and people's wallets. Homeowners have seen their energy bills cut by up to 60% after installing solar panels.

Aside from personal savings, renewable power projects can reduce dependence on imported fuels and create thousands of good-paying jobs. As more states embrace these clean energy investments, communities are reaping long-term benefits.

Meanwhile, aging coal-fired plants are being retired or canceled in increasing numbers. More than 3.6 GW of planned coal capacity has been delayed or scrapped so far this year, as utility providers turn to cheaper, more efficient solar and wind alternatives.

""Solar and storage are the backbone of America's energy future, delivering the majority of new power to the grid at the lowest cost to families and businesses,"" said Solar Energy Industries Association President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper, per Energies Media.

Solar adoption has already proved to drastically reduce household electricity bills while cutting harmful air pollution. Installing solar panels at home is one of the most effective ways to shrink your monthly energy costs, sometimes down to $0.

EnergySage offers a free, easy-to-use tool that lets homeowners compare quotes from vetted local installers and save up to $10,000 on installation.

Pairing solar with energy-efficient appliances, like heat pumps, can make your home even more affordable to run — and Mitsubishi can help you find the right option for your space.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/IqpDtz9gDf3L66xOLWr.Hw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/d3dfd82d01908f574ce12ac72ae17c0a,N,,2025-11-22 12:01:19.134950

Yet Kia’s executives are striking a different tone than they have for the past few years. At last year’s LA Auto Show, the company was unveiling the new, U.S.-built versions of the EV6 and a high-performance GT trim for the EV9. I thought at the time that a Tesla-style charging plug, eligibility for the federal tax credit and a new U.S. production location would sweeten the deal significantly.

But one year later, the tax credit is gone, the EV9 GT is postponed indefinitely, and the EV6 is, seemingly, the one EV that didn’t set a sales record in the second quarter, even as buyers rushed to claim tax credits. And as a South Korean company, Kia has been vulnerable to new tariffs. The car market is now very different from what it was a year ago.

But Kia’s competency in all three powertrain types means that it can lean into “choice,” executives said.

“We’re not pushing anything. We’re creating the right products that are meeting the customer demands,” Russell Wager, Kia’s vice president of marketing in the U.S., told InsideEVs.

Gallery: 2027 Kia Telluride

It’s a fair and earned brag. The Telluride was a smash hit for the company, breaking through to a wealthy and young audience with a ravenous appetite for three-row SUVs. At the LA Auto Show, Kia revealed a second-generation Telluride with a new hybrid powertrain. It sits well alongside the EV9, which just set its own sales record, and models like the Carnival and K5, which just saw 48% and 85% sales growth, respectively. (All of these numbers are from the third quarter.)

“We just got done with a national dealer meeting in Las Vegas,” Wager said. “We had over 1,700 representatives from our dealers there, and we told them: ‘we are going to give you choices for your customers.’”

Reality Check

This year, then, has been a reality check for Kia, as it has for everyone. With the EV tax credits gone and the Trump administration ending any sort of fuel economy regulations pushing for cleaner cars, a lot is up in the air right now. And that makes Kia’s onetime EV push less of a certainty than before.

“Yeah, I think the EV business has been, I would say, disrupted,” Eric Watson, Kia’s vice president of sales operations for the U.S., said in an interview.

”We had a great start to the year, and then in summer, there was a lot of EV business pulled ahead,” he said, referencing how buyers moved up their purchase timelines to take advantage of tax-credit deals, which expired on Sept. 30.

The Kia EV9 set a sales record in the third quarter.

Since then, the industry “softened,” but Watson says he expects EV sales to bounce back slightly from their October nadir. Sales peaked at around 10% of the market, then dropped to around 4-5% now, he said.

“But in 2026 it'll grow. I think it'll get to six, seven or eight percent of the industry next year,” Watson told me. Even in a best-case scenario, then, we’re probably not going to see 10% penetration anytime in the next year. And as Kia proves better than maybe any other company, it’s not for a lack of trying.

The company was early to launch a compelling compact electric SUV. This segment makes up the meat of the EV market, and Kia arrived with industry-beating charging times, an 800-volt architecture, plenty of range and good pricing. It was an immediate hit. But that was in 2021, in a much less crowded field. Since then, Kia has introduced the fantastic EV9—which nearly clinched our Breakthrough EV Of The Year award in 2024—and promised more affordable options, like the upcoming EV3. (The company hasn’t yet said when that might come to the U.S. market.) Its sibling, the EV4 sedan that was shown off to much fanfare at the New York Auto Show this spring, has been postponed “indefinitely.”

The Kia EV3 is supposed to come to the U.S. at some point in the near future.

But consumers are clamoring for hybrids, and the tax credit is gone. Tariffs are in effect, and steep duties have been biting into Kia’s margins since April. A recent tariff deal with South Korea lessens the pain, but it’s still far more expensive to import EVs than it was a year ago. Then consider that emissions standards are getting rolled back, and that Kia buyers can’t seem to get enough high-trim, high-dollar Tellurides.

All of this adds up to a refocused version of Kia that is aggressively playing the spread. The company is aggressively launching new hybrid versions of its core lineup, while pushing into new markets with upscale EVs like the top-trim EV9.

The Kia EV4 was supposed to come to the U.S., but has been postponed indefinitely.

The only thing it really needs is an affordable electric option, a role that should be filled by the upcoming EV3. But we still don’t know where that’ll be built, how much it’ll cost, how interested consumers will be, or whether we can expect other affordable options to follow.

“Things are changing, right? We're cognizant of the fact that we moved some production here for EV9 and EV6. So that gives us flexibility,” Wager, the marketing boss, said. “We're looking at: Should we bring others to North America?

Wager noted that the company has a “global portfolio” of products, including many EVs that haven’t made it here yet. But the business case for them—and any future EV, for that matter—is unclear in such a noisy, chaotic environment.

“So we're just waiting to see where things shake out a little bit, but we'll add to the lineup,” Wager said. “We’re just figuring out the timing.”

On Wednesday, federal wildlife agencies announced changes to the Endangered Species Act that could make it harder to rescue endangered species from the brink of extinction.
If the Trump administration’s proposals are finalized and upheld in court, they could reshape U.S. environmental policy for years to come, environmental lawyers and activists said.
“This was the week from hell for environmental policy in the United States,” said Pat Parenteau, a professor emeritus and senior fellow for climate policy at Vermont Law and Graduate School.
Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and critic of Mr. Trump, has promised to block any new drilling.","The environmental rollbacks came one after the next this week, potentially affecting everything from the survival of rare whales to the health of the Hudson River.

On Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed to strip federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams, narrowing the reach of the Clean Water Act.

On Wednesday, federal wildlife agencies announced changes to the Endangered Species Act that could make it harder to rescue endangered species from the brink of extinction.

And on Thursday, the Interior Department moved to allow new oil and gas drilling across nearly 1.3 billion acres of U.S. coastal waters, including a remote region in the high Arctic where drilling has never before taken place.

If the Trump administration’s proposals are finalized and upheld in court, they could reshape U.S. environmental policy for years to come, environmental lawyers and activists said.

“This was the week from hell for environmental policy in the United States,” said Pat Parenteau, a professor emeritus and senior fellow for climate policy at Vermont Law and Graduate School. “Unless stopped by the courts, each of these proposed rollbacks will do irreparable harm to the nation’s water quality, endangered species and marine ecosystems.”

The quick pace of these proposals was notable, even for an administration that has enacted Mr. Trump’s agenda at breakneck speed.

While the administration was working in Washington to dismantle environmental protections, 3,300 miles to the south, negotiators from nearly 200 nations were trying to improve the planet’s health at the United Nations climate summit in Brazil.

“The Trump administration unveiled many historic announcements this week to further President Trump’s American energy dominance agenda,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in an email. “President Trump serves the American people, not radical climate activists who have fallen victim to the biggest scam of the century.”

A range of industries supported the changes, including groups representing farmers, oil drillers, chemical manufacturers, home builders and real estate developers.

“The developments this week were definitely major steps toward the administration’s goal of achieving and restoring American energy dominance and manufacturing dominance as well,” said Chris Phalen, vice president of domestic policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group. “We’re definitely very pleased with what came out.”

The E.P.A. kicked off the wave of deregulation on Monday, when it proposed to significantly scale back the Clean Water Act, which Congress passed in 1972 to protect all “waters of the United States” from pollution or destruction.

The agency said it would more narrowly define “waters of the United States” to exclude many wetlands and streams across the country. The changes could strip federal protections from up to 55 million acres of wetlands, or about 85 percent of all wetlands nationwide, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.

Senator Cynthia Lummis, Republican of Wyoming, said the changes would prevent people with the smallest of waterways on their properties from needing to obtain federal permits if they wanted to fill them in or dump pollutants. “Farmers, ranchers and landowners shouldn’t have every puddle or gully regulated by D.C. bureaucrats,” she said in a statement.

The deregulatory spree picked up on Wednesday, when the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service announced changes to the way the Endangered Species Act, the bedrock environmental law intended to prevent animal and plant extinctions, is applied.

The proposals would allow the government to assess economic factors, such as lost revenue from a ban on oil drilling near critical habitat, before deciding whether to list a species as endangered. At the moment, the government considers only the best available science when awarding that designation, which triggers protections against killing or harming the species and interfering with its habitat.

It was easy to miss the announcement about endangered species, which came on the same day that Mr. Trump signed legislation calling on the Justice Department to make public its files on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

But the move was worth attention, said Andrew Mergen, an environmental law professor at Harvard Law School.

“It’s really hard for the public to keep track of this news, but it’s really important that they do,” Mr. Mergen said. “We’re going to lose species and their habitats in a death-by-a-thousand-cuts way, but there are things that can be done to right the ship and help these species recover.”

On Thursday, as the news cycle was dominated by Mr. Trump’s insult of a journalist, the Interior Department announced a plan to hold as many as 34 sales of leases in federal waters spanning roughly 1.27 billion acres, an area more than half the size of the United States.

The plan would require six sales of leases off the coast of California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and critic of Mr. Trump, has promised to block any new drilling. It also would mandate seven auctions of leases in the Gulf of Mexico, which Mr. Trump calls the Gulf of America, and 21 auctions of leases off the coast of Alaska, including in an isolated region called the high Arctic stretching more than 200 miles offshore.

Instead, oil industry interest could be concentrated in the Gulf, where drilling rigs are already plentiful. “The Gulf has the infrastructure, work force and expertise that make it uniquely productive,” said Erik Milito, the president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a trade group that represents offshore drilling companies as well as offshore wind firms.

Yet the critically endangered Rice’s whale lives only in the Gulf, and scientists worry that drilling there could drive the species to extinction. The 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, which killed 11 people and spilled millions of gallons of oil, caused the Rice’s whale population to decline by an estimated 22 percent. Fewer than 100 of the animals are thought to remain.

“For Rice’s whales, drilling and blasting for oil and gas is truly an existential threat,” said Michael Jasny, who oversees marine mammal protection at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

When blocking offshore wind farms, Mr. Trump has repeatedly invoked the welfare of whales, claiming that “wind mills are driving the whales crazy.” There is no scientific evidence to support this claim, and in fact, the noisy seismic surveys used in oil and gas exploration can stress whales to the point of harming their health, said Regina Asmutis-Silvia, the executive director for North America at Whale and Dolphin Conservation, a wildlife charity.

Ultimately, it could take the administration up to two years to finalize the proposals unveiled this week. At that point, environmental groups and other opponents could challenge the rules in court, leading to lengthy legal battles.

But Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, told reporters on Monday that his goal was to write regulations that would be “durable and withstand future swings of presidential elections to come.” He also suggested that 2025 would set a record in terms of environmental rollbacks.

“It’s possible that at least half of the president’s deregulatory agenda is at our agency, at E.P.A.,” Mr. Zeldin told the conservative entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David on Thursday on the “The PBD Podcast.” “We will do more deregulation in one year than entire federal governments in the past have done across all federal agencies combined.”

To try to reach compliance, Colorado mandated emissions-reduction rules on sectors from oil-and-gas to industrial facilities to commercial buildings in recent years, and gas stations in the nonattainment area began selling higher-priced reformulated gas last summer.
VOC emissions have fallen from 491.2 tons per day to 236.5, and NOx emissions dropped from 275.5 tons per day to 142.7.
What’s in the State Implementation Plan Instead, they updated the SIP by taking several emissions-cutting steps that were agreed to by all parties.
“This rulemaking is not designed to get Colorado into compliance,” lamented Lindsay Ex, policy director for Colorado Communities for Climate Action.","Seeing no pathway to reach compliance with federal ozone standards by 2027, Colorado regulators voluntarily downgraded the state’s status with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Friday — a move that will buy them more time to try and reduce air pollution.

In doing so, however, the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission resisted efforts from the business community to seek a federal designation that would have eased some restrictions, as well as efforts from environmentalists to add regulations on oil and gas. And while the final State Implementation Plan that the AQCC passed unanimously is hardly a stay-the-course roadmap — it seeks to reduce ozone precursors from drilling wells 50% by 2030 — it also acknowledged improvements that have come from existing regulations.

“Maybe we haven’t made as much progress as we’d like,” commissioner Curtis Rueter said shortly before passage of the updated SIP. “But at the same time, we’ve made some tremendous progress on several fronts.”

A large swath of the Front Range has been out of compliance since 2012 with EPA standards requiring ozone concentrations below 75 parts per billion, and a larger section extending to the Wyoming border is noncompliant with a new 70-parts-per-billion standard. To try to reach compliance, Colorado mandated emissions-reduction rules on sectors from oil-and-gas to industrial facilities to commercial buildings in recent years, and gas stations in the nonattainment area began selling higher-priced reformulated gas last summer.

Ozone precursors falling

The strategies have produced some success stories. Emissions of nitrous oxide and volatile organic compounds — the precursors to ozone — are down nearly 50% since 2011, explained Jessica Ferko, planning and policy program manager for the Colorado Air Pollution Control Division. VOC emissions have fallen from 491.2 tons per day to 236.5, and NOx emissions dropped from 275.5 tons per day to 142.7.

But ozone levels remain stubbornly close to 77 parts per billion, leading to health problems including pulmonary conditions and exacerbation of afflictions like asthma, explained Mike Silverstein, executive director of the Regional Air Quality Control Council. Though locally man-made ozone represents the minority of those parts, with most of the pollution coming from national and international sources or from natural causes like wildfires, Colorado still must work to reduce emissions from drills, cars and a lot of other sources.

With no viable path to cut ozone enough to avoid the whole northern Front Range being downgraded from serious to severe noncompliance by 2027, APCD officials chose instead to voluntarily downgrade the state, delaying its next compliance requirements until 2032. This will allow emissions-reduction strategies to fully mature and show more impact, Ferko told the AQCC during a two-day hearing, and it removes the need for the state to do extensive modeling immediately and propose unrealistic compliance pathways.

Several groups, including the Colorado Chamber of Commerce and Colorado Oil & Gas Association, urged the state to file a 179B designation seeking exemption from downgrade by arguing the Front Range would be in compliance if not for international emissions. Ferko agreed to brief the AQCC more on that potential process at a future date, but commissioners said they didn’t have enough information yet to take that step forward.

What’s in the State Implementation Plan

Instead, they updated the SIP by taking several emissions-cutting steps that were agreed to by all parties. Those included new regulations on certain aerospace coatings and the continuation through 2030 of a two-year-old NOx emissions-intensity-reduction program that is set to cut emissions of those compounds 50% by 2030 as compared to 2017 levels.

The Local Government Coalition — a 47-member organization representing areas like Adams, Boulder and Broomfield counties — asked the AQCC to go further and set mass-based limits on upstream oil-and-gas emissions, essentially capping production. This was needed, officials from that group said, because if oil and gas production grows in the next five years, it could boost rather than reduce the amount of emissions from that sector if drillers are required only to lower their emissions intensity.

“This rulemaking is not designed to get Colorado into compliance,” lamented Lindsay Ex, policy director for Colorado Communities for Climate Action. “More solutions and more strategies are needed.”

Ferko argued, however, that the reduction in NOx and VOCs shows that the emissions-intensity cutbacks are leading to overall emissions reductions and that mass-based limits would neither be helpful nor easily enforceable. If the sector did not reach its limit, she asked, who exactly would be responsible for making further mandatory cuts?

“The emissions inventory has been vetted by a lot of people. I’m confident it will result in mass reductions as well,” said commissioner Gregg Thomas before AQCC members voted unanimously against the LGC’s request.

A debate over minor modifications

Beyond that issue, there were a few specific provisions in the SIP that triggered significant debate during the hearing.

APCD staffers, for example, wanted to change the current permitting process for minor modifications — facility upgrades at major-emitter sites that are designed to allow greater production and could result in small increases of NOx or VOC emissions. Companies applying for minor-modification permits now can proceed with work immediately under state rules, but division leaders wanted to require that some of these projects instead go through a period of public notice and public comment.

Leah Martland, supervisor for APCD’s planning and policy regulatory team, noted that the division signed an informal agreement with the EPA in January to get more public comment on minor modification procedures. And commissioner Jana Milford said she believed it was important to take that step to show that the AQCC wants to hear input from communities like Commerce City that are near high-emitting industrial sites and be transparent about what regulators are allowing.

Colorado Chamber regulatory affairs advisor Dave Kulmann argued, however, that requiring even minor changes to go through the division’s lengthy, backlogged construction-permitting process could turn a four-month project into one that takes two years. And Carlos Romo, an attorney representing the Colorado Petroleum Association, said the change would make Colorado the first state to require public notice for minor modifications — all because of a non-binding resolution with the EPA.

“This is one of the few instances where we actually have a semi-streamlined permitting process in the division. Please don’t take that away,” Kulmann pled with commissioners before they voted 6-3 not to change the minor-modification process.

Emissions reduction credits

Commissioners OK’d an APCD plan to modernize the issuance of emissions reduction credits, a currently rarely-used process in which emitters can take voluntary actions like shutting down a producing well and get credits to help them meet their emissions limits. And they agreed to not foreclose the potential of offering those credits for mobile-source emissions cuts for actions like vehicle electrification in the future if those sources are ever subject to review permitting — an action that frustrated some environmentalists.

However, the commission did not go as far as groups like COGA and the American Petroleum Institute Colorado had asked them to in directing that actions like well shutdowns be awarded such credits automatically. Martland argued successfully that the credits must be considered on a case-by-case basis and can’t be given automatically if a company were to shut down one well while increasing emissions from other equipment.

Commissioners avoided having much discussion on the Blueprint submitted by the RAQC that recommends consideration of a host of future regulations or best practices on a wide range of sectors in order to achieve greater emissions reductions. The document garnered attention particularly for its suggestions to consider regulations on indirect sources of emissions that attract significant vehicle traffic, from airports to warehouses to sporting arenas, by trying to limit the traffic of gas-powered vehicles to them.

More suggestions for reducing ozone to come

While the LGC emphasized that it endorsed all the suggestions in the Blueprint, Silverstein said his group was submitting the proposal not for inclusion in the SIP but to spur ideas about further ways that the AQCC could look to get to compliance. He asked only that the RAQC be allowed to come back and brief the commission on potential benefits to the strategies as it undertook further study on their efficacy.

“Our job is to send you plans to reach attainment with federal standards,” said Dan Kramer, the Estes Park town attorney who chairs the RAQC board. “Some of what we propose may be expensive to implement, but there is nothing we don’t expect to pay off, especially in the health of our communities.”

While business leaders generally expressed satisfaction with the updated SIP — attorneys for COGA and API noted particularly how they support the approved plan to reduce NOx and VOC emissions further by 2030 — AQCC members expressed mixed feelings.

Will updates help public health?

Milford, for example, voiced disappointment that the state must take a compliance downgrade and defer federal judgment on its emissions-cutting efforts until 2032. But she, like APCD officials, said that the state can’t take its foot off the gas and must look for emissions reductions that will have more substantial impacts on air quality.

“In the end, what we’re doing is we spend a lot of time with these procedures, and really, we very seldom use the word ‘public health,’” commissioner Jon Slutsky said. “I wish we could do it a little sooner.”

But Chris Colclasure, a COGA attorney, emphasized any high-cost regulations imposed by the AQCC that couldn’t account for substantial-enough reductions to reach compliance would only impose burdens on Colorado businesses without producing progress. And he pointed to the substantial NOx and VOC cuts the state already has made and said that feasible steps will continue to reduce that pollution, even if cutting ozone is harder — a sentiment that seemed to land with at least one commissioner.

“We’ve made some great progress as a region in terms of precursors. The fact that ozone response is not there is very frustrating,” Thomas said.",https://tsscolorado.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Natural-gas-wells-Parachute-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 11:05:12.536765

The station is located in Land O’ Lakes, Florida (see map here), and belongs to Suncoast Charging, an entirely new player in the EV charging landscape. There are eight Supercharging stalls at the site (up to 325 kW), available 24/7 to all EVs at a rate of $0.45/kWh as of the posting of this article. According to Suncoast Charging, all major payment methods are accepted, and there are multiple amenities nearby.

Suncoast Charging-branded V4 Supercharging dispensers are equipped with NACS (SAE J3400) plugs and a built-in NACS-to-CCS1 adapter (aka Magic Dock), supporting CCS1-compatible EVs as well.

Another Suncoast Charging Supercharging location is planned at Wesley Chapel, Florida (in Q1 2026). This location will have four stalls.

We don’t know the company’s long-term plans, but it gives the impression that it intends to build a charging network, so we should see more stations deployed in the future. The sites can be found in the Tesla app (or navigation) as well as “through other in-car navigation apps like Google Maps, PlugShare, and many others”.

Tesla Supercharger for Business

The “Supercharger for Business” program is an interesting proposition for third-party businesses. It enables the deployment of DC fast-charging infrastructure without worrying about hardware, software (including updates), maintenance, or station visibility in navigation systems. Tesla takes care of everything (at an undisclosed cost), while the independent owner retains complete control over the site (including branding the dispensers, pricing, etc.). We described the details for that here.

Large charging networks can develop an entire system in-house, but smaller companies with one or several sites cannot. We guess that thousands of smaller businesses are Tesla’s main target, as it scales up its charger business and the Supercharging network.",https://evchargingstations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/G6Nd2xEacAQWAiM.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 16:00:01.692748

This bloc includes Saudi Arabia, Russia and other petrostates, and some countries dependent on using fossil fuels.
If so, it will bitterly disappoint those calling for stronger language on fossil fuels and the need to limit global temperatures.
Failure to reach an agreement on a roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels would not only be a big win for petrostates, but also for Trump and his hard-right allies.
“The Pacific came to Cop30 demanding a survival roadmap away from fossil fuels.","Climate crisis talks look likely to stretch well into the weekend in Brazil, with countries still far apart on the crucial issues of phasing out fossil fuels and cutting carbon.

The Cop30 president, André Corrêa do Lago, urged ministers and high-ranking officials from more than 190 countries to find common ground: “We need to preserve this regime [of the Paris climate agreement] with the spirit of cooperation, not in the spirit of who is going to win or is willing to lose’” he said. “Because we know if we don’t strengthen this, everyone will lose.”

No agreement looked likely, however, on the core issue of a “transition away from fossil fuels”, with the conference split into two large blocs.

More than 80 developed and developing countries have called for the process of drawing up a roadmap for the transition to begin, which would allow all governments to pursue self-chosen measures and timetables towards the eventual goal.

Even this – derided by some civil society groups as too weak – was unacceptable to a separate group of more than 80 countries, according to Corrêa do Lago. This bloc includes Saudi Arabia, Russia and other petrostates, and some countries dependent on using fossil fuels. References to a roadmap were excised from a draft text published early on Friday morning at their insistence.

Corrêa do Lago told the Guardian on Friday: “This issue has grown in importance. But more than 80 countries have said it is a non-starter. My president has said it is a priority. But we will see, as many countries have clearly said that they do not want this at the moment.”

A fresh draft text was expected late on Friday night or early on Saturday morning in Brazil, but several people involved in the talks said it might have only minor tweaks.

If so, it will bitterly disappoint those calling for stronger language on fossil fuels and the need to limit global temperatures. One developed country said: “The Brazilians are only listening to the Arab group.”

Brazil convened ministerial discussions among all of the major regional and interest groups at the talks on Friday afternoon, as well as holding meetings with individual countries after a morning plenary meeting with all countries was inconclusive.

The European commissioner for climate, Wopke Hoekstra, said the deal on offer was so inadequate that countries may leave with no agreement.

“What is now on the table is unacceptable,” he said. “And given that we’re so far away from where we should be, it’s unfortunate to say, but we’re really facing a no-deal scenario.”

Bas Eickhout, a member of the European parliament’s delegation to Cop30, said: “With this text as it stands, no deal is better than a bad deal. Failure to reach an agreement on a roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels would not only be a big win for petrostates, but also for Trump and his hard-right allies.

“No one can seriously expect us to win the fight on the climate crisis if we don’t deal with the elephant in the room: phasing out fossil fuels.”

In a sign of the slow pace of progress, Colombia and the Netherlands announced they would hold a separate but complementary conference on the transition away from fossil fuels for high-ambition countries next year.

“We have taken this step because, simply, we cannot wait any longer,” said Tuvalu’s environment minister, Maina Talia. “The Pacific came to Cop30 demanding a survival roadmap away from fossil fuels. Yet this text does not even name the threat to our existence. This process is failing us so we will not wait.”

The climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, Tina Stege, said: “As a nation that is just two metres above sea level we know that climate action cannot wait. This roadmap is inevitable, it’s happening.”

The Guardian understands from various countries’ delegates that China is not among the countries blocking a roadmap, while India has taken a harder line by insisting developed countries bear responsibility for past greenhouse gas emissions.

A few developing countries with fossil fuel interests, including Nigeria and Sierra Leone, have backed a potential roadmap.

Also at stake is the question of how countries respond to the fact that current national climate plans, known as nationally determined contributions, would lead to about 2.5C of heating above preindustrial levels, far above the 1.5C limit target set by the Paris agreement.

One delegate from the Alliance of Small Island States said issue was critical to vulnerable countries, but the draft text contained only options to continue talking about the large gap between countries’ targets and the carbon cuts necessary to stay within 1.5C or as close to it as is now possible.

Some civil society groups blamed the rich world for creating the impasse at the talks by failing to provide enough finance to help poor countries facing climate breakdown.

Cop veteran Harjeet Singh of the Satat Sampada Climate Foundation, said: “If the current draft text is accepted here in Belém, Cop30 will go down in history as the deadliest talkshow ever produced.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c9e47eb849f204246c942c31197ececc939b841/73_0_6873_5498/master/6873.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a23cbc16c0943870e741b7668aa6757b",N,,2025-11-22 13:59:07.849511

Tesla Inc. introduced new versions of its top-selling models priced at under $40,000, making its main vehicles more affordable to counteract the loss of US incentives for electric cars.

The new standard versions of the Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle start at $36,990 and $39,990, Tesla’s website shows. Those starting prices are about 13% and 11% cheaper, respectively, than premium longer-range versions of each model.

Tesla has been building anticipation for more affordable vehicles since early last year, when some investors and company insiders were alarmed by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s decision to de-emphasize a roughly $25,000 model. The CEO has instead prioritized efforts to develop self-driving technology and humanoid robots.

“The cars are increasingly just the cash engine for Tesla’s real pivot: autonomy and robotics,” said Shay Boloor, chief market strategist at Futurum Equities.

Executives said during Tesla’s most recent earnings call that while the company started building a more affordable model in June, they opted to put off production until after the US phased out up to $7,500 federal tax credits. Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja cautioned that output will ramp up slower than initially anticipated.

Tesla’s new models offer less battery range and are stripped of features including ambient interior lighting and a second-row screen.

While Tesla is coming off a record quarter of vehicle deliveries, its global sales have fallen around 6% year-to-date. Demand for EVs in its largest market is expected to drop off after the US eliminated incentives.

Analysts at BloombergNEF expect US sales of battery-electric and plug-in hybrid models to drop to around 332,000 vehicles in the final three months of the year, from almost 500,000 units in the third quarter.

“The stock baked in too much excitement for this as a driver of sales,” Dave Mazza, chief executive officer of Roundhill Financial, said of Tesla’s new Model Y. “Days like this remind investors the headwinds their core business faces, regardless of the longer-term dream premium that drives the stock.”

The offer follows a groundswell of criticism about the discretionary power, including from the author of the review that inspired the new laws, Graeme Samuel, and the former treasury secretary Ken Henry.

The concession alone may not be enough to win over the Greens, who demand protections for native forests and consideration of the climate impacts of projects in exchange for backing the proposed overhaul of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act.

With the government desperate to pass the laws in parliament’s final sitting of the year, the environment minister, Murray Watt, is locked in negotiations with the Greens and the Coalition in the hope of landing a deal next week.

Neither side supports the bill in its current form, putting the onus on Labor to cough up concessions if it wants to avoid the long-awaited reform collapsing for the second time in 12 months.

A senior government source confirmed to Guardian Australia that, under a potential deal with the Greens, it would rewrite the proposed “national interest” test to prevent it being used to approve fossil fuel projects.

Critical minerals projects could still be approved.

Under the provision, which Samuel initially supported in his 2020 review of the EPBC Act as a “rare exception”, the minister would be able to ignore environmental standards and greenlight a project if it was deemed in the “national interest”.

While Watt has stressed the provision was intended for projects related to defence, national security and emergencies, the level of discretion written into the legislation has left him unable to rule out the possibility of exemptions for coal and gas.

The Labor MP Ed Husic previously warned a future Coalition minister could misuse the power while Henry and Samuel both predicted a “conga line” of developers would lobby for special carveouts.

Labor’s grassroots environmental action group also called for the power to be axed or at least subject to parliamentary oversight.

As of Friday afternoon, the Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, and the shadow environment minister, Angie Bell, were still waiting for Labor’s options for a potential deal.

The amendments would need to be put forward in coming days to give both sides time to get a deal through their respective party rooms early next week.

The EPBC bills are listed for debate in the Senate on Wednesday. Parliament rises for the year on Thursday.

Hanson-Young on Friday reiterated that the Greens wouldn’t support the legislation without extra protections for forests and the climate.

Labor cast the Greens as perpetual “blockers” in the previous term of parliament, but Hanson-Young said the party wasn’t feeling pressure to cave to the government’s demands.

“What plays on my mind is not allowing this government off the hook when they’re pushing for laws that will fast-track coal and gas,” she said.

Ahead of Friday’s hearings, an alliance of major environment groups, including the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Wilderness Society and the legal firm Environmental Justice Australia, urged major changes to a bill that it warned “[does] not protect nature”.

Among its suggested changes, the alliance called for the removal of new discretionary powers for the minister, the closing of loopholes for native forest logging, better engagement with First Nations communities, scrapping or limiting a proposed “restoration contributions” fund, consideration of climate impacts and reversing the decision to delegate decisions under the so-called “water trigger” to the states.

The alliance also wants the federal EPA to be the main decision-maker on projects, with the minister only allowed to intervene in “exceptional circumstances”.

Under the government’s model, which critics note is not genuinely independent, the minister would either make decisions or delegate that responsibility to an EPA official.

“We call on the Labor government to substantially improve the bills and negotiate in good faith with members of the Senate that care about nature and a vibrant, healthy Australia,” the groups said.

At Thursday’s round of inquiry hearings, the celebrated environmentalist and former Greens leader Bob Brown said the laws were an “insult to the environmental conscience of Australians”.

He said the absence of a requirement for decision-makers to consider a project’s greenhouse gas emissions – known colloquially as a “climate trigger” – was analogous to stripping a treasurer of powers over taxation.

“And I say that must be taken seriously, because that’s how the situation is,” he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78b5515bfd483d36ad19323b2846b05721d5dec5/0_249_5051_4041/master/5051.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7bd9785ad60e26efe6dc36cab6c325d6",N,,2025-11-22 13:00:23.803215

A draft text for a deal for this year's UN climate summit, released before dawn on Friday, contained no reference to fossil fuels, dropping entirely a range of options on the subject that had been included in an earlier version.

The issue has been one of the most contentious at the two-week conference of nearly 200 governments in Brazil's Amazon city of Belem.

A group of more than 30 nations sent a letter to the COP30 presidency late on Thursday saying they could not accept a deal that failed to include a commitment to develop a roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels.

That has set the stage for a showdown in the final hours of the conference, which is scheduled to end at 6 p.m. local time (4 p.m. ET). Previous COP summits have blown past their deadlines before eventually reaching a compromise.

""We are disappointed with the text currently on the table,"" EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said in a statement, adding it lacked ambition on action to cut emissions.

Countries are set to air their thoughts on the draft in a public plenary session starting around 8 a.m. ET. The deal text, which is still subject to further negotiation, would need approval by consensus in order to be adopted.

Arguments over fossil fuel roadmap

For days, nations have wrangled over the future of fossil fuels, whose burning emits greenhouse gases that are by far the largest contributor to global warming.

Dozens of nations have been pushing hard for a ""roadmap"" laying out how countries should follow through with a promise made at COP28 two years ago to move away from fossil fuels.

Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing nations are opposing this, negotiators at COP30 told Reuters. The Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

A negotiator from one developing country told Reuters its government did not oppose a fossil fuel phase-out and was open to negotiating, but was concerned the draft text offered little to address their concerns on other issues, including finance.

""You can't keep saying that things that matter to us are no longer important and that things that matter to the developed countries are the only things that are important,"" the negotiator said.

The letter from those supporting a roadmap — who include Colombia, France, Germany, Kenya, the Marshall Islands, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain and Britain — said the draft deal, in its current form, ""does not meet the minimum conditions required for a credible COP outcome.""

""We cannot support an outcome that does not include a roadmap for implementing a just, orderly, and equitable transition away from fossil fuels,"" the letter said.

Canada did not sign the letter, Environment and Climate Change Canada confirmed to CBC News Friday.

In an emailed statement, an ECCC spokesperson said, ""Canada remains fully committed to advancing global climate action and supporting a transition away from fossil fuels in ways that respect national priorities and circumstances.""

The statement said Canada's representatives are focused on ""practical"" outcomes ""consistent with the direction we are taking at home.""

Climate finance, trade debated

The draft called for global efforts to triple the financing available to help nations adapt to climate change by 2030, from 2025 levels.

However, it did not specify whether this money would be provided directly by wealthy nations, or other sources, including development banks or the private sector.

That may disappoint poorer nations who want stronger guarantees that public money will be spent on this area.

Investments in adaptation — such as improving infrastructure to cope with extreme heat, or reinforcing buildings against worsening storms — are often vital for saving lives but offer little financial return, making it difficult for such investments to attract private finance.

The draft deal would also launch a dialogue at upcoming COP climate summits on trade, involving governments and other actors including the World Trade Organization.

That would be a win for countries including China who have long demanded that trade concerns be part of the world's climate summit.

But it may be uncomfortable for the European Union, as demands for such discussions have often focused on the EU carbon border levy. South Africa and India have criticized the levy and argued for it to be scrapped.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/46e36dbf-ab09-4dd0-9c42-fb61fd83c2e7,1763731732389/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C202%2C3879%2C2181%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-11-22 11:04:32.942636

The project began in October and the Scania 30 G 4×2 vehicle will travel from Cajamar to Taubaté, in São Paulo, Amazon’s main freight corridor in Brazil, for six months.

Exploring electric alternatives for long routes

The truck is recharged at Amazon’s logistics warehouse in Sort Centre CGH7 and goes to the carrier partner, To Do Green base. The route was officially announced as part of a wider unveiling of the Laneshift e-Dutra Alliance on at Cop in Belém, in which electric trucks will run along the Presidente Dutra Highway between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

Saori Yano, head of sustainability for operations, Brazil at Amazon, said that throughout the six-month trial, the vehicle’s entire route and energy consumption/efficiency will be precisely monitored by telemetry to evaluate success metrics.

“Longer journeys are our biggest challenge, and this is where the impact of decarbonisation is most significant”

“We want to demonstrate that electrification isn’t confined to urban logistics; it is a viable and efficient solution for heavy-load, long-distance freight transport,” she said. “This is a decisive step in accelerating the transition to low-emission freight movement and advancing our global decarbonisation goal.”

For Cristina Argudo, C40’s deputy regional director in Latin America, this trial represents an important step toward exploring electric alternatives on long routes in the country, where road transport moves 65 per cent of cargo and generates 11 per cent of emissions, according to data from the Coalition for Decarbonising Transportation. “This test is not just about a truck; it’s about proving the technology in real-world conditions, inspiring investment in charging networks, and showing that it is possible to decarbonize transportation.”

The truck will transport various cargoes managed by DHL Supply Chain, and the test results will be essential for assessing the viability of completely sustainable long-distance transport, which is an important milestone for encouraging companies, investors, and governments.

“Longer journeys are our biggest challenge, and this is where the impact of decarbonisation is most significant. Therefore, by putting this truck on the road, we are redefining the future of logistics in Brazil and beginning the implementation of the green transport corridor,” celebrates João Meneghetti, sustainability director for Latin America at DHL Supply Chain.

This is Scania’s first 100 per cent electric tractor truck in Brazil and is aimed at transporters seeking to meet decarbonisation goals. The vehicle has a range of 250km, 300kW of power (410 hp), and the technical capacity is 66 tons in gross combination weight rating (GCWR).

“Scania has a very clear purpose: to lead the shift towards a more sustainable transport system,” said Alex Nucci, solutions sales director at Scania Commercial Operations Brazil.

“The electrification of trucks is a journey that is only just beginning, and we know the country still faces significant infrastructure challenges. That’s why partnerships with major global players such as Amazon and DHL are true milestones, not only for pointing out concrete paths to the future, but also for generating valuable learnings for the entire transport ecosystem.

“Sustainability must balance environmental, economic, and social pillars. Our role is to offer solutions that make sense within Brazil’s logistics and energy reality. Today, this means working with transition fuels such as natural gas, biomethane, and biodiesel, but electrification is the natural evolution of this movement. It represents transport free from CO₂ and greenhouse gas emissions, and that’s the direction we’re moving towards with determination.”

“We want to demonstrate that electrification isn’t confined to urban logistics; it is a viable and efficient solution for heavy-load, long-distance freight transport”

As part of the pilot project, the Scania 30 G 4×2 will travel along the Presidente Dutra Highway, one of the busiest routes in the country, where the Laneshift E-Dutra project is being developed. This project aims to implement Brazil’s first 100 per cent electric freight transport corridor, with charging hubs installed along the highway connecting São Paulo to Rio de Janeiro.

The project is a partnership between Volkswagen, Smart Freight Centre, Calstart, and C40 Cities, and is already in the testing phase. In September, a pilot trip was made between Resende (RJ) and Sorocaba (SP), covering approximately 800km, with an 11-ton Volkswagen e-Delivery truck.

The route, which included stops at strategic charging points along the highway, demonstrated the operational feasibility of the technology and allowed important data to be gathered on range, charging time, and infrastructure conditions. Currently, the corridor already has plans for fast charging stations at key locations, such as Graal and PIT São José dos Campos stations, with chargers with an average power of 120kW.",https://scwcontent.affino.com/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/056/Presidente_Dutra_Highway_Rio_smart_cities_Adobe1_rt.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 13:00:29.597289

The question now is whether cultural identity can keep outweighing material loss — or whether the second trade war will signal a deeper political shift.
If the first Trump trade war tested farmers’ wallets, this one tests their faith — and faith, once shaken, is far harder to restore.","Few political alliances in recent American history have seemed as solid as the one between Donald Trump and the country’s farmers. Through three elections, farmers stood by Trump even as tariffs, trade wars and labor shortages squeezed profits.

But Trump’s second term may be different.

A new round of administration policies now cuts deeper into farmers’ livelihoods — not just squeezing profits but reshaping how farms survive — through renewed tariffs on agricultural products, visa restrictions on farm workers, reduced farm subsidies and open favoritism toward South American agricultural competitors.

In the past, farmers’ loyalty to Trump has overridden economics. In our study of the 2018-19 trade war between the U.S. and China, we found that farmers in Trump-voting counties kept planting soybeans even though the trade war’s effects were clear: Their costs would rise and their profits would fall. Farmers in Democratic-leaning counties, by contrast, shifted acreage toward alternatives such as corn or wheat that were likely to be more profitable. For many pro-Trump farmers, political belief outweighed market logic — at least in the short term.

Today, the economic effects of policies affecting farmers are broader and deeper — and the resolve that carried farmers’ support for Trump through the first trade war may no longer be enough.

Tariffs: The familiar pain returns

The revived U.S.-China trade conflict has again placed soybeans at its center. In March 2025, Beijing suspended import licenses for several major U.S. soybean exporters following new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump countered with a new round of reciprocal tariffs, broadening the list of Chinese imports hit and raising rates on already targeted goods.

An October 2025 deal promised China would buy 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans a year, but relief has proved mostly symbolic.

Before the 2018-19 trade war, China regularly imported 30 million to 36 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans annually — more than one-third of all American soybean exports. Now, Beijing has signed long-term contracts with Brazil and Argentina, leaving U.S. producers with shrinking overseas demand for their crops.

Prices remain roughly 40% to 50% below pre-2018 levels, and farmers are storing record volumes of unsold soybeans.

In 2019, the federal government cushioned those losses with over $23 billion in bailout payments to farmers. This time, Republican leaders show little appetite for another bailout. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s funds for farm relief are running low, leaving farmers with lower prices and less support.

Labor: Fewer hands, higher costs

Farms are also short of workers. Roughly 42% of U.S. crop workers lack legal status, according to the National Agricultural Workers Survey. Tougher immigration enforcement and slower visa processing have thinned the labor pool just as production costs are surging. Hired-labor expenses rose 14.4% from 2021 to 2022 and another 15.2% the following year, and costs such as fertilizer, equipment and parts climbed sharply.

Many growers are turning to the H-2A guest worker program — a legal pipeline for seasonal foreign labor that has quadrupled in size over the past decade. But it is expensive: Farms must pay the adverse effect wage rate, a federally set pay rate that is more than twice the regular federal minimum wage. And farms must provide every H-2A worker with free housing and free transportation to and from the U.S., as well as from their housing to the worksite. Large agribusinesses can absorb those costs; small family farms often cannot.

As exports collapsed in late September 2025, the head of the American Soybean Association wrote a public letter to the White House begging for help, saying, “We’ve had your back. We need you to have ours now.” The hard-line immigration policy approach that rallies rural voters is also pushing smaller farms to the brink — forcing them to ask what their loyalty still buys.

Subsidies and symbolism: The Argentina shock

The question of the value of farmers’ loyalty sharpened in the fall of 2025 when the U.S. Treasury approved a $20 billion currency-swap deal with Argentina — supporting the country’s president, Javier Milei, a political ally of Trump, while the country remains a direct agricultural competitor.

U.S. farmers, already frustrated by low prices and visa delays, took it as an insult. Argentina is among the world’s largest soybean exporters, and U.S. farm groups asked why the federal government would underwrite a competitor while trimming support for American producers at home.

The tension deepened when Trump floated the idea of buying Argentinian beef for U.S. markets — a remark one Kansas rancher called “an absolute betrayal.” The plan may be economically minor, but symbolically it pierced the “America First” narrative that had helped hold the farm vote together.

Clean energy: The new rural subsidy under threat

For decades, the farm vote relied on federally funded support programs — crop insurance, price guarantees and disaster assistance — which account for a significant share of net farm income. Over the past five years, a quieter lifeline has emerged: renewable energy.

Wind and solar projects have brought jobs, tax revenue and steady lease payments to rural counties that have been losing both population and farm income for decades. Iowa now gets about 63% of its electricity from wind, while Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas have seen significant growth.

That momentum has stalled. In August 2025, a U.S. Treasury Department policy change froze billions in rural investment in renewable energy projects. Industry trackers report that prolonged uncertainty has pushed many Midwestern renewable projects into limbo.

For farmers, this isn’t an abstract climate debate — it’s a lost income stream. Leasing land for turbines or solar panels brought in tens of thousands of dollars a year and kept many family farms afloat.

The freeze wipes out one of the few growth engines in rural America and highlights an irony at the heart of Trump’s message: The administration that promises to protect the heartland is dismantling the clean energy investments that were finally helping it diversify.

Politics: How deep does loyalty run?

As our research found, during the first trade war, Trump-voting counties absorbed heavy financial losses without changing course. That loyalty was propped up by subsidies — and by hope. This time, neither cushion is secure.

Many farmers still share Trump’s skepticism of Washington and global elites. But shrinking federal backing, tighter labor and a competitor’s bailout cut close to home. The question now is whether cultural identity can keep outweighing material loss — or whether the second trade war will signal a deeper political shift.

No sudden collapse of rural support for Trump is likely; cultural loyalty doesn’t fade overnight. But strain is visible. Farm groups are quietly pressing for pragmatic trade policy and visa reform, and several Republican governors now lobby for labor flexibility rather than tougher enforcement.

If the first Trump trade war tested farmers’ wallets, this one tests their faith — and faith, once shaken, is far harder to restore.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-84/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/file-20251114-56-2dszop-1024x6611763804292.jpg?h=21017897&itok=adYX6LQU,N,,2025-11-22 07:59:45.410748

The annual talks are this year being held in Belem, a Brazilian city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. They were scheduled to wrap up Friday, but negotiators blew past that deadline and it wasn’t clear when they may finish.

Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez, a top negotiator for Panama, said Friday that the decades-long United Nations process risks “becoming a clown show” for the omission. His nation was among 36 to object to a proposal from the conference president, André Corrêa do Lago of host Brazil, because it doesn’t provide an explicit guide map for the world to transition away from fossil fuels, nor to strengthen climate-fighting plans submitted earlier this year.

Before nations moved into high-level negotiations behind closed doors, Monterrey Gomez warned that talks were on “the verge of collapse.” A few hours later, he said nothing much had changed.

Do Lago started the day telling diplomats he thought they “are very close” to doing what they set out to do when they started meeting a week ago. When the all-country talks fizzled, do Lago pivoted to bringing in smaller pairings of negotiating teams for meeting in his office.

Talks behind schedule

“I would expect there needs to be another text,” veteran observer and former chief German climate negotiator Jennifer Morgan said late Friday afternoon. “I think there’s quite a lot of work to be done.”

The Brazilian proposals — also called texts — came on the heels of a fire on Thursday that briefly spread through pavilions of the conference known as COP30 on the edge of the Amazon. No one was seriously hurt but the fire meant that a day of work was largely lost.

“The problem is we’re 24 hours behind schedule,” said David Waskow, international climate director for the World Resources Institute.

Cold reception from many

The European Union said flatly that it wouldn’t accept the text. EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra reminded negotiators that countries had gathered at the edge of the Amazon to bring down emissions and transition away from fossil fuels.

“Look at the text. Look at it. None of it is in there. No science. No global stocktake. No transitioning away. But instead, weakness,” Hoekstra said in a closed-door meeting of negotiators, according to a transcript provided by the EU. “Under no circumstances are we going to accept this. And nothing that is even remotely close, and I say it with pain in my heart, nothing that is remotely close to what is now on the table.”

“After 10 years, this process is still failing,” Maina Vakafua Talia, minister of environment for the small Pacific island nation of Tuvalu, said in a speech earlier in the day. “The Pacific came to COP30 demanding a survival road map away from fossil fuels. Yet the current draft texts that came out (do) not even name the main threat for our very survival and existence.”

A key text among host Brazil’s proposals deals with four difficult issues. They include financial aid for vulnerable countries hit hardest by climate change and getting countries to toughen up their national plans to reduce Earth-warming emissions.

Then there’s the dispute over creating a detailed road map for the world to phase out the fossil fuels that are largely driving Earth’s increasing extreme weather. Any such plan would expand on a single sentence — to “transition away” from fossil fuels — agreed upon two years ago at the climate talks in Dubai. But no timetable or process was spelled out and powerful oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia and Russia oppose it.

More than 80 nations have called for stronger direction and Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva also pushed for it earlier this month.

Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore urged nations to stand firm in opposition and hailed Lula’s involvement.

“Saudi Arabia and Donald Trump and Russia under Vladimir Putin have bullied countries to support an absurd proposal,” Gore said in an interview with The Associated Press. He said the latest document “even deletes the proposal to phase out the ridiculous and self-destructive subsidies for fossil fuels. This is an OPEC text,” he said, for the organization that represents oil-producing countries.

Tackling fossil fuels

On phasing out fossil fuels, the proposal “acknowledges that the global transition towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development is irreversible and the trend of the future.”

The text “also acknowledges that the Paris Agreement is working and resolves to go further and faster,” referring to the 2015 climate talks that established the goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), compared to the mid-1800s. A key issue is that the 119 national emissions-curbing plans submitted this year don’t come close to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees.

Though the text didn’t address a fossil fuel transition road map, it could eventually end in a vaguely worded section about a plan for the next couple years in a separate road map.

The 36 nations who thought the text didn’t go far enough included wealthy ones such as the United Kingdom, France and Germany along with smaller climate-vulnerable islands Palau, Marshall Islands and Vanuatu. They said the proposal doesn’t meet “the minimum conditions required for a credible COP outcome.”

Colombian Environment Minister Irene Vélez Torres said the presidency’s proposal is unacceptable to “those of us who are committed to life on this planet, to climate justice.”

Getting everyone in one room

Agreements at these talks are officially reached when no nation objects and typically require many rounds of negotiations. In practice, the proceedings can end with agreements adopted and the presidency adjourning the meeting after noting any objections.

Instead of the usual small group meetings, the Brazilian presidency convened a meeting of nations’ top officials behind closed doors for much of Friday. It’s designed to lessen any nation feeling left out of backroom deals, but it doesn’t let the public see countries’ objections.

After a few hours it broke up with no sign of success and do Lago trying a different strategy.

Bell said he supported the new plant because Ascension Parish has been split between an economically prosperous east side and an impoverished west side.","With few elected officials in attendance at a hearing for a proposed CF Industries ammonia plant north of Donaldsonville, many Ascension Parish residents who gave public comment said they didn’t want the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality to approve permits for the facility.

The plant, a $4 billion facility that will use carbon capture and sequestration technology, will be located near the rural community of Modeste on the parish's west bank. The hearing held in Donaldsonville Thursday concerned an application for an air permit and a permit required for large facilities building in areas that meet or exceed federal air quality limits.

Most locals who spoke, such as fifth-generation Modeste resident Mekaylyn Lavigne, said they didn’t want the facility to be given a permit or built in their area.

“I simply find it very disheartening to see how so much greed for monetary value is pushing an entire community of people out of their homes who have expressed their distaste and their opposition to this,” she said. “And it seems to not be getting taken seriously.”

Terry Dugas, the general manager for the proposed plant, said in his remarks at the Thursday hearing that the complex will create 103 permanent full-time jobs and 110 indirect jobs. The company currently operates the world’s largest ammonia plant between Donaldsonville and the Sunshine Bridge.

“Our state-of-the-art ammonia production facility will have one of the lowest environmental footprints of any ammonia production facility in the world,” he said.

And while industry, nonprofit and Chamber of Commerce leaders spoke in favor of the permit—saying the plant will bring much-needed jobs and the company has been an important parish partner for nearly 60 years—few elected officials attended. It marked a departure from similar meetings in the past, which have seen local and state leaders support and oppose carbon capture proposals.

Locals say they don’t want the plant

The facility is one of a number looking to build in the sugarcane fields of west Ascension, a roughly 17,000-acre region called the RiverPlex MegaPark. Several corporations intend to build large industrial facilities in the area. Hyundai has announced a $5.8-billion steel mill north of Modeste, and the Texas-based Clean Hydrogen Works seeks to build a $7.5-billion ammonia plant.

At Thursday’s hearing, a half-dozen officers with the Ascension Parish Sheriff’s Office and a Louisiana State Police deputy attended the meeting. Last year, a fire official shut down a Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality meeting due to overcrowding.

Paul Troxclair, a former Iberville Parish resident who said he moved to Modeste because the company Shintech expanded near his home, said he was opposed because of chemical releases and it would remove important sugarcane land.

“I’ve worked in chemical plants for 40-plus years of my life,” he said. “And they can say all they want, you can have all the safety stuff you want, but you’re releasing stuff every day that people are breathing.”

Others, like Prairieville resident Denise Drago, said they didn’t want the planned carbon dioxide pipelines that would be connected to such a facility.

“There are no guarantees that the carbon sequestration will remain perfectly stored underground,” she said. ""It’s all risk and no rewards. That’s why I’m asking for this permit not to be issued.”

Not every resident opposed it. Eugene Britton, Gonzales resident and employee of the Donaldsonville plant, and Donaldsonville resident Ali Kocke, a CF Industries human resources supervisor, both said the company was committed to safety and helping the community.

Some Capital Region nonprofit leaders voiced support, including Brian Hightower, the chief development officer of the Greater Baton Rouge Food Bank, and George Bell, the president and CEO of Capital Area United Way.

Bell said he supported the new plant because Ascension Parish has been split between an economically prosperous east side and an impoverished west side.

“I see this as an opportunity for this area to really thrive and to come back and really gain the kinds of jobs and access to the kinds of jobs that are really needed here,” he said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/de/3defb8af-9a58-5d34-b172-9723c366f5f5/69208a4523a01.image.jpg?crop=1762%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C631&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-22 07:59:50.864414

Notably, economists have warned that the resulting fast development of AI infrastructure is sustaining the entire US economy.","Boxtown is a neighborhood in South Memphis established in 1863 by emancipated former slaves. Since 2024, it is also the home to one of the world’s largest supercomputers, property of Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI. Amidst politicians’ talk about innovation, development, and growth, and boosterism about the US American South’s “data boom,” Boxtown shows how the push to “win the race” of AI is shaping local landscapes in the United States. In Boxtown, the environmental effects of a gargantuan computer accrue with geological obstinacy on top of decades of environmental and health hazards, as well as longer legacies of plantation and racial violence, policy, and urban neglect.

The environmental risks and health impacts of this facility have raised the alarms of journalists, scientists, scholars, and citizen groups. Methane turbines churning toxic pollutants around the clock; a community railroaded by the well-funded interests of energy-hungry technology companies; the glitzy language of economic opportunity mobilizing acquiescent city administrators to harbor regulation-averse capital flows. And yet, its advance is unimpeded, aided by a variety of financial, rhetorical, and legal instruments. If the rush to build AI infrastructure is a national phenomenon tied to grandiose aspirations of economic and techno-cultural renewal, its local impacts show it is also unevenly transforming the landscape of the United States.

The computer housed in xAI’s facility near Boxtown is named “Colossus”—a name which computing historians will quickly associate with the storied super computer built in northwest London to support the work of cryptanalysts during World War II. Instead of decoding German ciphers, however, the Colossus now standing in the Mississippi river’s eastern margin services xAI, the company that Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, established to train AI models. In a caustic twist of history, while the first Colossus was built to decode and disrupt Nazi messages, the second seems inclined to recast and amplify them. xAI’s most famous product, Grok, is a chatbot which in 2025 made international news for praising Hitler, spewing antisemitic rants, and insistently bringing up the absurd idea of a “white genocide” in South Africa, seemingly parroting the views of its owner.

That the Mississippi Colossus requires a yearly energy expenditure equivalent to that of hundreds of thousands of homes—and that clouds of methane and formaldehyde are dumped into a dangerously warming atmosphere in the process—prompts questions about the nature and convenience of this technology, and about its role as an accelerator of extreme ideology, wealth concentration, and environmental collapse. As Rev. Dr. Heber Brown put it: “The emissions from the facility … are the same whether Grok is generating images of rock bands fronted by cats or posting tweets like ‘The white man stands for innovation, grit and not bending to PC nonsense,’ as it did recently. But polluting the nearby neighborhood of Boxtown in order to generate posts like the latter certainly adds insult to injury.”

Boxtown’s antebellum history is tied to the agricultural economy of the cotton plantation, which flourished on its rich river valley topsoil thanks to the labor of enslaved people of African descent. The neighborhood is located in Tennessee’s Shelby County, specifically on the land of the former Ensley cotton plantation. Convict labor extended the agricultural use of this land after the Civil War and until the early twentieth century, informing the postbellum development of African American neighborhoods. With the decline of the cotton industry after the Civil War, steam plants and steel mills found their way into the area.

Boxtown sits in Memphis’ southern periphery flanked on the west by an industrial zone, which aside from xAI’s facility includes a large steel processing facility for Nucor, one of the country’s largest steel manufacturers. In the North, the neighborhood is limited by the T.O. Fuller State park, another portion of the former Ensley plantation, sold in 1938 to create “the first park open for African Americans east of the Mississippi river.” The neighborhood thus has a history of air pollution, health hazards, and resistance that precedes the digital age. And yet, in Boxtown, Old South patterns of land use and their associated dynamics of capital accumulation persist and combine today with the interests of a new industrialist class, shaping its urban form.

AI’s new economy in Boxtown literally dwells in the shell of previous industries. On the east margin of the Mississippi river, xAI’s facility occupies a building previously owned by Electrolux, the Swedish washing machine and dishwasher appliances company. The company sold the facility to xAI in 2024 and transferred its operations to Springfield, Tennessee. We might draw a contrast between the affective spheres of these respective technological eras. If powered appliances promised an easier and more enjoyable life by easing the highly gendered toil of domestic labor, the services provided by xAI’s promise to drastically reorganize the market of cognitive labor. But this vision is not accompanied by bucolic or leisurely images of a future without work. Proponents of AI are, for the most part, content with using this technology to put workers on notice.

The displacement of physical manufacturing in the US by the industrial production of language and images via data and energy-intensive computational processes reveals the country’s broader economic and techno-cultural transition. And yet, from cotton plantations, steam, and steel manufacturing to the current manufacturing of digital data, the neighborhood’s residents have organized. Boxtown has been and continues to be an urbanism of resistance.

The Environmental Politics of AI in the US

The race to dominate the global economy of AI requires a drastic increase in data storage, hardware manufacturing, and processing capacity. All of this extends the United States’s reliance on power plants using fossil fuels, fundamentally derailing efforts towards a clean energy transition. An important portion of these costs are associated with the powering and cooling of data centers. A forecast estimates that by 2026, excess energy demands for powering data centers will be comparable to the entire energy expenditure of Japan, up to 1,050 terawatts. In addition, a data center’s daily water consumption is in the hundreds of thousands of gallons. Further, material and energy-intensive processes to produce integrated circuits, processors, and semiconductors for AI accentuate problematic labor and mineral extractive dynamics. With this complicated picture as a background, wishful voices have emphasized the need to power the data economy with cleaner forms of energy. Others have minimized these potential impacts, deferring them, in a form of magical thinking, as something that AI itself might solve in the future. However, given the AI industry’s projections of growth, and their unrestricted embrace by the US government, what seems most likely is that “winning the race” of AI simply means relinquishing the goal of reducing carbon emissions and transitioning into clean energy.

xAI’s Southern Colossus should thus be seen in the context of an emerging AI doctrine in the United States. Its relentless march is enabled by a US government dictate to “build, baby, build” computing infrastructure by streamlining the process of issuing permissions for data centers, semiconductor manufacturing facilities, and energy infrastructure by exempting these from environmental regulations. Penned by presidential science advisor Michael J. Kratsios, “special advisor for AI and Crypto” David O. Sacks, and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Marco Rubio, the report aligns with the Trump administration’s well documented animosity against environmental protections. Notably, economists have warned that the resulting fast development of AI infrastructure is sustaining the entire US economy. Aside from rescuing the coal mining industry, hardware companies supplying the AI industry with microprocessors seem to explain, at least for the moment, US stock market gains, however raising concerns about “circular financing.” In addition, with data center construction outpacing office space construction, AI seems to be offering the field of architecture a lifeline in an otherwise declining construction industry. Amidst global economic uncertainty, and increasing warnings about a financial bubble, the US seems to have placed its bet firmly—and exclusively—on AI.

Aside from promising to secure US military, economic, and scientific superiority—as well as an artistic “renaissance” through digital art—the US AI doctrine has important spatial and environmental dimensions. xAI’s unpermitted use of harmful methane gas turbines to power its Memphis facility illustrates that the social and environmental harms of computing infrastructures are not evenly distributed, and disproportionately affect zones inhabited by Black and other underprivileged communities, which experts have described as “sacrificial zones.” Alongside these environmental effects, the construction of AI infrastructure entails costs that citizens are already beginning to shoulder. In Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia, for example, utilities companies are building natural gas infrastructure aimed at producing more than 20,000 megawatts by 2040, largely for powering data centers in these states. If these plans are realized, households in these states will pay even higher electricity rates to subsidize an oversized, fossil fuel–powered grid which heats the atmosphere and largely works to consolidate an increasingly privatized and surveilling data economy. These new land use patterns are rapidly leaving a mark on US landscapes.

In their disproportionate scale, the spatial disclosures of AI infrastructures can accidentally resemble utopian architectures. An image shared by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shows an aerial view of the island of Manhattan with its landmass dominated by a colossal box. The image is meant to convey the gargantuan scale of Hyperion, the Meta data center currently under construction in Louisiana. As observed by media scholar Roland Meyer, Buckminster Fuller’s Dome over Manhattan (1959) and Zuckerberg’s Hyperion data center (2025) represent drastically different (albeit similarly megalomaniacal) ecological aspirations. While Fuller’s three-kilometer-wide geodesic dome sought to reduce energy consumption, Zuckerberg’s gigantic extruded box is premised on its waste.

Proponents of AI wield maximalist claims about economic growth, intelligence, and geopolitical economic and military dominance in order to gather capital and attention, and to drown concerns about the inconvenient impacts of AI on the environment and labor. While ostensibly linked to productivity and competitiveness, it is currently difficult to disentangle AI in the United States from a political project committed to oligarchic power, the surveillance and militarization of civic life, aggressive imperial foreign policy, and racist nation-building fantasies. And all of this is taking place while AI technologies threaten to become the very lens through which we look into and participate in political reality.

The dance of billionaire and state power outlines this mechanics. The picture that has emerged is that of a cadre of obsequious billionaires greasing the wheels of presidential munificence in the form of contracts and tariff exemptions with juicy political contributions and curtsies. Despite the critical attention this farcical race has attracted, it seems to be paying off. The same week xAI was forced to issue a public apology for repeatedly bringing up Nazi rhetoric, it announced a $200 million deal with the US Department of Defense (DoD). At the same time, the US Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) boasted that similar contracts were procured between the US Department of Defense and other technology giants including Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI. And the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a government initiative led by Elon Musk, helped slash around two billion US dollars from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the very government agency in charge of overseeing the AI industry’s environmental impacts. Supported by this combination of self-dealing, obsequiousness, disdain for environmental concerns, and technological tunnel vision, the construction of AI infrastructure, and the forms of power that enable it, advances.

Really Large Time-sharing or the Schematic Geography of AI

The spatial configuration of present-day AI infrastructure increasingly distributes computing power away from users, relocating it in privatized, highly polluting super centers such as xAI’s. This recalls an earlier moment in the history of computing, when large mainframe computers provided computing services to numerous terminals distributed across organizations such as university campuses, government offices, or large companies. Known as “time-sharing,” this early form of networked computing aimed at making scarce computing resources available to many users who might not be aware that they are sharing a computer.

Today’s geography of AI, with software services increasingly relying on server-side processing, bears a structural resemblance with the spatial logic of this Cold War–era computing paradigm. However, as we have seen, the distribution of computing resources today takes place at an altogether different scale. The computing superclusters servicing the AI economy are not merely in a different location within a building or campus, but in a different city, country, or continent. As a result, users are removed from the material and environmental dimensions of computing, contributing to the obfuscation of its costs and hazards. Extruding a text or an image using an AI service can appear as a smooth, frictionless transaction only because the space, energy, and water these require are removed from users’ experience. Further, by centralizing computing in facilities such as xAI’s Boxtown data center, citizens’ data routinely circulates and is processed in distant jurisdictions, under increasingly privatized conditions, lowering thresholds for surveillance and information manipulation.

In ways that resemble previous eras of technological investment, we are witnessing the coupling of US government and industry in the construction of a new socio-technical infrastructure. In the background of the US’s ongoing plan to deploy AI infrastructure is the historical entwining of the US industry and government sectors throughout the twentieth century. Since the decades following the Second World War, US officials saw computers as useful instruments to secure global militaristic and economic dominance, and to realize a worldview centered on economic growth, open markets, and international competitiveness. Vast sums of federal funds were directed to university research and technology transfer programs aimed at reorganizing the US manufacturing industry around computers. These investments outpaced those of any of the other industrialized economies, configuring technological and scientific standards that firmed the United States’s role as a global hegemon, and shaped a distinctly US American “innovation” culture of scientific production, industry collaboration, and design. In the 1990s, a comparably large wave of financial and cultural capital placed the internet at the center of the country’s economic doctrine, with its own infrastructural demands. During this long postwar period, technologies such as numerical control, computer-aided design, and the internet helped model a postwar international order after US interests, ostensibly on ideas about productivity, growth, international competition, and open markets. By virtue of their role in standardizing industrial production, commerce, and culture, they can be seen as relatively soft instruments of US empire. The Trump administration’s action plan to “win the race” of AI refurbishes the language of these previous waves of financial and cultural fervor about US technology, but places them within a different economic and historical trajectory inflected by openly protectionist and ethno-nationalistic political sensibilities. The postwar period of economic expansion in the US, characterized by government-sponsored university research, social security, environmental protections, public education, and health, is now, after forty years of political and cultural erosion, on the chopping block, making way for private interests to further encyst and exert greater influence over all aspects of US politics and life. As we have seen, the concentration of computing power across networks of privatized super centers is one manifestation of this dynamic.

Computing has never been neutral, but the form of mediation proposed by many AI systems suggests deeper impacts into how knowledge is not just shared but also produced and manipulated. That these processes are increasingly under the control of private actors of incalculable wealth and questionable commitments to democracy, should raise questions about what the US AI doctrine portends not just for the environment but also the body politic in the United States and beyond.

Counteractions

The perception of AI as a frictionless, neatly automated process rests on hiding its material and social substrates and environmental effects. Making these visible has been the important work of citizens, activists, scholars, journalists, and independent organizations interested in advancing the causes of environmental justice and democratic governance. In Boxtown, activist organizations including Memphis Community Against Pollution (MCAP) and Protect Our Aquifer have sounded the alarm about the planning process leading to the construction of xAI’s facility and scrutinized the company’s promises regarding air quality and water use, which has led to an independent air monitoring study. A recent protest named “Get Out of Memphis” organized by the student activist group Tigers Against Pollution brought attention to these issues, prompting the deployment of federal law enforcement under president Trump’s pledge to “fight crime in the city.”

Beyond Boxtown and around the US, citizen groups and non-profit organizations work to increase democratic oversight on computing infrastructures by conducting independent research, mobilizing public opinion, and supporting related legislation. For example, in a 2025 Data & Society policy brief, Tamara Kneese and Maia Woluchem draw on journalistic, academic, and industry research to scrutinize common claims of AI as the catalyst of growth, alternative energy development, and national security, noting that “achieving computing abundance requires exhausting the planetary bounds of our ecological resources, energy, and labor, all of which are required to support this industrial development.” The Tech Workers Coalition, a New York–based group, supported a state-level act requiring the disclosure, hearings, and annual reports about the fossil fuel consumption, water, and energy, of all data centers in the state of New York, and that they all transition to renewable energy by 2030. The act, which was not passed, was inspired by examples of data center legislation from Virginia and Germany, and included consumer protections such as community discount plans and preventing “backroom deals” between tech companies and utility companies. , directed by Tech Workers Coalition, 2025, ➝.] And in partnership with researchers at the University of Michigan, the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition has released policy and citizen action recommendations based on a review of the impacts of data center construction and energy demands in communities across several states, notably also including the adoption of regulation and transparency approaches inspired by German legislation on this issue.

While academic and industry researchers have pursued the notion of “Responsible AI,” they have overwhelmingly focused on topics such as implicit bias and disinformation, leaving open questions about the environmental effects of AI’s underlying infrastructure. In a similar vein, US linguist and natural language processing scholar Emily M. Bender has observed that researchers working under the banner of “AI Safety” have mostly avoided seriously confronting AI’s social and environmental dimensions—at times simply channeling AI industry propaganda as well as white supremacist fantasies. More on point, scholars in the social sciences, arts, and humanities have in recent years approached data centers as subjects of empirical analysis and critical scrutiny. For example Dustin Edwards, Zane Griffin, and Mél Hogan have proposed “Critical Data Center Studies” as a new interdisciplinary area of study critically focused on contemporary computing infrastructures. The landscape of critical scholarship they chart draws on concepts and methods from fields including anthropology, history, and science and technology studies (STS), and ranges from studies of the physical infrastructure of the internet, real estate and land use aspects of data center construction, to ethnographies of data centers and other AI infrastructures. Architecture and other design disciplines might hold clues to open up spatial and environmental dimensions of this phenomenon.

Science and technology scholar Langdon Winner proposes that certain technologies, by virtue of their scale and configuration, can be seen to enact a politics. Nuclear reactors, he notes, require centralized forms of power for their deployment and operation that might be antithetical to democratic governance. As the deployment of the xAI Colossus onto Boxtown suggests, the US AI doctrine and the nation-wide development of data-intensive computing infrastructure both requires and expresses a worldview organized around undemocratic concentrations of capital, space, and political agency. The existence of democracy in the United States and of breathable air in Boxtown are in this way intimately intertwined.",https://images.e-flux.com/test/426fed3e-6e3e-4137-b25d-7f11fc9f6ca0?width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-11-22 09:58:09.626894

By delivering reliable, 24/7 renewable power, Copiapó will help decarbonize Chile’s steel and mining sectors, among the nation’s largest energy consumers.
'The Copiapó project reflects Chile’s growing capability to pair renewable generation with storage and supply clean energy to key industrial sectors,' said Esteban Uauy, Global Head of Project Finance at Atlas Renewable Energy.
The company, an international renewable energy solutions provider with more than 8.4 GW in its portfolio, develops, finances, builds and operates clean-energy projects across Latin America, including 1.5 GW of contracted capacity in Chile.
Atlas currently operates three large-scale solar plants – Javiera (Atacama), Quilapilún (Metropolitan Region), and Sol del Desierto (Antofagasta) – as well as BESS del Desierto, the country’s first large-scale standalone storage project.","DNV acted as market advisor to support Atlas Renewable Energy in securing USD 475 million in financing for the Copiapó hybrid solar and battery storage project in Chile. The financing was arranged with a consortium of leading financial institutions including BBVA, BCI, Crédit Agricole CIB (CACIB), Natixis CIB, SMBC, and Société Générale.

Located in Chile’s Atacama Region, Copiapó combines 357 MWp of solar capacity with a 320 MW/1.28 GWh battery system, capable of providing four hours of storage. The project will supply clean energy equivalent to 750 GWh per year to CAP Group subsidiaries – CMP and Aguas CAP (part of Chile’s leading steel and mining conglomerate) – under two long-term 15-year power purchase agreements (PPAs). By delivering reliable, 24/7 renewable power, Copiapó will help decarbonize Chile’s steel and mining sectors, among the nation’s largest energy consumers.

DNV helped de-risk the project’s complex revenue structure for lenders. The scope included market due diligence, review of the power purchase agreements, and battery revenue-stacking and dispatch-optimization analysis to demonstrate long-term bankability. This independent validation strengthened lender confidence and supported the achievement of highly competitive financing terms.

'Chile is showing what the next chapter of the energy transition looks like,' said Santiago Blanco, Executive Vice President and Regional Director for Latin America, Energy Systems at DNV. 'Projects like Copiapó thrive because the country has combined exceptional natural resources — including world-class solar irradiance to a domestic lithium industry — with strong public support and clear, long-term policy signals. This combination creates the conditions for large-scale solar-plus-storage projects to deliver reliable, clean power to industry and serve as a model for other nations to follow.'

'The Copiapó project reflects Chile’s growing capability to pair renewable generation with storage and supply clean energy to key industrial sectors,' said Esteban Uauy, Global Head of Project Finance at Atlas Renewable Energy. 'DNV’s support helped reinforce lender confidence and highlight the project’s strengths in a rapidly evolving market. Together, we’re demonstrating how collaboration and innovation can accelerate the region’s energy transition.”

This transaction marks a milestone in a record year for Atlas Renewable Energy in Chile, bringing its total project financings closed in the last 13 months to over USD 1.2 billion. The company, an international renewable energy solutions provider with more than 8.4 GW in its portfolio, develops, finances, builds and operates clean-energy projects across Latin America, including 1.5 GW of contracted capacity in Chile.

Atlas currently operates three large-scale solar plants – Javiera (Atacama), Quilapilún (Metropolitan Region), and Sol del Desierto (Antofagasta) – as well as BESS del Desierto, the country’s first large-scale standalone storage project. Together with Copiapó, these facilities underscore Chile’s emergence as one of the world’s most advanced clean-energy markets. With more than 70% of its power generation already renewable and an 80% target set for 2030, the country is demonstrating how ambitious policy, investor confidence, and technological innovation can align to accelerate decarbonization and inspire similar progress across Latin America and beyond.

U.S. farmers, already frustrated by low prices and visa delays, took it as an insult.
As our research found, during the first trade war, Trump-voting counties absorbed heavy financial losses without changing course.
The question now is whether cultural identity can keep outweighing material loss — or whether the second trade war will signal a deeper political shift.
If the first Trump trade war tested farmers’ wallets, this one tests their faith — and faith, once shaken, is far harder to restore.","Few political alliances in recent American history have seemed as solid as the one between Donald Trump and the country’s farmers. Through three elections, farmers stood by Trump even as tariffs, trade wars and labor shortages squeezed profits.

But Trump’s second term may be different.

A new round of administration policies now cuts deeper into farmers’ livelihoods — not just squeezing profits but reshaping how farms survive — through renewed tariffs on agricultural products, visa restrictions on farm workers, reduced farm subsidies and open favoritism toward South American agricultural competitors.

In the past, farmers’ loyalty to Trump has overridden economics. In our study of the 2018-19 trade war between the U.S. and China, we found that farmers in Trump-voting counties kept planting soybeans even though the trade war’s effects were clear: Their costs would rise and their profits would fall. Farmers in Democratic-leaning counties, by contrast, shifted acreage toward alternatives such as corn or wheat that were likely to be more profitable. For many pro-Trump farmers, political belief outweighed market logic — at least in the short term.

Today, the economic effects of policies affecting farmers are broader and deeper — and the resolve that carried farmers’ support for Trump through the first trade war may no longer be enough.

Tariffs: The familiar pain returns

The revived U.S.-China trade conflict has again placed soybeans at its center. In March 2025, Beijing suspended import licenses for several major U.S. soybean exporters following new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump countered with a new round of reciprocal tariffs, broadening the list of Chinese imports hit and raising rates on already targeted goods.

An October 2025 deal promised China would buy 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans a year, but relief has proved mostly symbolic.

Before the 2018-19 trade war, China regularly imported 30 million to 36 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans annually — more than one-third of all American soybean exports. Now, Beijing has signed long-term contracts with Brazil and Argentina, leaving U.S. producers with shrinking overseas demand for their crops.

Prices remain roughly 40% to 50% below pre-2018 levels, and farmers are storing record volumes of unsold soybeans.

In 2019, the federal government cushioned those losses with over $23 billion in bailout payments to farmers. This time, Republican leaders show little appetite for another bailout. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s funds for farm relief are running low, leaving farmers with lower prices and less support.

Labor: Fewer hands, higher costs

Farms are also short of workers. Roughly 42% of U.S. crop workers lack legal status, according to the National Agricultural Workers Survey. Tougher immigration enforcement and slower visa processing have thinned the labor pool just as production costs are surging. Hired-labor expenses rose 14.4% from 2021 to 2022 and another 15.2% the following year, and costs such as fertilizer, equipment and parts climbed sharply.

Many growers are turning to the H-2A guest worker program — a legal pipeline for seasonal foreign labor that has quadrupled in size over the past decade. But it is expensive: Farms must pay the adverse effect wage rate, a federally set pay rate that is more than twice the regular federal minimum wage. And farms must provide every H-2A worker with free housing and free transportation to and from the U.S., as well as from their housing to the worksite. Large agribusinesses can absorb those costs; small family farms often cannot.

As exports collapsed in late September 2025, the head of the American Soybean Association wrote a public letter to the White House begging for help, saying, “We’ve had your back. We need you to have ours now.” The hard-line immigration policy approach that rallies rural voters is also pushing smaller farms to the brink — forcing them to ask what their loyalty still buys.

Subsidies and symbolism: The Argentina shock

The question of the value of farmers’ loyalty sharpened in the fall of 2025 when the U.S. Treasury approved a $20 billion currency-swap deal with Argentina — supporting the country’s president, Javier Milei, a political ally of Trump, while the country remains a direct agricultural competitor.

U.S. farmers, already frustrated by low prices and visa delays, took it as an insult. Argentina is among the world’s largest soybean exporters, and U.S. farm groups asked why the federal government would underwrite a competitor while trimming support for American producers at home.

The tension deepened when Trump floated the idea of buying Argentinian beef for U.S. markets — a remark one Kansas rancher called “an absolute betrayal.” The plan may be economically minor, but symbolically it pierced the “America First” narrative that had helped hold the farm vote together.

Clean energy: The new rural subsidy under threat

For decades, the farm vote relied on federally funded support programs — crop insurance, price guarantees and disaster assistance — which account for a significant share of net farm income. Over the past five years, a quieter lifeline has emerged: renewable energy.

Wind and solar projects have brought jobs, tax revenue and steady lease payments to rural counties that have been losing both population and farm income for decades. Iowa now gets about 63% of its electricity from wind, while Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas have seen significant growth.

That momentum has stalled. In August 2025, a U.S. Treasury Department policy change froze billions in rural investment in renewable energy projects. Industry trackers report that prolonged uncertainty has pushed many Midwestern renewable projects into limbo.

For farmers, this isn’t an abstract climate debate — it’s a lost income stream. Leasing land for turbines or solar panels brought in tens of thousands of dollars a year and kept many family farms afloat.

The freeze wipes out one of the few growth engines in rural America and highlights an irony at the heart of Trump’s message: The administration that promises to protect the heartland is dismantling the clean energy investments that were finally helping it diversify.

Politics: How deep does loyalty run?

As our research found, during the first trade war, Trump-voting counties absorbed heavy financial losses without changing course. That loyalty was propped up by subsidies — and by hope. This time, neither cushion is secure.

Many farmers still share Trump’s skepticism of Washington and global elites. But shrinking federal backing, tighter labor and a competitor’s bailout cut close to home. The question now is whether cultural identity can keep outweighing material loss — or whether the second trade war will signal a deeper political shift.

No sudden collapse of rural support for Trump is likely; cultural loyalty doesn’t fade overnight. But strain is visible. Farm groups are quietly pressing for pragmatic trade policy and visa reform, and several Republican governors now lobby for labor flexibility rather than tougher enforcement.

The global energy infrastructure transformation creates unprecedented demand for specialized materials that enable renewable systems, electric vehicles, and digital networks. Among these enabling materials, certain metals exhibit properties that make them irreplaceable across multiple clean energy applications while facing constrained supply pipelines and geopolitical concentration risks.

This analysis examines strategic positioning frameworks for materials that serve as infrastructure components rather than energy storage elements. Unlike lithium or cobalt, which primarily function within battery chemistries, these enabling materials create the fundamental connections and protective systems that allow clean energy technologies to operate reliably across decades-long operational lifecycles.

Atomic Structure Creates Irreplaceable Clean Energy Applications

Tin's strategic value in clean energy transition stems from its unique atomic configuration with 50 protons that creates specific metallurgical properties essential for renewable energy electronics. The metal's crystalline structure enables formation of reliable solder joints that maintain electrical conductivity under thermal cycling conditions typical in solar inverters, wind turbine electronics, and electric vehicle power systems.

Modern renewable energy installations require thousands of individual electrical connections per megawatt of capacity. Each photovoltaic panel contains approximately 1,000-1,500 solder joints connecting solar cells to electrical circuits. These connections must withstand temperature variations from -40°C to +85°C over 25-year operational periods while maintaining consistent electrical resistance.

Critical Properties Enabling Clean Energy Applications:

Thermal stability: Maintains mechanical integrity across temperature ranges

Corrosion resistance: Provides long-term reliability in outdoor installations

Electrical conductivity: Enables efficient power transfer with minimal losses

Workability: Allows precise application in miniaturised electronics

The transition from lead-based to tin-based solder systems, mandated by the European Union's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, created structural demand growth as electronics manufacturers globally adopted tin-silver-copper alloy systems. This regulatory shift established tin as the standard for all new electronics manufacturing serving renewable energy markets.

Advanced Semiconductor Requirements Drive Precision Demand

Next-generation power electronics require solder systems capable of atomic-level precision in chip-scale packaging applications. Advanced inverters for solar installations and electric vehicle powertrains utilise wide-bandgap semiconductors that operate at higher temperatures and switching frequencies than traditional silicon devices.

These advanced semiconductor packages demand solder alloys with specific thermal expansion coefficients that match silicon carbide and gallium nitride substrates. Tin-silver-copper formulations provide the precise thermal expansion matching required to prevent mechanical failure during thermal cycling in high-performance applications.

Furthermore, as highlighted by Wood Mackenzie's analysis, the role of tin in the energy transition has been significantly undervalued despite its critical applications.

According to industry projections, each megawatt of renewable energy infrastructure requires approximately 15-20 kilograms of specialised solder materials across inverters, monitoring systems, and grid interconnection hardware.

Multiple Demand Growth Scenarios Through 2035

Scenario modelling for tin consumption reflects different pathways for global electrification and technology deployment. These scenarios incorporate electric vehicle adoption rates, renewable energy capacity growth, and data centre expansion driven by artificial intelligence applications.

Accelerated Transition Scenario:

Electric vehicle market share reaches 70% of new sales by 2030

Solar photovoltaic capacity grows 300% from 2024 baseline

Data centre computing power increases 250% supporting renewable grid management

Projected annual tin consumption: 580,000 tonnes by 2035

Baseline Development Scenario:

Electric vehicle adoption reaches 50% of new vehicle sales by 2030

Solar capacity doubles from current installed base

Steady electronics manufacturing growth

Projected annual tin consumption: 480,000 tonnes by 2035

Conservative Transition Scenario:

Electric vehicle adoption limited to 35% by infrastructure constraints

Renewable energy deployment constrained by grid integration challenges

Projected annual tin consumption: 420,000 tonnes by 2035

Current global tin production operates near 350,000 tonnes annually, indicating potential supply deficits across all scenarios unless new primary production comes online. The International Tin Association projects demand growth of up to 40 percent by 2030, primarily driven by electrification and semiconductor applications.

Supply Response Constraints Create Strategic Bottlenecks

New tin mining projects require 7-12 years from discovery to commercial production, creating structural inflexibility in supply response to demand growth. Unlike industrial materials with multiple production pathways, primary tin extraction depends on specific geological formations that limit potential supply sources.

Global Tin Production Analysis:

Region Annual Production Development Potential Supply Security China 95,000 tonnes Limited expansion Domestic priority Indonesia 72,000 tonnes Moderate growth Export restrictions Myanmar 48,000 tonnes Declining output Political instability Peru 19,000 tonnes High potential Stable jurisdiction Bolivia 18,000 tonnes Expansion possible Resource nationalism

Indonesia's position as the second-largest producer creates particular supply chain vulnerability. The country has implemented export licensing requirements and local processing mandates that constrain tin availability for international markets. These policies reflect broader trends toward resource nationalism that prioritise domestic value-added processing over raw material exports.

Geographic Concentration Amplifies Supply Vulnerabilities

Approximately 65% of global tin production originates from Southeast Asia, where political instability, regulatory changes, and infrastructure limitations create recurring supply disruptions. Myanmar's contribution of approximately 48,000 tonnes annually faces ongoing challenges from civil conflict and international sanctions.

This geographic concentration creates systemic risks similar to rare earth element dependencies that prompted strategic stockpiling initiatives in the United States and European Union. However, establishing Europe's CRM hub represents a crucial step toward supply chain diversification.

Strategic Stockpiling Initiatives Address Critical Dependencies

The United States consumes approximately 32,000 tonnes of tin annually while producing zero primary tin domestically. This complete import dependence mirrors vulnerabilities identified in rare earth elements, lithium, and other critical minerals supply chain dependencies essential for national security applications.

Government strategic reserves serve multiple functions beyond supply security. Reserve purchases provide price stability during demand surges whilst creating strategic optionality for supply chain disruptions. The U.S. Defense Production Act authorises federal investment in domestic processing capabilities and alternative supply development.

Critical Supply Chokepoints:

Indonesian export licensing and processing requirements

Myanmar political instability affecting 14% of global supply

Limited smelting capacity outside Asia-Pacific region

Transportation bottlenecks through Southeast Asian ports

European Union policy frameworks include tin among critical raw materials subject to supply diversification mandates. The Critical Raw Materials Act establishes targets for reducing import dependencies and developing domestic processing capabilities for materials deemed essential for clean energy transition.

Technology Evolution Creates Expanding Applications

Renewable energy infrastructure expansion requires tin-based electronics across multiple system components. Solar photovoltaic installations utilise tin solder for electrical connections between cells, junction boxes, combiner circuits, and power conditioning equipment.

Wind energy systems incorporate tin solder in generator electronics, power conversion equipment, and control systems. Each wind turbine contains approximately 1-2 tonnes of electronics requiring specialised solder materials designed for vibration resistance and long-term reliability.

Technology Trend Analysis:

Bifacial solar panels: Increase tin consumption by 30% per installation

Floating solar systems: Require enhanced corrosion protection

Advanced inverter technologies: Demand higher-performance solder systems

Grid-scale energy storage: Creates new tin application categories

Electric Vehicle Electronics Complexity Scaling

Modern electric vehicles contain 4-6 times more electronic components than internal combustion vehicles. Battery management systems, power electronics, charging infrastructure, and autonomous driving sensors create dense networks of tin-soldered connections throughout vehicle electrical systems.

In addition to transportation applications, understanding the broader context of energy transition minerals helps illustrate tin's strategic positioning within the clean energy ecosystem.

Per-Vehicle Tin Content Analysis:

Battery management and safety systems: 0.9-1.3 kg per vehicle

Power electronics and motor controllers: 1.2-1.8 kg per vehicle

Charging and connectivity systems: 0.5-0.7 kg per vehicle

Autonomous driving electronics: 0.4-1.2 kg per vehicle (emerging)

Electric vehicle charging infrastructure represents an additional demand category requiring tin-based electronics for power conversion, grid interconnection, and communication systems. Each fast-charging station contains approximately 15-25 kg of electronics requiring specialised solder materials.

Investment Framework Development for Critical Materials Exposure

Traditional commodity valuation models inadequately capture tin's strategic value in clean energy transition beyond standard supply-demand fundamentals. Alternative analytical frameworks must incorporate supply security premiums, substitution constraints, and technology adoption multipliers.

Strategic Valuation Components:

Base commodity fundamentals: Current market price and demand volumes

Supply security premium: 20-30% markup reflecting geopolitical concentration

Technology adoption multiplier: 1.3-2.1x based on electrification deployment pace

Strategic reserve demand: Additional 5-10% from government stockpiling

Portfolio construction for tin exposure requires indirect approaches through mining equities, integrated materials companies, and technology manufacturers. Direct tin investment vehicles remain limited compared to precious metals or energy commodities.

Risk-Return Modelling Across Investment Vehicles

Monte Carlo simulations incorporating demand scenarios, supply disruptions, and price volatility suggest tin-exposed investments could outperform broader commodity indices by 180-350 basis points annually through 2030, though with higher volatility profiles.

Investment Exposure Options:

Primary tin producers: Direct exposure with operational risk concentration

Diversified miners: Tin revenue components within broader metal portfolios

Electronics manufacturers: Indirect exposure through tin-intensive product lines

Strategic material funds: Emerging vehicles focusing on critical mineral exposure

Risk-adjusted return optimisation requires balancing direct commodity exposure against operational risks in tin-producing regions. Companies with established operations in stable jurisdictions command valuation premiums despite potentially lower tin grades or production volumes.

Corporate Strategy Development for Supply Chain Resilience

Technology companies dependent on tin-intensive manufacturing should develop comprehensive procurement strategies incorporating price hedging, supplier diversification, and strategic inventory optimisation. Supply chain resilience has become a competitive advantage as critical material availability constraints affect production scheduling.

Moreover, companies must align their procurement strategies with evolving critical minerals strategy frameworks at the national level to ensure long-term supply security.

Strategic Procurement Framework Elements:

Multi-year demand forecasting: Integrating technology roadmaps with material requirements

Geographic supplier assessment: Evaluating political and operational risks

Inventory optimisation: Balancing carrying costs against supply security

Alternative material research: Long-term substitution development programmes

Research and development investments should prioritise tin-efficient technologies that maintain performance whilst reducing material intensity. Companies achieving superior tin utilisation efficiency gain competitive advantages as supply constraints tighten.

Policy Coordination Requirements for International Cooperation

Effective critical material security requires coordination between consuming nations, producing countries, and multilateral organisations. Policy frameworks must address mining investment incentives, recycling infrastructure development, and strategic reserve coordination.

The United States, European Union, Japan, and Australia have established coordination mechanisms for critical material supply chain resilience. These frameworks include information sharing on production capacity, joint strategic reserve management, and coordinated responses to supply disruptions.

International cooperation initiatives focus on supporting responsible mining development in emerging jurisdictions whilst building domestic processing capabilities in consuming countries. Furthermore, considering the insights from CRUX Investor's analysis, technology transfer programmes and development finance mechanisms aim to diversify supply sources beyond current geographic concentrations.

Defence Applications Heighten Strategic Importance

Military applications of tin extend beyond commercial electronics to encompass specialised defence systems requiring extreme reliability under harsh operational conditions. Advanced radar systems, military communications equipment, and precision weaponry depend on tin-based solder joints that maintain functionality across temperature extremes and electromagnetic interference.

The development of a comprehensive defence minerals strategy recognises tin's dual-use nature and the need for secure supply chains to support both civilian infrastructure and military applications.

Defence-Critical Tin Applications:

Military communications: Secure radio and satellite systems

Avionics electronics: Aircraft navigation and control systems

Naval systems: Shipboard electronics and sonar equipment

Land-based defence: Radar installations and command centres

This dual-use characteristic elevates tin's strategic value in clean energy transition beyond commercial considerations to encompass national security implications that justify government intervention in supply chain development.

Strategic Positioning for Material-Enabled Energy Transition

Tin's strategic importance extends beyond traditional commodity market dynamics to encompass national security considerations, technological sovereignty, and industrial competitiveness factors. The material's irreplaceable role in electronics manufacturing positions it as critical infrastructure for renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, and digital networks supporting decarbonisation.

Strategic scenario modelling indicates potential supply tightness emerging by 2027-2028 under baseline electrification scenarios, with more severe constraints possible by 2030-2031 if technology deployment accelerates beyond current projections. Geographic supply concentration in politically unstable regions amplifies these risks whilst limited substitution options constrain demand elasticity.

Investment approaches must recognise tin's strategic value in clean energy transition beyond traditional commodity fundamentals, incorporating the material's role as enabling infrastructure for clean energy transition. Corporate strategic planning should prioritise supply chain diversification and efficiency improvements, whilst policy frameworks require international coordination on critical material security.

The convergence of electrification trends, supply constraints, and geopolitical factors positions tin among the most strategically significant materials for the next decade of energy infrastructure development. Organisations that develop comprehensive strategies for tin's strategic value in clean energy transition exposure and supply security will be better positioned to capitalise on clean energy transition opportunities whilst managing material availability risks.

This analysis reflects current market conditions and technological trends. Commodity markets involve substantial risks, and material demand projections contain inherent uncertainties. Investors should conduct independent research and consider professional advisory services before making investment decisions.

The wind farms collectively generated an unprecedented 22.7 gigawatts (GW) of electricity. That impressive output was sufficient to power 22 million homes, a visible demonstration of the nation’s accelerating transition to a clean energy future.

This new peak comfortably beats the previous wind generation record of 22.5 GW, set less than a year earlier on December 18, 2024.

For a brief but significant moment, wind energy alone supplied over half of the nation’s demand.

As per SkyNews, the country had experienced windy conditions, particularly in the north of England and Scotland.

Jane Cooper, deputy chief executive of RenewableUK, revealed the practical, immediate benefit of the new record. “On a cold, dark November evening, wind was generating enough electricity to power 80% of British homes when we needed it most.”

A new energy mix dominates

According to the National Energy System Operator (Neso), wind energy supplied 43.6 percent of Britain’s electricity on November 11, enough to power over three-quarters of British homes.

Furthermore, 12.1% came from “embedded wind” generation, which feeds local distribution networks directly rather than the main transmission network, pushing the overall wind power total to 55.7%.

The remaining energy came from a diverse mix of sources, with gas (12.5%) and interconnectors (11.3%) as the next-largest contributors, followed by nuclear (8%) and biomass (8%). Minor contributions were made by hydro (1.4%) and storage (1.1%), illustrating a highly decarbonised and varied energy mix for the period.

“This is a world-beating record, showing that our national grid can run safely and securely on large quantities of renewables generated right here in Britain,” said Kayte O’Neill, chief operating officer at Neso.

“We’ve come on leaps and bounds in wind generation in recent years. It really shows what is possible, and I look forward to seeing if we can hit another clean energy milestone in the months ahead: running Britain’s electricity grid entirely zero carbon,” O’Neill added.

Clean energy goals

The UK’s current wind power capacity, standing at roughly 32 GW and nearly equally divided between onshore and offshore turbines, provides the foundation for this enormous generation.

Among its assets, the country boasts five of the planet’s largest offshore wind farms, as reported by Electrek.

​​Neso predicts that within the next few months, Britain could achieve a new milestone by operating its electricity grid solely on zero-carbon sources, namely renewables and nuclear power.

“This new record high period is another tangible example of wind taking its place at the heart of our clean energy system, as we transition away from the volatile prices of fossil fuels, which caused the energy crisis,” Cooper added.

It aligns with the UK government’s wider, high-stakes objective, often referred to as the “clean power mission.” The government aims to generate at least 95% of the UK’s electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030, transitioning away from reliance on fossil fuels.",https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IE-16.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 06:58:00.082999

Last year, the number of jobs in North Carolina’s economy grew by about 1%. But growth in clean energy employment outpaced other sectors, according to a new report.

The advocacy group E2 found that clean energy jobs grew by about 3% in 2024. That includes jobs that make new clean energy, as well as put that energy to work or use energy more efficiently.

“Another year of data demonstrating that clean energy is a really powerful engine for job growth in North Carolina,” said Zach Amittay, E2’s Southeast advocate.

He said growth trends were largely in line with what past reports have shown. North Carolina remains in the top 10 for most clean energy jobs in the country, with businesses employing around 113,000 workers. For context, that’s significantly more than the number of teachers, and includes about 15% of total construction jobs in the state, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Mecklenburg and Wake counties made the top 30 list of counties with the most jobs across these sectors.

Within the broad category of “clean energy,” the energy efficiency sector employs significantly more workers than any other. That includes HVAC technicians, lighting experts and other jobs that either electrify the home or make it consume energy more efficiently. The state has continued investing in this workforce into 2025, announcing the Energy Saver NC program in January, which gives homeowners up to $16,000 back on home electrification and efficiency projects.

The clean vehicle sector halted its upward trajectory last year, mirroring the national decline in automotive manufacturing jobs during the last couple of years.

“This year, we actually saw a slight reduction in that workforce,” Amittay said. The sector shrank 2.5%, even as North Carolina’s EV supply chain continues to develop. When combined with new EV battery manufacturing, such as the $14 billion Toyota battery manufacturing plant in Liberty, N.C., the state remains in the top four nationally for investments in manufacturing EVs and batteries.

Making clean energy work post-IRA

Amittay said the Inflation Reduction Act and its associated tax credits drove much of the growth that year. “Plenty of this growth would have happened regardless of the policy landscape.”

“Renewable generation continues to be a notch above the economy statewide,” he said. “What’s really kind of head and shoulders above statewide growth is storage and grid.”

That includes folks such as Charlotte-based Heimdall Power’s president, Brita Formato, who presented about her new powerline “neuron” during an E2 event last week in Charlotte. The device provides real-time data to utilities about their transmission line capacity:

“Using the infrastructure that we already have will bridge us to that 7-10 years that we need to build out the grid,” Formato said. In addition to new clean energy jobs, technologies like Heimdall Power’s neuron are lowering electricity bills.

Looking ahead, Amittay said he expects growth to continue, albeit more slowly.

“What we’re doing is leaving some potential for jobs on the table,” said Amittay, referring to changes in federal policy during the last year. President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill eliminated or greatly restricted federal incentives for solar installations and manufacturing.

This new political landscape has made renewable energy businesses in particular more sensitive to state and local changes. During this past legislative session, lawmakers removed a key carbon pollution reduction target and took aim at a tax abatement for utility-scale solar projects. Meanwhile, other initiatives, such as Duke Energy’s PowerPair and Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg, have helped buoy rooftop solar sales into the first quarter of 2026.

He anticipates that grid and battery storage will continue growing rapidly.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/45172ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1601x841+0+30/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F04%2Fe7%2F73c6711e4879935414fe87089ecf%2Fe2plan-de-travail-44-copie.png,N,,2025-11-22 05:58:42.801249

The goal: Get more heat pumps into more homes through a combination of financial incentives, educational outreach, and workforce development.
At the same time, heat pumps have faced barriers in the region, including the upfront cost of equipment, New England’s high price of electricity, and misconceptions about heat pumps’ ability to work in cold weather.
The largest portion of money, some $270 million, will go to the ​“market hub.” Distributors will receive incentives for selling heat pumps.
These midstream incentives are expected to reduce the cost of cold-climate air-source heat pumps by $500 to $700 per unit and heat-pump water heaters by $200 to $300 per unit.","New England winters can get wicked cold. This week, five of the region’s states launched a $450 million effort to warm more of the homes in the often-frigid region with energy-efficient, low-emission heat pumps instead by burning fossil fuels.

“It’s a big deal,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. ​“It’s unprecedented to see five states aligning together on a transformational approach to deploying more-affordable clean-heat options.”

The New England Heat Pump Accelerator is a collaboration between Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. The initiative is funded by the federal Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program, which was created by President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The accelerator’s launch marks a rare milestone for a Biden-era climate initiative amid the Trump administration’s relentless attempts to scrap federal clean energy and environmental programs.

The goal: Get more heat pumps into more homes through a combination of financial incentives, educational outreach, and workforce development.

New England is a rich target for such an effort because of its current dependence on fossil-fuel heating. Natural gas and propane are in wide use, and heating oil is still widespread throughout the region; more than half of Maine’s homes are heated by oil, and the other coalition states all use oil at rates much higher than the national average. The prevalence of oil in particular means there’s plenty of opportunity to grow heat-pump adoption, cut emissions, and lower residents’ energy bills.

At the same time, heat pumps have faced barriers in the region, including the upfront cost of equipment, New England’s high price of electricity, and misconceptions about heat pumps’ ability to work in cold weather.

“There’s not a full awareness that these cold-temperature heat pumps can handle our winters, and do it at a cost that is lower than many of our delivered fuels,” said Joseph DeNicola, deputy commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.

To some degree, the momentum is shifting. Maine has had notable success, hitting its aim of 100,000 new heat pump installations in 2023, two years ahead of its initial deadline. Massachusetts is on track to reach its 2025 target, but needs adoption rates to rise in order to make its 2030 goal.

The accelerator aims to speed up adoption by supporting the installation of some 580,000 residential heat pumps, which would reduce carbon emissions by 2.5 million metric tons by 2030 — the equivalent of taking more than 540,000 gas-powered passenger vehicles off the road.

The initiative is organized into three program areas, or ​“hubs,” as planners called them during a webinar kicking off the accelerator this week.

The largest portion of money, some $270 million, will go to the ​“market hub.” Distributors will receive incentives for selling heat pumps. They will keep a small percentage of the money for themselves and pass most of the savings on to the contractors buying the equipment. The contractors, in turn, will pass the lower price on to the customers. In addition to reducing upfront costs for consumers, this approach is designed to shift the market by encouraging distributors to keep the equipment in stock, therefore making it an easier choice for contractors and their customers.

These midstream incentives are expected to reduce the cost of cold-climate air-source heat pumps by $500 to $700 per unit and heat-pump water heaters by $200 to $300 per unit. When contractors buy the appliances, the incentive will be applied automatically — no extra paperwork or claims process required.

“It should be very simple for contractors to access this funding,” said Ellen Pfeiffer, a senior manager with Energy Solutions, a clean energy consultancy that is helping implement the programming. ​“It should be almost seamless.”

Consumers will also remain eligible for any incentives available through state efficiency programs, such as rebates from Mass Save or Efficiency Maine, but will likely not be able to stack the accelerator benefits with federal incentives like the Home Efficiency Rebates and Home Electrification and Appliances Rebate programs.

Program planners expect to be finalizing the incentive levels through the end of the year, enrolling and training distributors in the early months of 2026, and making the first participating products available in February 2026, said New England Heat Pump Accelerator program manager Jennifer Gottlieb Elazhari.

The second program area is the innovation hub. Each state will receive $14.5 million to fund one or two pilot programs testing out new ways to overcome barriers to heat pump adoption by low- and moderate-income households and in disadvantaged communities. One state might, for example, create a lending library of window-mounted air-source heat pumps, allowing someone whose oil heating breaks down the time to research replacement options rather than just installing new oil equipment.

The innovation hub will also include workforce development and training. Organizers are talking with contractors and other partners to figure out where the gaps are in heat pump training. In the first few months of 2026, they will develop a program with a target start date in April.

The goal will be not only to ensure that there are tradespeople with the needed skills to install the systems, but also to lay the groundwork for faster adoption by spreading knowledge about the capabilities of the technology and the available incentives.

The third major area of the accelerator is a resource hub to aggregate information for contractors, distributors, program implementers, and other stakeholders. Overall, organizers hope to have all three hubs operational in spring 2026.

Accelerator planners expect programs to boost adoption even as a federal tax credit of up to $2,000 on heat pumps and heat-pump water heaters is phased out at the end of the year, leaving states leading the way on clean energy action.

“At the state level, this is one example of a way we are helping to make progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but with a solution that can help people take control of their energy costs,” Dykes said. ​“That’s really what we’re focused on.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2226699225.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=4e11ebc6ea331ee3e8de5ab4df57a828,N,,2025-11-22 07:59:33.381852

This marks a major step in the company’s decarbonization plans and sets the stage for Eni to become a market leader in the production of biofuels for a variety of industries.

Sicily will become the home of European biofuel production thanks to Eni’s ambitious plans

As the world grapples with the transition from conventional energy resource production, such as oil and gas, to the new and exciting world of biofuel production, several exceedingly large energy companies have laid out their plans to expand existing operations or retrofit refineries to produce biofuels.

That has become especially true in Sicily, as Eni, one of Italy’s largest energy companies, has announced its plans to develop a 500,000-metric-ton-per-year biorefinery at its existing industrial site in Priolo, Sicily. The company notes that the facility will produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel and is expected to be operational in 2028.

Eni has officially launched the authorization process for the environmental impact assessment to retrofit the facility in Sicily, and has received the blessing of the Italian Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security to begin retrofitting the facility.

The new biorefinery will be developed at an existing ethylene plant in Sicily

Eni has stated that the plan involves developing the project at the current site of Versalis’ ethylene plant. Versalis is a subsidiary of Eni, which focuses on the production of chemicals. The company has stated that the ethylene plant will slowly be phased out and decommissioned to make room for the new biorefinery, marking a turning point for Eni’s vast energy portfolio.

The new facility will serve Eni’s biofuel ambitions as well as produce hydrogen

Eni has noted that the new facility will produce renewable diesel as well as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), all made from waste, animal fat, and vegetable oil feedstocks. Diversifying the company’s energy portfolio will be the planned biogenic feedstock pretreatment unit and a hydrogen production facility.

The new project will also boast a chemical recycling facility that will make use of Versalis’ proprietary Hoop pyrolysis technology. The all-new chemical recycling facility will have the capacity to process 40,000 metric tons per year of mixed plastic packaging waste, which will enable Eni to produce approximately 32,000 metric tons per year of pyrolysis oil.

Eni previously announced its plans to increase biorefinery capacity over the years to come

The company has stated its plans to increase the capacity of its biorefineries to more than 3 million metric tons in 2028, with ambitions to increase that number even more over the next few years.

LITTLETON, Colorado, Nov 21 (Reuters) – A potent mix of American ingenuity and full-throated political backing has propelled the U.S. to the top of global LNG exporter rankings, and promoted a narrative that shipments of “freedom gas” will continue climbing to all markets for years to come.

But while U.S. liquefied natural gas exports in 2025 are nearly a third more than those of the next largest exporter, the heavy skew of sales to Europe leaves American LNG vendors at risk of rapid volume downturns as European buyers curb gas use.

The US has exported a record 98 million metric tons of LNG so far in 2025, or 25% of global LNG exports

Further, the U.S. share of exports into the largest region for LNG imports – Asia – is far smaller than rivals Qatar and Australia, which enjoy far more cost-effective shipping times to key markets such as Japan, China and India.

If the U.S. is to cement its role as the preeminent global supplier of LNG – often branded as freedom gas when pitched to allies as an alternative to supplies from authoritarian countries – export flows will need to grow sharply in key markets outside of Europe in areas where the likes of Qatar, Australia, Malaysia and Russia are already well established.

LNG imports by region since 2021

That heightened competition will severely test the U.S. ability to remain the top global LNG supplier, as it will lead to sharply higher transit costs for U.S. exporters and narrower profit margins as sellers compete for deals.

EURO CENTRIC

European nations have accounted for two-thirds of U.S. LNG exports this year, which is the highest concentration of U.S. export flows to a single continent since 2022, when Europe’s demand for LNG spiked following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

And although Europe’s total LNG import volumes have jumped by 25% in 2025 from last year, Kpler data shows, Europe’s total LNG import needs have expanded by only 2% since 2022 as the power sector retooled generation sources away from fossil fuels.

Europe is by far the top destination for US LNG exports, accounting for two-thirds of US LNG shipments in 2025

With Europe’s utilities expected to continue fast-tracking renewables and battery storage deployment going forward, regional gas demand is likely to decline from the 2030s, resulting in a shrinking market for LNG exporters.

In its latest outlook, the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts total European Union gas demand to decline by just over 10% by 2035 due to greater use of electric heat pumps, higher energy efficiencies and more renewables output.

FAR-FLUNG HEADWINDS

To offset shrinking volumes into Europe, U.S. LNG exporters will have to look farther afield, and may have to go head-to-head with other large LNG sellers to grow market share in Asia, which is the top overall LNG importing region.

But to sustainably grow volumes into cost-sensitive markets such as China and India, U.S. exporters may need to undercut rivals while also incurring higher transit costs on each delivery.

Roughly 26% of the LNG imported by the top 10 importers comes from the USA. But the US share is much higher into Europe than into Asia

So far in 2025, the U.S. share of LNG exports to the top five global LNG importers – Japan, China, South Korea, India and Taiwan – is just 8%, as other exporters such as Qatar and Australia hold far higher Asian market shares.

To grow that share, U.S. LNG will need to be cheaper than what’s being offered by other suppliers.

But lowering sale prices will be a challenge as the costs of delivering the LNG to Asian buyers stands to be over twice that of shipping LNG to mainland Europe.

The journey time for an LNG vessel from Sabine Pass in the U.S. to Rotterdam in the Netherlands is roughly 15 days, according to LSEG.

But the journey time from Sabine Pass to the Dahej port in India is over 30 days, and so marks a doubling in trip time as well as greater LNG boil off during the journey, which will eat into cargo revenues.

Lower sales prices combined with higher transit costs will not just erode profitability, but may also strain exporter creditworthiness as the lengthier journeys will tie up cash flows for longer and may necessitate short-term credit lines.

A pivot from mainly servicing cash-rich customers in Europe to soliciting demand from firms with weaker credit profiles in emerging markets will also raise the overall market risk for LNG exporters, and may lift the cost of credit lines accordingly.

TRADE TENSIONS

Aggressive moves by U.S. LNG exporters to grow market share in Asia could also strain trade ties with the likes of Qatar, which is heavily reliant on gas exports for national earnings and has plans to steeply boost its own LNG export volumes.

The US has an 8% average share of LNG trade into the top 5 LNG importers, and a 44% average share into the next 5 largest importers

Qatar has also pledged hefty investments in the U.S. over the coming decade – including in facilities that export LNG from the U.S. Gulf coast – and so could renege on those commitments if U.S. LNG export expansions are deemed too disruptive.

Canada, Russia, Australia, Mozambique and Mexico have also announced plans to lift LNG export volumes in the coming years, and so will also be vying for share in the same markets that U.S. exporters will be targeting.

Overall, more supplies from other exporters alongside higher delivery costs to new markets may slow U.S. LNG export growth going forward, and could force LNG exporters to settle for a smaller slice of the global LNG export pie over time.

Washington (November 21, 2025) – Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, today wrote to President Trump to condemn the Administration’s reversal of progress towards ambitious domestic and international climate policy. The United States government has been noticeably absent from negotiations at COP30 in Brazil, the United Nations-hosted annual climate summit where government leaders, civil society, and academia convene to take stock of collective progress towards emissions reduction and climate resilience and chart forward new goals to address ongoing challenges. The Trump administration’s repeated attacks on climate and clean energy at home and abroad jeopardizes our relationships with our global allies, sacrifices American jobs and competitiveness, and leads the world into a race to the bottom.

Senator Markey writes, “As the countries of the world gather to fight climate catastrophe, you are courting it. Since the first day of your second Administration, when you ordered the United States to join the company of Iran, Libya, and Yemen as the only non-participating parties to the Paris Agreement, you have undone decades of U.S. climate leadership on the global stage.”

Senator Markey continues, “As the international climate conference COP30 concludes in Brazil on the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement, I urge you to stop destroying our standing with international allies and turning collective climate action into a race to the bottom. Your attacks on our domestic clean energy industry and international aid are decimating our national ability to compete with China and other countries that are seizing the economic advantage of climate action.”

Senator Markey has been outspoken in his support for strong U.S. climate leadership on the international stage.

During COP29 in 2024, Senator Markey partnered with Representative Lisa Badum of Germany and Senator Rosa Galvez of Canada to lead more than 130 leaders from around the world in sending an open letter urging world leaders and UN-level negotiators to support an immediate moratorium on the expansion of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) infrastructure worldwide.

In December 2023, Senator Markey and Representative Nydia Velasquez introduced the Climate Displaced Persons Act, legislation to enact a national strategy that would provide a more equitable immigration pathway to the United States for people displaced by climate change and critical support for people affected by climate disasters internationally.

Ahead of COP28 in 2023, Senator Markey and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez led 32 of their House and Senate colleagues in a letter to President Joe Biden urging the Administration to support stronger national climate action commitments to the Paris climate agreement, a negotiated outcome for a full phase-out of fossil fuels, and transparency and stronger standards to prevent public financing for international fossil fuel projects.

Efforts by two tiny bucolic villages in northern Delaware to thwart Delmarva Power’s plan to replace high-voltage transmission lines have crumbled under a lawsuit filed by the state’s dominant electricity provider.

Ardentown and Ardencroft, whose roughly 500 residents live in a self-proclaimed

“forest ecosystem” of mature woodlands and open spaces known as “greens,” object to the looming replacement of seven tall metal towers, one more than 100 feet high, that were built a century ago on what was then farmland.

The existing towers traverse about a half-mile of mostly hilly terrain through the two towns, with some located between the backyard of homes in a Delmarva right-of-way. Their replacement with galvanized steel structures designed to withstand hurricane-force winds is part of Delmarva’s 4.5-mile upgrade that’s aimed at improving reliability service for 13,000 customers while reducing the frequency and duration of outages.

But the village’s governing assemblies contend the project will tarnish the lush enclave by clear-cutting trees and disrupting lead-contaminated soil beneath the towers. They want the project rerouted about a quarter-mile away, near railroad tracks where Delmarva already has some towers. WHYY News detailed the controversy in January.

In a bid to stymie Delmarva, Ardencroft banned new transmission lines and towers last year, and approved an annual impact fee for existing transmission infrastructure. In March, the town sent Delmarva a $12,833.17 impact fee bill for 2025.

Earlier this year, Ardentown formally entered the fray, prohibiting transmission towers and poles from exceeding 100 feet in height, with fines of $1,000 per day for violations. Ardentown also banned new transmission lines or tower infrastructure of 60 kilovolts or more within 100 feet of any home, with fines of $1,500 per day for violations.

Delmarva’s existing lines and towers, both Ardentown ordinances said, have “caused almost 100 years of unnecessary harm and avoidable risk to our village.”

In response to the villages’ laws and fees, Delmarva fired back on Oct. 31 against Ardentown — but not Ardencroft — in Delaware’s Chancery Court, which is recognized internationally for its ability to resolve business and corporate disputes.

Delmarva’s suit asked the court to invalidate Ardentown’s new laws and order the town to pay its legal bills. The 27-page filing accused the town of exceeding its legislative authority by violating the village’s 1926 contract with predecessor American Power Company that allows the lines, the Delaware Public Service Commission’s authority to regulate utilities and Delmarva’s constitutional property rights.

“The 1926 Ardentown Easement does not limit the height of the towers/poles located in the Ardentown Easement Area, nor does it limit the voltage carried by the transmission lines,” the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit added that the easement “gives Delmarva Power, among other things, the right to ‘repair and renew said poles, towers, structures, fixtures, and wires.’”

None of the current towers are higher than 100 feet, according to the lawsuit, but all of the proposed ones are, and the law was only enacted after Delmarva shared details of its “long-planned improvements” with town leaders.

“At their core, the ordinances are nothing more than a ‘not in my backyard’ attempt to force Delmarva Power to re-route its existing transmission line away from Ardentown and through other communities,” the lawsuit said.

Noting that the project’s completion deadline is the end of 2026, the lawsuit said that failing to finish by then “risks real-time operational reliability problems, including outages to a large number of customers or higher energy costs to customers.”

‘Trying to go up against Delmarva is quite, quite difficult’

Delmarva did not sue Ardencroft, which rescinded its ordinance in October to avoid litigation.

Minutes for that Ardenroft Assembly meeting noted the “general disappointment and frustration that everyone feels about this litigious outcome.”

And this month, 10 days after the lawsuit was filed, Ardentown also rescinded its two laws.

Ardentown trustee Lisa Wilson Riblett described the fight as a valiant but uphill battle for the “tree huggers” of the town, whose municipal budget is $22,500 a year, against the powerful subsidiary of Exelon Corp., a Fortune 500 conglomerate that had $23 billion in revenue and $2.46 billion in net income in 2024.

“The town did decide to rescind those ordinances because of just the financial burden of them,” Wilson Riblett said. “Unfortunately that doesn’t mean the problems are solved.”

Wilson Riblett said the utility still hasn’t provided detailed plans, including any tree replacement that’s needed.

She also pointed out that Delmarva must remediate the lead contamination under an agreement with state environmental officials and restrict the scope of their work to the width of the easement, which is as narrow as 8 feet in some stretches of the half-mile swatch through Ardentown and Ardencroft.

“Trying to go up against Delmarva when you’re a little tiny village is quite, quite difficult,” Wilson Riblett said. “But the people in the town are very proactive and they’re still working toward trying to make this the best situation that we can.”

Melissa Parsonson, Ardentown’s chair and effectively its unpaid mayor, said residents had little choice but to capitulate and rescind the laws. Otherwise, the town would put the approximately 270 residents in jeopardy of having to pay any damages, including the cost of litigation.

“There’s the risk of going to court and you don’t know how a judge is going to decide,” Parsonson said. “It’s very frustrating.”

Delmarva officials would not agree to be interviewed about the project, but said in a written statement from spokesman Matthew Ford that the utility is anticipating notification from Ardentown that the laws are no longer on the books.

“We are continuing to work closely with customers and communities to minimize impacts and keep them informed throughout this project,” Ford’s statement said. “We are pleased that the village has since withdrawn the ordinances, and we appreciate their decision, which allows us to move forward collaboratively in serving our customers and communities.”

Parsonson countered that Delmarva has been less than forthcoming, but said she hopes they will be more candid going forward.

“They haven’t told us anything,” she said. “They could bring in trucks tomorrow and we wouldn’t be none the wiser, because they just have not been open with us.”",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/delmarva-power-c-barrish-2025-11-19-4.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 02:57:56.943665

Summary

AI Data Centers Boom: The U.S. is spending more on data centers than on commercial construction, driving a new phase of infrastructure growth.

Energy Demand Surges: AI is the most energy-intensive form of computing, pushing grid demand to record levels and requiring massive new power generation.

Skilled Trades Shortage: The construction of data centers, factories, and infrastructure is creating a huge demand for electricians, plumbers, truck drivers, and other skilled workers.

Shift in Labor Market: AI threatens white-collar jobs, while blue-collar and technical trades see rising wages and job opportunities.

Grid and Transmission Challenges: Delivering enough energy—especially through new transmission lines and pipelines—is a major hurdle, with permitting and construction slowdowns.

Rising Utility Costs: Electric rates are increasing, driven largely by policy choices such as shutting down low-cost plants and subsidizing intermittent renewables.

Private Sector Solutions: Tech giants are building or funding their own off-grid power plants to meet data center needs and avoid overburdening public utilities.

U.S. Competitive Edge: America leads in data center capacity and AI infrastructure, thanks to abundant energy and technological know-how.

Political and Economic Risks: Policy missteps, regulatory delays, or global shocks (black swans) could disrupt the AI-driven economic boom.

Structural Economic Revolution: The convergence of AI, reshoring, and automation signals not just an industrial revolution, but a fundamental transformation of the entire U.S. economy.

Transcript

Jim Puplava:

Welcome, everyone. I am speaking with Mark Mills today. He's Executive Director for the National Center for Energy Analytics. And Mark, I wanted to have you back on the program. You recently wrote an article called ""The Rise of AI: The Reality Check on Energy and Economic Impacts."" I'd like to begin—I think it was a statement that we are spending more money on data centers than we are on commercial construction.

Mark Mills:

Yeah, I mean, it's really quite remarkable. That report's available at our National Center for Energy Analytics website. It's a free report; we don't—NCA is a nonprofit energy think tank. We don't charge for stuff; we just harvest donors to help us do our work. So, it's some interesting things going on. I've been involved in the data center industry for a long time and was on the board of a company that designed power systems for data centers for quite a while in the first era of the great data center build-out. America has been building data centers since 1998. The very first data center was built in Santa Clara, California, by Exodus Communications, which went bankrupt shortly after the great dot-com Internet bubble burst in 2000. But that's when it began. We've been building for 20-plus years, and now we're in the next phase of the great data center build-out, largely because of AI, but not exclusively because of AI. So, the country was spending billions of dollars a year constructing buildings the size of warehouses and shopping malls that are full of computers—data centers. That's where your magic Google Maps lives; that's where shopping exists; that's where you store your cat videos. The data centers are the beating heart of the global cloud and the Internet that we all use, both in business and in life. That's where streaming videos come from—that's where Netflix and Amazon Prime reside. That's where the data resides, in hardware—physical hardware. So now, with what's going on with this boom that's happened because of AI—and it's the most energy-hungry form of compute ever invented—data center construction this year in dollar terms blew past total construction of all office buildings in spending terms. Now, partly, office building construction slowed down a bit at the same time as data center construction took off. So, yeah, it's a—keep in mind that for those who are power nerds, energy nerds, a square foot of data center is roughly 10 times more energy-intensive than a square foot of office building.

Jim Puplava:

You know, something that you wrote in that article really struck me, and Mike Rowe talks about this—the need for skilled workers from electricians, plumbers, welders, things of that nature, and the amount of individuals needed to build a data center. It's remarkable. And you think of the data centers, you think of the new factories they're bringing back, the commercial buildings, not to mention residential buildings, which—where are we going to get all these people?

Mark Mills:

Yeah, it's a giant boom in demand for the skilled trades. It's really crazy. So, as I wrote in that piece—and as soon as you say it, it's self-evident, right? Whether you're building a shipyard or a skyscraper, whether you're building a data center, a new factory to make chips, a highway, you're essentially tapping the same labor pool. These are truck drivers, electricians, plumbers, pipe fitters. It's all the things you need to move concrete, steel, and iron—to join things. It's very similar, and if it's not exactly the same, it's the same people. The number of people you need per billion dollars is remarkably constant across all these spaces. If you spend a billion dollars building something, you're going to need 5,000 to 7,000 skilled tradesmen to do it—whether it's a highway, a skyscraper, or a data center. And it's the same skilled trades. So yes, I think we have a massive boom in demand for skilled trades because of the appetite to reshore, because of data center expansion, and geopolitical concerns to start building ships here again. Where are we going to get the labor? Well, the question answers itself. People will figure out these are high-paying jobs. You do apprenticeships for a few years, you can get in at the ground level, you can earn twice the salary compared to more than half of college graduates. It's starting to come back, but we will face a—we already are facing a near-term shortage. How will it get filled? Well, again, it's a fairly fast cycle. But the other thing that will happen as wages rise and demand rises is that we will finally see the stimulant we need for more industrial automation. That's been very difficult to get into the construction sector. Those technologies, which by the way are also AI-infused and AI-enabled robots—to be simplistic, whether wheeled, tracked, or walking—that's coming. That's not theoretical anymore. It's another sort of nascent boom that everybody will look at, I'll say, three years from now and say, ""Gee, where did that come from?"" Well, it's—we need labor. We need to amplify the labor we've got.

Jim Puplava:

You know, the thing that really strikes me when I read that article—the Wall Street Journal just did an article—it's going to be the worst job market for graduating college students next year. And I was thinking about this, Mark, you know, the globalization where we outsourced our factories overseas, it really hit, you know, blue-collar workers.

Mark Mills:

Yeah.

Jim Puplava:

Now with AI, it's going to hit white-collar workers. And then blue-collar workers, with the demand for the trades to build all this stuff, their prospects are looking brighter.

Mark Mills:

Oh, no question. I mean, I wrote a piece about Mondaire Jones before we won the mayoral race in New York, pointing out the obvious that you just pointed out—that the voting class, and to put it unkindly, the laptop class in Manhattan who graduated with college degrees that were, to be unkind, marginally useful. I mean, these are not stupid people—I'm not denigrating them—but the degrees they got were of marginal value. That's exactly the kind of jobs that are being displaced, of course, by AI. So, they're feeling very nervous and anxious. This was collectively a political class that lectured the blue-collar class during the 1920s to 1960s when automation reduced the need for labor in the automotive and steel industries—that they should get over it and get retrained because automation and productivity were great for the economy, as it displaced the number of blue-collar jobs needed per unit of output, which it did by a lot. Now the shoe's on the other foot, as they say, and nobody likes it. It's politically disruptive. I'm not underplaying how politically volatile this is in the short term. In the long term, as they say, we've seen this movie before—the net-net effect is more jobs and more wealth. But in the short term, it does create disruption and realignment of where job opportunities lie. Then to your point, Jim, the boom in job opportunities is not just in blue-collar, but we'll call them the intermediate jobs. Most of the jobs in construction are not on the front line, like in war-fighting; most of the warfighters are not the guys at the so-called tip of the spear. It's everything in between the tip of the spear and the back office—all the infrastructure jobs. So these are real jobs that don't involve carrying a hammer or welding something, but they're in the construction industries. So that's where the boom's going to be. And again, you don't have to be trained as an electrician to get jobs there, but you have to decide that's an industry you want to work in instead of, say, finance or being in a law firm. And where those jobs are—very, very quickly, those intermediate jobs are already being rapidly automated away by AI.

Jim Puplava:

I want to get into your article about the energy requirements to put in all these data centers you mentioned. Probably in the next five years, that's probably going to come mainly from natural gas; five years out, then we start getting into nuclear. But where are we going to get all the energy? I'm talking about the grid. So, if you are doing, for example, renewable energy, where vast swaths of land for wind turbines or solar panels—you’re going to have to have some kind of transmission link to bring that power to the city. So where's all this going to come from?

Mark Mills:

Well, that's the big question of this decade, right? Because the surprise is at the magnitude of demand from data centers. To put it in context, for people who haven't really thought about this a lot, they hear the words thrown around—gigawatt of this, what's a gigawatt? Well, a gigawatt power plant is a pretty big power plant. It's like a nuclear plant or a big coal plant, a massive wind array. A gigawatt is huge—goes to the horizon. But that's about a half-million people; it's a city of a half-million people, one gigawatt. So it's a lot of power. And we're building right now, based on construction permits, we're building 76 gigawatts of data centers. That's what's permitted—whether they all get built or not, we'll see, but about 76. So, do the math, right? That's adding a city of 30 million people, which the United States doesn't have one of those. I mean, well, LA, I guess, greater area is 30 million. So it's adding, you know, five or six New York cities' worth of electric demand. So, where are we going to get it? Well, okay, the two parts of it are: how do you get the primary energy? That's why I said natural gas. It's a very significant but achievable increase in natural gas demand—about 10 or 15% more natural gas will be needed compared to what we currently produce. This is not that hard to do, really. You need more pipelines, but that's not that hard to do. It's the conversion of the gas into electricity, to your point, and delivering it to the data center. So, the data centers will be sited closer to where the power plants are first. That's what's happening already. If you need to build long transmission lines, good luck. Transmission line construction is at epic low levels—very difficult to expand quickly. Even if there were no permitting problems, there are a lot of problems getting these big long-distance transmission lines permitted. Just from an engineering perspective, to give you a framing of how the market's going to play out—if you want to build 500 miles of transmission line, you're looking at, ignoring permits, two to four years to do that. If you want to build 500 miles of natural gas pipelines to deliver energy to the endpoint and make electricity there instead, you're talking 24 to 30 months. So you get two years versus four years. So which would you do? I mean, obviously, you'll build gas pipes and put the power plants at the end of the pipe. So that's how the architecture is starting to play out, both with utilities and non-utilities. We saw Meta announce a big project with a gas pipeline company, Williams, in Pennsylvania to build a data center and gas generation off-grid—not connected to electric utility at all. You see in Louisiana, Meta do a different version of their plan, which is to work with the utility there, Entergy, to prepay for, in effect, the capacity needs. So the utility didn't have any trouble raising capital because the capital came from big tech and it didn't impact ratepayers. And they're going to build two gigawatts of capacity for one data center. Think about this—a data center with a million people's worth of electric demand, and it'll get built in two years. You don't build a city in two years, but you can build a city's worth of electric demand in two years. This is a distinction with a profound difference with respect to how this whole market's going to play out.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, because, I mean, AI stocks have dominated the stock market the last two years. I think tech stocks are about 40% of the market cap in the S&P, and even more so in the Nasdaq. But nobody's looking at what you're addressing—which is, where are we going to get the energy, the transmission lines to make all this possible? The other thing I want to bring up here is we've spent a lot of money on the Green New Deal, solar farms, wind farms, and things like that. Let's talk about what that is doing to the cost of electricity, because I want to get into the recent elections, which were all about affordability. I want to go to New Jersey. New Jersey utility rates are up 26% in the last 12 months alone.

Mark Mills:

Yeah, yeah, you can't blame data centers for that—although people are trying to. The data centers aren't finished yet; most of them are under construction. So how do they cause electric rates to go up when they haven't consumed the electricity yet? They will consume electricity when they get built. I'm being only slightly facetious. In a few cases you can trace some of the electric rate increases to data centers, in a few—very few—cases. The primary reason electric rates are going up is bad policies. And the bad policies devolve to two things: shutting down existing low-cost electric generation—some of it's nuclear, but a lot of it's coal. And so, as you know, this administration has ordered this cessation, and many states have also ordered cessation. Many utilities have voluntarily stopped shutting down low-cost big coal plants because we need more power, not less. So, doing that—a lot of that's already happened—raised rates. Pushing onto grids by mandate—subsidized use of episodic power, wind and solar—causes electricity costs to go up, even if the electricity from the sun and the wind, when it's being supplied, is cheap, which it is. When it's not available, you have to depend on the rest of the grid, which is now run suboptimally. And that suboptimization of the grid means electric rates go up, which is what happened. This was predictable, it was predicted, and now we're harvesting the consequences. And this is politically volatile because affordability is one thing politicians do not like. Having experienced self-inflicted inflation is to have inflation come back in energy and in the electric side—it is coming back.

Jim Puplava:

And you don't hear any of these arguments in the media. You know, they're already talking about big tech companies building these data centers. But some of these tech companies—a good example is Microsoft and a couple of others—I think they're working with a decommissioned nuclear plant, so they're bringing it back. So, do you see a lot of these companies realizing, hey, we're not going to be able to get the power, so let us take this on our own? Like what Elon Musk did in Virginia—I think he put in two power plants to build his data center. I know Meta is doing that in Louisiana, and as you mentioned, they're doing it in Pennsylvania. Do you see more of that, to maybe take some of the pressure off them so they won't be the, you know, the scapegoat for this?

Mark Mills:

Well, I think they have no choice. First of all, you're going to see a blend of different solutions depending on the geography and politics of each state and what they have. But the blend will always devolve to the pressure to the people demanding the power—big tech paying for their power. So, sort of bring your own money, not just bring your own power. They have a lot of money. I think they are very sensitive to the politics of this, and they're not—these are not stupid people. So, when you're a utility, you need to expand capacity, which costs money, which increases rates. You're going to look to the proximate reason for that to pay for it. Now, whether that is you bring your own power plant and build it off-grid, whether that's you pay for the power plant preemptively by refurbishing an old one or paying the utility to build a new one, whatever the mechanism is, there will, I think, be a lot of pressure on the demand side—that is, the data centers—to offset these costs themselves rather than having the ratepayers pay for that. We've already seen that. In a few cases, public service commissions have reversed decisions made by utilities to build power for a data center on the ratepayers' back, to say you're not going to do that. And the PJM region, which is the big grid operator from Chicago to New York, they've sent a very clear signal out that if you want this kind of power demand, you're going to have to find a way to not only just cover the cost of electricity, but also cover the cost of reliability.

Jim Puplava:

What about—let's talk about utilities for a minute. If you look at until AI and EVs came about—originally they were worried about EVs and what that would do—but utilities' growth was about maybe a half a percent a year. Now they're growing at close to 3% a year. I think this came as a big shock to the utility industry, and I don't know if they were prepared for it.

Mark Mills:

No, they weren't. In a moment of self-promotion, I will point out that I've spoken at utility meetings—for the last 15 years—making the claim that the interregnum of flat load growth would end. And it would end for two reasons. We would not be able to harvest any more efficiency gains—mostly efficiency gains in electric growth were a one-time thing. You know, going from regular light bulbs to LEDs—it's a one-time gain. They can't keep doing that over and over again. And we would go from an era of minimal demand growth—modest economic growth, new technologies—to more demand growth from, to your point, not just EVs but reshoring factories, getting general economies to grow, and now data centers. These are all predictable things. Now, utilities' mindset—and this is painting with a broad brush; there is a lot of diversity in the hundreds of utilities out there, as you know—there's hundreds of electric utilities, investor-owned, co-ops, and public powers. So there's a lot of diversity of intellectual opinion and skills, let's just say. But painting with a broad brush, the industry has been locked into a no-growth mentality—to your point, half percent or less—while also simultaneously locked into a replacement mentality. That is, we can shut down hydrocarbon plants—gas plants and coal plants—and replace them with episodic power plants—wind and solar—by harvesting subsidies from the government, the federal government largely, and some state governments. You could get away with that during a no-growth period, up to a point. And the point ends when you can't keep grids reliable without spending more money. Episodic power is unreliable inherently, and that happens simultaneously with growth. So, it's a long way of saying that you're absolutely right, Jim. They were not prepared for this. The mindset and the operational strategy of a lot of utilities was essentially managing a no-growth period and a ""transition"" away from traditional power generation. Now, what they're in is an era coming back to—I'll call it ""team reality."" We have growth and the need for additions, not replacements or transitions. We're not going to get rid of windmills and we're going to build lots more of them. I mean, the one big beautiful bill—the OBB as it's called—did not eliminate subsidies, it cut them back and put a time period. But there's going to be a lot more windmills and solar arrays built to harvest the credits that are still left after the OBB passed. And they're going to be integrated into the grid one way or the other. The trick now is to figure out how to do that without compromising either reliability or affordability. And that's going to take some fancy footwork—let's just put it that way.

Jim Puplava:

I almost call this, Mark, the perfect storm for energy. You have demand coming from EVs, you have demand coming from reshoring all these factories we're going to bring back, and then you throw AI and the cloud on top of all three hitting the energy market at the same time.

Mark Mills:

So here's the challenge. You know what happens when demand outruns supply—this is your, I'm talking in your business, your métier—prices go up. So, then we normally say, well, a market will respond. If you raise the price of something, businesses will respond and harvest that higher revenue. But now you're talking about a regulated industry, where there's consumers who do not want prices to go up and the politicians that impact industry do not want higher-priced electricity. So this is the collision—the challenge, the fancy footwork I'm talking about. You're absolutely right. Everybody wants to reshore. Lots of people love EVs. EVs are great, by the way; I just don't subsidize them. Millions more are going to be bought because they're great, great fun, a lot of utility value, and so forth. And markets want AI. We know that because the demand for AI products is soaring. Never mind that the reason they're being built is not because of mandates—there's no subsidies to build data centers for AI. What's happening is the consumers—that is, both businesses and individuals—are using and buying the products and services that AI is enabling. So there's a huge tailwind for all three vectors you described, never mind politicians and subsidies. But it's running headlong into this challenge of demand outstripping supply, which stimulates higher prices, which will just crash right into the affordability politics.

Jim Puplava:

You know, how does this work? We know utilities are a very capital-intensive business. So if they have to build new power plants, expand the grid, transmission lines, that's going to take capital—a lot of money. If our politicians are hammering the utilities as the reason people's utility rates are going up and they limit them, where are they going to get the money? How's this going to work if they hammer the utilities and make them the boogeyman?

Mark Mills:

Yeah, well, I would say there isn't an infinite supply of capital, but the supply of dry powder, as they say in that industry—infrastructure fund capital globally that would love to invest in America—is enormous. There's trillions of dollars of capital looking to invest in exactly this kind of thing. In the United States, we're still the best place to deploy that kind of capital in terms of reliability of the broader market economy. There are going to have to be creative solutions. And the creative solutions will be at the two ends of the spectrum. One is, some of it will get built off-grid—just fully off-grid. The money, because the data centers need to be built, you build power plants to run the data center itself, isolated from the grid, and therefore the service will go into the Internet, the magic cloud. But it won't consume electricity from the common pool and raise rates. That's one solution. The other solution is that the data center companies themselves offset those costs when the utility builds the power plants. Because utilities are very good at building power plants and distributing power—they've been doing it for well over a century. We're one and a half centuries into the utility industry. Nothing is different about it structurally now than it's ever been. They know how to do this. They're just going to have to be very creative about who pays. So, some of that can be done through artful accounting, but it always devolves to that old question: who pays? And the goal will be to have legal structures, regulatory contracts, that result in the consumer not paying. That's what's going to have to happen. I just don't see any get-out-of-jail card on this. I mean, modest increases, sure. You know what politicians and public service commissions do? They'll cut a deal that says—and this is because they don't care about the future—politicians are going to have to face this. The deal will be, we'll pay for it, we the utility, and what the public service commission will give them is a rate increase of 1.5% or 2% or something de minimis. Now, that will ratchet up over the next decade or two decades. Well, if you’ve got a regulatory ratchet built in, you can take that to the bank—literally—and finance that. The problem is, five, ten years out when electric rates then have to start to follow the ratchet, the politicians in that future are going to be very unhappy with the politicians of the past that cut that deal. But those are the kinds of deals that have been cut before in the utility industry, and they'll be cut again. And to be philosophically cynical, it's not a bad way to do it. If what we get is an economic boom from AI—and that's what I, as you know, predict in my book—then the people of the future will be richer than us in the present. They can afford the higher rates. I mean, that's the nature of the beast.

Jim Puplava:

What about, I mean, you know, we talk about these three forces that are creating all this demand for energy and electricity. I've seen where some of the big companies are even talking about locating AI data centers in the Middle East. We had the Saudi prince at the White House, and all the tech titans were there for dinner. So what are the chances that you may see that, maybe to relieve some of the pressure here and the availability of electricity, to go to the Middle East?

Mark Mills:

That's already happening, as you say. I mean, everybody—firstly, building a gigawatt-scale data center is now sort of a sign of modernity and status. So, we're going to see a lot of that. Just like a lot of countries want to have their own automobile industry because it's a sign of modernity and status, even though the world gets oversupplied with cars, generally speaking. So you'll see that. There's two problems with that, at the macro level. There have been lots of data centers everywhere. The United States is building about 75% right now of all the new data centers—they're being built in the United States. United States already has 70%—if you measure compute power in FLOPS, you know, floating logic operations per second—the United States has 70-plus percent of the world's compute power. The continental United States—something like half of the global Internet traffic flows physically through the United States. So, the epicenter is here. And it's here not because energy is relatively cheap here—cheaper than most places; the only place that's cheaper is China and the Middle East. China because they like coal power, built lots of coal plants and they're building lots more; and here because we got there early and we have cheap primary energy, especially natural gas and earlier on, coal. So, you'll see some more of this. But by and large, it's going to be here because the skills are here, the epicenter's here, the technology is here. The other issue, of course, is how the AI is used. So if the AI—you've probably heard some of the progenitors of AI start to use this nomenclature—they're not calling these data centers anymore; they're calling them ""AI factories."" It's a building in which we fabricate a large language model that will make pretty pictures, like the new Gemini 3 from Google, or will answer semantic questions in natural language. So we have to build the model. Once the model's built, the model can run lots of other places. Well, you can build those models anywhere. But the problem with that is that most of the value in building the model—and most of the energy used—is in using the model, not building it. And when you use the model, generally, distance is not your friend. So, the speed of light turns out to be a problem, even though it may seem like it's very fast. As a physicist, I'll tell you, the speed of light's very fast, but it's the fastest thing that we think exists in the universe. But information moves close to the speed of light. But speed of light means that if you want fast things—control systems and automation—you can't have the data centers' inference and logic more than, typically, if it's financial transactions, it's dozens of miles; if it's other kinds of transactions, maybe 100, 200 miles; you have to be very close to the activity. So the speed of light actually turns out to be a limiting factor for a lot of things that you want to use data for—you can't put it too far away. So there'll be stuff going on for those countries for their own need for data centers, because everybody's going to need a data center. They're everywhere now. Give or take, there are 8,000 data centers in the world, roughly. There are 5,000 in the United States. So, the world has a lot of them too. We'll build lots more. They're in Russia, they're in China, they're in Myanmar. People have only recently, because of AI, discovered the phrase ""data center,"" the technical term. But it's not new. We're in—I guess if I'm thinking of a better analogy—we're in the second phase of the build-out of a great revolution.

Jim Puplava:

So, when you take a look at this, there are people that are questioning, ""Oh, we're spending all this money—I mean massive amounts of money."" Even the tech companies have found a way to finance this; they're issuing debt. So what about profitability?

Mark Mills:

So right now, based on, you know, I'm just going on data from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs and the Bank of America analysts—so the Magnificent Seven are spending about 30 to 40% of their cash flow on capex. So they're still way below spending all their cash flow. So even though there's a lot of debt in the mix, as a share of cash flow, it's below total cash flow. So the question answers itself—they're still minting a lot of money. They're not consuming more than they're producing. And the marginal value of AI generating more cash flow is what they're counting on. Obviously, they're expecting that hundreds of billions being deployed will generate revenues. So I'll give you a sort of order-of-magnitude number: the global cloud services data centers generate these software-as-a-service in the cloud. So the total market for global cloud services—that is, the businesses and consumers buying services in the cloud—is approaching a trillion dollars a year of spending right now. A trillion a year, and it'll rise to about 2 trillion a year, based on old models—that is, pre-AI models. So you could ask yourself this just macro question: How much money would an industry spend on capex per year to harvest a trillion-dollar per year market consuming the products that the capex serves? Well, you could spend half of it and not be crazy in a growth phase. I mean, a lot of investors would like to harvest all the profits, of course, but as a business, you're trying to capture future profits. That's what this game is. So, we're sort of in a growth phase where everybody's trying to guess how much we have to spend now to stimulate more growth, and how much of that share of growth—increased cloud revenues—each player is going to get. There are going to be winners and losers. Some people will get out over their skis and spend too much; some won't spend enough and they'll lose market share and disappear. But, macro, U.S. big tech—Magnificent Seven—are well below collectively spending half of their cash flow on capex. So, I mean, I'm not a financial wizard like you are, Jim, but I don't think that's the crisis. I don't think that's a problem. I think that's probably quasi-rational.

Jim Puplava:

How do you see all of this coming together and changing the shape of the economy? You know, we're talking about robotics, we're talking about reshoring, and now AI. How do you see that changing? I was talking to a doctor, client, and friend, and he was saying he sees, like, a radiologist could maybe be phased out because it'll just go to AI and analyze the X-rays.

Mark Mills:

Yeah. So, the big answer to the question is: read my book ""The Cloud Revolution,"" because that's why I wrote the book. It came out just before ChatGPT came on the market, but a third of the book is about AI, and I addressed the answer to the question of what's going to happen to different parts of our economy—to manufacturing, to education, to entertainment, to transportation. AI is fundamentally a productivity tool. The reason markets use it is because it makes things more productive. If it didn't, it wouldn’t be used. Entertainment is a separate issue but it's a form of productivity. And so I'm very bullish on what this means for the economy at large as it's democratized, which has implications of all kinds, but the bottom line—sort of underlying it all—it's very productive. And that productivity feature, just to give you an example, just arithmetically—if it were the case, as you know, the United States is in a productivity deficit. The productivity growth rate, which drives everything in the economy, is running about half of the long-run average since World War II. If AI can restore our productivity growth rate just to the long-run average, never mind beyond it—which I think it will do; I think it'll take it up to old highs—but let's just say it did the long-run average. So, we're running at a 1.4% per year productivity growth rate. Long-run average is about 2.2. Peak periods, we had 3 to 4% productivity growth rate. Now, this doesn't sound like a lot, but as you know, compound averages really kick in here. If we restore to the long-run average over the next decade, the U.S. economy will harvest a cumulative $10 trillion more wealth than we would otherwise have. Ten trillion! I mean, that's free money in a sense, right? The economy will be $10 trillion—cumulative—bigger. That has a lot of implications for health care, Social Security, for people fighting over limited money—everything. It also has implications for energy demand, because a wealthier economy consumes more energy. In fact, I think that's the biggest energy event. Roughly speaking, I calculated, back-of-the-envelope, that the energy demand induced by a wealthier economy over the next decade will be 20 times bigger than the energy needed to fuel the AI that creates the bigger economy. So, the real energy demand that's going to come from this is a bigger economy. But the question you asked—a specific one—will it kill jobs? Well, of course it will kill some jobs. That's the whole point of productivity. Productivity is intended to reduce inputs to get the same outputs. That means less labor, less material. That's the point of it. That's been the point of it for centuries. This is not new. What's new is that we finally get some productivity coming back in the economy. What's always worrisome, though, about productivity-driven job disruptions—we've been there many times in history—is they're politically volatile too, because there are always winners and losers. I'm not downplaying the political challenges. We have more tools to deal with them now—not just unemployment and retraining, and we're wealthy. But in a weird way, the AI itself is a tool that can ameliorate the job disruption effects, because AI itself allows new skills and new training and upskilling much faster than old ways of retraining and upskilling. So, it's going to be both complicated and ugly, but it's not an apocalypse. The idea that—I'll give you one specific example: the classic automation tool, the ATM—automated teller machines. The apocryphal story is, it got rid of the bank teller, and that's what's going to happen—AI on steroids. Okay, I agree. It's going to be just like the ATM machine, but—except that the data, according to the Census Bureau, tell a different story. From the early 1980s, when ATMs started coming into the game, the number of ATMs in the market in the United States is 800% greater than in 1980. How about bank tellers? There are 20% more bank tellers in the United States now than there were in 1980. Not zero, not 20% less—more. Now, the number of bank tellers did not grow as fast as it did in the previous 40 years—gee, what a shock. So, the story will repeat itself. That's the more common AI story. AI will do to most jobs what automated teller machines did to the teller business. It changed the character of what most tellers do. You know, dispersing cash was what a lot of tellers spent their time doing. They don't do much of that anymore. Most people go to an ATM or use Zelle or Venmo, right?

Jim Puplava:

Yeah. The thing that really strikes me, I guess from a positive point of view, I'm taking a look at the demand for blue-collar jobs that are going to be needed—whether you're building factories, building AI centers, not to mention commercial and residential buildings. So, the blue-collar person with higher wages—because when you don't have enough of them, what happens? Wages go up to attract people to the industry. So, that's positive. And then, you know, you take a look at reshoring, robotics—all these kind of things that we're bringing back—it's like a great industrial renaissance.

Mark Mills:

All right, listen, I'm bullish on this.

Jim Puplava:

I'm not.

Mark Mills:

I mean, I'm not a Pollyanna, naive about negatives and hard times and disruptions in the politics—the Mandami class really being unhappy about the disruption. I mean, I get all that.

Jim Puplava:

I'm not.

Mark Mills:

Nor am I naive about the fact that economic flourishing doesn't mean we end wars. Anybody that studies history knows that the state of an economy and the prospects for wars are not correlated in any particular way. Wars happen because bad things happen. But you're right—this is a renaissance. But here's the language error: we all use analogies because analogies help us understand. So, we talk about this as an Industrial Revolution, the fourth Industrial Revolution, whatever. It's not an industrial revolution—it's everything. Industry is part of the economy. It's a very important part of the economy, and it will cause revolutionary impacts in industry. But it's a structural revolution in the economy, which is really a very different beast than the Industrial Revolution. And in fact, it's much more important and far-reaching than just the Industrial Revolution. As consequential as the Industrial Revolution was, this is bigger. I think it's—and it's happening at a point in time when we need it, because of demographics, to your point, because of inflationary pressures. There are all kinds of features that can be addressed by this class of revolution. So, we use the word ""industry"" because it's a generic term. But obviously, many of the jobs that are being amplified by AI are not industrial jobs, right? They're information sector jobs or service sector jobs, they're transportation jobs. In fact, the hardest thing to automate has been industry. We went through a great eruption—to use Carlotta Perez's term—of automation in manufacturing with the Industrial Revolution, from steam and electrification and motors and control systems. And that brought productivity gains which have not been matched in all of history. I mean, the number of labor hours needed to make a car or a ton of steel went down fourfold—not 40%, fourfold. Now, AI hasn't done anything close to that yet. But if it does—and I think it will—across the various markets, it will do exactly the same thing as happened last time. It'll be a massive tailwind for the economy, contemporaneous with some very consequential social and political challenges. And we're seeing the hints of some of that already. Again, back to the Mondaire Jones vote—that's in the Bernie Sanders wing of the political class, where they rail against the oligarchs who make these businesses and technologies, the robber barons. That all began during the great Industrial Revolution, as you know, of the so-called robber baron age. And the idea of a robber baron, that phrase was coined by the people who hated the big industrialists—not because they weren't making things better or cheaper for people—but because they had a lot of power, economic and political power. And it created a reaction. And this is, you know, so we're in the same kind of world, which promoted my book again, where I pointed out what was going on in the 1920s. We were at the same kind of conflict from 1900 through the 1920s for very much the same reasons.

Jim Puplava:

You know, I should have you back on the program just to discuss that book. It was very prescient. I mean, you wrote that—what was it, '22 you wrote that?

Mark Mills:

Yeah, it came out—January was really, it was released right at the beginning of the year '21, but '22 was right on the cusp of ChatGPT showing up on the landscape. But yeah, no, it was prescient. Thank you, Jim, but only because I, as I put in the book, I only predicted stuff that already happened.

Jim Puplava:

Well, let me throw this one on. Given all these scenarios, what would be a black swan event that could maybe be overlooked, that nobody is seeing that could come out of the blue? And then, you know, I think of the financial crisis that we went through in 2007 and 2008—mortgages, real estate, the financial market was going, and then all of a sudden, boom, something hit. Can you think of anything in the back of your mind that might disrupt this?

Mark Mills:

You know, when it comes to black swans, there's a reason we call them black swans. But even though black swans are common, by the way—it's an interesting phrase, common in the southern hemisphere, but that's a detail—black swans are uncommon here, where we write about them. So black swans fall into two categories almost always throughout history, and they do have a pattern. The pattern is because of people—politics and people. And by that, I mean the two classes of black swans that are impossible to predict except that they always happen at times we can't expect. One is war, which is very worrisome. Wars are black swans—I mean, but I don't mean isolated wars, big wars. And we pray and hope that there isn't going to be another one of those, because that changes everything, obviously. But the more common one is recessions. And recessions are triggered by political malfeasance and policy malfeasance and stupidity and greed of politicians and policymakers and players in the ecosystem that sort of, because there's regulations—unavoidable—politics are in regulation, in markets where you have kleptocrats that are bad actors, that's a toxic brew that episodically erupts into black swan events. And could we have a market crash because of a combination of things that will be obvious in hindsight, but not in advance? Sure. And would a market crash take the steam out of the capital available for propelling the AI boom? Yeah, of course. Of course it will delay it—it won't end it. The Great Depression did not end the great efflorescence of technology of the 20th century. If you measure the 20th century's wealth expansion—unprecedented in history—yet we had the biggest depression in modern history, and we had two horrific global wars. But the great wealth expansion still happened, but it got interrupted by human malfeasance and stupidity. So—yeah. Can we do it again? Sure, count on it. I'm just hoping and praying we at least get a run as long as the 1920s and the crash of '29 is our 2039.

Jim Puplava:

Well, I mean, my own state is a good example. We just—I think this year, at the end of the year, we're losing two more refiners. Chevron just moved out to Texas, and we have the highest gas and the highest utility rates in the country. And it's all, as you mentioned, it's all policy. We shut down our gas plants, we shut down one of our nuclear power plants, and we've got wind and solar, which are intermittent.

Mark Mills:

Yeah, no, these are all bad policies. They're harvesting the consequences of it. And if it keeps going, of course it can be catastrophic. And the catastrophe doesn't have to be economic—it can be political. Because when people get angry, you don't know what kind of government they're going to elect. It won't necessarily be a right-thinking—but I mean a sensibly thinking, free-market, democratic-oriented leader. You can end up with very bad outcomes when people get angry. And I—that's what I worry about. I mean, you know, I will again promote my book. At the end of my introduction, I point out that my book is not about politics. I only have two political observations in the book, in the introduction and the epilogue. And in the introduction, I point out that I don't talk about the politics of technology in my book, but I do point out—and I quoted Charles Krauthammer, who was asked before he died why he spent his life as a political commentator, even though he was a PhD psychiatric scientist trained at Harvard. He planned to go into research—psychiatric research. Brilliant guy. He became a political commentator because—I quote him saying this; it's stuck in my mind ever since he said it, I didn't know the man personally—well, I met him a few times. ""If you don't get the politics right, nothing else matters."" Okay? Amen.

Jim Puplava:

Wow, so true. And my own state is a good example. You know, one other thing—there was a gal by the name of Meredith Whitney, and she wrote a book called ""The State of the States,"" and she was talking about where industry jobs growth was going to go—sort of like in the middle of the country, over red flyover land. And if you look at where some of these data centers are going, they're going to places where there's not regulation, good political climate—Florida, places like that. I almost can see this happening because we're losing—we've lost over 400 major corporations: Oracle, Tesla, Hewlett Packard.

Mark Mills:

Yeah, it's already happened. This is, again, you don't have to predict the future, you can predict what's already happened. So, the epicenter of data centers was Virginia, and still a lot being built there. But now it's going to Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Dakota, Wyoming—but especially Texas, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and Oklahoma. Epicenters of, we'll call it, sane policies and lots of energy.

Jim Puplava:

You know, you wrote about where these new centers are going, and it really struck me about North Dakota. I mean, it's freezing there, they've got snow. But you know, if it's the regulations and everything's favorable, why not?

Mark Mills:

Well, the energy is abundant, and it's a lot for North Dakota. I mean, the data centers being built in North Dakota will consume more electricity than the entire population of North Dakota by a lot. It's because there's only a million people in North Dakota. So, you only have to build a couple of data centers and you're beating the population. But Canada's building data centers too, because they need them and also because they have cheap energy there. But again, the epicenter is currently, and I think will stay, the United States. I think there's enough bipartisan enthusiasm—again, remind everyone, I'm not naive about the anxieties and the challenges. I recognize those. And the opposition to data centers—they're big, big, big ugly buildings; you shouldn't put them beside residential areas any more than you put any other factory next to a nice residential area, in my view. But you know, this is—there's a widespread recognition, a bipartisan recognition, that this is a non-trivial, economically important, and geopolitically and strategically important private market-driven, private market-invested boom. And so, you want to facilitate that, you want that to happen now—with all the number of caveats. But you want it to happen. There is a bipartisan sense of that in the United States now, despite so much division and so much else. That's true. It's spilled over into nuclear energy to help fuel the next phase of data centers. This is great. Let's take advantage of it. I think there's some political momentum to find one narrow area of bipartisan comity.

Jim Puplava:

One final question, if I may. There's talk about the AI race between the U.S. and China. As you look at both countries, how do you see that playing out? Do you see the U.S. as the winner?

Mark Mills:

We're winning now—just in sheer volume of data centers, we're winning, largely in terms of the underlying technology. So yeah, I think right now we're winning. If it matters who's winners and losers, how does it play out over the next decade? It will have a lot to do with politics. I think we're likely—I mean, my epilogue in my book says I think we win. It's the 21st century as America's, not China's. And I don't say that jingoistically; I'm just saying this structurally in terms of population and demographics and entrepreneurship and capital markets that are free. But in the short term, China's got very good engineers. I've been to a dozen cities in China—very, very good, terrific manufacturing of factories. They're working very, very hard to catch up because economic power is geopolitical power, and they're not unaware of that, nor are we.

Jim Puplava:

It's interesting. I read a book called ""Breakneck,"" and it was a Chinese individual who talked about the difference between China and the U.S. He said China is made up of engineers—I think Xi is a chemical engineer—whereas the U.S. is made up of lawyers.

Mark Mills:

Yeah, I know. Well, that's part of the problem. Yeah, it is. Well, I like a lot of lawyers—there are some lawyers in our family. There are some very good lawyers. My longtime business partner was a brilliant lawyer and also a PhD mechanical engineer—he had both brains. Yeah, you look—the United States, a large number of our problems are self-inflicted wounds based on regulations and policies. And I would say that we're in the process of fixing that. That's what I see politically and structurally. And the beauty of the subsidiarity of our states is that even though the federal government may not be fixing it really quickly, we see at least a dozen states—maybe two dozen—that are rapidly trying to fix the problems of building factories, building data centers, restoring job opportunities. So, this is what most governors are hyper-focused on—most. So, I'm cautiously optimistic that this will trickle up into changing the federal system too.

Jim Puplava:

Well, as we close, why don't you bring up your book once again—fabulous, prescient book. And this article, which is on your website, the Center for Energy Analytics—""The Rise of AI,"" which is must reading if you really want to understand how this all works and all the various implications of energy.

Mark Mills:

So, the book—the book's easy to find at Amazon, you know, the magic Google machine. It's ""The Cloud Revolution"" with my name. You know, it's still there; they still publish it, they still sell it. And, you know, because as I said, I only predicted what's already underway. The fact that it's a few years old just means that you can—you can test whether the theories I promoted are happening and whether the ideas of where this is going would be true. That report, which is relatively dense—it's, I think, 20-plus pages, so it's not super long, it's graph- and data-rich—looks at the architecture of what's happening on AI and energy. As you said, it's free at the National Center for Energy Analytics website, which is energyanalytics.org. But again, just look up ""Mark Mills data centers AI"" and Dr. Google will point you right to it. I did a lecture when we released the report—a 20-minute lecture on the report—which I think will be available to put on YouTube. When it's available, I'll send it to you.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, we'll put up some links. Just out of curiosity, why did you start the Center for Energy Analytics? That's a good thing. That's quite in-depth.

Mark Mills:

I ask myself that too. Well, short story is, there wasn't an independent think tank focused on energy—a national energy think tank. Universities have some think tanks, but that's not the same. There are lots of think tanks that focus on the environment or policy that relates to regulations and the economy, and the absence of such a beast—you know, I had colleagues and friends who agreed with me there needed to be one, and I got volunteered, in the Army sense of the word, to launch it about a year and a half ago. So, we're a real think tank now, putting on a lot of stuff. I welcome everybody.

Jim Puplava:

It's one of my go-to sites on energy, so—well, listen, Mark, I want to thank you as always for coming on the program. You're one of our most requested guests, so I saw the article and I said I got to get you on the program.

Mark Mills:

Well, thank you for having me back into the circle of trust, because your network is powerful and I hear from people after I do a podcast with you—I hear more often from—just say, this is not me blowing smoke up your skirt, as they say—but I hear more often from people when I'm on your podcast than when I do pretty much anything else. So, you're up in the top quintile, which is wonderful, and thank you.

Jim Puplava:

Well, listen, have a great Thanksgiving and a great rest of the year, and I hope to talk to you again next year.

Mark Mills:

Well, if you invite me back, I'll come back. Likewise. Have a great, great year-end. Take care, Jim.

Rising geopolitical tensions underscore the urgent need to diversify away from fossil fuels.
Equally important, the fossil-fuel phaseout must be central to climate negotiations.","BELÉM – Calls to reduce the use of fossil fuels are becoming impossible to ignore. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Brazil (COP30), major producers are being pressed to begin planning for the phasing down of oil, gas, and coal in a just and orderly way.

For decades, climate negotiations have focused on emissions targets and clean-energy pledges while sidestepping the politically explosive question of whether – and how quickly – countries should phase out fossil-fuel production. COP28 broke new ground by introducing the phrase “transition away from fossil fuels,” but real progress has remained slow and uneven. At COP30, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has reset the tone, declaring that “the Earth can no longer sustain the intensive use of fossil fuels” and calling for a clear roadmap for phasing them out.

Resistance to a phaseout has historically come from major producer countries and energy companies. But many governments with legitimate social-justice concerns are also reluctant to support such a move, fearing it would impede efforts to reduce inequality and fund essential services.

Brazil, a rising energy power with vast renewable potential, but also deep poverty and a thriving offshore oil sector, is a prime example. When Lula argued that fossil-fuel dependence must end in a “planned and just” manner, he signaled that an orderly phaseout can support development rather than undermine it.

For Brazil, the challenge is to strengthen its global standing while navigating its own energy transition. Lula’s plan for a national fund that would direct some of Brazil’s oil revenues toward the green transition reflects this balance: the rents of the old economy would be used to build the new one without harming workers and vulnerable communities.

Such an approach is not without precedent. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, built on decades of oil revenues, invests heavily in low-carbon sectors worldwide and supports initiatives like the Amazon Fund. And in Southeast Asia, East Timor – heavily reliant on petroleum and gas – has pursued diversification strategies financed through its own resource revenues.

These examples show that channeling fossil-fuel income toward the green transition is both feasible and necessary. For too long, the idea has been treated as taboo by climate advocates, owing to fears that even discussing oil money might legitimize continued extraction.

Avoiding the issue, however, leaves resource-dependent countries without the means to finance their transitions before revenues dwindle. Until climate finance reaches the scale required, governments must support equitable, justice-oriented energy transitions by channeling fossil-fuel revenues through well-governed sovereign wealth funds.

Early efforts to repurpose resource income point to a broader shift. A decade ago, few governments could imagine a future without fossil fuels. But economic realities have changed: renewables are now cost-competitive, clean-fuel technologies have matured, and developing countries increasingly view the energy transition as a pathway to greater productivity, resilience, competitiveness, and sovereignty.

Brazil’s experience illustrates this trend. Like many resource-rich countries, it has long relied on oil rents to fund social programs and infrastructure; between 2011 and 2023, only a tiny fraction of federal royalties flowed to its main climate fund. It has since expanded its biofuels industry, started developing sustainable aviation fuels, and scaled up renewables, generating jobs in regions historically tied to extraction and showing that the energy transition can reinforce – not replace – a country’s development agenda.

Rising geopolitical tensions underscore the urgent need to diversify away from fossil fuels. With supply chains realigning, competition for global leadership in battery production, green hydrogen, sustainable infrastructure, and circular manufacturing is intensifying. At the same time, the International Energy Agency expects oil demand to plateau by 2035 even without stronger climate action, while OPEC sees demand growing through mid-century. Whatever the exact timeline, economies that are slow to diversify will be left with stranded assets once global consumption declines.

That risk is especially acute for Brazil, which has invested heavily in deep-water drilling. Just weeks before COP30, Brazil’s environmental agency granted Petrobras a license to drill at the mouth of the Amazon River – a highly sensitive ecological zone. Petrobras and some government officials argue that exploration is necessary for energy security, while environmental groups say the decision undermines Brazil’s climate leadership.

A clear, well-structured transition plan – rather than ad hoc, case-by-case decision-making – might have prevented these tensions. If Brazil wants its COP30 leadership to have a lasting impact, it must ensure that its new transition fund is more than symbolic. The government should clarify revenue allocations, establish transparent governance structures, and encourage civil-society participation. Integrating the fund into the country’s ecological transition plan would help channel resources toward job-creating sectors such as sustainable fuels, renewable energy, green industry, and climate-resilient infrastructure.

Internationally, Brazil must use its COP30 presidency to advance a cooperative approach to phasing out fossil fuels. The Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance – launched by Costa Rica and Denmark – has attempted to promote supply-side action, but major producers have stayed on the sidelines. Brazil could help bridge this divide by encouraging parties to develop guidelines for an orderly and flexible reduction in fossil-fuel production.

These discussions must produce a roadmap with clear criteria for determining realistic timelines that reflect national capabilities and historical responsibilities, as well as mechanisms that build on existing institutions rather than adding new layers of bureaucracy. Equally important, the fossil-fuel phaseout must be central to climate negotiations. This would signal that multilateralism still matters; that countries can collectively confront even the most politically sensitive issues; that fossil fuels are no longer treated as untouchable; and that producer states are willing to engage in a structured, cooperative process.

Ultimately, the green transition depends on confronting the issue of fossil-fuel revenues head-on. Otherwise, climate ambition cannot be reconciled with economic and political realities. Brazil has taken a bold step by raising this question at COP30 and framing transition as a socioeconomic opportunity, not just an ecological imperative. The challenge now is to turn the resulting discussion into a coherent plan – at home and globally.",https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/9b7233428034dc1bef9faf6f1d031a4e.2-1-super.1.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 12:01:14.910864

It’s a made-in-America approach to manufacturing for First Solar outpace manufacturing capabilities of companies in China, said CEO Mark Widmar.","When the site selection process began for First Solar to find its next manufacturing facility, leaders in Iberia Parish and Acadiana got to work.

There were at least 10 in the running to land billion-dollar project that would bring hundreds of jobs. Two of them were out of the country. When the Iberia Parish site made the cut for the final three, things got interesting.

“We were really excited when we got to the top three,” said Mike Tarantino, ppresident and CEO of the Iberia Industrial Development Foundation. “That’s when we really had to put on our championship jackets and really work hard. We’re so happy First Solar chose us. We’re so excited to see this plant come to fruition.”

On Friday, First Solar’s leadership team along with local elected officials and other leaders celebrated the company’s inauguration at its New Iberia plant, opening its 2.4 million square foot building — now the largest facility under one roof in Louisiana — that represents its $1.1 billion investment in Iberia Parish.

It marked the end of a two-year process since it was announced in August 2023. Now the company will employ 826 and offer an average compensation package of $90,000.

“Today is a huge win for Iberia Parish,” said Millard Mulé, policy director for Gov. Jeff Landry. “It’s a huge win for our state’s workers, and it’s a huge win for Louisiana’s economy. First Solar's investment is bringing hundreds of great, high-quality American manufacturing jobs in the community.”

It’s another step in First Solar’s rapid growth across the U.S. When it announced plans to locate it Iberia Parish, the news was that it would be its fifth facility in the country and have a payroll of at least $40 million.

The plant opened in July, months ahead of schedule. Last week it announced plans to open a similar plant in South Carolina, its ninth overall.

The company will produce its Series 7 modules using American materials, including glass from Illinois and Ohio along with steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

It’s a made-in-America approach to manufacturing for First Solar outpace manufacturing capabilities of companies in China, said CEO Mark Widmar.

“A level playing field — that’s all we need,” he said. “American workers can out-innovate and out-compete if given the opportunity. We're incredibly proud to inaugurate this facility as a symbol of American energy dominance and re-industrialization.”

The plant will also utilize artificial intelligence by using computer vision and deep learning to quickly detect defects in its products during production, officials said. Its technicians and operators can use AI tools to make operating adjustments and guide their decision making.

It will also add 3.5 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity, taking First Solar’s manufacturing footprint to 14 gigawatts by 2026 and 17.7 in 2027 when the South Carolina facility is expected to open.

First Solar, which has opened facilities in other similar-sized markets, expected to employ 5,500 people by the end of next year and have invested $4.5 billion in American manufacturing.

“We’ve been able to be successful to go into communities, in some cases, that other companies have left,” Widmar said. “Our factory that we put in Alabama, there was a paper mill there. Those guys went to China. We went back into that community, revived it and now it’s thriving. That’s what we want to do.”

They want more to be done to transform the world's food system.

Protesters gathered outside a new space at the talks, the industry-sponsored “Agrizone,” to call for a transition toward a more grassroots food system, even as hundreds of lobbyists for big agriculture companies are attending the talks.

Though agriculture contributes about a third of Earth-warming emissions worldwide, most of the money dedicated to fighting climate change goes to causes other than agriculture, according to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization.

The FAO didn't offer any single answer as to how that spending should be shifted, or on what foods people should be eating.

“All the countries are coming together. I don’t think we can impose on them one specific worldview,” said Kaveh Zahedi, director of the organization's Office of Climate Change, Biodiversity and Environment.

Research has generally shown that a plant-based diet can be better for health and the planet. But many people in poverty around the world who are hardest hit by climate change depend on animal sources of protein for survival. People in higher-income countries have more options for a healthy diet without meat. But those people still tend to contribute more to climate change with their dietary choices.

""We have to be very, very aware and conscious of those nuances, those differences that exist,” Zahedi said.

An alternative universe at COP for agriculture

When world leaders gather every year to try to address climate change, they spend much of their time in a giant, artificial world that typically gets built up just for the conference.

One corner of COP30, as this year's conference is known, featured the alternative universe of AgriZone, where visitors could step into a world of immersive videos and exhibits with live plants and food products. Those included a research farm that Brazilian national agricultural research corporation Embrapa built to showcase what they call low-carbon farming methods for raising cattle, and growing crops like corn and soy as well as ways to integrate cover crops like legumes or trees like teak and eucalyptus.

Ana Euler, executive director of innovation, business and technology transfer at Embrapa, said her industry can offer solutions needed especially in the Global South where climate change is hitting hardest.

""We need to be part of the discussions in terms of climate funds,"" Euler said. ""We researchers, we speak loud, but nobody listens.”

AgriZone was averaging about 2,000 visitors a day during COP30's two-week run, said Gabriel Faria, an Embrapa spokesman. That included tours for Queen Mary of Denmark, COP President André Corrêa do Lago and other Brazilian state and local officials.

But while the AgriZone seeks to spread a message of lower-carbon agriculture possibilities, industrial agriculture retains a big influence at the climate talks. The climate-focused news site DeSmog reported that more than 300 industrial agriculture lobbyists are attending COP30.

In the face of big industry, some call for a voice for smallholder farmers

On a humid evening at COP30's opening, a group of activists gathered on the grassy center of a busy roundabout in front of the AgriZone to call for food systems that prioritize good working conditions and sustainability and for industry lobbyists to not be allowed at the talks.

Those with the most sway are ""not the smallholder food producers, … not the peasants, and … definitely not all these people in the Global South that are experiencing the brunt of the crisis,"" said Pang Delgra, an activist with the Asian People’s Movement on Debt and Development who was among the protesters. “It’s this industrial agriculture and corporate lobbyists that are shifting the narrative inside COPs.”

As Indigenous people pushed to be heard at a COP that was supposed to be about them, some also called for countries to honor their knowledge of land stewardship.

“We have to decolonize our thoughts. It’s not just about changing to a different food,” said Sara Omi, from the Embera people of Panama and president of the Coordination of Territorial Leaders of the Mesoamerican Alliance of Peoples and Forests.

“The agro-industrial systems are not the solution,"" she added.

In environments where chemical exposure can pose an invisible threat—from aircraft hangars to hospital rooms—XploSafe is equipping workers and responders with a new kind of protection. Based in Oklahoma, XploSafe has developed the XCel+ line of personal and environmental samplers, a technology that makes near real-time, broad-spectrum detection and quantification of airborne toxic chemicals accessible, portable, and precise.

Traditional chemical monitoring methods are often expensive, stationary, and limited to detecting known compounds. XploSafe’s XCel+ system overcomes these challenges through patented nanoconfinement technology that passively or actively captures a wide range of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds (VOCs and SVOCs)—including aldehydes, ketones, organophosphates, and amines—without the need to pre-select targets. Adaptable to numerous EPA methods (such as TO-11A, TO-14A, TO-15, and TO-17), the system is designed for use in dynamic and demanding environments, from submarines and disaster zones to industrial sites and mobile medical units.

Supported by SBIR funding from the Defense Health Agency (DHA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), XploSafe brought this innovation from early-stage R&D through rigorous field testing to global deployment. This support enabled the development of the integrated Data Repository Platform (DRP), a cloud-based system that manages digital chain-of-custody records and delivers occupational chemical exposure analytics, threshold alerts, and long-term exposure tracking—all from a mobile-first interface. Together, XCel+ and the DRP provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring, compliance, and rapid response to airborne chemical threats.

Since commercialization, the technology has generated over $3.5 million in revenue and gained traction across multiple sectors. The samplers are sold by XploSafe’s spin-off Airotect and distributed internationally by Assay Technology, a leader in chemical exposure monitoring. Users include the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, industrial hygienists, and emergency response teams operating in both routine and extreme conditions—including subarctic deployments and confined military installations.

The impact of XploSafe’s SBIR-supported work is both economic and societal. Commercial success has fueled job creation in Oklahoma and supported careers in chemistry, engineering, software, and manufacturing. At the same time, the technology is strengthening workplace safety, disaster preparedness, and public health research.

For XploSafe, the SBIR program was not only a funding mechanism—it was a launchpad. Federal investment allowed the company to develop a fully integrated, field-proven solution that is now actively protecting lives and shaping the future of chemical safety worldwide.",https://www.sbir.gov/sites/all/themes/sbir/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-22 01:58:34.658683

Europe is on track to surpass the US in total climate-tech capital deployed, while India, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East are scaling projects faster than many developed markets.

Europe’s Policy Engine and India’s Clean-Energy Breakthrough Lead the Shift

Sightline’s findings highlight Europe’s accelerating industrial transition. The region now accounts for 55% of global low-carbon cement capacity in development and 70% of projects under construction, driven by the EU carbon price and the forthcoming CBAM border-adjustment mechanism. Coordinated CO2 transport and storage networks are also creating the backbone for deep industrial decarbonization.

India emerges as the standout performer in emerging economies, ranking third worldwide in ammonia capacity (25 Mt/yr) and second in advanced nuclear (17 GW).wing deployment in wealthier nations.

Across the Global South, megaprojects are defining the next chapter of clean-energy industrialization.

Saudi Arabia’s $500 billion NEOM project is reshaping regional energy systems; Chile, Oman, Kazakhstan, and Mauritania are racing to supply Europe with low-carbon ammonia; and Singapore and Latin America are converting waste streams, biomass, and interconnection programs into competitive supply chains.

Sightline argues that deployment success increasingly hinges on governance rather than technology. Regions with coordinated planning, whether Central America’s interconnection programs or Europe’s CO2 hubs, are capturing investment and accelerating commercialization.

“While policymakers are increasingly focused on growth and energy security, in many cases those goals align with climate,” said Kim Zou, Sightline CEO. “To many of these economies, security is more than just energy.”

Besides BEVs, plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV) are also expected to decline slightly, dropping 1.4 percentage points to 1.1% of US vehicle sales.","J.D. Power released on Thursday a new report estimating that US electric vehicle sales will drop 37.6% year over year in November, continuing the decline triggered by the EV tax credit deadline.

According to the data analysis firm, battery electric vehicles (BEV) are expected to represent 6% of all vehicle sales in November.

While the figures are consistent with October’s estimates, they are well below the 12.9% recorded in September, the firm noted.

Thomas King, J.D. Power’s President of OEM Solutions, commented on the results, saying that the anticipation of the EV credit deadline prompted consumers to “accelerate buying decisions,” which has caused sales to decline since October.

“Now, two months after the credit expired, the industry continues to feel the effect of those accelerated purchases,” he wrote.

Pricing Strategy

According to Tyson Jominy, Senior VP of OEM Customer Success, pricing trends further highlight the evolving EV landscape, as average prices on electric vehicles have risen 14% from November 2024.

EV prices have surged by $6,500 year over year to $52,400, making them the second most expensive powertrain after PHEVs.

ICE vehicles average $46,000 — about $8,000 lower — while traditional hybrids remain the most affordable option at $42,200.

“As the market adjusts to life without federal tax credits, manufacturers will need to rethink go-to-market strategies to balance affordability, profitability, and consumer demand in this new paradigm,” Jominy wrote.

EV Discounts

US automakers are still adjusting after several policy changes, including the expiration of the EV tax credit and the impact of tariffs on the overall market.

Along with these, Thomas King further noted that “evolving fuel economy requirements, along with the transition to the new model year” also contribute to “some distortions in typical seasonal discount patterns.”

J.D. Power expects discounts on EVs to average $11,689 in November, up $260 from November 2024 but down $928 from October 2025.

These figures highly contrast with estimates for non-EVs, which are projected at $2,960, an increase of $161 from a year ago.

Several automakers have introduced new discounts and benefits to try to lower the impact of the consumer credit expiry.

These include offering the $7,500 discount — the same value as the credit — on the final pricing of the vehicle, as EV maker Lucid Motors has done.

General Motors and Ford also announced that they would “keep” offering the value to consumers buying electric vehicles, but then stepped back and began offering other discounts, such as Ford‘s 0% financing rate for contracts of up to 72 months.

Leasing

The scenario is also changing for leasing contracts, which EV makers like Rivian have depended on, since the price cap for the tax credit was higher for leases than for purchases.

To qualify for the tax credit when purchasing an electric vehicle, the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) could not exceed $88,000 for vans, SUVs, and pickup trucks, and $55,000 for other vehicles, such as sedans.

In November, leasing has declined 12% from a year ago, trending at 54%.

“Leasing remains a critical lever for EV adoption,” Tyson Jominy said, adding that it far outpaces leasing on ICE vehicles — at 20% — and hybrids — at 15%.

“While EV incentive spending has moderated compared to a year ago, the reliance on leasing and discounts underscores the challenges automakers face.”

Other Powertrains

J.D. Power expects a 5.2% decrease in overall vehicle sales this month in the US, with the total figures reaching below 1.26 million units.

Besides BEVs, plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV) are also expected to decline slightly, dropping 1.4 percentage points to 1.1% of US vehicle sales.

Regular hybrids (HEV), however, are projected to rise by 3.6 percentage points, reaching a 14.5% market share.

This month’s elections underscored the importance, and need, to reign in rising costs. When it comes to energy, a great way to create new jobs, make energy cheaper to produce and distribute, as well as unleash economic growth, is to reform and streamline the federal permitting process so that energy projects, ranging from power plants to transmission lines, come online and meet demand. Fortunately, the SPEED Act is progressing through the House of Representatives.

The SPEED Act primarily reforms the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review process, a key procedural hurdle that often results in elongated delays for vital energy projects. This bill ensures NEPA reviews have consistent and predictable timelines, clarifies what is deemed a major Federal action to trigger a NEPA review, places reasonable judicial limitations on reviews, and simplifies the entire bureaucratic process.

The House Committee on Natural Resources passed the SPEED Act yesterday, a promising sign for the bill’s future. Several lawmakers highlighted the need to reform the permitting process and pass the SPEED Act during the committee markup:

Rep. Bruce Westerman (Arkansas): “The United States is unnervingly reliant on China for minerals critical to both high-tech military equipment and everyday civilian goods. Yet today, thanks in part to NEPA, it takes 29 years to get an American mine up and running. As committee members know, we have viable, domestic deposits of the critical minerals that we need. Permitting delays cannot be the reason why we fall behind our chief global rivals.”

Rep. Jeff Hurd (Colorado): “The federal NEPA environmental review process was never intended to be a climate policy, it was never intended to be a litigation strategy for stopping reasonable projects that promote economic growth. It was meant to ensure agencies look before they act, instead it has become a system that stalls projects and gives an advantage to foreign competitors, especially China. The SPEED Act restores common sense. It focuses reviews on real impacts, not speculative ones…. This is not about weakening environmental protections, it’s about ending unreasonable delays so that states can actually build what they need.”

Rep. Harriet Hageman: (Wyoming): “The SPEED Act is designed to ensure that we can build the infrastructure and develop the energy we need to power this country. It is project agnostic and one of the rare examples where Washington, D.C. is not selecting winners and losers, but rather making structural updates that bring benefits across every important sector that Americans rely on.

First Solar today inaugurated its new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana. The $1.1 billion facility spans approximately 2.4 million square feet and is about 11 times the size of the New Orleans Superdome.

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule. The accelerated timeline was driven by the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Trump administration's trade policies, both of which catalyzed demand for American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance. The facility, which has no dependencies on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains, produces First Solar's Series 7 modules using American materials including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

""First Solar's investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses,"" said Louisiana Governor, Jeff Landry. ""This is exactly how we advance President Trump's agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we're strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.""

According to an economic impact analysis conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority (IEDA) the new facility is forecast to grow Iberia Parish's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 4.4% in its first full year of operations at capacity. Manufacturing roles at the facility offer an average compensation package of $90,000 per year, more than three times the per capita income in Iberia Parish.

First Solar Inaugurates New $1.1 Billion AI-Enabled Louisiana Manufacturing Facility

First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) (the ""Company"" or ""First Solar"") today inaugurated its new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana. The $1.1 billion facility, which spans approximately 2.4 million square feet and is about 11 times the size of the New Orleans Superdome, currently employs over 700 people and is expected to have 826 employees by the end of the year. Once fully ramped, the Iberia Parish facility is expected to add 3.5 gigawatts (GW) of annual nameplate capacity, taking First Solar's American manufacturing footprint to 14 GW in 2026, and 17.7 GW in 2027, when a recently announced production facility in South Carolina is expected to be fully ramped.

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule. The accelerated timeline was driven by the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Trump administration's trade policies, both of which catalyzed demand for American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance. The facility, which has no dependencies on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains, produces First Solar's Series 7 modules using American materials including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

""First Solar's investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses,"" said Louisiana Governor, Jeff Landry. ""This is exactly how we advance President Trump's agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we're strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.""

According to an economic impact analysis conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority (IEDA) the new facility is forecast to grow Iberia Parish's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 4.4% in its first full year of operations at capacity. Manufacturing roles at the facility offer an average compensation package of $90,000 per year, more than three times the per capita income in Iberia Parish.

""This is more than just a manufacturing facility. It's a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,"" said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. ""By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we're demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn't just a thesis, it's an operating reality.""

The high-tech factory is enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), using computer vision and deep learning to automatically detect defects in solar panels during production, while technicians and operators leverage AI-powered tools to make operating adjustments and guide decision making.

""This is, beyond doubt, one of the most advanced solar manufacturing facilities in the world and it represents the very best of American manufacturing innovation,"" said Kuntal Kumar Verma, chief manufacturing officer, First Solar. ""Along with its sister facilities in Ohio and Alabama, this factory demonstrates how AI can be harnessed to help American factory workers reach their full potential.

Is Revolution Wind safe from federal opposition?","A federal judge is weighing whether the Trump administration’s sweeping pause on offshore wind projects was lawful, raising renewed legal uncertainty around major clean-energy initiatives — including Revolution Wind, a significant offshore wind farm under construction off the Rhode Island coast that will power hundreds of thousands of homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut.

In presiding over a lawsuit filed by a coalition of states, U.S. District Judge Patti Saris on Nov. 18 questioned whether agencies “could lawfully implement” a blanket ban simply because “the president told me to do it.”

Back on track after September ruling

The new court showdown comes a few months after another federal ruling allowed Revolution Wind to resume construction. In September, Judge Royce Lamberth granted a preliminary injunction that reversed a stop-work order and permitted the project to restart.

Charles Rothenberger, climate and energy attorney with Save the Sound, praised the earlier ruling and insisted the project is still on track.

“There are people on the water and on the docks working to finish the last dozen of those turbines before the project can be fully energized in the second quarter of 2026,” he said.

He acknowledged that winter could slow progress but noted delays are already built into the timeline.

“Because of the delay … with the onset of winter weather, some of that work will naturally slow down,” he said.

Benefits to consumers

Rothenberger argued that once completed, Revolution Wind — slated to deliver power to Connecticut and Rhode Island — will offer major advantages.

“Access to clean, renewable energy for about 350,000 homes … more than 1,000 jobs,” he said. “Offshore wind is really the solution to multiple problems we face here in New England.”

He highlighted its ability to address winter reliability issues in the electricity grid: “The generation profile is really ideally suited to address the winter reliability concerns … because of our reliance on natural gas.” He also pointed to analyses showing the project’s potential to lower wholesale energy prices and protect customers from volatile natural gas costs.

Is Revolution Wind safe from federal opposition?

When pressed on the risk of further political or legal interference, Rothenberger expressed cautious optimism.

“I wouldn’t want to jinx anything,” he said, “But … it’s clear … the only thing to be done is to finish assembling it and get it energized.”

He added that the project already holds all federal and state permits solidly in hand, suggesting the worst of the regulatory fights may be behind them.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bb68d9d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0b%2Fab%2F88c70174433780b5dbe8dff7b07c%2F250825-newlondonwind-tra5037xx.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 01:58:27.036101

TOP NEWS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE

STATE NEWS

OREGON GOVERNOR DIRECTS STATE TO SPEED UP CLEAN ENERGY: Governor Tina Kotek issued an executive order that will speed up the process of building and connecting new clean energy generation to the electrical grid. This will help Oregon meet rising energy demand while lowering costs for consumers and reducing harmful climate pollution.

OLCV TAKE: Oregon League of Conservation Voters Executive Director Lindsey Scholten said, “The State Energy Strategy made it clear that electrification is essential to keeping our communities safe and resilient. The Governor’s Executive Order is a good first step in implementing these recommendations, putting our state on a path to reach our climate goals and ensure clean, affordable energy for Oregonians.”

PENNSYLVANIA COUNTY TO MAKE POLLUTERS PAY: The Allegheny County Council unanimously voted to increase permit fees for polluters. Revenue from these permits will support pollution monitoring and enforcement of clean air laws to improve public health.

CHISPA NV CALLS ON STATE LAWMAKERS TO RESTORE FAIR ENERGY RATES: After the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada voted to keep NV Energy’s controversial daily demand charge despite strong opposition from families and advocates, Chispa Nevada and partner organizations called on state lawmakers to intervene and restore fair, predictable rates for Nevadans.

CHISPA NV TAKE: Chispa Nevada Program Director Audrey Peral said, “We’re incredibly disappointed with the PUCN’s decision. We feel that someone needs to act and really protect us all, because utility monopolies are continuing to make millions of dollars while communities are struggling to survive.”

CLIMATE ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES VOTES ON DIRTY ENERGY AND ANTI-DEMOCRACY BILLS: This week, House Republicans advanced a slew of bills aimed at promoting dirty energy, weakening our democracy, and worsening the affordability crisis.

OUR TAKE: LCV Vice President of Federal Policy Matthew Davis said, “After seven weeks of doing nothing to deliver affordability for families, House Republicans are prioritizing votes this week that give handouts to polluters instead of addressing skyrocketing costs across the country and continued threats to our democracy. From selling off our public lands to oil, gas, and coal executives to approving projects without evaluating impacts and limiting public input, these bills are corrupt polluter handouts that will likely raise energy costs across the country.

“At the same time, Congressional Republicans are trying to take away people’s voice and participation in our democracy. Taking away the Department of Energy’s required public interest determination before allowing more liquid methane gas (LNG) exports, illegitimately cancelling protections for public lands that were set up through a public process with public input, and overruling DC laws that were passed by our elected representatives, only tramples on our democratic processes and self-government. Instead of advancing giveaways for polluters, Congress should be taking action to ensure polluters pay their fair share of rising costs from climate change and harming our health, the Trump administration stops its ban on affordable clean energy, and our democratic processes and institutions remain strong.”

PRO-POLLUTER ‘SPEED ACT’ ADVANCES IN COMMITTEE: The House Natural Resources Committee marked up the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, moving to prop up Big Polluters at the expense of environmental protections and public input. Read more about LCV’s opposition to the SPEED Act, the PERMIT Act, and more about the benefits of NEPA.

OUR TAKE: LCV Vice President of Federal Policy Matthew Davis said, “House Republicans have once again shown they are more interested in helping their fossil fuel billionaire buddies instead of working to lower utility costs for American families. The SPEED Act is another giveaway to Big Polluters that allows the Trump administration to continue its assault on clean energy while rigging the permitting process for harmful projects by cutting public input, gutting environmental protections, and blocking people’s day in court. Adequate staffing and resources delivered improvements in permitting timelines last year, and yet this bill does nothing to stop the indiscriminate firings of career civil servants or disregard for congressional direction on funding. We urge Congress to follow the lead of the members of Congress who opposed this bill in committee today and get serious about lowering utility costs by building clean, affordable energy that creates jobs and protects the health of our communities.”

SENATE VOTES TO SUPPORT METHANE POLLUTION LIMITS DELAY: The Senate voted down a Congressional Review Act resolution led by Senators Adam Schiff (CA) and Sheldon Whitehouse (RI) that would have invalidated the EPA’s harmful and unlawful rule to delay compliance deadlines for the oil and gas industry to cut dangerous methane pollution.

OUR TAKE: LCV Healthy Communities Program Director Madeleine Foote said, “This vote once again shows that the allegiance of Senate Republicans lies with big polluters and their profits, not the health of our families and communities. By greenlighting EPA’s unlawful delay of compliance deadlines for the oil and gas industry to cut dangerous methane pollution, these Senators have signed off on pumping more cancer-causing pollution into frontline communities, worsening our climate, and wasting money and our natural resources. We thank Senators Schiff and Whitehouse for leading the effort to reverse the EPA’s harmful action and standing up for our communities, and we will continue to fight alongside them for strong methane standards that protect public health and the environment.”

TRUMP ADMIN RELEASES RECKLESS 5-YEAR LEASE SALE PLAN FOR OFFSHORE DRILLING: The Trump administration released its reckless and dangerous draft five year plan opening 1.3 billion acres of waters for offshore oil and gas drilling. The plan would auction waters off the coast of Alaska and southern and central California and in the Gulf of Mexico for drilling.

OUR TAKE: LCV Conservation Program Director America Fitzpatrick said, “As extreme weather becomes more frequent and severe, the Trump administration is moving full steam ahead on its dangerous agenda to make our communities less safe by releasing a plan to allow offshore oil and gas leasing in several previously protected areas. This needless, reckless expansion of offshore drilling would jeopardize our coastal communities, public health, local economies, and the environment, while prolonging our dependence on fossil fuels and doing nothing to lower costs. As families face skyrocketing energy bills and extreme weather becomes more dangerous, we should be investing in affordable, fast, and reliable clean energy–not opening up our coasts to costly, dangerous drilling that threatens our health, safety, and future.”

TRUMP ADMIN RELEASES POLLUTED WATER RULE: EPA and the Department of the Army released a revised Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule restricting which bodies of water are protected by the Clean Water Act. This rule, better characterized as the “Polluted Water Rule,” would be devastating for our waters and communities, and is another attempt to dismantle the bedrock Clean Water Act.

OUR TAKE: LCV Healthy Communities Program Director Madeleine Foote said, “The Trump administration’s Polluted Water Rule is another blatant giveaway to big corporate polluters that will jeopardize the waters that our families and communities rely on for drinking, recreation, and fueling our local economies. In 2023, the Supreme Court’s devastating Sackett decision stripped federal protections from millions of miles of streams and tens of millions of acres of wetlands, and now corporate polluters are pushing their friends in the administration to go even further in decimating our clean water safeguards. They won’t be happy until the Clean Water Act is nothing more than words on a page and they can pollute our waters with abandon.

“The public overwhelmingly supports stronger protections for our waters, and contrary to this administration’s preference, do not think polluting industries should be left to police themselves. The Trump administration should abandon this attempt to ignore science and the law, and work to ensure everyone, no matter who they are or where they live, has access to the clean water they deserve.”

TRUMP ADMIN FORCES MICHIGAN COAL PLANT TO STAY OPEN: The Department of Energy issued a third order to force the J.H. Campbell Coal Plant in Ottawa County, Michigan to stay open. The plant was set to close in May, but has been forced to restart by the Trump administration, adding over $80 million in costs that will be passed on to ratepayers. Michigan state lawmakers have introduced a resolution calling for an end to the Trump administration’s reckless order.

MLCV TAKE: Michigan League of Conservation Voters Federal Government Affairs Director Bentley Johnson said, “The decision to keep Campbell open comes at a time when costs for everything are up and Michigan families are having to make hard decisions of whether to pay their light bill or put food on the table. Despite promising to bring energy costs down, Trump’s policies are causing them to skyrocket and the impact is being felt right here in Michigan.”

First Solar's investment is bringing hundreds of great, high-quality American manufacturing jobs in the community.” It’s another step in First Solar’s rapid growth across the United States.
Ohio-based Ice Industries recently celebrated the grand opening of its $6 million manufacturing facility in Jefferson Davis Parish, which will produce steel backrails for First Solar's photovoltaic panels.
The idea to bring the facility to south Louisiana wasn't without its hurdles, he added.
Level playing field It’s a made-in-America approach to manufacturing that allowed First Solar to outpace manufacturing capabilities of companies in China, said CEO Mark Widmar.","When Georges Antoun came to Louisiana from Lebanon in the early 1980s, he needed money.

The country was entering an oil crisis, and cities along the Gulf Coast — especially places like Lafayette that depended on oil and gas jobs — felt the hit first.

As families moved to larger cities like Houston in search of work, Antoun began offering a service: For a fee, he’d drive their moving trucks back to Louisiana.

It's no secret that Louisiana has long lost talent to its western neighbor and has sought ways to entice them back.

The opening of First Solar's $1.1 billion solar panel manufacturing facility near New Iberia has allowed Antoun, now the company's chief commercial officer, to have conversations with families who have chosen to return to Louisiana to work at the facility.

The 2.4 million-square-foot mega complex is one of the largest investments in the Acadiana region and is expected to provide more than 800 jobs by the end of 2025.

Two years in the making

When the site selection process began for First Solar to find its next manufacturing facility, leaders in Iberia Parish and Acadiana got to work.

There were at least 10 sites in the running to land billion-dollar project that would bring hundreds of jobs. Two of them were out of the country. When the Iberia Parish site made the cut for the final three, things got interesting.

“That’s when we really had to put on our championship jackets and really work hard,"" said Mike Tarantino, ppresident and CEO of the Iberia Industrial Development Foundation. ""We’re so happy First Solar chose us. We’re so excited to see this plant come to fruition.”

On Friday, First Solar’s leadership team along with local elected officials and other leaders celebrated the company’s inauguration at its New Iberia plant, opening its 2.4 million square foot building — now the largest facility under one roof in Louisiana — that represents its $1.1 billion investment in south Louisiana.

It marked the end of a two-year process since it was announced in August 2023. Now the company will employ 826 and offer an average compensation package of $90,000.

The opening is a huge win for the region and the state, said Millard Mulé, policy director for Gov. Jeff Landry. “It’s a huge win for our state’s workers, and it’s a huge win for Louisiana’s economy. First Solar's investment is bringing hundreds of great, high-quality American manufacturing jobs in the community.”

It’s another step in First Solar’s rapid growth across the United States. When it announced plans to locate in Iberia Parish, the news was that it would be its fifth facility in the country and have a payroll of at least $40 million.

The plant opened in July, months ahead of schedule. Last week it announced plans to open a similar plant in South Carolina, its ninth overall.

The company will produce its Series 7 modules using American materials, including glass from Illinois and Ohio along with steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

Economic dividends

The Louisiana investment is already paying dividends, with Acadiana manufacturers like Noble Plastics announcing in September that it would undergo an $8.5 million expansion to supply the New Iberia location. Ohio-based Ice Industries recently celebrated the grand opening of its $6 million manufacturing facility in Jefferson Davis Parish, which will produce steel backrails for First Solar's photovoltaic panels.

""You feel the impact immediately, ""Antoun said. ""I'm very proud, given that I'm a Louisiana boy. ""

The idea to bring the facility to south Louisiana wasn't without its hurdles, he added. The state, known for its damaging hurricanes and flooding, at first made the board uneasy, but it had one thing going for it — a highly skilled, easily transferable workforce.

The University of Louisiana at Lafayette and South Louisiana Community College were also eager to help win over the company, providing a curriculum and simulated training for new hires, and tapping the university for a large portion of its workforce.

""Pushback is normal,"" he said. ""Louisiana is a tough place to build. South Louisiana, we get a few hurricanes here and there. Flooding, tax-wise, insurance-wise. This took a bit of doing and bringing it here. But the company was committed to drive it in here.""

""(UL-Lafayette) produces a tremendous amount of engineers and technical degrees, and a lot of folks don't want to leave the area. They want to stay here.""

Level playing field

It’s a made-in-America approach to manufacturing that allowed First Solar to outpace manufacturing capabilities of companies in China, said CEO Mark Widmar.

“A level playing field — that’s all we need,” he said. “American workers can out-innovate and out-compete if given the opportunity. We're incredibly proud to inaugurate this facility as a symbol of American energy dominance and re-industrialization.”

The plant will also utilize artificial intelligence by using computer vision and deep learning to quickly detect defects in its products during production, officials said. Its technicians and operators can use AI tools to make operating adjustments and guide their decision making.

First Solar, which has opened facilities in other similar-sized markets, expected to employ 5,500 people by the end of next year and have invested $4.5 billion in American manufacturing.

“We’ve been able to be successful to go into communities, in some cases, that other companies have left,” Widmar said. “Our factory that we put in Alabama, there was a paper mill there. Those guys went to China. We went back into that community, revived it and now it’s thriving. That’s what we want to do.”

The New Iberia location can produce up to 3.5 GW worth of solar panels annually.

""You're going to see us throttle down, throttle up. We're trying to react to the market,"" Antoun said. ""We've been on a tremendous growth over the past 10 years. Now we're at a point where we need to understand what our friends in Washington will do and what certainties they will put.""

The company will also provide high-paying jobs averaging $80,000 to $90,000, totaling $75 million in annual labor income, according to data collected by the Kathleen Babineaux Blanco Public Policy Center at UL.

Antoun also believes the company will likely continue its rapid growth as the largest solar panel manufacturer in the Western Hemisphere. Just seven years ago, the company could produce around 2.5 gigawatts of solar panels a year, compared to the 17.7 GW it expects to create once the South Carolina facility is operational.

President Donald Trump has made his distaste for renewable energy well known over the years, going as far as sunsetting Biden-era solar tax credits earlier than they were set to expire. The decision killed dozens of early-stage utility-scale solar projects planned for Louisiana.

But Trump's marquee One Big Beautiful Bill has produced ""tailwinds"" for the 100% American-made company, Proenca said, adding that First Solar is one of the only solar companies listed on the White House's investment list, which shows domestic corporate investment.

""Can we survive without incentives? The answer is yes,"" Antoun said.

In an energy-hungry America, Antoun said, solar remains the cheapest and most quickly deployable form of energy.

""Everybody is looking for power as a country, as the U.S.,"" he said. ""We have no spare power. Is it solar? Is it natural gas? Is it coal? Is it nuke? Look, it's all of the above.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/1b/11b94004-c940-59ab-a7d6-58bfcd64dd42/6920e0f72bd8d.image.jpg?crop=1764%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-21 19:59:39.286260

The approved actions include comprehensive updates to air quality regulations and the State Implementation Plan, while strategically directing state resources.
“Clean air is the foundation for a thriving and sustainable community,” said Michael Ogletree, the senior director of state air quality programs.
Gasoline-fueled equipment and vehicles, oil and gas operations, and manufacturing facilities are large sources of ozone precursors in Colorado.
Following this request, the commission approved new updates to several Colorado Air Quality Control Commission Regulations, targeting sectors emitting high levels of ozone pollution precursors.","Denver (Nov. 21, 2025): The Colorado Air Quality Control Commission has approved new measures that will drive a 50% reduction in air pollution emissions that form ground-level ozone pollution from upstream oil and gas operations by 2030, compared to 2017 levels. The approved actions include comprehensive updates to air quality regulations and the State Implementation Plan, while strategically directing state resources. The measures mark another significant step toward cleaner air for all Coloradans.

“Clean air is the foundation for a thriving and sustainable community,” said Michael Ogletree, the senior director of state air quality programs. “With these strategic actions, the state reaffirms its commitment to protecting the health of our residents and the environment for future generations to come.”

Ground-level ozone pollution is a harmful air pollutant that can affect lung health, particularly for children, seniors, and those with respiratory conditions. It forms at ground-level when pollutants known as “ozone precursors” react in heat and sunlight. Emissions of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides are ozone precursors. Gasoline-fueled equipment and vehicles, oil and gas operations, and manufacturing facilities are large sources of ozone precursors in Colorado.

In March 2023, the Governor directed state agencies to develop new rules to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions from upstream oil and gas operations by 30% in 2025 and 50% by 2030 in the parts of Colorado that do not meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone pollution, which are known as ozone nonattainment areas. Following this request, the commission approved new updates to several Colorado Air Quality Control Commission Regulations, targeting sectors emitting high levels of ozone pollution precursors. These include:

Regulation 7: Extending the nitrogen oxide intensity program, expanding leak detection and repair program requirements for oil and gas operations, including storage and transferring processes.

Regulation 11: Identifying more vehicles that emit high levels of ozone precursors.

Regulation 25: Limiting volatile organic compounds for coating materials in aerospace.

Regulation 26: Strengthening emissions controls for combustion equipment and industrial waste in northern Weld County.

The commission included many of the regulatory updates in changes to Colorado's State Implementation Plan. The plan outlines actions that Colorado is taking to reduce air pollution in the ozone nonattainment areas. Additionally, the updated plan allows for further technical analysis to support future policies reducing ground-level ozone.

The commission also revised administrative protocols and regulatory language. These changes will make ozone pollution-reducing programs, such as the federally required vehicle emissions testing program, sustainable over the long term, correct outdated language to align with current state and federal requirements, and revise modeling and emissions credit rules to make compliance easier.

The commission approved a strategic proposal to proactively reclassify portions of the state as nonattainment for the 2015 National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ground-level ozone. The reclassification would impact a smaller section of northern Weld County. If the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approves the voluntary reclassification request, this would enable the state to focus additional resources on reducing emissions without the burden of administrative tasks.

Colorado is committed to continuing its work on reducing emissions within its control. Learn more about the actions the state is taking to work towards meeting federal ozone pollution standards.

The EV maker's parent company, Bollinger Innovations, delisted from the Nasdaq Composite stock market index in October.

Bollinger Motors, an Oak Park-based electric vehicle start-up, is closing after a long slog of poor performance, never quite getting off the ground.

According to emails reviewed by the Detroit Free Press, sent by Bollinger's Human Resources Director, Helen Watson, the embattled EV maker's last day of business was Friday, Nov. 21.

""We received word late last night that the day has arrived, we are to officially close the doors of Bollinger Motors, effective today, November 21st, 2025,"" the email from Watson said.

On Wednesday, Nov. 19, the Free Press reported that Bollinger was struggling to meet payroll. The EV maker currently has 59 claims of unpaid wages pending with the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, a department spokesperson confirmed.

Days later, the company is shuttering operations.

Watson told employees in the email that David Michery, the CEO of Bollinger Innovations (Bollinger Motors' parent company), will ""make us whole with regards to the remaining monies"" that went unpaid as the company missed payroll for the last two pay periods.

""I am working on creating checks for the 10/31/2025 payroll and believe they will be in hand on Monday,"" Watson wrote. ""It is the end of an era but one you should all be very proud of.""

Bollinger Motors' website, as of late Nov. 21, still reflects the brand's commitment to building ""the most bad-ass electric commercial trucks on the planet.""

Bollinger Motors was founded in 2015 and built vehicles in Livonia, through Roush Industries, and is headquartered in Oak Park.

The company's site lists a chassis cab truck, the B4, as available for order, as well as two boxy SUV prototypes, the B1 and B2. A larger chassis cab truck, the B5, appears to be slated for release in 2026.

In March, the company's founder and namesake, Robert Bollinger — who had left the company — sued over a $10 million loan he gave the company the previous October. Robert Bollinger alleged the company was broke and sought a receivership to handle repayment of his loan. The company exited the receivership in June.

At least six suppliers have taken legal action against Bollinger this year to settle more than $5 million in overdue bills, according to Crain's Detroit Business.

Michery, the CEO of Bollinger's parent company, took over as the leader of Bollinger Motors in June. Michery rebranded his own California-based EV start-up, Mullen Automotive, to the Bollinger name, pulling all brands under the ""Bollinger Innovations"" umbrella.

Now Bollinger Motors, the maker of the chassis trucks and SUV prototypes, is closed for good. Bollinger Innovations has not closed.

On Sept. 23, Bollinger Innovations announced via an online news release that it would no longer perform reverse stock splits, a tactic used to amalgamate several cheaper shares of a stock into one more valuable share of a stock, as a method of staying on the Nasdaq Composite stock market index. Bollinger Innovations had undergone at least six reverse stock splits during the last 12 months, according to company announcements.

The company delisted from the Nasdaq Composite stock market index on Oct. 13 after dropping below the threshold of $1 per share.

The Free Press left messages on social media requesting comment from Michery. A phone number attached to Bollinger Innovations news releases delivered an automated message when called, indicating the phone line was not in operation.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/19/PDTF/87352974007-bollinger-screenshot-20251119-111400.png?crop=1104,621,x0,y0&width=1104&height=621&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-21 19:59:19.161198

New guidance from EPA promises more flexibility to begin certain project activities before receiving a New Source Review (NSR) permit for new industrial facilities and/or expansion of existing facilities. These NSR permits are enforceable legal documents that typically determine what construction is allowed, what air emissions must be met, and how the source can be operated consistently with air quality requirements. These efforts are intended to remove barriers that stifle construction and, as EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated, “make America the AI capital of the world.”

The September 2 letter from EPA Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, Aaron Szabo, to Maricopa County Air Quality Department Director Philip McNeeley, confirms EPA’s intention to propose and finalize modification to the NSR regulations in 2026 to address modification of the definition of “begin actual construction.” In the meantime, Szabo suggests in the letter that EPA will advise on matters of interpretation of the term on a case-by-case basis:

“Consistent with the views expressed in the March 2020 Draft Guidance, the EPA continues to recognize that the definition of ‘begin actual construction’ in EPA’s regulation prohibits ‘the initiation of physical on-site construction on an emissions unit’ and that this does not prohibit initiation of physical on-site construction of those parts of a facility that do not qualify as an emission unit.”

EPA also signaled that its interpretation of “emission unit” will not be “overly broad.”

However, environmental groups argue EPA does not have the authority to allow substantial on-site work before preconstruction air permits for an entire facility are in place. Environmental groups have sent letters to EPA arguing that this issue requires formal rulemaking rather than case-by-case guidance. While this issue has not yet spurred litigation, it is possible environmental groups could file a petition for review or attempt to elicit persons with standing to enjoin projects from proceeding before preconstruction air permits have been issued.

Given the heightened scrutiny from environmental groups, construction projects should proceed cautiously. Projects must assist the regulatory agency in developing an administrative record that supports a regulatory conclusion that the proposed preconstruction activities are distinguishable from construction of the emission unit, capture device, etc. It is critical to stay up to date with the latest EPA guidance, review permit provisions, and attend to comprehensive recordkeeping. Doing so safeguards project timelines and budgets, preserves the reputations of project participants, and mitigates the risks of relying on administrative guidance before issuance of a NSR permit. Owners, developers, and contractors involved in construction projects should take care to participate in the rulemaking process on this issue when the opportunity arises to ensure EPA is made aware of the practical intricacies of preconstruction activities as they relate to the implementation of any administrative guidance or formal rulemaking.

If you are unsure of what activities you can legally conduct prior to the issuance of any preconstruction permits or if you need assistance navigating the permitting landscape, please reach out to the authors of this alert.",https://www.steptoe-johnson.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/facebook.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 01:58:48.770434

Keeping Violent Criminals Off D.C.’s Streets ✅

Currently, the District of Columbia has a cashless bail policy that prohibits using cash bail as a condition for pre-trial release. This reckless policy allows soft-on-crime progressive judges to release dangerous criminals onto the streets of D.C. with only a promise to not re-offend and show up for their future court date, resulting in multiple arrests and putting public safety at risk.

We cannot allow dangerous criminals to roam the streets freely and threaten the safety of everyone in our nation’s capital while they await trial. It’s past time for D.C. to abandon its soft-on-crime policies and make sure those charged with committing violent crimes remain behind bars to ensure the safety of law-abidding Americans.

This week, House Republicans continued our fight to make D.C. safe for visitors and residents by passing legislation that keeps violent and dangerous criminals off our streets. Our bill amends the current D.C. Code to mandate the detention of individuals charged with violent and dangerous offenses and implement cash bail for crimes that threaten public safety, such as aggravated assault and obstruction of justice. This legislation codifies Executive Action taken by President Trump to clean up D.C. crime and make our nation’s capital safe again.

Rep. Elise Stefanik’s legislation, H.R. 5214, the District of Columbia Cash Bail Reform Act, amends D.C.’s pre-trial release and detention processes to require mandatory pre-trial detention for defendants charged with violent crimes and for cash bail or bail bonds for defendants charged with certain crimes concerning public safety and order.

“New Yorkers know that Kathy Hochul’s failed bail reform has unleashed a crime wave across our state by emboldening violent criminals and putting law-abiding New Yorkers in harm’s way. Kathy Hochul's failed bail reform has literally caused murders, assaults, rapes, and heinous crimes to be committed against law abiding New Yorkers. As the Worst Governor in America Kathy Hochul continues to fuel her crime crisis and wage war on our corrections system by closing more prisons, she has made clear she will always side with criminals over law abiding New Yorkers,” said Rep. Stefanik. “Throughout my time in Congress, I have fought for the safety of New Yorkers and the support of our brave law enforcement. This week I proudly voted to end cashless bail in D.C which Congress has jurisdiction over.”

What Members Said:

Supporting Police Officers and Cleaning Up our Nation’s Capital ✅

While crime skyrocketed in D.C., Democrats went after the police working to protect the community instead of the criminals putting Americans at risk. The D.C. Council’s Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022 allows police officers to be targeted by protestors, bans officers from watching body-camera footage when writing initial incident reports, demands a jury consider if an officer consulted with mental health, behavioral health, or social workers prior to use of deadly force, dismisses officers and police union representatives from the Police Complaints Board, and strips officers of collective bargaining rights regarding discipline.

Under the D.C. Council’s emergency legislative powers, these harmful policies have been in place since 2020; meanwhile, D.C. police staffing reached the half-century low as homicides rose to their highest number since 1997. Additionally, juvenile crime in the District has reached historic levels while truancy grows.

Congress has a duty to oversee the governance of D.C. and make sure the MPD is able to effectively fight crime and keep Washingtonians and visitors safe. President Trump has taken significant strides to clean up D.C. streets, and House Republicans are likewise committed to restoring law and order in the District. This week, we passed legislation to reverse dangerous anti-police measures in the Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022 to deliver the support our law enforcement needs.

Rep. Andrew Clyde’s legislation, H.R. 5107, the Common-Sense Law Enforcement and Accountability Now in DC (CLEAN DC) Act, repeals the D.C. Council’s Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022 which placed harmful and burdensome requirements on the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department.

“For years, the D.C. City Council’s Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Emergency Amendment Act of 2022 has prevented our men and women in blue from effectively protecting Americans in our nation’s capital, hindered the MPD’s ability to recruit and retain officers, and exacerbated Washington’s crime crisis,” said Rep. Clyde. “I’m incredibly pleased that my commonsense legislation to repeal this anti-police law passed with bipartisan support, and I look forward to a similar outcome in the Senate. By eliminating the D.C. Council’s misguided law, the CLEAN D.C. Act strengthens and codifies President Trump’s successful efforts to restore law and order in Washington. While Joe Biden foolishly vetoed my legislation in 2023, I look forward to advancing the CLEAN D.C. Act to President Trump’s desk for his signature to continue delivering on our shared goal of Making D.C. Safe Again.”

Denouncing the Horrors of Socialism ✅

Socialism is one of the most destructive ideologies in world history, time and time again proving itself to be a failed experiment that only leads to communist regimes, totalitarian rule, and brutal dictatorships. More than 100 million people have been killed as a result of the mass murders and famines that accompany failed socialist states, including tens of millions of people during the Bolshevik Revolution, between 15 and 55 million people who died of starvation in the wake of famine caused by China’s Great Leap Forward, at least 3.5 million people who have starved in North Korea, and more.

Despite the proven dangers of socialism, America is seeing a troubling rise in the harmful ideology, especially with our youth – most recently culminating in the election of radical socialist Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York City. Since 2016, more Democrats have held positive views of socialism than of capitalism, with 66 percent of Democrats now viewing socialism favorably, while only 42 percent view capitalism favorably. Additionally, 62 percent of Americans between the ages 18 to 29 hold a favorable view of socialism, and 34 percent of communism.

Socialism and the abuses it leads to go against everything our Founding Fathers stood for. We cannot allow history to be ignored and the threat of socialism to grow unchallenged in America. House Republicans passed legislation that denounces the horrors of socialism and reaffirms our commitment to uphold the American ideals of freedom, democracy, and the pursuit of happiness.

H. Con. Res. 58, introduced by Congresswoman Maria Salazar, describes the horrors perpetrated by socialist regimes, denounces socialism in all its forms, and opposes the implementation of socialist policies in the United States.

“Socialism is a lie. It has never delivered justice or equality, only fear, censorship, poverty, and broken nations. I represent thousands of families who fled their homelands because socialist regimes promised paradise and delivered prisons,” said Rep. Salazar. “Today, the House is sending a clear message: we will never allow socialism’s failed, destructive ideology to take root in the United States. America must remain the beacon of freedom that exposes socialism’s lies and defends the God-given rights of every individual.”",https://www.majorityleader.gov/images/majorityleader-meta.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 21:00:46.441842

But his enthusiasm for a “closed-loop” small modular reactor (or SMR) complex requires a more careful look (“George Gemelas: Indiana just leveled up as leader in nuclear power,” Forefront, Nov. 14). Indiana is being invited to take on risks for an industry whose promises are unproven.

First, the editorial highlights Fanco’s plan to reprocess spent nuclear fuel on-site. This is unprecedented in the USA. The closest analogue is a West Valley, New York, facility that reprocessed commercial spent fuel and operated for only six years. The site has been in cleanup for nearly half a century and remains one of the most complex nuclear remediation projects in the country. Indiana officials should visit West Valley before assuming reprocessing is straightforward or low impact.

Second, Gemelas endorses a strategy of burning more natural gas while hoping new reactors arrive in the 2030s. Natural gas emits about a pound of CO2-equivalent for every 2 kWh generated, worsening the climate crisis now while gambling on technology that may or may not be ready later. If SMRs fall behind schedule or fail to perform, what is Indiana’s Plan B?

Third, even with reprocessing, long-lived high-level nuclear waste remains. The United States has no deep geological repository, and none will be available for decades. That means any high-level waste created here will stay in Indiana indefinitely. Moreover, for the economics of reprocessing to pencil out, Indiana would likely need to import spent fuel from other states. Will this be acceptable to the host community and the state?

Fourth, the plan for six SMRs (enough to power 1.5 million homes) creates a significant resilience challenge. Concentrating so much generation in one location introduces a major point of failure. If the plant goes off-line, half the state could lose power.

Finally, large energy “parks” inevitably attract large consumers such as data centers, increasing demand and potentially requiring yet more power plants. If Indiana needs power, consider weatherization and solar first. If it really wants nuclear, why not consider proven, commercial-scale designs rather than experimental ones?

Indiana deserves a full, transparent evaluation of the benefits, risks and alternatives, not just optimistic projections.",https://www.ibj.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/og-logo.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 19:01:39.484697

Bergeson,,,,,https://www.lawbc.com/tsca-pfas-reporting-implications-of-epas-new-statutory-interpretation-on-articles/,"At a minimum, EPA’s posture here suggests a particularly firm resolve in this Administration to keep articles importers out of the final PFAS reporting rule.
Beyond PFAS, there are also some potentially broader implications regarding EPA’s new statements on its authority over articles importers.
Stakeholders supporting EPA’s authority over articles importers made a number of arguments in public comments on the 2021 proposed PFAS reporting rule.
Time will tell whether EPA “sticks” with the interpretation it has taken in the proposed PFAS reporting rule and how closely EPA will hew to the statutory language in other sections.
In any case, the rationale EPA has offered on the PFAS reporting rule certainly opens the door to a closer read of TSCA statutory authorities over articles.","Headlines regarding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) most recent proposed update to the one-time per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) reporting rule under Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Section 8(a)(7) have been dominated by the rule’s new exemptions and the significant narrowing of responsibility and burden that industry stakeholders will face if the rule becomes final. But, buried in the preambular text — Unit III.A.2 to be precise — are a few paragraphs that caught our attention: a proposed interpretation that EPA lacks statutory authority to require reporting by those who import PFAS in articles.

EPA now states that the law is “best read as excluding articles and targeting the reporting requirement to manufacturers of the PFAS themselves.” EPA rationalizes that Congress “could have said so” if it desired the reporting requirements to extend to those who import articles containing PFAS. In EPA’s words: “[w]here Congress omits expansive modifiers, they should not be inferred.” It is worth mentioning that the argument itself is not new; EPA received some public comment to this effect on the original 2021 proposed rule. In the 2023 final rule and response to comments document, EPA disagreed and defended its authority, citing the decades-long interpretation that “manufacture of a chemical substance” under TSCA includes import of an article containing the chemical substance.

More than five years of regulatory development activity have transpired since Congress enacted the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that added TSCA Section 8(a)(7) and directed EPA to undertake rulemaking to collect more information on PFAS. EPA’s estimated burdens with respect to articles importers in the 2021 proposed rule drew significant criticism, prompting EPA to convene a Small Business Advocacy Review (SBAR) panel in 2022, update its economic analysis to inform the 2023 final rule, and develop numerous guidance materials to assist articles importers with compliance responsibilities. Stakeholders were correct to note that EPA has excluded articles from various other regulatory contexts, including chemical data reporting (CDR) under TSCA Section 8(a) and premanufacture notice review of new chemicals. When EPA Administrator Zeldin announced in 2025 that EPA would implement the TSCA PFAS reporting requirements “smartly” and “without overburdening small businesses and article importers,” many in the TSCA community expected some regulatory relief. The proposed rule, however, takes it even one step further.

As indicated in Bergeson & Campbell, P.C.’s recent analysis of the proposed rule, we found EPA’s new position — that it previously exceeded its own statutory authority in requiring articles importers to report under TSCA — to be quite notable. And while EPA requested feedback on the argument, it also concurrently proposed to exempt articles importers, citing TSCA Section 8(a)(5) and arguing that such entities are less likely to have responsive information, effectively doubling down on its effort to exclude articles importers from scope. We remind readers that in the 2023 final rule, EPA estimated that only 10 percent of small articles importers would have information to report on PFAS in imported articles; the remaining 90 percent would undergo due diligence and compliance burdens only to determine they lack responsive information. Whether the data that might be reported justify the (likely futile) effort of the 90 percent is a legitimate area of disagreement and one that this Administration has decided is not worth the burden on small businesses.

At a minimum, EPA’s posture here suggests a particularly firm resolve in this Administration to keep articles importers out of the final PFAS reporting rule. Future would-be challengers to this rule will have to convince a court both that (1) EPA has statutory authority to require reporting from articles importers, and (2) EPA’s application of discretion under TSCA Section 8(a)(5) to exempt articles importers was inappropriate. Considering this, we would not expect EPA to collect information on how PFAS might be entering the United States through imported articles any time soon. Similarly, given the data-driven nature of rulemaking, any future regulatory efforts on PFAS under TSCA are not likely to focus on exposures from imported articles either.

Beyond PFAS, there are also some potentially broader implications regarding EPA’s new statements on its authority over articles importers. Although the discussion in the proposed rule is framed narrowly (i.e., only in the context of the specific language in TSCA Section 8(a)(7)), the underlying rationale used by EPA could be applied to other instances in TSCA that refer to “manufacture of a chemical substance” without a corresponding reference to “articles.” Applying EPA’s new reasoning, for example, one could argue that Congress never intended EPA’s existing chemical risk evaluations to consider import of articles containing a chemical as a “condition of use.” Congress could have mentioned “articles” — but did not — when it defined “conditions of use” in the 2016 amendments to govern the scope of existing chemical reviews. Congress also did not include expansive modifiers like “contain” or “including imported articles” when it charged EPA to regulate “manufacture…of a chemical substance” that presents an unreasonable risk under TSCA Section 6(a). Although there are specific mentions of “article” in TSCA Section 3 definitions of “process” and “distribute in commerce,” and in specific other aspects of TSCA Sections 5 and 6, the word “article” does not appear in TSCA’s definition of “manufacture” — the statutory term encompassing import of chemical substances into the United States.

Of course, such a position would not be without controversy. Stakeholders supporting EPA’s authority over articles importers made a number of arguments in public comments on the 2021 proposed PFAS reporting rule. For example, the statutory definition of “chemical substance” in Section 3 does not generally exclude articles, and the specific exclusion for some articles in that definition (e.g., firearms) could imply that Congress contemplated the term “chemical substance” otherwise to be inclusive of chemicals contained in articles. Likewise, other provisions in the law, e.g., TSCA Sections 5(a)(5) and 6(a)(3), give EPA explicit authority to protect against risk and require warnings (respectively) for chemicals in articles. TSCA Section 6(c) includes some specific limitations on regulation of chemicals in articles (e.g., replacement parts), which arguably would not be necessary if Congress did not intend to convey statutory authority to address chemicals in articles in different ways in different sections of the statute.

Time will tell whether EPA “sticks” with the interpretation it has taken in the proposed PFAS reporting rule and how closely EPA will hew to the statutory language in other sections. In any case, the rationale EPA has offered on the PFAS reporting rule certainly opens the door to a closer read of TSCA statutory authorities over articles. Any changes in EPA’s statutory interpretations are worth keeping an eye on and could have profound implications regarding the scope and reach of future TSCA actions.",https://www.lawbc.com/wp-content/uploads/Feature_EPA_building.png,N,,2025-11-21 19:01:20.551301

First Solar today inaugurated its new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana. The $1.1 billion facility spans approximately 2.4 million square feet and is about 11 times the size of the New Orleans Superdome.

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule. The accelerated timeline was driven by the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Trump administration’s trade policies, both of which catalyzed demand for American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance. The facility, which has no dependencies on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains, produces First Solar’s Series 7 modules using American materials including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

“First Solar’s investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses,” said Louisiana Governor, Jeff Landry. “This is exactly how we advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we’re strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.”

According to an economic impact analysis conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority (IEDA) the new facility is forecast to grow Iberia Parish’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 4.4% in its first full year of operations at capacity. Manufacturing roles at the facility offer an average compensation package of $90,000 per year, more than three times the per capita income in Iberia Parish.

“This is more than just a manufacturing facility. It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we’re demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn’t just a thesis, it’s an operating reality.”

The high-tech factory is enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), using computer vision and deep learning to automatically detect defects in solar panels during production, while technicians and operators leverage AI-powered tools to make operating adjustments and guide decision making.

“This is, beyond doubt, one of the most advanced solar manufacturing facilities in the world and it represents the very best of American manufacturing innovation,” said Kuntal Kumar Verma, chief manufacturing officer, First Solar. “Along with its sister facilities in Ohio and Alabama, this factory demonstrates how AI can be harnessed to help American factory workers reach their full potential. Our fleet offers proof that AI can help realize productivity gains that allow us to out-innovate the competition and run our operations smarter, better, and faster.”

The Louisiana facility is part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one in Alabama, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Last week, the Company announced an investment in a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 modules initiated by its international fleet. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company. It is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the Company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.

This bipartisan bill makes improvements to the Rural Energy in America Program (REAP), which provides grants and guaranteed loans to agricultural producers and rural small businesses purchasing and installing renewable energy systems and making energy efficiency improvements.

“As a dairy farmer, I’ve seen firsthand how hard our producers work to improve energy efficiency and be responsible stewards of the land,” said Congressman Valadao. “The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) helps lower costs and makes it easier for recipients to become more energy independent, and this bill makes key updates to ensure the program meets the needs of our Central Valley communities. I’m proud to partner with Congressman Vindman on this bipartisan effort to help more farmers and rural small businesses take advantage of this successful program.”

“As the only Virginian on the House Agriculture Committee, I’ve heard firsthand how lower energy costs can really help farmers. We need to take real steps to make this a reality, cutting costs for agricultural producers and rural areas as they make smart investments in clean energy and storage,” said Congressman Vindman. “I’m proud to lead this bipartisan legislation to cut red tape and lower energy costs. We’re not just helping farms — we’re strengthening our rural economies and investing in a more sustainable future for Virginia.”

The REAP Modernization Act would:

Expand eligibility for REAP to include agricultural producer cooperatives and nongovernmental organizations that serve rural energy needs.

Streamline applications for small-scale and bundled projects, reducing administrative barriers for producers and rural businesses.

Increase cost-share limits for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects to help smaller farms and businesses afford upfront investment costs.

Require USDA to consider climate benefits, including greenhouse gas emission reductions, as a priority factor in project selection.

Enhance outreach and technical assistance for applicants and grantees.

Create a reserve fund of annual REAP resources to support underutilized renewable technologies such as geothermal, biomass, and combined heat and power systems.",https://valadao.house.gov/images/facebook-meta.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 19:01:16.426010

Both joined this week's episode of the WUNC Politics Podcast to discuss their publications and the state of the news media in North Carolina.
We are blessed with a wonderfully vibrant local business community, and I think you have to have that.
There's a lot of space for more growth from us, from others across North Carolina.
Both of you have added newsletters in recent years focused on state politics.","Local news is a tough business these days, with journalists routinely laid off (including some this month at the company that owns The (Raleigh) News & Observer) and small-town newspapers closing up shop.

But North Carolina’s journalism scene does have success stories, including two locally owned media companies that are seeing growth.

David Woronoff owns The Pilot, a thriving newspaper in Southern Pines, and magazines including Business North Carolina and Walter. Kyle Villemain started The Assembly in 2021, and it’s since grown to a staff of 43 people producing in-depth stories on all things North Carolina.

Both companies are adding to the state’s political news coverage (each has a politics newsletter for paid subscribers), and they’re expanding into underserved areas of the state.

Woronoff recently launched a new magazine called EastBound, covering communities east of Interstate 95, and Villemain has added a newsroom in Greensboro and a newsletter covering Cary and western Wake County.

Both joined this week's episode of the WUNC Politics Podcast to discuss their publications and the state of the news media in North Carolina.

This conversation has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.

What's allowed you to grow instead of shrink?

Woronoff: ""So many of the problems that our industry faces are self-imposed, and you could lay it at the feet of private equity ownership of news organizations, where the ownership is disengaged from the local community. Ours is locally and independently owned, and I believe that is the key to our success.""

Villemain: ""I also think that people respond when you put a really good product out there, when you put good reporting out there, whether it just really speaks to what they see in their community, if it speaks to what they see in their business, if it makes them feel more informed and more curious about the state — and it's just really good. People have a good eye for quality, and I think the news business has oftentimes not put out as high quality of a product as they think they are, and people respond by not engaging.""

I've been tracking the increase in news deserts and some of the more rural pockets of the state. I'm curious to what extent your organizations' models may be able to be replicated in other places.

Woronoff: ""As much as I'd like to say, 'oh yes, you could just pick ours up and drop it in Roanoke Rapids, or Laurinburg or Rockingham,' it's not that simple. We are blessed with a wonderfully vibrant local business community, and I think you have to have that. If you have a lot of corporately owned retail enterprises, it's a much harder sales environment.""

Villemain: ""I think there's at least a dozen markets across the state that can build substantial reporting teams on the ground. There's a lot of space for more growth from us, from others across North Carolina. I don't have a solution for every county, but there are a lot of mid-sized metros across North Carolina that don't have many full-time reporters, and that's a darn good place for entrepreneurs and existing outlets to start by saying, 'how do we build a three, four or five-person team that can give this county or city a thing that they don't have right now?'""

Both of you have added newsletters in recent years focused on state politics. Where have you seen unmet needs in political coverage that you've been able to fill?

Villemain: ""There's tons of gaps in political coverage, and there are great politics reporters out there, but there aren't enough of them, and there aren't enough doing deep backstories on complicated questions. We're not here to do the 'what happened today?' story — there are folks out there doing that. We are here to do the 'why did that happen and what's coming next?'""

Woronoff: ""We are the outlet that's going to tell you what happened today or yesterday or tomorrow. We're not doing the long-form journalism. ... We pride ourselves at the North Carolina Tribune of providing fair and impartial and objective coverage of the goings-on in state government.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7a613c9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/621x326+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F66%2F14%2F561896784929a20057dc8858b146%2Fpublications.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 19:01:28.192488

The company’s $1.1 billion, fully vertically integrated facility spans 2.4 million square feet, or about 11 times the size of the stadium’s main arena.

The factory began production quietly in July, a few months ahead of schedule, and employs more than 700 people. First Solar expects that number to hit 826 by the end of the year. Once it’s fully online, the site will add 3.5 GW of annual manufacturing capacity. That brings the company’s total US footprint to 14 GW in 2026 and 17.7 GW in 2027, when its newly announced South Carolina plant is anticipated to come online.

The Louisiana plant produces First Solar’s Series 7 modules using US-made materials — glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel from Mississippi, which is fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

The new factory leans heavily on AI, from computer vision that spots defects on the line to deep learning tools that help technicians make real‑time adjustments.

Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry says the investment is already a win for the region, bringing in “hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses.” A new economic impact analysis from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette projects that the factory will boost Iberia Parish’s GDP by 4.4% in its first full year at capacity. The average manufacturing compensation package comes in at around $90,000, more than triple the parish’s per capita income.

First Solar CEO Mark Widmar framed the new facility as a major step for US clean energy manufacturing: “By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we’re demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn’t just a thesis, it’s an operating reality.”

This site joins what’s already the largest solar manufacturing and R&D footprint in the Western Hemisphere: three factories in Ohio, one in Alabama, and R&D centers in Ohio and California. Just last week, First Solar announced a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to onshore more Series 6 module work. By the end of 2026, the company expects to directly employ more than 5,500 people across the US.

Still, the Constitution says very little about the individual rights of Members of Congress and nothing about individual Member oversight.
Truman Committee Members and staff visited and inspected U.S. Army housing camps, military manufacturing facilities, and allied military bases abroad.
Individual Member Oversight Powers In contrast, Members, acting on their own, have not been delegated the same investigatory powers and tools as committees.
Statutory Sources of Member Oversight Functions While limited, some statutory provisions support the oversight activities of individual members.","Several disputes have arisen in the 119th Congress surrounding access by Members of Congress to federal buildings. On several occasions, Members have been denied entry to various agency offices, and at least one Member was forcibly removed from an agency press conference in a federal building. A group of Members sued Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after they were refused access to immigration facilities, and, in a separate incident, one Member has been indicted for an altercation with law enforcement that occurred while attempting to inspect an ICE facility.

These controversies—which, though not novel, appear to be occurring with more frequency—seem to stem not only from differing interpretations of federal law by the executive and legislative branches but also from an interbranch disagreement over a Member's role in overseeing executive activities. The executive branch has at times asserted that agencies retain authority to control access to their buildings and that individual Members of Congress generally ""do not have the authority to conduct oversight"" except through an authorized committee investigation. Some Members, on the other hand, have argued for a legal right to access federal property that stems from federal statute and their individualized constitutional authority both to inform themselves on legislative matters and conduct oversight of the executive's implementation of federal law.

This Sidebar addresses this disagreement by discussing legal principles that govern the exercise of oversight by individual Members. Members of both chambers and both parties have long engaged in their own efforts to inform themselves of agency activity and confirm that a given executive agency is implementing the law in a way that comports with that Member's view of the statutory powers that Congress has entrusted to that agency. The courts have also recognized, in various contexts, that investigating and overseeing the executive branch is part of the official responsibilities of a Member of Congress.

Still, the Constitution says very little about the individual rights of Members of Congress and nothing about individual Member oversight. There are few federal laws or chamber rules that directly and explicitly empower Members to act unilaterally to obtain information from the executive branch and perhaps one lawthat explicitly governs Member access to federal facilities for oversight purposes. (In that case, the provision applies only to certain Department of Homeland Security immigration centers.) Instead, House and Senate rules and federal statutes that delegateformal investigatory and oversight authority generally do so to committees and committee chairs. While either chamber could vest each of its Members with compulsory investigative tools—for example, by providing all Members with the power to issue subpoenas or establishing a broad-based right of access to federal property—neither the House nor the Senate has explicitly done so. As a result, although individual Members possess an implicit constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight of the executive branch and inform themselves of matters of legislative importance, they do not appear to have easy access to the tools that may allow them to overcome an agency's resistance to their information-gathering efforts.

Congressional Oversight Powers and Limits

As analyzed in greater detail in other CRS products, both the House and Senate have an implied constitutional power to investigate matters relating to their legislative functions—a power that includes conducting oversight of the executive branch. The Supreme Court has described this power as ""broad"" and one that ""encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes."" To effectively perform its legislative responsibilities, the Court has recognizedthat Congress must know whether an agency's functions are ""being properly discharged or . . . neglected or misdirected, and particularly whether [agency officials are] performing or neglecting their duties.""

Each chamber has delegatedthis constitutional ""power of inquiry,"" including the tools necessary to gather information, to its standing committees through House or Senate rules. Under these rules, committees may conduct investigations, hold hearings, call witnesses, take depositions, and issue and enforce subpoenas, and under federal statute, committees are to use their powers and tools to ""review and study, on a continuing basis,"" the implementation of law by federal agencies.

Congress is not a law enforcement agency, and it therefore generally does not conduct the type of physical search that, by comparison, is typical of an executive branch criminal investigation. Still, Congress gathers information necessary to inform and support its various legislative functions in many ways. For example, though not explicitly referenced in House or Senate rules, site visits and inspections of federal property have long been one tool in Congress's oversight toolbox. This practice likely derives from a combination of Congress's implicit oversight powers and its explicit constitutional authority to ""make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting . . . Property belonging to the United States."" As described in a recent filingby a group of Members denied access to ICE facilities, examples of ""on the ground oversight"" can be traced back to investigations by the Continental Congress and were a prominent part of the investigation into wartime waste during World War II conducted by the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program (Truman Committee). Truman Committee Members and staff visited and inspected U.S. Army housing camps, military manufacturing facilities, and allied military bases abroad. Members undertook similar investigative activities during the Civil War, when Members of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the Civil War inspected ""Camp Convalescent"" in Alexandria, VA, following allegations of unacceptable conditions at that military hospital. In-person site visits, of both government and private property, remain a regular feature of modern congressional investigations.

In addition to this practice, courts have also recognized field investigations and inspections as a component of congressional fact-finding. In McSurely v McClellan, for example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (D.C. Circuit) announced that it had ""no doubt that information gathering,"" by either ""field work"" or ""field investigations"" by a committee Member or his staff, ""is essential to informed deliberation over proposed legislation"" and that ""the acquisition of knowledge through informal sources is a necessary concomitant of legislative conduct.""

The House and Senate have not, however, provided their committees with limitless investigative power. Committees may only use compulsory tools that have been given to them by their parent chamber, and then only when investigating matters within the committee's delegated jurisdiction—or, put another way, they are ""restricted to the missions delegated to them."" In practice, Congress's constitutional powers of investigation and oversight are typically carried out by committees under the powers and restraints provided by House and Senate rules.

Individual Member Oversight Powers

In contrast, Members, acting on their own, have not been delegated the same investigatory powers and tools as committees. An individual Member (other than a committee chair if delegated that authority by the parent chamber or by the rules of their committee) may not unilaterally convene an official committee hearing, initiate an official committee investigation, issue a subpoena, or seek enforcement of a subpoena through contempt.

Nevertheless, these specific and formal powers represent a small portion of what may be considered congressional ""oversight."" Every Member of Congress has the ability, as ""an officer of the union, deriving his powers and qualifications from the Constitution,"" to leverage their position to influence agency action or gather information necessary to do their job. Also, though the Constitution does not vest the legislative power ""in any one individual,"" the ""action of the body as a whole"" requires the consent of ""the aggregate of the members who compose the body."" As explainedby the D.C. Circuit, ""[a]ll Members have a constitutionally recognized status entitling them to share in general congressional powers and responsibilities, many of them requiring access to executive information."" Each individual Member therefore participates in the exercise of Congress's legislative and investigative powers. It would appear that the same can be said for the exercise of committee power: though investigative jurisdiction and authorities have been delegated to committees, each Member of the committee shares in that power, and ""each is entitled to request such information from the executive agencies as will enable him to carry out the responsibilities of a legislator.""

Statutory Sources of Member Oversight Functions

While limited, some statutory provisions support the oversight activities of individual members. For example, some provisions of federal law require agencies to disclose specific types of information ""upon request of any Member of Congress."" Another law, 5 U.S.C. § 2954, requires agencies to comply with requests for information made by seven Members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform or five members of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Various agency regulations similarly recognize an individual Member's right of access to certain types of information, and the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel, though noting that individual Members have generally not been delegated investigative powers, nevertheless has reasoned that Members' requests should be given ""due weight and sympathetic consideration"" out of ""respect for the legislative functions of individual members.""

Relevant to many of the ongoing disputes, Congress has also used its power of the purse to support Member oversight activities. Since 2019, Congress has repeatedly enacted an appropriations provision that affirms the right of Members to physically inspect certain immigration facilities for oversight purposes. The initial law prohibited the use of appropriated funds to ""prevent a Member of Congress from entering, for the purpose of conducting oversight, any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house alien minors."" Congress later expandedthat law to prohibit the use of funds to deny Members access to ""any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house aliens."" The current appropriations restriction also explicitly provides that ""[n]othing in this section may be construed to require a Member of Congress to provide prior notice"" of their intent to enter such a facility, though DHS may require that congressional staff provide the agency with 24 hours' notice.

Enforcement of Oversight Requests

Ultimately, the primary distinction between the exercise of investigative powers by the House or Senate (through its committees) and individual Members is that committees have the power and tools (albeit with limitations) to overcome resistance to their oversight efforts and enforce their demands for information. Committees can compel compliance with their requests by issuing subpoenas and enforcing those subpoenas (with the approval of the parent chamber) either in court or through criminal contempt of Congress referrals. Members, on the other hand, generally cannot utilize these mechanisms. Even when acting pursuant to statutory powers, Members have often struggled to enforce their rights. While Members may request information from an agency and exert various forms of pressure to increase the likelihood of compliance with their requests, they generally have not been able to legally compel an agency, in court or otherwise, to disclose information that the agency is otherwise reluctant to produce. As described by the D.C. Circuit: ""disclosure of information can only be compelled by authority of Congress, its committees or subcommittees, not solely by individual members . . . . Election to the Congress does not give an individual subpoena power over whatever information he may happen to be interested in.""

Whether the difficulties that Members have experienced in enforcing other oversight rights may also be apparent in field investigations may be answered by the pending litigation brought by individual Members of Congress who were denied access to ICE facilities. That case includes the added complexity that it is at least partly founded on the appropriations provision discussed above, which is phrased as a prohibition on the use of funds rather than an explicit grant of authority to individual Members. One federal district court has stated that, as a result of the provision, Members are ""statutorily authorized to enter and inspect"" covered facilities ""to conduct oversight.""

Even with its greater authority, a committee acting pursuant to an authorized investigation may still have some difficulty enforcing a request for access to government property because the typical enforcement tools may not be available in that context. The subpoena is a committee's traditional means of compulsion, but subpoenas generally only come in two forms: subpoenas ad testificandum, or demands for testimony, and subpoenas duces tecum, or demands for records or other evidence. While congressional committees have attempted to use subpoenas in a variety of ways—for example, to prevent the removal of life support or to compel a witness to sign a document that would provide the Congress with access to an overseas bank account—it is not clear how a subpoena could be used to gain physical access to a site. Securing such access, therefore, may require the use of other forms of legislative leverage or litigating any constitutional power or statutory right in court.

Informal Member Fact-Finding and the Speech or Debate Clause

While it is generally recognized that conducting oversight of executive branch activities is one of the official responsibilities of a Member of Congress as described above, judicial decisions interpreting the legal protections that the Speech or Debate Clause (Clause) affords Members in exercising that oversight responsibility have injected some confusion into this area of law.

The Clause largely immunizes Members from criminal and civil liability predicated on their ""legislative acts."" The types of actions that the Clause protects go well beyond formal ""Speech or Debate"" in the halls of Congress to include any action that is an ""integral part of the deliberative and communicative processes"" through which Congress implements ""matters which the Constitution places within the jurisdiction of either House.""

The Supreme Court has held that investigative and oversight actions sanctioned by either the House or Senate or a congressional committee are the type of activities that receive the protections of the Clause. As a result, courts have interpreted actions taken by individual Members in the course of an authorized congressional investigation (for example at hearings, in issuing subpoenas, or pursuing contempt) as protected ""legislative acts.""

Some courts have been less receptive to interpreting the Clause to protect informal investigative and oversight actions undertaken by individual Members outside of authorized committee investigations. While these interactions are generally viewed as ""official"" and ""legitimate,"" they have not always been viewed as ""legislative"" for purposes of the Clause. The Supreme Court has saidthat efforts to influence how the executive branch implements or administers the laws enacted by Congress (a common and legitimate oversight activity) are not ""integral"" to the legislative function and not protected by the Clause, at least when conducted ""informally"" by an individual Member. As stated by the Supreme Court: ""Members of Congress are constantly in touch with the Executive Branch of the Government and with administrative agencies—they may cajole, and exhort with respect to the administration of a federal statute—but such conduct, though generally done, is not protected legislative activity.""

There is also some disagreement among the courts as to whether a Member's efforts to gather information from an agency necessary to assist in their legislative duties (as opposed to seeking to influence agency conduct) is protected legislative activity. Some courts do not view informal actions by individual Members as ""integral to the legislative process"" for purposes of the Clause. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, for example, has held that ""informal information gathering—either personally by a member of Congress or by congressional aides""—is not protected legislative activity. That court, however, acknowledged that information gathering ""is a proper congressional function and, when conducted by a committee, should be treated just as voting and debating legislation.""

That said, most courts have held that this type of informal fact-finding is a protected legislative act, regardless of whether that fact-finding is undertaken as part of an authorized committee investigation. The D.C. Circuit, for example, has articulatedthat ""the acquisition of knowledge through informal sources is a necessary concomitant of legislative conduct and thus should be within the ambit of [the Clause's] privilege so that congressmen are able to discharge their constitutional duties properly."" In another case, United States v. Biaggi, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that ""legislative factfinding activity conducted"" by an individual Member during a trip ""to inspect and visit"" state agencies in Florida in preparation for a congressional hearing was protected legislative activity. This recognition of the importance of legislative fact-finding by individual Members is consistent with the position generally taken by Members that, as constitutionally elected officers of the legislative branch, they may engage in oversight and investigations and are entitled to access necessary information.

Similarly, in McSurely, the D.C. Circuit recognized Member and staff ""field work"" and ""field investigations"" as protected legislative activities. At the same time, the court also clarifiedthat ""a Member of Congress or congressional employee is not free to use every conceivable means to obtain investigatory materials without fear of criminal prosecution or civil suit."" In that case, a Senate committee staff member traveled to Kentucky to view, collect, and transport back to Washington, DC, information that allegedly had been unlawfully obtained from an individual by state authorities and was subject to a court order of confidentiality due to Fourth Amendment concerns. Though acknowledging the committee staffer was engaged in informal fact-finding, the court nevertheless held that ""the employment of unlawful means to implement an otherwise proper legislative objective is simply not 'essential to legislating'"" and therefore was not protected by the Clause.

Most recently, in a federal criminal prosecution of a sitting Member of Congress, the Department of Justice acknowledged, and the federal district court agreed, that the Member's oversight and fact-finding inspection of a federal immigration facility was a protected legislative act. In that case, however, the court found that a physical altercation with law enforcement that took place ""during a brief time frame before the oversight inspection began"" was ultimately not a protected legislative act. That case remains ongoing.

While these cases are useful in understanding the scope of legislative power, especially absent cases dealing directly with individual Member oversight, the Clause acts primarily as a shield against intrusion by other branches into legislative acts: it is a protection; not a source of authority. For this reason, Speech or Debate Clause principles have played a significant role in recent executive branch efforts to either investigate or prosecute conduct that Members have described as information gathering—including the government's attempt, as referenced above, to prosecute a Member for an altercation with law enforcement that occurred during an oversight visit to an ICE facility.

Whether informal fact-finding activity is entitled to Speech or Debate Clause protections does not dispositively determine whether such activity is within a Member's authority. The fact that a certain activity may not qualify as legislative for purposes of the Clause does not necessarily mean that activity is unauthorized. The Court has made clear that some unprotected acts, though not deemed legislative, may still be within a Member's official responsibilities. The reverse is also true: the fact that a certain activity is considered legislative does not mean that it is authorized. Unauthorized acts—even some criminal acts—can still be protected legislative acts under the Clause.

Conclusion

Oversight of the executive branch is an essential aspect of the legislative function. While Congress has provided many of the compulsory investigative tools that support its oversight efforts to committees, individual Members nevertheless appear to retain the ability to conduct their own investigations and gather their own information, including through field investigations and site visits. Still, there are significant distinctions between committee investigations and individual Member investigations. Members have limited means available to enforce their particular investigative requests and, under the Speech or Debate Clause, may not always receive immunity for their otherwise legitimate investigative actions.",https://www.congress.gov/img/opengraph1200by630.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 19:59:06.787443

That includes dragging our nation back to a time when rivers caught fire, smog choked our cities, and California’s iconic coastline was wide open to offshore oil and gas drilling, and we know all too well what that means.
It helped spark the modern environmental movement and led to longstanding restrictions on offshore drilling along California’s coast.
“The threat posed by offshore drilling is not just environmental.
Offshore oil and gas leasing poses serious health and safety risks to our communities.","Washington, DC – Today, Congresswoman Julia Brownley (CA-26) released the following statement after the Trump administration announced plans to allow new oil and gas drilling off the California Coast for the first time in decades.

“The Trump administration has made its priorities unmistakably clear: rolling back protections, dismantling safeguards, and putting the interests of wealthy donors and powerful corporations before the health, safety, and future of the American people. That includes dragging our nation back to a time when rivers caught fire, smog choked our cities, and California’s iconic coastline was wide open to offshore oil and gas drilling, and we know all too well what that means.

“Oil spills have caused some of the worst environmental catastrophes in our nation’s history. While the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill occurred just north of California’s 26th Congressional District, its devastation is part of our region’s collective memory. That disaster was so profound that it transformed how our government oversees environmental protection for the offshore energy industry. It helped spark the modern environmental movement and led to longstanding restrictions on offshore drilling along California’s coast.

“The threat posed by offshore drilling is not just environmental. Offshore oil and gas leasing poses serious health and safety risks to our communities. It endangers local economies that rely on clean water and healthy ecosystems, including tourism, fishing, outdoor recreation, and the jobs that come with them. It also threatens the backbone of Ventura County’s $2 billion agricultural economy. Our farmers and farmworkers depend on clean water, healthy soil, and stable ecosystems to grow the crops that feed our country.

“An offshore spill could contaminate irrigation sources, damage coastal farmland, and jeopardize thousands of jobs across California’s Central Coast, and these harms are not borne equally. Low-income communities, communities of color, and the workers who power our agricultural and coastal economies, like Oxnard, the largest city in my district and one of the larger coastal cities in California, suffer first and worst from pollution, toxic exposure, and environmental degradation.

“Environmental justice demands that we prevent new harms — not repeat the failures of the past. At a time when the U.S. is already the world’s leading producer of oil and gas, when major oil companies are raking in record profits, and when most federal acres leased to industry sit unused, there is no justification for putting California’s coast back on the chopping block — except to serve corporate interests.

“Let me be absolutely clear: my Democratic colleagues and I stand united. We are committed to confronting this administration’s assault on our environment and standing up to the corporate interests trying to write our nation’s energy policy.

“We will fight back, not quietly, not halfway, but with the full force of our values and our conviction, because our coast, our communities, and our climate are worth every ounce of that fight.”

New Mexico took this gamble at the exact moment the market is now wobbly,” Rubio said.
Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the data center as a $5 billion project in February, lawmakers and some southern New Mexico residents have voiced concerns over how quickly the deal appeared to come together.
Project representatives have touted that as a way to prevent the data center from increasing nearby residents’ energy bills.
“It was a process failure, it was a transparency failure, it was a democracy failure,” Rubio said.","Two southern New Mexico state representatives on Thursday evening told their constituents that they view Project Jupiter, the massive data center for which elected county leaders approved $165 billion in government-backed bonds, as a transparency failure that “sidelined” the community.

Rep. Angelica Rubio (D-Las Cruces) and Rep. Micaela Lara Cadena (D-Mesilla) spoke at a Thursday event hosted by the nonprofit organization New Mexico Water Advocates and expressed apprehensions that Project Jupiter’s plans to generate natural gas and tap into the region’s troubled water utility will exacerbate regional pollution and strain a water system that’s already pushed to the limit.

Rubio noted that she has seen several recent headlines questioning whether the nation is on the brink of an artificial intelligence bubble and characterized the decision to approve $165 billion for an OpenAI and Oracle data center as a “gamble.”

Project Jupiter pits demand for data against New Mexico’s finite natural resources

“When the industry itself is signaling instability…it’s reckless for public institutions to lock themselves into these long-term subsidies and abatements and these water commitments. New Mexico took this gamble at the exact moment the market is now wobbly,” Rubio said. “For New Mexicans, there has been this long history of being told that the next big thing is what’s going to save us, whether it has been Spaceport, whether it was Virgin Galactic, Facebook, film incentives pitched as these permanent engines…now it’s Project Jupiter.”

Although Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the data center as a $5 billion project in February, lawmakers and some southern New Mexico residents have voiced concerns over how quickly the deal appeared to come together. They also question whether the project’s $360 million payment in lieu of taxes — spread out over 30 years — is a fair return for $165 billion.

“When I first heard that the payment in lieu of taxes was going to be $360 million, I assumed that was annually,” Lara Cadena, who also serves as vice chair on the House Taxation and Revenue Committee, said. “To see that our county commission signed a deal to receive so little, I was just stunned.”

Critics take issue with the data center’s energy source, in particular. Plans call for a natural gas generating “microgrid,” a system that can solely rely on its own power rather than drawing from an existing grid. Project representatives have touted that as a way to prevent the data center from increasing nearby residents’ energy bills. But critics say the 2025 law that governs microgrids appears to exempt them from complying with the state’s landmark Energy Transition Act — which requires that utilities use 50% renewable energy by 2030 and 80% renewable energy by 2040 — until 2045, when it would be required to use fully renewable energy.

Sen. Michael Padilla (D-Albuquerque), who sponsored the legislative language in question, has previously disputed that characterization to Source New Mexico and insisted that the development must comply with every aspect of the clean energy law.

The costs of what was going to go into a data center need to be more transparent.
In Ohio, they passed a law requiring data center companies to pay for a high percentage of the power they’re using.
So when you think about what regulation might make data center development more reasonable, it’s asking for the costs happening to be borne by the industry making them.
Fairfax County passed a data center zoning ordinance amendment – minimum requirements a data center will have to adhere to.","Tell me more about how you started focusing on data centers.

So, in Fairfax County, in 2020 or 2021, people were pursuing the construction of an indoor ski facility on a landfill. From a climate perspective, to build something that would need to be cooled 24/7 for indoor skiing seemed like a very bad proposal in terms of energy usage. And for what kind of gain?

Then our friends at the Sierra Club were saying, indoor ski slopes? Bad, yes. But data centers? Way, way worse. Those aren’t cooling to support snow but are cooling much larger areas on a much larger scale, dwarfing the area of that one ski slope. This was around the time the Prince William Digital Gateway was showing up – they were saying all these acres of agricultural lands and single-family housing zones were about to be rezoned. This was a big deal, and Sierra Club led the way in opening our eyes to this. The rezoning ultimately passed. The data centers were sued and the people who filed the lawsuit won, but pre-planning for the centers is still allowed to take place.

The way we think about the impacts of data centers, besides the loss of natural lands and the amount of energy that’s going to be needed to power these things, has been diesel generators. These are the things that are backup generation and the camel’s nose under the tent is trying to get them to be primary power.

Now I want to ask you a provocative question: is there any middle ground between letting these projects be built unfettered and outright bans on their development?

We have no regulation today. From our standpoint, these things are coming, they’re here. We know a lot more now than we did in 2022. As we make decisions about how and where to build these facilities we all need – I mean we’re using one right now. I use a data center all day at work. Teams conferencing. ChatGPT to answer a question. We need these. So if we’re going to build them, let’s not give a pass to some of the world’s largest and richest companies. Let’s ask them to put the guardrails on to protect our residences and our infrastructure to make sure they’re as sustainable as possible.

Okay, so what are the guardrails then?

The costs of what was going to go into a data center need to be more transparent. We need to bring accountability to the forefront right away as they’re being built.

In Ohio, they passed a law requiring data center companies to pay for a high percentage of the power they’re using. That cut a significant number of the projects in Ohio. This industry is so speculative and a land grab and a rush to be first to get the most.

You have this dichotomy of land values for residences being inundated, while land values for developers are skyrocketing. We have an affordability crisis going on and we are all on the hook for paying for the infrastructure to power these things.

So when you think about what regulation might make data center development more reasonable, it’s asking for the costs happening to be borne by the industry making them. Let’s get rid of some of the incentives for power users. We don’t need to be encouraging the loss of state revenue, either – we’re leaving money on the table to bring these facilities here.

Lastly, our readers love to get hyperlocal. I know you’re intently focused on Fairfax County right now which has been a big part of the data center boom in Virginia – what’s happening there?

There are a couple things that have happened over the course of this past year. Fairfax County passed a data center zoning ordinance amendment – minimum requirements a data center will have to adhere to. The big thing with that one is, you have to have a special exception if you build within a mile of a Metro station. When you think about good land use and building a data center within a walkable distance of a Metro, that’s eye-openingly poor land use policy and a missed opportunity for transit-oriented development. It doesn’t mean they can’t be built near one but you have to get a special exception.

Some things can’t be regulated at the local level. Like generators. That’s in the hands of the state.

Last night, we had a public hearing at the Fairfax County board level for our policy plan – our comprehensive plan providing guidance for developers who want to get a special exception or rezoning. It is not law. It is not required. It is a visionary document that helps us get to better. They’ve added a section for data centers in that. In May, staff put forward something pretty good, making sure data centers met a minimum level of efficiency. But our chairman of the county board said it went above and beyond our zoning ordinance and said he didn’t think it was appropriate, so staff rewrote that section and stripped out a lot of the specificity and higher standards that were in that document.

At the hearing, they deferred a decision, listening to the public but not having a discussion at the board level. They’ve left the record open through December 9th.

As we chronicle time and time again in The Fight, residents in farming communities are fighting back aggressively – protesting, petitioning, suing and yelling loudly. Things have gotten so tense that some are refusing to let representatives for Piedmont’s developer, PSEG, onto their properties, and a court battle is currently underway over giving the company federal marshal protection amid threats from landowners.

Exacerbating the situation is a quirk we don’t often deal with in The Fight. Unlike energy generation projects, which are usually subject to local review, transmission sits entirely under the purview of Maryland’s Public Service Commission, a five-member board consisting entirely of Democrats appointed by current Governor Wes Moore – a rumored candidate for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination. It’s going to be months before the PSC formally considers the Piedmont project, and it likely won’t issue a decision until 2027 – a date convenient for Moore, as it’s right after he’s up for re-election. Moore last month expressed “concerns” about the project’s development process, but has brushed aside calls to take a personal position on whether it should ultimately be built.

Enter a potential Trump card that could force Moore’s hand. In early October, commissioners and state legislators representing Carroll County – one of the farm-heavy counties in Piedmont’s path – sent Trump a letter requesting that he intervene in the case before the commission. The letter followed previous examples of Trump coming in to kill planned projects, including the Grain Belt Express transmission line and a Tennessee Valley Authority gas plant in Tennessee that was relocated after lobbying from a country rock musician.

One of the letter’s lead signatories was Kenneth Kiler, president of the Carroll County Board of Commissioners, who told me this lobbying effort will soon expand beyond Trump to the Agriculture and Energy Departments. He’s hoping regulators weigh in before PJM, the regional grid operator overseeing Mid-Atlantic states. “We’re hoping they go to PJM and say, ‘You’re supposed to be managing the grid, and if you were properly managing the grid you wouldn’t need to build a transmission line through a state you’re not giving power to.’”

Part of the reason why these efforts are expanding, though, is that it’s been more than a month since they sent their letter, and they’ve heard nothing but radio silence from the White House.

“My worry is that I think President Trump likes and sees the need for data centers. They take a lot of water and a lot of electric [power],” Kiler, a Republican, told me in an interview. “He’s conservative, he values property rights, but I’m not sure that he’s not wanting data centers so badly that he feels this request is justified.”

Kiler told me the plan to kill the transmission line centers hinges on delaying development long enough that interest rates, inflation and rising demand for electricity make it too painful and inconvenient to build it through his resentful community. It’s easy to believe the federal government flexing its muscle here would help with that, either by drawing out the decision-making or employing some other as yet unforeseen stall tactic. “That’s why we’re doing this second letter to the Secretary of Agriculture and Secretary of Energy asking them for help. I think they may be more sympathetic than the president,” Kiler said.

At the moment, Kiler thinks the odds of Piedmont’s construction come down to a coin flip – 50-50. “They’re running straight through us for data centers. We want this project stopped, and we’ll fight as well as we can, but it just seems like ultimately they’re going to do it,” he confessed to me.

Thus is the predicament of the rural Marylander. On the one hand, Kiler’s situation represents a great opportunity for a GOP president to come in and stand with his base against a would-be presidential candidate. On the other, data center development and artificial intelligence represent one of the president’s few economic bright spots, and he has dedicated copious policy attention to expanding growth in this precise avenue of the tech sector. It’s hard to imagine something less “energy dominance” than killing a transmission line.

WASHINGTON – Today, in coordination with the U.S. International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is releasing its first quarterly public update detailing progress made towards implementing a permanent, 100% solution to the Tijuana River sewage crisis afflicting millions of Americans in Southern California. Today’s public update marks another milestone in implementing the historic Memorandum of Understanding EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and Secretary of the Environment and National Resources of Mexico Alicia Bárcena Ibarra signed in Mexico City in July 2025.

“The Trump Administration committed to delivering an urgent and permanent 100% solution to the millions of people afflicted by this crisis, and it is critical that we are transparent with the public about ongoing projects as well as the status of upcoming projects. Our mission will not be accomplished until we reach the 100% solution,” said Administrator Lee Zeldin. “So far, we have successfully implemented this MOU well ahead of the projected timeline. We are committed to maintaining full transparency regarding both our current initiatives and the progress of future projects, ensuring the public stays informed about our ongoing efforts and planned developments. Safeguarding public health and environmental integrity stands as EPA's foremost responsibility, and every American deserves confidence in the safety of the air they inhale and the recreational areas they enjoy.”

“President Trump, EPA Administrator Zeldin, and the USIBWC are making real progress on a 100% solution to permanently eliminate American exposure to Mexican sewage from the Tijuana River,” said USIBWC Commissioner Chad McIntosh. “As we accelerate our infrastructure improvements at our San Diego plant, we will continue to monitor Mexico's progress to make sure they also urgently complete the work they agreed to do. This information will be shared with our stakeholders who support our commitment to finally solve the Tijuana River sewage crisis.”

Section 1(b) of the MOU requires the United States and Mexico to issue clear, coordinated, and at least quarterly updates to the public. This quarterly public update details the historic progress both nations have made towards fully and faithfully executing the MOU, including:

USIBWC completing a 10 million gallons per day (mgd) interim expansion of the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant (SBIWTP);

Mexico initiating the construction of the First Phase of the Tijuana River Gates, a collection pipes project, with Mexican state and federal funds;

A U.S.-Mexico binational working group announcing timelines for key Minute 328 projects had been compressed by an additional 9 months;

USIBWC completing a nanobubble ozonation pilot project for the Tijuana River and starting to plan for an accelerated 50 mgd expansion of SBIWTP;

EPA and SEMARNAT developing strategies for operations and maintenance (O&M) costs and accounts; and

U.S. and Mexican Sections of the IBWC entering final negotiations for a new treaty “Minute.”

The MOU established a framework for permanent resolution through three critical priorities crucial to achieving a 100% solution to the transboundary pollution crisis:

Securing Mexico's Financial Commitments

Accelerating Project Timelines

Adding Other Necessary Projects that Factor in Future Population Growth in the Tijuana River Valley

Future projects and timelines include Mexico allocating the remaining Minute 328 funds as part of Mexico’s 2026-2027 budgets, including half (USD$46M) in 2026 and half (USD$47M) in 2027, to facilitate completion of the remaining Minute 328 projects by December 31, 2027, or sooner, in accordance with the following project priority schedule:

Construction in Calendar Year 2026:

Rehabilitation of the Insurgentes Collector;

Rehabilitation of PB Matadero and Laureles Pump Station 2;

Rehabilitation of Poniente Interceptor;

Rehabilitation of the Oriente Interceptor;

Rehabilitation of the Collector Carranza; and

Backup power supply for PB1.

Construction in Calendar Year 2027:

Upgrades to the Arturo Herrera and La Morita WWTPs;

International Collector Phase II;

Rehabilitation of the Antiguo Force Main

Lift station and force main from Sainz Canyon to Arturo Herrera; and

Enclose the open channel from PB1 to SAB WWTP.

December 31, 2027 is the deadline to complete all Minute 328 projects.

Administrator Zeldin made it clear when he signed this agreement that the only way to achieve this desired end goal is to have a plan that takes into account all three of these key pillars. Sacrificing one of them would mean the “100%” solution would not be reached.

Since signing this MOU in July, the Trump Administration has made historic progress on implementing the agreement. In August, EPA and IBWC announced the completion of a 10 mgd expansion of the SBIWTP, which will significantly reduce wastewater flowing into the Tijuana River and help eliminate foul smells that have long plagued San Diego area residents. This project was initially projected to take two years, but the Trump Administration completed it in 100 days. The U.S. Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) is working closely with our local and Mexican partners as we enter the rainy season in the San Diego-Tijuana area. The South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant will continue to treat sewage from Tijuana at full capacity while we protect its infrastructure from excess sediment and trash that come with stormwater.

This public update provides further details on Mexico’s progress on meeting commitments the country agreed to in signing the MOU.

The next milestone will be the signing of a new “Minute” by the end of 2025. As the public update notes, the U.S. and Mexico sections of the IBWC are finalizing negotiations.",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-news-releases-og.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 18:03:43.285749

The latest: The Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) has been the center of attention from both Republicans and Democrats, with questions arising about transparency in its process, its achievements, and the general public’s opposition to government investments in private companies.","The debate over future economic development in Lansing continues with far-reaching implications for business — a conversation lawmakers and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer publicly said they expected to address before the end of the year, after passing the state budget.

The Detroit Regional Chamber continues to meet with and provide input to the leadership of both legislative chambers and the Governor’s office.

Where the issue stands: The leading economic development concept being discussed is a payroll tax credit. The House Republicans and Senate Democrats have each introduced their own versions. The basis of their proposals stem from the “Good Jobs for Michigan” package passed under then-Gov. Rick Snyder, but which has since expired.

As talks continue, the size and scope of both the House and Senate proposals remain in question and may not include a focus on large-scale projects like previous business incentives, such as the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve (SOAR) Fund.

Why it matters: Global competition is ramping up with the onset of AI, digitalization, and automation, which are reshaping every industry. Site selectors analyze many factors when determining where to locate their next expansion, including the business climate, talent pool, and economic development incentives. With the expiration of SOAR at the end of 2025, Michigan needs to look at new forms of long-term, sustainable economic development incentives to compete for jobs and investment from other states and countries.

What it is: The Senate Democrats’ version of this payroll tax credit, called “More Jobs for Michigan” and introduced by Sen. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing), creates a withholding tax capture that diverts 100% of employee income taxes to the employer. Additionally, it offers a retention credit for jobs that were at risk of leaving if the employer had not made the investment in the state.

How it works: To qualify for the credit, the employer must be generating 25 or more jobs and must be at 175% of the Detroit Region’s median wage, or have 250 or more jobs at 150%. Currently, 175% of the Region’s wage is about $90,000, and 150% is about $77,000. This package selects jobs that it would qualify as “good jobs,” preferring white-collar jobs in engineering and semiconductors over blue-collar assembly line work.

What they’re saying: “The focus is on looking at high-paying e-jobs and what we can do to incentivize those,” Singh said. “My package also takes a look at how you retain jobs, and especially in this environment with the tariffs and so forth. Having a retention strategy for companies that are based here in Michigan makes a lot of sense to me.”

What it is: A payroll tax credit called “Real Jobs for Michigan,” introduced by Rep. Mike Hoadley (R-Au Gres), creates a new income tax capture program for companies that create new full-time jobs paying 150% of the regional median wage, which is about $77,000 in the Detroit Region, the highest in the state, and as low as $63,000 in the Northeast Region.

How it works: The program is capped at $50 million annually through 2036, with $10 million allocated for businesses with fewer than 100 employees, $15 million allocated for businesses with between 100 and 999 employees, and $25 million allocated for businesses with more than 1,000 employees.

What they’re saying: “The biggest benefit to this is it’s not corporate welfare,” Hoadley said. “It’s not upfront taxpayer money. It is sincerely performance incentives that go right to job creators in this state.”

What it is: The House Republicans’ legislation aims to refinance the state’s remaining $1.62 billion MEGA obligation by extending the payment schedule from five years to ten years. The House package repeals the Michigan Business Tax (MBT) and eliminates the MEGA tax credits, which were negotiated with previous Governors and the state’s largest employers to retain critical employment numbers in the state.

Why it matters: MEGA credits have been utilized during critical periods in Michigan’s economy, notably at the end of the 20th century and during the Great Recession, when companies were considering relocating out of Michigan or offshore. Those businesses that negotiated their MEGA credits made a commitment to the state that they would retain those jobs for Michiganders in exchange for the incentive.

What they’re saying: “We’re not walking away from the [MEGA] commitment,” Rep. Mark Tisdel (R-Rochester Hills), the cosponsor of the legislation, said. “We’re simply going to restructure that and try to get that out in 10 payments over the next 10 years.”

What it is: Transformational brownfield plans are sales and use tax exemptions for developers of transformational projects on sites that would otherwise never have been redeveloped. The incentives are based on the project’s outcome and provide no upfront funding to developers.

Why it matters: Transformational brownfields have been around since 2017 and were essential in building Hudson’s Detroit. Without a level of incentive for redeveloping sites, vacant and polluted sites would remain undeveloped and leave urban cores with visible stains. The statewide cap was originally set at $800 million and then raised to $1.6 billion in 2023. The cap is $30 million away from being hit again, but multiple projects are being proposed, including the revitalization and partial demolition of the Renaissance Center property, which will easily exceed this.

What they’re saying: “This is a program that helped take our city from bankruptcy to a Top 50 place to visit in the world, and is enabling the same kind of transformation from west to east,” said Jared Fleisher, incoming Chief Executive Officer of Bedrock.

The latest: The Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) has been the center of attention from both Republicans and Democrats, with questions arising about transparency in its process, its achievements, and the general public’s opposition to government investments in private companies. The House Republicans have introduced legislation to disband the MEDC, which Whitmer has promised to veto if it were ever to clear the Democratic-controlled Senate.

Why it matters: The MEDC is the chief statewide entity charged with promoting economic growth in Michigan and does essential work to attract and retain businesses as well as promote the state and tourism.",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lansing-aerial-feature.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 17:02:18.598251

Clean energy exports from 2024 alone slashed global emissions by one per cent outside of China.
""The lucky few countries have got them [fossil fuels], but renewables, of course, are everywhere … everyone can do it,"" he said.
""Somehow, the reduction in enthusiasm of the global north is showing that the global south is moving.","There are well-known poster children for the transition to clean technologies. Norway, for its embrace of electric cars, Australia for rooftop solar and China for its colossal renewables industrial revolution.

But there are others that you might not have heard as much about.

Nepal, the landlocked Himalayan country, where 76 per cent of new cars are electric. Or Pakistan, where a homegrown solar boom has sprung up in response to rising energy prices.

Unshackled from established fossil-fuel industries and outdated technologies, these countries show how the global south is starting to move faster in the renewables transition than wealthier nations such as Australia. These shifts aren't being driven by climate motives, but rather energy security and economics.

In fact, the world is at a tipping point where renewable energy and electric cars are becoming so affordable that countries are leapfrogging the era of fossil fuels to go straight to green solutions, according to Kingsmill Bond, an energy strategist at global think tank Ember.

""The traditional way that people think about technology revolutions is they think that the rich countries do it first and then the technology makes it to the poor countries, which is what happened with the internet, for example,"" he says.

China as the centre of change

These developments would have been hard to fathom a decade ago.

China's rapid shift to renewables hasn't just transformed its own economy and started to eat into fossil fuel emissions at home; it's also building out that manufacturing capacity in other countries.

According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, since 2022 Chinese investments overseas have surged past $US220 billion ($340 billion) in manufacturing projects across batteries, solar, wind, electric cars and green hydrogen.

These investments are on top of the renewables and electric car products made in China and sold internationally.

Clean energy exports from 2024 alone slashed global emissions by one per cent outside of China.

While these exports are going to every region, the benefits are most striking in their immediate neighbourhood, according to Mr Bond.

""A lot of the electrification stories are China-adjacent. What you're seeing — as so often in technology revolutions — is countries near the centre of change are moving quicker. We have a real story of Asian electrification going on,"" he says.

The problem with fossil fuels is that not everyone has them, unlike sunshine and wind. Countries that don't have them are dependent on expensive, and sometimes volatile, imports.

Some 80 per cent of the world lives in countries that import coal, gas, petrol and diesel to power their lives, whereas 92 per cent of countries have the potential to generate renewable energy more than 10 times their current demand, Mr Bond says.

""The lucky few countries have got them [fossil fuels], but renewables, of course, are everywhere … everyone can do it,"" he said.

""People will harness their own energy. What's changed is that the price has come down so much that it's become feasible.""

The potential for cheap, abundant and locally-grown renewable energy, coupled with the opportunity to unshackle from imported fossil fuels, has seen emerging markets starting to transition faster than the global north.

Think of it like going straight to mobile phones instead of getting a landline connected first.

Wesley Morgan, a climate diplomacy academic at UNSW and fellow at the Climate Council, says this is a game-changer for global development and bringing access to electricity everywhere.

""Energy poverty is obviously still a thing in many parts of the developing world, but rather than going via … large fossil-fuel infrastructure like coal-fired power plants and then shifting to renewables, the economics now mean that developing countries can just leapfrog straight to renewables,"" he says.

Around the world, the clean energy transition is taking off in emerging markets.

Pakistan's sudden spike in solar in recent years, without any specific government policies or incentives driving it, has puzzled the world. The country has increased its solar capacity fivefold since 2022, and solar is now Pakistan's largest source of energy, ranking it among the top 20 countries globally for solar capacity.

In Africa, solar imports from China have risen by 60 per cent in the past year alone, according to analysis from Ember.

In Nepal, the dependence on imported oil via India was the catalyst for its EV boom.

In 2015, India implemented an unofficial oil blockade, grinding much of Nepal's transport to a halt and forcing the country to innovate, according to Reihana Mohideen, an electrical engineer at the University of Melbourne who focuses on the energy transition.

""Fuel tankers stopped arriving. Vital supplies were cut off. Prices skyrocketed. People queued for days at petrol stations. Black market rates soared. Public transport ground to a halt and long periods of blackout on top of existing blackout conditions,"" she said.

""So under those conditions, Nepal decided to explore a different course and look at electric vehicles. And the government played a really important role here [with] policy and planning.""

The Nepalese government introduced a target of having 90 per cent of new cars sold as electric by 2030 and this year it already reached 76 per cent.

By comparison, in Australia, battery-electric cars make up about 9 per cent of new car sales, rising to 12 per cent when hybrids are included.

Last year, the Ethiopian government's ban on combustion cars led to a spike in EV sales. The country spends more than $US4.5 billion importing fuel every year.

For small, island countries dotted across the Pacific, renewables reduce dependence on expensive diesel imports for power generators, according to Dr Mohideen.

""Solar plays a very important role because the systems can be smaller, they're modular, they're cheaper. Globally, the average prices for solar are cheaper than for fossil fuels,"" she says.

This is another key benefit of renewable systems, especially solar: developing regions can electrify without building large infrastructure. It doesn't even necessarily require government intervention or programs.

""This is a story we're kind of seeing now happening all over the place, people … import solar panels from China, you stick it on the back of a moped, and you carry it into the countryside, and you just put it up,"" Mr Bond says.

He says not having to adapt older energy systems — as is the case in Australia —makes it easier for emerging economies.

""If you're Kenya or Vietnam or Paraguay and your energy use per capita is relatively low, you don't have a huge entrenched fossil fuel system, and therefore you actually can build your electricity system right first time,"" Mr Bond says.

Another leap forward in this space has been the cost of batteries.

""Solar has been great, but you can't store it. And now you can store it cheaply with cheap batteries. This combination of solar plus batteries it's just creating a very different environment everywhere across the world,"" Mr Bond says.

""And the combination of the two is really what will break the logjam of change.""

India, not following the path of China, critical for the climate

For the emerging economies of the global south, the imperative to invest in renewables isn't to address climate change, as many of them have negligible emissions now. However, these regions would otherwise have the biggest emissions growth in the coming decades.

Their goal is to improve living standards, and the world's climate future will heavily depend on whether that can be done without the emissions toll that established economies such as the US or Australia have had.

""Now we have these big economies like China, like India, like Brazil, like Indonesia. And we really need those economies to be rapidly shifting to renewables if we're going to have any chance of tackling the climate crisis,"" Dr Morgan says.

Take India, for example, which has the world’s biggest population and is undergoing rapid economic development.

""If that is a fossil fuel-powered development, then we cannot come close to meeting our shared climate goals. So we really need India to be shifting to do what China is doing now, not what China has done over the last 30 years.""

There are already positive signs. India's per-capita emissions are lower than China's when it reached a similar level of GDP.

""India is not going down the Chinese path. If they were … Indian coal use per capita would already be two or three times higher than it is today,"" Mr Bond says.

""The reason … is not necessarily because of the global warming issues, simply because they've got another alternative — they've got the solar option.""

Where does this leave us today with COP?

As COP30 draws to a close, a lot of focus has been on the big emitters and the absence of the United States.

Corrêa do Lago, this year's COP president, stirred mixed reactions when he called out wealthy nations at the start of the summit.

""Somehow, the reduction in enthusiasm of the global north is showing that the global south is moving. It is not just this year — it has been moving for years, but it did not have the exposure that it has now,"" he told reporters in Belém.

Dr Morgan says there has always been tension between wealthy countries and the global south, with the expectation that developed countries needed to cut their emissions first.

""Essentially, the idea is that rich countries are supposed to move first, cutting their emissions and even more that they're supposed to provide finance to developing countries to help them with their energy transition and later coping with the impacts and adapting to climate change,"" he says.

""What [they] want to see is polluting nations paying for the loss and damage caused by their pollution, and also helping to provide climate finance to help with adaptation.""

This year's COP was dubbed an ""implementation COP"" because the focus has not been on reaching an agreement but instead on making sure countries are delivering on their existing commitments.

For Mr Bond that is fundamentally changing the role of governments in climate action.

""The function of governments was to spark this change. And now that they've done that, they need to get out of the way, actually, and allow it to happen,"" he says.

But for Dr Mohideen, governments are still critical for ensuring the transition is as smooth and equitable as possible.

""In a lot of countries … there's a gap between policies that exist and what's happening on the ground in terms of new renewable energy systems and programs being rolled out,"" she says.

“Political will is necessary to develop strong policy.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/a078f7cb8feb59b517b87a7d16af05cd?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2132&cropW=3791&xPos=0&yPos=197&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-11-21 18:03:24.708017

“We’re likely to see a lot less infrastructure built, paired with an increase in energy demand,” Weeks said.","What is the future of renewables in New Hampshire, and how can citizens help make it happen?

The future of renewable energy in New Hampshire will depend on community collaboration, smarter energy management and policy changes that support local projects, according to speakers at a Community Conversation on Wednesday hosted by the Monadnock Center for History and Culture and the Monadnock Ledger-Transcript.

Speakers said residents can support renewable energy by enrolling in demand response programs, using smart thermostats, supporting warrant articles for municipal projects, and advocating for policy changes such as higher net metering caps.

The panel featured Gabe Chelius, a circuit rider for Clean Energy New Hampshire; Jennifer Runyon of Eversource’s Demand Response Team; and Dan Weeks, vice president of business development for ReVision Energy.

Chelius said his organization helps municipalities and small businesses identify, plan and finance energy-saving and renewable-energy projects, and connects them with contractors, grant opportunities and model warrant articles. He said that some recent projects will generate substantial long-term savings for small businesses.

When asked by Monadnock Center for History and Culture Director Michelle Stahl about help specifically for nonprofits, Chelius admitted that there is not a lot of help for that sector in terms of grant funding, calling it the “biggest gap” in the funding opportunities that Clean Energy New Hampshire tracks.

“There simply aren’t enough programs to help them,” Chelius said. “It’s a huge issue; there’s a massive void.”

Runyon spoke about the purpose of the Demand Response Team, which she said was about taking demand off the grid during peak hours. She said that the entire grid is sized to meet its peak demand, even though it does not need that capacity most of the time.

“And so, if the peak demand keeps growing, we have to keep growing the grid,” Runyon explained.

Eversource’s voluntary demand response program allows the utility to make minor adjustments to participating residents’ smart thermostats or home battery systems during peak hours, typically early evenings in the summer.

“One person doing that is not going to save a lot of energy, but when you have 100,000, which demand response does, it makes a difference,” Runyon said.

Runyon said participation at scale reduces stress on the grid and can limit costly upgrades. Residents who enroll get a stipend — $50 for smart thermostats and $3,000 for eligible battery systems. Runyon said the company buys back battery power in Massachusetts and Connecticut, but not yet in New Hampshire, though the stipend is calculated to cover the average price of the electricity generated.

Weeks said New Hampshire trails neighboring states in solar adoption due to state policies.

“So it’s not geography, it’s not climate — it’s policy,” Weeks said.

One way to open up new solar projects is to increase the net metering cap for solar power generation for all systems. Weeks pointed to the state’s 1-megawatt cap on community solar projects for residential and commercial users. Larger systems up to 5 megawatts are allowed only for municipalities and school districts. Legislative efforts to raise those caps are underway.

Weeks also noted that the federal 30 percent solar investment tax credit, which has helped reduce the upfront cost of installations, expires at the end of the year, likely slowing small-scale solar development.

“We’re likely to see a lot less infrastructure built, paired with an increase in energy demand,” Weeks said.

First Solar is America’s leading photovoltaic solar technology and manufacturing company, according to its website.
Once fully ramped, the Iberia Parish facility is expected to add 3.5 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity, company officials said.
“This is more than just a manufacturing facility.
It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,” Widmar said.","NEW IBERIA, La. (KLFY) — First Solar, Inc. today inaugurated its new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish.

The $1.1 billion facility, which spans approximately 2.4 million square feet and is about 11 times the size of the New Orleans Superdome, currently employs over 700 people and is expected to have 826 employees by the end of the year.

First Solar is America’s leading photovoltaic solar technology and manufacturing company, according to its website. Photovoltaic technology converts sunlight directly into electricity using semiconductor-based solar cells. These cells are connected into larger panels, which can be used in various applications from small devices like calculators to large-scale utility solar farms.

Once fully ramped, the Iberia Parish facility is expected to add 3.5 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity, company officials said.

“First Solar’s investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses,” said Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry. “This is exactly how we advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we’re strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.”

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule. The facility, which officials claim has no dependencies on Chinese supply chains, produces First Solar’s Series 7 modules using American materials including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

According to an economic impact analysis conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, and commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority, the new facility is forecast to grow Iberia Parish’s Gross Domestic Product by 4.4% in its first full year of operations at capacity.

Manufacturing roles at the facility offer an average compensation package of $90,000 per year, more than three times the per capita income in Iberia Parish, according to First Solar CEO Mark Widmar.

“This is more than just a manufacturing facility. It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,” Widmar said. “By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we’re demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn’t just a thesis, it’s an operating reality.”

First Solar today inaugurated its new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana. The $1.1 billion facility spans approximately 2.4 million square feet and is about 11 times the size of the New Orleans Superdome.

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule. The accelerated timeline was driven by the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Trump administration’s trade policies, both of which catalyzed demand for American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance. The facility, which has no dependencies on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains, produces First Solar’s Series 7 modules using American materials including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

“First Solar’s investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses,” said Louisiana Governor, Jeff Landry. “This is exactly how we advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we’re strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.”

According to an economic impact analysis conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority (IEDA) the new facility is forecast to grow Iberia Parish’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 4.4% in its first full year of operations at capacity. Manufacturing roles at the facility offer an average compensation package of $90,000 per year, more than three times the per capita income in Iberia Parish.

“This is more than just a manufacturing facility. It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,” said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. “By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we’re demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn’t just a thesis, it’s an operating reality.”

The high-tech factory is enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), using computer vision and deep learning to automatically detect defects in solar panels during production, while technicians and operators leverage AI-powered tools to make operating adjustments and guide decision making.

“This is, beyond doubt, one of the most advanced solar manufacturing facilities in the world and it represents the very best of American manufacturing innovation,” said Kuntal Kumar Verma, chief manufacturing officer, First Solar. “Along with its sister facilities in Ohio and Alabama, this factory demonstrates how AI can be harnessed to help American factory workers reach their full potential. Our fleet offers proof that AI can help realize productivity gains that allow us to out-innovate the competition and run our operations smarter, better, and faster.”

The Louisiana facility is part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one in Alabama, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Last week, the Company announced an investment in a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 modules initiated by its international fleet. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company. It is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the Company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.
