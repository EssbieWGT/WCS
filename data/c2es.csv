The Buffalo River Watershed Alliance and 42 other environmental organizations (collectively, “BRWA”) submitted a Petition to the United States Department of Agriculture Rural Business-Cooperative Service (“RBCS”) styled:

PETITION FOR RULEMAKING TO DEEM MANURE DIGESTERS INELIGIBLE FOR FUNDS UNDER THE RURAL ENERGY FOR AMERICA PROGRAM (“Petition”).

BRWA argues that RBCS should issue a rule deeming manure digesters ineligible for Rural Energy for America Program (“REAP”) grants and loan guarantees.

BRWA argues that:

… Even if manure digesters fit within the definition of renewable energy systems ordinarily eligible for funding under REAP, RBCS has the authority to decline to fund them because they directly undermine Congress’s intent that REAP “promote rural economic development” while “provid[ing] environmental and public health benefits such as cleaner air and water.”

The organizations further argue that Congress’s intent is undermined because they failed to provide many of the benefits that RBCS considers when awarding REAP funding.

Anaerobic digestion is a process through which bacteria break down organic matter – such as animal manure, wastewater biosolids, and food waste. This occurs in the absence of oxygen.

Anaerobic digestion for biogas production takes place in a sealed vessel called a reactor, which is designed and constructed in various shapes and sizes specific to the site and feedstock conditions. These reactors contain complex microbial communities that break down or digest the waste and produce resultant biogas and digestate (the solid and liquid material end-products of the BD process) which is discharged from the digester.

Anaerobic digestion can produce two valuable outputs:

Biogas.

Digestate.

Energy and biogas can be used like natural gas to provide heat, generate electricity, and power cooling systems. Further, it can be purified by removing the inner or low-value constituents to generate renewable natural gas.

The digestate is the residual material left after the digestion process. With appropriate treatment, both the solid and liquid portions of digestate can be used in beneficial applications such as animal bedding, nutrient-rich fertilizer, foundation material for bio-based products, and/or as soil amendment.

BRWA’s Petition argues:

Digesters contribute to the loss of small farms in rural communities.

Cause water and air pollution that harms human health.

Fail to provide many of the benefits that RBCS must identify and consider when awarding REAP funding.

RBCS gives preference to projects that seek a grant of $250,000 or less, yet the manure digesters that received grants from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2025 required an average of $855,701, over three times more than RBCS’s preferred maximum.

Studies show that manure digesters typically are unlikely to recoup their high costs.

Manure digesters that received loan guarantees from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2025 generate an average of 4.5 times less energy per public dollar than solar projects.

Manure digesters offer only uncertain and incomplete GHG emissions reductions at major cost to taxpayers.

Making manure digesters ineligible for REAP will free up funds for projects that satisfy REAP’s purposes by benefitting small farms, rural communities, the environment, and taxpayers.

The Petition components include:

House Appropriations Committee Releases Funding Bill Covering International Climate Financing

The FY26 National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs (NSRP) bill includes continued, but substantially reduced, investments in climate and environmental programs. There is $131.8 million for sustainable landscapes to protect forests and marine resources, $125 million for renewable energy through the Clean Technology Fund, and $192 million for climate adaptation and disaster preparedness in high-risk regions. Despite significant reductions, the bill preserves key international climate and conservation funding that the administration had proposed eliminating, without imposing new anti-climate policy restrictions. The House passed the package 341-79 on January 14, and it’s making its way to the Senate.

Minibus Largely Spares EPA Funding but Cuts Deeper into Interior

House and Senate appropriators unveiled another fiscal 2026 spending package to fund the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Compared with earlier Republican proposals, the measure largely preserves EPA funding, while imposing modest additional cuts at Interior. EPA would receive $8.816 billion, about 4 percent below its 2025 level, but more than double the administration’s proposed budget.

This package shields funding for several programs. For example, financing for geographic restoration initiatives would rise to $690 million, reversing major proposed cuts. State and tribal assistance grants will similarly see increased funding of up to $4.41 billion, including support for region-specific environmental and infrastructure projects.

Unfortunately, lawmakers did accept sharp cuts to the Superfund program, which pays for the cleanup of hazardous waste sites across the country. Thankfully, we expect reinstated excise taxes on major polluters to offset the cut by imposing fees on sales of polluting substances. The bill also directs EPA to maintain federal oversight of the Energy Star program rather than privatizing it.

Interior would receive $14.54 billion, slightly less than the $14.8 billion in 2025, but well above the administration’s request. The bill still trims funding for land management, parks, science programs, and renewable energy development, while increasing support for oil and gas activities.

News and Updates

Oil Company Receives Record Fine for 2023 Louisiana Oil Spill

On January 5, federal pipeline regulators imposed a record civil penalty on Panther Operating Co. over safety problems that led to a massive 2023 oil spill off the Louisiana coast. Panther Operating Co. runs over a thousand miles of crude oil and gas pipelines through onshore and offshore areas in the Gulf of Mexico. The spill released roughly 1.1 million gallons of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico.

The Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is seeking $9.6 million, the largest fine ever proposed under federal pipeline safety enforcement. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the action underscores the administration’s intent to pursue serious penalties when operators fail to meet regulatory standards.

U.S. Withdraws from Landmark Climate Change Treaty

President Donald Trump announced that the United States will withdraw from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the main global agreement guiding international efforts to address climate change. The decision would make the U.S. the only country to ever leave the treaty.

The UNFCCC, adopted in 1992, is the foundation for international climate talks, including the Paris Agreement. The U.S. withdrawal will become official one year after notice is submitted to the United Nations.

The move is part of a broader withdrawal from dozens of international organizations the White House claims promote policies that conflict with U.S. sovereignty and economic priorities. Trump officials have argued that global climate agreements place unfair limits on the U.S. while offering little benefit in return.

Despite the instability, Buttigieg expressed confidence that the American market still has an opportunity to set the pace for global mobility innovation.

“We don’t need nostalgia about the auto industry because we are living in the most transformational moment for transportation since the combustion engine was developed,” Buttigieg said.

While adoption of EVs has been hesitant, he shared that their mere existence represents a permanent technological shift; policymakers cannot “put the toothpaste back in the tube.” This poses the question: Is the U.S. able to lead that shift or watch global competitors define it?

Buttigieg also added that America must approach the transition with equal seriousness if it intends to “own the 21st Century just as much as we did the 20th century,” but it won’t happen on its own.

Thinking about what the future would look like, he noted that the public will notice vast differences in land-use patterns, vehicle designs, and even ownership compared to the past. During his time as secretary, he noted that federal regulations still dictate mirror placement — even in driverless vehicles — reflecting outdated assumptions and can pose risks to both the nation’s safety and competitiveness.

“A lot of the people making decisions about technology in our country, I fear, do not understand the technologies that they are regulating or proposing to make decisions about,” he warned. “People expect from their leaders a level of literacy around these technologies that are going to shape so much about our day-to-day lives, not to mention our economy.”

Reflecting on his service in the U.S. Navy, where he drove officers and equipment along dangerous routes in Afghanistan, he said the most important lesson he learned was the role of trust. No one cared about politics or personal background; they cared about competence and preparedness. Trust, he said, is the operating system of society and innovation. Whether deploying autonomous vehicles, modernizing infrastructure, or integrating AI into daily life, trust is the invisible infrastructure that makes progress possible and innovation is cultivated.

“Nothing works without trust, even the most basic things,” he said. “If that sounds like an extreme or exotic consideration, consider the fact that every time you’re at a green or a red light, you are trusting. You’re making a life-or-death decision to trust your personal survival to a whole bunch of people that you’ve never met, because your survival depends on whether everybody follows the same convention of the stoplight.”",https://michauto.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ButtigiegArticle.png,N,,2026-01-16 10:01:07.575447

The relationship between Cherry Street and Inman Solar goes back over a decade, CEO Michael Chanin told Hypepotamus, as the two grew and scaled in Atlanta’s renewable energy space.
The State of Solar Energy Early Cherry Street customers included municipalities and universities, schools, houses of worship, and hospital networks.
But recently, Chanin said that Cherry Street has been seeing more interest from industrial and manufacturing companies, particularly in the Southeast region.
“[Solar power] technology has existed for quite a long time.","Surging electricity demand from data centers, electric vehicles, and onshore manufacturing sites have brought big opportunities for Cherry Street, the Atlanta-based solar technology company that provides distributed power generation.

Cherry Street is primed to capitalize on those opportunities following a new acquisition of 16 operating distributed generation projects from fellow Atlanta company Inman Solar.

The acquisition, announced this week, brings an additional 12.7 megawatts of capacity across Georgia, Florida, Washington D.C., South Carolina, and Michigan under Cherry Street’s umbrella. This matters because that has the potential to power thousands of homes.

Most of the acquired projects are in the State of Georgia. Their energy and renewable attributes are sold to Georgia Power as part of the utility’s Georgia Public Service Commission approved solar programs, according to a company press release.

Financial information around the site acquisition were not disclosed, but the acquisition of the sites “present excellent opportunities for future battery storage integration, which will enhance their value to the grid and support the continued economic development across the Southeast,” Chanin added in a press statement.

The relationship between Cherry Street and Inman Solar goes back over a decade, CEO Michael Chanin told Hypepotamus, as the two grew and scaled in Atlanta’s renewable energy space. Dan Fossitt has served as Inman Solar’s President and CEO since 2009. The transaction proved mutually beneficial: Inman Solar is refocusing on its core EPC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) services and development business, while Cherry Street expands its portfolio of long-term generating assets.

“We’re going to continue to need to expand the availability of reliable and affordable electricity, and so these solar fields are going to enable flexibility and durability in our system,” Chanin told Hypepotamus.

The State of Solar Energy

Early Cherry Street customers included municipalities and universities, schools, houses of worship, and hospital networks. The company has Emory University, the Atlanta Airport, Gulfstream, and Porsche as some of its clients. But recently, Chanin said that Cherry Street has been seeing more interest from industrial and manufacturing companies, particularly in the Southeast region.

“Historically, we would not have been able to be in a place to provide competitively priced electricity. Because of such material growth in the market, the supply and demand economics make our electricity very competitive,” Chanin said.

He added that he remains optimistic about the future of solar energy in the Southeast and its “ability to serve the communities where we are.”

“[In the Southeast] we have abundant and incredible natural resources from the sun,” he added. “[Solar power] technology has existed for quite a long time. It’s incredibly reliable and what it produces is very predictable.”

The biggest question about the final repeal is what it will say about climate science.
But last summer’s proposal also took a swipe at established climate science through what it called an “alternative rationale” for the repeal.
The endangerment finding was issued under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act, which covers car and truck pollution.
The proposed rule asserts that EPA sees the endangerment repeal as only applying to motor vehicle sector regulations.","EPA is on the verge of finalizing its sweeping rollback of the endangerment finding — the scientific cornerstone that allows it to regulate climate pollution — in a move that would help President Donald Trump topple multiple rules aimed at forcing American industries to reduce their carbon emissions.

It stands to be a game changer for a president who has rejected the basic tenets of climate science as he works to accelerate the production of fossil fuels, the main source of pollution that has led global temperatures to reach levels never seen before by modern humans. Repealing the 2009 finding would eliminate the regulatory authority that EPA relied on to enact climate rules on sources such as power plants and vehicles, easing Trump’s ability to revoke them — and making it harder for future presidents to replace them.

Yet the repeal will almost certainly face court challenges. Whether EPA’s action is successful could hinge on three things: its legal rationale for revoking the finding, its treatment of the scientific record and the strength of its regulatory analysis and responses to public comments. Those factors will come to light when the agency releases its final rule, expected within weeks.

“If the courts decide that this is valid, then … you can definitely see a scenario where you can wipe out a lot of the rules on the books that have been justified using the endangerment finding,” said Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, an advocacy group that opposes regulations. “That’s kind of a big deal.”

The proposed repeal is under review by the White House, along with a rollback of Biden-era climate standards for cars and trucks. The rules were submitted to the Office of Management and Budget last week and are expected to be released together in January or February.

Here are three things that could determine whether the repeal succeeds or fails, according to lawyers and environmental advocates.

Law and science, or just law?

The biggest question about the final repeal is what it will say about climate science.

The proposal issued by EPA on July 29, 2025, centered on a new statutory interpretation of EPA’s Clean Air Act authorities instead of science. It argued that the landmark environmental law did not permit EPA to regulate pollution from motor vehicles unless direct exposure to it endangered the public.

But last summer’s proposal also took a swipe at established climate science through what it called an “alternative rationale” for the repeal. It argued that the Obama EPA based the endangerment finding on projections and empirical data and analyses that were “unduly pessimistic” about the atmosphere’s sensitivity to spiking greenhouse gas emissions and the dangers of warming for the public.

To support this contention, EPA relied overwhelmingly on a report written by five climate contrarians assembled by Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

But the group and its report have run into significant legal and reputational problems in the months since the endangerment proposal was released. The Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists are suing the Department of Energy, which they say skirted public records laws in convening the so-called Climate Working Group in secret last May. A judge overseeing the case criticized the government for describing the contrarians’ work as an objective review of climate science, when instead it was a clear attempt, he said, to infuse established science with doubt about the effects of rising temperatures. Wright later disbanded the group.

Meanwhile, in September the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine issued its own report reaffirming that the use of fossil fuels is producing dangerous warming. The scientific panel plays a unique role by statute in informing Clean Air Act regulations.

All told, experts predicted that if EPA highlights the DOE report in the final repeal of the endangerment finding it could come back to bite the agency in court.

“I think the disbanding of the Climate Working Group, the court decisions and the litigation brought by EDF and UCS, the complete rebuttal by the National Academies and many scientists, certainly weakens any basis for EPA to rely or depend on that report,” said Meredith Hankins, legal director for federal climate policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “And so, if they try and continue to include it in the final rule, that’ll just be one more arbitrary and capricious argument that we’ll be pushing in court.”

Jeff Holmstead, who served as EPA’s air chief under President George W. Bush, said he was “pretty confident they’ll rely on the legal rationale” in the final repeal — and not the contrarians’ climate report.

Joe Goffman, the air chief under former President Joe Biden, said EPA would likely lean into arguments that it thinks could persuade the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court to issue a decision that “precludes or dispositively sandbags a future administration from regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.”

Public comments

Holmstead, an attorney at Bracewell LLP, said that dropping the so-called alternative rationale based on climate science from the final rule could stem from practical considerations. The draft rule’s public comment period closed in late September, and EPA hasn’t had time to process and meaningfully respond to all the public criticism it received about its scientific assertions. The DOE report that advanced those claims has been described by climate scientists as promoting misinformation, cherry-picking data to downplay the dangers of global warming and regurgitating debunked arguments.

If EPA’s rationale for the repeal continues to be partly based on scientific arguments, rather than relying on legal ones exclusively, it would have an obligation to respond to all of the scientific information in the public comments — including the report by the National Academies, the federal government’s preeminent advisory body on scientific matters.

“If they’re basing it entirely on their legal rationale, they may still want to sort of downplay the science. But they don’t have an obligation to respond to all the scientific arguments that were made,” said Holmstead.

Advocates and lawyers said they’d be looking to see how EPA responded to comments about the draft — not only on its science-based assertions, but on its legal arguments as well. The agency reports having received 572,000 public comments on the draft by the September 22 deadline, but it has uploaded only 31,000. If its response to those comments is deemed to be inadequate, the repeal could fail in court.

“The agency got hundreds of thousands of comments on this, including really extensive and detailed comments, and comments from people who would be adversely impacted by this action,” said Peter Zalzal, associate vice president for clean air strategies at EDF. “Seeing how the agency is responding and considering those — as it’s required to do under the law — has EPA done anything to analyze or consider those very real and harmful impacts on people?”

One rule to end all rules

Lawyers and advocates will also search the final rule for any intel about how EPA sees its repeal impacting regulations beyond the motor vehicle sector. The endangerment finding was issued under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act, which covers car and truck pollution.

The proposed rule asserts that EPA sees the endangerment repeal as only applying to motor vehicle sector regulations.

“Note this does not include stationary sources, which are regulated under a completely different section of the Clean Air Act,” said EPA press secretary Brigit Hirsch in an email to POLITICO’s E&E News. “To report otherwise would show a lack of understanding of EPA’s statutory authority.”

Mike Sommers, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, said in a call with reporters on Monday that the oil and gas trade group supports EPA’s repeal of the finding for motor vehicles.

“We would not support repealing the endangerment finding for stationary sources, and one of the reasons why we wouldn’t support that is because we do support the federal regulation of methane,” he said.

But there isn’t a separate endangerment finding for stationary sources of climate pollution.

Since 2009, the finding on climate pollution from new motor vehicles has legally supported standards for oil and gas methane and power plant carbon. It could do the same in the future for landfill methane and carbon from other industries.

“It’s incorporated by reference in all of the other rules,” said Meghan Greenfield, an attorney with Jenner & Block LLP. “So, if you set that aside, it’s unclear how any of them can stand on their own.”

She said she’ll be looking for indications within the final rule about how scrapping the endangerment finding could cascade into repealing other rules.

“Does it by its own operation, affect the other standards outside of motor vehicles, like power plants, landfills, oil and gas?” she said. “Or, if the EPA were to change direction on those, how much extra effort does it require for them to repeal those other rules?”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/ca/d7/a6f902a54cf4a98f128589dc3f46/epa-2025-year-in-review-10973.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 09:59:50.308896

The Trump administration and governors will urge the grid operator to return to market fundamentals after the acute problem is addressed, the White House official said.

PJM is now being asked to extend the price cap for auctions held through this year, the White House official said.","“I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,” Trump wrote in his post.

Cost-of-living concerns are already weighing heavily on Republicans’ bid to maintain control of the House and Senate in this November’s congressional elections. While Trump has stressed the plummeting cost of oil and gasoline since he took office last January, electricity prices have climbed due to rising demand — and there’s a building backlash against data centers that are fueling the surge.

The average US retail price for electricity gained 7.4% in September to a record 18.07 cents per kilowatt-hour, the biggest gain since December 2023. Residential prices have jumped even higher, rising by 10.5% between January and August 2025, marking one of the largest increases in more than a decade, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.

Friday’s action is being cast as a one-time emergency intervention into the PJM market, necessary because of the rapid rise in electricity prices in the Mid-Atlantic region. The Trump administration and governors will urge the grid operator to return to market fundamentals after the acute problem is addressed, the White House official said.

The administration’s prescription for PJM is what’s known as a reliability backstop auction — something the grid operator already envisioned in the wake of repeated failed sales. But the administration and governors’ plan would mean holding the emergency auction right away after one clear failure – with unusual terms meant to foster a wave of rapid, new construction and the only bidders being data center owners and operators.

While PJM already holds auctions procuring electricity supplies, those are 12-month periods. In the auction encouraged by Trump and the governors for 15-year contracts, start-up times for the new power plants are likely to be staggered. The White House and governors are urging PJM to hold the special one-time auction by the end of September.

“It sounds like a significant improvement and a logical extension of bring-your-own new generation,” Joe Bowring, president of PJM’ s independent watchdog Monitoring Analytics LLC, said in a telephone interview.

“While a ‘statement of principles’ doesn’t appear to include a legal mandate for PJM to act, pressure from the Trump administration and a bipartisan coalition of PJM states is very likely to motivate a considerable response” from the grid operator, said Timothy Fox, an analyst with the research firm ClearView Energy Partners.

This plan also could fast track the development of natural gas generation and potentially nuclear plants by guaranteeing revenues – and profits – specifically to support data campuses needed to deploy artificial intelligence.

The approach could benefit larger tech companies at the expense of smaller firms.

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Google and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) are less exposed to electricity price fluctuations since they can pass those costs on to customers, said Gil Luria, analyst at DA Davidson & Co. However, dozens of smaller companies, including Nebius (NBIS) and CoreWeave (CRWV) that offer artificial intelligence infrastructure to cloud-computing companies on multi-year contracts, could be more exposed to big price swings since they are on the hook to absorb higher electricity costs, he said.

“If they have to pay more for electricity, their margins will get squeezed,” Luria said.

The effort has the potential to help PJM tackle a significant roadblock: improving the accuracy of its forecasts for demand growth. With tech giants paying for the power plants they need, the approach could weed out speculative projects that have skewed demand growth projections.

The involvement of governors – including Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Maryland’s Wes Moore, both Democrats – is seen by the Trump administration as helping to anchor the effort, since state policies have driven recent changes in the power mix, including the retirement of coal and gas plants. The initiative is also seen aiding hyperscalers by ensuring reliable power supply, and it could be a model for other parts of the country, the White House official said.

Governors are committing to implement and assign these costs to the data centers, ensuring the price of these new power plants doesn’t land on the average household, the White House official said.

PJM’s auctions have emerged as a political flashpoint in the national debate about affordability after prices reached record levels in 2024. Although Pennsylvania’s Shapiro struck a deal with PJM to cap prices in future auctions, costs hit new highs in two subsequent sales.

The most recent auction, in December, also fell 6.6 gigawatts short of supplies, which PJM blamed on the frenzy to build massive data centers.

PJM is now being asked to extend the price cap for auctions held through this year, the White House official said.

While the statement of principles being signed Friday isn’t a binding legal document, administration officials have discussed the plan with a host of stakeholders, from PJM executives and state officials, to utilities, power-plant developers, Wall Street and the hyperscalers building these data centers, the official said.

But the most decisive element in transforming cars into active energy resources is the human factor.","During AFC Ajax match days at the Amsterdam Johan Cruijff ArenA, the spectacle is not confined to the pitch. As tens of thousands of fans stream into the stadium, long rows of electric vehicles remain parked outside, quietly storing solar energy collected over the afternoon and later feeding part of it back to the stadium when demand surges. A scene that would have sounded futuristic only a few years ago is now technically feasible, and researchers developing advanced charging systems say the foundations are already there. As Professor Gautham Ram Chandra Mouli of TU Delft explains, this scenario illustrates a broader point emerging from advanced charging research: “An electric vehicle is not just a load but a potential micro–storage unit, capable of supporting the grid when managed through precise modelling and controlled charging.” In his view, “mobility and energy are no longer separate systems: if managed correctly, the EV becomes part of the energy infrastructure.”

The timing is relevant: according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), in 2025, battery electric vehicles accounted for around 16% of new-car registrations in the EU, reflecting strong growth in EV uptake. This growth overlaps with a grid increasingly strained by electrification, local congestion and renewable variability. As highlighted in the IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2023, Europe faces more than €3.5 trillion in required grid investments by 2035 to modernise and digitalise its electricity networks. In this context, turning EVs into distributed storage is not a futuristic idea but one of the most realistic forms of flexibility available at scale. As Mouli adds, the logic is simple: “The vehicles are already there, already plugged in, already carrying large batteries.”

Yet today’s EV ecosystem has a core limitation: most vehicles can receive energy but not return it to the grid. Many models technically could, but this function is deactivated due to uncertainty. “Battery lifetime, thermal behaviour and charging dynamics must be modelled precisely before exposing users to additional cycles,” Mouli notes. Automakers remain cautious because ageing mechanisms vary widely across chemistries and thermal systems, and warranties must be built around predictable patterns. From the grid operator’s perspective, the challenge is scale. Luiz Dias of EDP NEW, a DriVe2X project partner, summarises it clearly: “To unlock flexibility at the scale Europe needs, vehicles must become two-way devices — not just consumers of electricity but contributors to local stability.”

The long-term vision is neighbourhoods, workplaces and mobility hubs where EVs provide electricity when demand spikes and absorb excess when renewables surge. This intersection of technology, infrastructure and user behaviour is exactly what DriVe2X is testing across several European cities. Solutions that perform well in simulations are being validated in open, real-life environments to see how EVs behave under daily constraints. Beyond the ArenA, tests in Budapest are taking place in private homes where charging routines interact with rooftop solar generation and tariff optimisation. At Porto Airport, vehicles remain plugged in for long stays, offering insight into predictable charging patterns and user satisfaction. In Maia, northern Portugal, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) is being added to a dense network of charging points. The project also explores tourism-driven charging behaviour on the Isle of Wight in the UK, where EVs remain parked for extended periods, and the ASM living lab in Terni, Italy, where blockchain-enabled energy transactions are complementing incentives for smart and bidirectional charging.

The demonstrations show that bidirectional charging works best when users trust the system. This trust depends on infrastructure availability, clear information and the certainty that the car will always be ready. As Dias notes, “We face challenges in each of these dimensions, but two are particularly present: the lack of vehicles truly compatible with bidirectionality and the need to design operations that are as open to the public as possible.” At the technical level, research within DriVe2X indicates how advanced modelling can reduce battery stress. Mouli’s team integrates empirical and physics-based ageing models to simulate how different lithium-ion chemistries react under bidirectional cycles. “We model applications, battery types and thermal behaviour together,” he explains, “so we can predict ageing accurately and ensure V2G does not compromise user needs.” Their work suggests that, when managed carefully, V2G can even reduce certain forms of degradation by keeping batteries at moderate charge levels rather than fully charged for long periods — an insight that challenges the common fear that bidirectional charging necessarily accelerates ageing.

But the most decisive element in transforming cars into active energy resources is the human factor. A large-scale survey was designed to understand how people think about, use and emotionally relate to EV charging. It captures technical preferences as well as cultural habits, socioeconomic conditions and behavioural patterns that will shape electrified societies. “One of the clearest barriers emerging is a persistent lack of clarity,” explains Carlos Montalvo, Senior Scientist on Strategy and Innovation Policy at TNO. “People don’t really know how the battery will behave in the long run, how much they could earn, or who is responsible if something goes wrong. This makes the survey a mirror of a changing society.” The paradox is that several EVs already have the technical capacity for V2X, yet the function remains disabled because responsibilities and warranties are not standardised. Montalvo highlights how striking the survey results were: “Beyond cost and convenience, emotion emerged as one of the strongest predictors of willingness to engage in V2X: feelings of pride, usefulness and contribution to the common good correlate strongly with acceptance.” Participants who already own solar panels, home batteries or efficient heating systems “are far more inclined to try V2X because they already understand energy flows and see the vehicle as part of a broader household ecosystem.”

After mapping these emotional, behavioural and informational patterns, the implications become clear: bidirectional charging will scale only if technology and infrastructure evolve alongside people’s expectations, habits and uncertainties. The scene at the Amsterdam ArenA offers a glimpse of what this transition could look like: in the long term, millions of EVs — which spend 92% of their time parked — could become the distributed storage backbone of Europe’s energy system. Its deployment will depend on scientific progress, market readiness and public acceptance. As Mouli notes, “There is still a lot to be done, from battery lifetime to uniform grid codes, but once these challenges are addressed, mass adoption becomes possible.” Dias agrees: “The experience must be smooth, practically intuitive. Smart charging should be the default — with ‘dumb’ charging as the last resort.” What ultimately determines adoption, Montalvo concludes, is “whether citizens feel that V2X is safe, fair, understandable and compatible with daily life.”",https://www.youris.com/imgpub/2218532/0/0/550x400.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 08:59:13.703397

It is not clear which, if any, Chinese automakers could announce a move toward Canadian imports.","Canada agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles in exchange for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products.

The decision was made during Prime Minister Mark Carney’s visit to Beijing to improve strained Canada–China relations.

The move breaks with the U.S. on anti-China tariffs, and opens the doors to much more affordable EV imports—possibly around $35,000 Canadian, or $25,000 U.S.

The Chinese automotive industry received the green light to make a deeper incursion into North America on Friday as Canada agreed to cut its 100% tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, opening the door to cheap imports and potentially upending the car industry on this continent.

According to the AP, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that anti-Chinese EV tariffs would be slashed after two days of meetings with Chinese leaders in Beijing. In return for lower tariffs on EVs, Canada has agreed to reduce its tariffs on Canadian farm goods, including canola seeds.

But Chinese EV imports won't flood into the country just yet. Carney said that the deal includes an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports to Canada, although that grows to about 70,000 over five years. Carney said Canadians purchase about 1.8 million vehicles annually, almost a tenth of the U.S.' sales volume.

Still, the move represents a major break between Canada and the U.S., which once moved in lockstep to protect a deeply intertwined North American automotive industry.

Carney, according to the AP, touted the move as part of the growth of a whole new auto sector, and a win for Canadians seeking more affordable new-car options at a time of record-high prices. He added that most of these cars would have an import price of less than $35,000 Canadian, or about $25,000 U.S. The average new vehicle costs around $63,000 Canadian.

“We’re building a new part of our car industry, building cars of the future in partnership, bringing affordable autos for Canadians at a time when affordability is top of mind, and doing it at a scale that allows for a smooth transition in the sector,” Carney said.

The deal is a groundbreaking one on several levels. First and foremost, it represents arguably the biggest automotive break in trade relations yet between the U.S. and Canada, whose once-close relations have become deeply strained in the era of President Donald Trump's tariffs and his remarks about the country becoming ""the 51st state.""

Previously, Canada acted with the U.S. to enact 100% tariffs on Chinese-made EVs as a way to protect the North American automotive industry. Automakers, parts suppliers and other components of the car business run between both countries, and the growth of Chinese imports into Canada was widely seen as a threat to the operations of companies like General Motors, Ford, Honda, Toyota and so on, who collectively employ millions of people in both countries.

It is not clear which, if any, Chinese automakers could announce a move toward Canadian imports. In theory, doing so would be the first move toward more localized North American production, a long-sought goal of Chinese companies eager to expand into this continent and its massive auto market. As sales in China slow down after years of explosive growth, most large Chinese automakers are seeking growth by expanding into Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.

Sales of plug-in cars rose globally in 2025, except for North America, due to an end to U.S. EV tax credits and fuel economy rules driving a more-electric market. One exception was Mexico, which saw 29% more plug-in sales in 2025—most of which were imported from China.

In Detroit earlier this week, Trump also expressed an openness to Chinese automakers coming to the U.S., as long as they build cars stateside, too. “If they want to come in and build a plant and hire you and hire your friends and your neighbors, that’s great, I love that,” Trump said during a meeting of the Detroit Economic Club. “Let China come in.”

Fluence supplies BESS for BrightNight and Cordelio Power’s 1,200MWh Arizona project US-headquartered energy storage system integrator Fluence Energy has announced it will supply its Gridstack Pro BESS for the solar-plus-storage Pioneer Clean Energy Centre in Yuma County, Arizona.
The Pioneer Clean Energy Centre, being developed by independent power producers (IPPs) BrightNight and Cordelio Power, pairs a 300MWac solar facility with a 300MW/1,200MWh BESS.
In 2025, Swift Current Energy, a renewables and energy storage developer based in Massachusetts, secured US$242 million in financing for Prospect Power.","Both lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery systems are eligible for federal investment tax credits (ITCs), covering 40% of the cost for Duke Energy customers. This amount includes an additional 10% for reinvestment into an energy community, following the coal plant’s retirement in December 2024.

Duke Energy says it intends to expand its battery storage across several counties in the Carolinas.

According to the company’s 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan, currently under review by state regulators, it plans to add 6,550MW of battery capacity by 2035 to ensure reliable service and accommodate increasing demand in North and South Carolina.

Duke forecasted that, if the plan is implemented, the proposed changes would lead to a 2.1% rise in customer bills. The company states this increase is lower than the projected costs of their previously approved plan.

The 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan aimed for 2,700MW of battery storage by 2031, resulting in a total of 5,600MW, a 2,900MW increase to support immediate growth and take advantage of tax credits.

The utility added that the plan upholds Gaston County’s—where the BESS is located—tradition of supporting its customers across both states.

Duke Energy’s proposal includes installing battery storage at the county’s former coal plant sites on the Catawba River- Allen, in Belmont and Riverbend, in Mount Holly. The Riverbend project, a 115MW/460MWh BESS, is scheduled to start construction in late 2026 and become operational by late 2027.

The utility has also proposed a third BESS at Allen to be operational by the end of 2028, along with a regional facility for operations, training, and storage of batteries and renewables, capable of supporting 20-50 employees. Both plans are still in development and awaiting regulatory approval.

Fluence supplies BESS for BrightNight and Cordelio Power’s 1,200MWh Arizona project

US-headquartered energy storage system integrator Fluence Energy has announced it will supply its Gridstack Pro BESS for the solar-plus-storage Pioneer Clean Energy Centre in Yuma County, Arizona.

The Pioneer Clean Energy Centre, being developed by independent power producers (IPPs) BrightNight and Cordelio Power, pairs a 300MWac solar facility with a 300MW/1,200MWh BESS.

In February 2025, BrightNight and Cordelio announced a power purchase agreement (PPA) for Pioneer with utility Arizona Public Service (APS).

The Pioneer Clean Energy Centre is expected to generate hundreds of construction and operational jobs, according to Brightnight, along with significant tax revenue for the local community. The facility is anticipated to start commercial operations in April 2027.

Fluence’s Gridstack Pro will include US-made cells, modules, enclosures, and thermal management systems, “supporting the advancement of domestically produced energy storage technology while strengthening American energy security.”

In October 2023, the company introduced the Gridstack Pro solution, which provides customers with improved performance and reduced operating costs by enhancing state of charge (SOC) accuracy, enabling string-level control, and incorporating pre-integrated asset performance management intelligence, the company stated.

BrightNight has collaborated with its joint venture (JV) partner Cordelio on several occasions, including the Box Canyon project, a 300MW solar PV and 600MWh BESS in Pinal County, Arizona. A PPA for this project was finalised in July 2022.

In late 2025, Cordelio and BrightNight announced financial close of the 200MW/800MWh Greenwater BESS in Piece County, Washington state. It will provide capacity and grid services to the utility Puget Sound Energy.

Elevate Renewables acquires 150MW Virgina BESS

Developer and IPP Elevate Renewables has acquired the 150MW/600MWh Prospect Power Storage BESS project near Northern Virginia’s ‘Data Centre Alley.’

According to Elevate, the BESS, located in Rockingham County, is the largest standalone battery storage asset in the PJM Interconnection. It is currently under construction and scheduled to begin operations in mid-2026.

In 2025, Swift Current Energy, a renewables and energy storage developer based in Massachusetts, secured US$242 million in financing for Prospect Power. This marked Swift Current Energy’s first large-scale battery project, which they acquired in 2023 from Clean Planet Energy, a joint venture between Open Road Renewable Energy and Eolian.

Clean Plant Energy is a JV between the developers Open Road Renewable Energy and Eolian.

Prospect Power is committed to a 15-year PPA with utility Dominion Energy Virginia, “positioning the project as an essential energy resource to ensure cost-effective grid reliability and meet the rapidly growing demand for power across the Mid-Atlantic region.”

In 2024, Elevate revealed plans for a 15MW/60MWh battery storage project at the Arthur Kill Power Station in Staten Island, NY. Once finished, Elevate claims it will be the biggest battery storage system in New York City.

In the same year, Elevate revealed plans to install a grid-forming BESS at a fossil fuel peaker plant in Connecticut, funded with US$27.5 million from the US Department of Energy (DOE). Elevate’s Innovative Inertia Project aims to upgrade the 244MW Devon Generating Station peaker unit by integrating a BESS that can deliver inertia, synchronous condensing (‘green sync’), and other vital grid services, according to the company.

According to a report by the independent market monitor for PJM Interconnection, Northern Virginia’s ‘Data Centre Alley’ is the largest concentration of data centres worldwide, and lies within PJM’s jurisdiction. PJM’s departing CEO, Manu Asthana, has highlighted the importance of the US “winning the race” for global AI leadership. This outlook aligns with statements from the White House and major Silicon Valley firms.

Partly due to ‘Data Centre Alley’s’ large energy demand, data centres are projected to increase power demand overall by nearly 12,000MW this summer.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/energy-storage-products.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 09:00:08.117437

Ford is exploring BYD as a battery supplier to support its growing hybrid vehicle lineup.

The talks highlight Ford’s shift away from EVs and toward hybrids amid changing demand.

Any deal would face political scrutiny given BYD’s status as a major Chinese automaker.

Ford Motor is in discussions with China’s BYD over a potential partnership in which the U.S. automaker would purchase batteries for some of its hybrid vehicles, according to an exclusive WSJ report.

The companies are currently negotiating the terms of this arrangement, and the discussions remain nonbinding. One proposal under consideration involves Ford importing batteries from BYD for use in Ford factories outside the United States. However, it’s possible that a deal may not ultimately be reached.

If completed, the partnership would pair Ford with the world’s largest Chinese automaker, a company that has unsettled much of the U.S. auto industry with its ability to produce affordable vehicles equipped with advanced technology.

For Ford, the talks address a growing need. As the automaker pulls back from electric vehicles amid softer demand and accelerates its push into hybrids, it requires additional battery supply tailored to hybrid powertrains. BYD, which began as a battery manufacturer and has since become a global auto giant, has extensive experience producing batteries for both electric and hybrid vehicles.

BYD produces most of its batteries in China, but is expanding manufacturing capacity overseas as it expands into markets such as Southeast Asia, Europe, and Brazil.

Following publication of the Journal report, President Donald Trump’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, publicly criticized the idea, questioning whether the arrangement would make Ford more vulnerable to Chinese supply chains.

Last month, Ford announced it would further scale back its EV plans, taking an expected $19.5 billion in charges, largely tied to its EV business. The company said it now expects hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and all-electric vehicles to account for roughly half of its global sales by 2030, while it expands its lineup of gas-powered and hybrid models.

Hybrid vehicles have emerged as a relative bright spot for the automaker, with its hybrid sales rising 18% in the Q4 of last year to about 55,000 vehicles, and executives have pointed to strong demand for models such as the F-150 hybrid. Speaking at the Detroit Auto Show this week, Jim Farley said the company plans to expand its hybrid and extended-range vehicle offerings.

Ford is also pursuing other battery strategies. The company is building a battery plant in Marshall, Michigan, where it plans to produce lower-cost cells using licensed technology from Chinese battery maker CATL. The project has faced scrutiny from Republican lawmakers but is expected to begin operations this year.

While Chinese automakers remain largely barred from selling vehicles in the U.S. due to tariffs and regulatory restrictions, industry executives continue to view companies such as BYD as a long-term competitive threat. For now, Ford and its peers increasingly see hybrids as the most viable growth segment as consumer demand shifts and EV adoption slows.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ford-BYD-01162025-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 08:59:21.809155

The solar installation produces more than three times the energy currently consumed by the expansion, meaning the solar installation generates a net surplus of clean power.
Scott Brand, President and Chief Operating Officer of Subaru of Indiana Automotive, said, “The expansion rooftop project completed by Emergent Solar Energy further demonstrates an ongoing commitment to reduce our environmental impact.
Jeremy Lipinski, Managing Partner of Emergent Solar Energy, said, “Subaru of Indiana Automotive has set the standard for sustainable manufacturing in Indiana and the Midwest.
We are honored to contribute to that vision with a solar project that will deliver long-term energy savings, reduce emissions and showcase how renewable energy can integrate seamlessly with advanced manufacturing.","Subaru of Indiana Automotive (SIA), a recognized industry leader in environmental stewardship, has energized a 204-kilowatt rooftop solar project atop its new building expansion in Lafayette.

The system went into service in August 2025 and represents the latest step in SIA’s multi-decade effort to reduce its carbon footprint while strengthening Indiana’s clean energy economy.

The solar installation produces more than three times the energy currently consumed by the expansion, meaning the solar installation generates a net surplus of clean power. That surplus is fed back into the company’s operations, creating both long-term energy cost containment and measurable carbon reduction benefits.

The project is expected to offset more than 250 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, the equivalent of supplying the electricity needs of 43 homes. Over its 30-year operating life, the system will deliver millions of kilowatt-hours of clean electricity, helping Subaru advance its corporate sustainability goals while reducing operating costs of the expansion at its Lafayette facility.

Building on a legacy of environmental leadership

SIA has long been recognized for its leadership in environmental practices. It was the first U.S. auto assembly plant to achieve zero-landfill status and has consistently invested in technologies that reduce waste, conserve natural resources and lower greenhouse gas emissions.

The new solar project builds on that legacy, demonstrating how one of Indiana’s largest manufacturers is using renewable energy as both a cost-containment strategy and a core component of its environmental vision.

Scott Brand, President and Chief Operating Officer of Subaru of Indiana Automotive, said, “The expansion rooftop project completed by Emergent Solar Energy further demonstrates an ongoing commitment to reduce our environmental impact. By expanding the use of renewable energy at our facility, we continue to embrace sustainable technology to help offset our carbon footprint.”

Partnership with Emergent Solar Energy

SIA selected Emergent Solar Energy, a commercial and industrial solar EPC headquartered in the Purdue Research Park of West Lafayette, as its partner for the design and construction of the project. Emergent specializes in turnkey solar and energy storage solutions for large manufacturers and agricultural operations across the state.

Jeremy Lipinski, Managing Partner of Emergent Solar Energy, said, “Subaru of Indiana Automotive has set the standard for sustainable manufacturing in Indiana and the Midwest. We are honored to contribute to that vision with a solar project that will deliver long-term energy savings, reduce emissions and showcase how renewable energy can integrate seamlessly with advanced manufacturing. This project reflects what’s possible when industry leaders take bold steps toward a carbon-conscious future.”

Adam Bolen, Project Manager at Emergent Solar Energy who led the on-site construction, said, “Executing a solar installation on an active, high-volume manufacturing campus requires rigorous safety planning and precise coordination. We worked seamlessly with the SIA facilities team to ensure this array was installed safely and efficiently without disrupting operations. It is rewarding to see the system now delivering clean power to this impressive facility.”",https://zeta.creativecirclecdn.com/bin/original/20260116-070458-7b6-suburu%20EmergentSolarEnergy_1200x630.png.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 07:58:09.752048

The transaction covers Aethon's shale gas assets primarily in Texas and Louisiana's Haynesville formation-one of the largest natural gas reserves in the southern U.S.
This deal follows a wave of Japanese investment in U.S. energy, reflecting Tokyo's strategic view of natural gas as a transition fuel well beyond 2050.
Mitsubishi's move signals it's playing in a league increasing its exposure to American shale gas.
What's clear is that the company is positioning itself to capture more of the U.S. shale gas pie-territory that sits at the heart of the country's energy exports and global supply chains.","Mitsubishi Corp (TSE: 8058) is making a big bet on U.S. natural gas, agreeing to purchase shale gas production and infrastructure assets from Aethon Energy Management for a hefty $7.53 billion. This marks Mitsubishi's largest deal so far as they double down on their gas supply chain, especially along the strategic U.S. Gulf Coast corridor.

The transaction covers Aethon's shale gas assets primarily in Texas and Louisiana's Haynesville formation-one of the largest natural gas reserves in the southern U.S. Notably, Mitsubishi is buying $5.2 billion in equity interests plus taking on $2.33 billion in net debt from Aethon. Aethon retains the option to buy back up to 25% of the stakes within six months after closing, which is scheduled sometime between April and June 2026.

CEO Katsuya Nakanishi pointed out the assets' strong productivity and competitiveness, underscoring their significance as Japan leans on natural gas to bridge its energy needs while managing the transition toward greener alternatives. Mitsubishi's foothold along the Gulf Coast pairs with ongoing LNG export facility developments in the region, potentially expanding their global gas distribution capacity.

For context, Mitsubishi is no stranger to the LNG game. Aside from this U.S. acquisition, they hold stakes in LNG operations across Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Oman, Russia, and elsewhere in the U.S., with around 15 million metric tons per year in equity LNG production. Meanwhile, Aethon is one of the biggest private U.S. gas producers with output hitting 2.1 billion cubic feet per day, roughly matching Mitsubishi's annual LNG equity output.

Looking ahead, production at these assets is expected to ramp up, peaking at 2.6 billion cubic feet per day in fiscal 2028. Mitsubishi forecasts a net profit contribution of between 70 and 80 billion yen ($443 million to $506 million) by fiscal 2027. Funding is slated to come from a mix of cash and debt.

This deal follows a wave of Japanese investment in U.S. energy, reflecting Tokyo's strategic view of natural gas as a transition fuel well beyond 2050. The expected surge in demand driven by sectors such as data centers-fueled by the AI boom-further cements gas' role in Japan's energy future.

The market didn't exactly cheer this announcement, with Mitsubishi's shares dipping 2% post-news, outpacing the Nikkei 225 index's mild 0.3% drop. Traders might be weighing the hefty price tag or shifting sentiment around energy stocks in general.

Earlier deals mirror this trend: JERA, Japan's largest power generator, picked up U.S. gas assets for $1.5 billion in October, while Japan Petroleum Exploration snapped up a U.S. tight oil and gas firm for $1.3 billion back in December. Mitsubishi's move signals it's playing in a league increasing its exposure to American shale gas.

No word yet on how aggressively Mitsubishi plans to tap the debt markets or use cash reserves to complete the transaction.

China will reduce its tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from about 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.
""It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China–Canada relations toward improvement,"" China's top leader said.
China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood.
Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said.","BEIJING — Breaking with the United States, Canada has agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday.

Carney made the announcement after two days of meetings with Chinese leaders. He said there would be an initial cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports to Canada, growing to 70,000 over five years. China will reduce its tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from about 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.

""It has been a historic and productive two days,"" Carney said, speaking outside against the backdrop of a traditional pavilion and a frozen pond at a Beijing park. ""We have to understand the differences between Canada and other countries, and focus our efforts to work together where we're aligned.""

Earlier Friday, he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to improve relations between their two nations after years of acrimony.

Xi told Carney in a meeting at the Great Hall of the People that he is willing to continue working to improve ties, noting that talks have been underway on restoring and restarting cooperation since the two held an initial meeting in October on the sidelines of a regional economic conference in South Korea.

""It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China–Canada relations toward improvement,"" China's top leader said.

Carney looks to improve global governance

Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China in eight years, said better relations would help improve a global governance system that he described as ""under great strain.""

He called for a new relationship ""adapted to new global realities"" and cooperation in agriculture, energy and finance.

Those new realities reflect in large part the so-called America-first approach of U.S. President Donald Trump. The tariffs he has imposed have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that his government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the U.S. at what he called ""a time of global trade disruption.""

A Canadian business owner in China called Carney's visit game-changing, saying it re-establishes dialogue, respect and a framework between the two nations.

""These three things we didn't have,"" said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps exporters navigate the Chinese market. ""The parties were not talking for years.""

Canada had been aligned with US on tariffs

Canada had followed the U.S. in putting tariffs of 100% on EVs from China and 25% on steel and aluminum under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Carney's predecessor.

China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood. It added a 75.8% tariff on canola seeds last August. Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said. Overall, China's imports from Canada fell 10.4% last year to $41.7 billion, according to Chinese trade data.

China is hoping Trump's pressure tactics on allies such as Canada will drive them to pursue a foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States. The U.S. president has suggested Canada could become America's 51st state.

Carney departs China on Saturday and visits Qatar on Sunday before attending the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week. He will meet business leaders and investors in Qatar to promote trade and investment, his office said.

Among the most significant, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act ended several federal EV and clean vehicle tax credits, and federal agencies moved to weaken clean car standards and California's Clean Air Act waiver authority. Funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program was paused and then revived. Despite federal headwinds, states continued to advance EV adoption through robust incentives, charging infrastructure buildouts, and fleet commitments. The market response has been swift and substantial, with leading automakers recording multi-billion-dollar write-downs and shifts in their EV production plans. Overall, near-term U.S. EV deployment faces policy-driven turbulence, but underlying consumer interest, technology progress, and state actions suggest that the clean transportation transition is getting a re-set in 2026, rather than a reversal.

Federal

In a major blow to the affordability of EVs, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act sunset several EV and clean vehicle tax credits. The $7,500 EV tax credit commonly known as the ""New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit"", or 30D credit, officially expired on September 30, 2025. The ""Previously-Owned Clean Vehicle"" credit under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 25E and the ""Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle"" credit under IRC 45W also effectively expired, and will not be available for any vehicle acquired after September 30, 2025. EV sales spiked to a record share just before the credit ended, then plunged in October, suggesting regulatorily‑driven demand swings as buyers and sellers adjusted to new federal policy signals.

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program had a tumultuous road in 2025, after the Trump Administration froze unspent program funds. Following the overturn of such funding freeze by a federal district court in June 2025, the Federal Highway Administration released new interim guidance in August 2025 to restore funding to states. Notably, among other updates to provide flexibility to states, because the NEVI program was funded through FY 2026, the updated guidance allows states to release all remaining NEVI funds in a single solicitation.

State

States have forged ahead with their EV policies despite federal uncertainty. According to a comprehensive EDF report released in early January 2026, every state has adopted multiple EV‑supportive policies. California leads with the most policies, while states like Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, and Alabama have built more diversified EV policy portfolios. Nearly every state offers incentives or rebates for EV charging equipment, and 40 states offer incentives for medium- and heavy-duty EVs. Charging investments have been near‑universal, with all states participating in NEVI. In sum, the report suggests that shifting federal policy in favor of fossil fuels provides even greater incentive for states to lead the charge on clean transportation initiatives that are already underway.

Industry

Several major automakers announced billion‑dollar write-downs and realignment of their EV production capacity following shifting federal EV policy and consumer demand. General Motors, the largest U.S. automaker, reported a $7.1 billion loss in the last quarter of 2025 primarily due to the diminished value of its investments in battery and EV manufacturing facilities. These losses come after the company wrote down $1.6 billion in EV assets and announced plans to scale back EV production in favor of producing more large, internal combustion engine vehicles. Ford Motors also reportedly took a $19.5 billion write-down to cut its EV losses and plans to pivot production towards more hybrid vehicles and lower-cost EVs. Foreign automakers were hit hardest by the Trump Administration's tariffs. Volkswagen, for example, saw its U.S. sales of EVs fall 20% in the last quarter of 2025, while EV sales continue to grow in Europe and China. To remain competitive, some automakers have considered dropping prices going into 2026, which industry analysts posit could lead to an uptick in EV sales.

The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), his signature trade deal, enacted stronger protections for American workers and businesses and revitalized the export industries that account for more than a quarter of Louisiana's economic output.

Soon, the Trump administration will have the chance to build on that success. A formal review of the USMCA begins this year. The process is already underway as the United States gathers public input and evaluates how the agreement has performed. If Trump uses this moment to reinforce the deal's protections for American businesses, he can deliver yet another boost to Louisiana's economy.

When President Trump signed the USMCA in 2018, America's North American trade relationships were strained. The old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) framework had become outdated and allowed competitors to exploit loopholes that harmed U.S. workers and manufacturers.

The USMCA reversed that trend. It tightened trade rules to encourage more production in the United States, gave American businesses clearer access to Canadian and Mexican markets and included new provisions to remove barriers for agricultural and energy producers — two pillars of Louisiana's economy.

The results speak for themselves. As America's fourth-largest exporting state, Louisiana has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the agreement.

Last year alone, Louisiana exported $10 billion worth of goods to Canada and Mexico, supporting more than 21,000 Louisiana jobs. Nearly 1 in every 8 exported Louisiana goods now goes to one of our two North American partners.

That success is why Louisianans should hope, above all, that President Trump renews the agreement during this year's review. The USMCA has delivered for our state.

At the same time, there is room to strengthen it. In several cases, Mexico and Canada have not fully upheld their commitments — and the review offers a rare opportunity to address those issues.

Start with Mexico. The USMCA requires all parties to regulate sectors such as energy fairly and impartially. Yet Mexico has repeatedly favored its state-owned energy provider, disadvantaging American companies. That matters in Louisiana, which supplies a large share of the oil and petroleum products exported to Mexico. Energy alone accounts for nearly half of Louisiana's exports to Canada and Mexico.

Mexico has also altered customs procedures with little warning, slowing shipments of energy, agricultural goods and manufactured products that move through Louisiana's ports. These unexpected rule changes violate the USMCA's transparency requirements and undermine the reliability Louisiana exporters depend on.

Canada has posed challenges as well. Certain customs policies have created new administrative hurdles for American exporters, affecting sectors like agriculture — a $13 billion cornerstone of Louisiana's economy, home to nearly 30,000 farms.

This year's review is the right moment to fix that. As the United States works to renew the USMCA, Trump administration officials should focus on bolstering enforcement, ensuring transparency and addressing areas where Mexico and Canada have not fully complied with the agreement.

Strengthening the USMCA will benefit more than just Louisiana — it will enhance America's overall economic security. Reinforcing trade rules, especially in energy, will help protect American competitiveness, support domestic production and reduce reliance on imports.

The progress Louisiana has made under the USMCA proves what strong, America First trade leadership can achieve. President Trump can put our state on firmer footing.

Under Democratic presidents, the agency tends to clamp down on emissions from cars and smokestacks. Under Republicans, it tends to give automakers and the manufacturing sector more flexibility.

When President Donald Trump returned to office last year, climate experts expected him to tilt the balance toward industry as he did in his first term, continuing the ping-pong of the last few decades.

Instead, his EPA is going much farther, attempting to eliminate its own power to govern pollution. The agency is soon expected to release its final proposal to repeal the landmark “endangerment finding,” an Obama-era rule that gave it the authority to regulate the greenhouse gases that warm the earth; at the same time, it will also repeal its rule limiting automotive carbon emissions. The agency also confirmed this week that it will no longer quantify the human health benefits of regulating industrial pollution, a change that could justify far more lenient oversight of toxic emissions from things like smokestacks and power plants. Administrator Lee Zeldin hits the road today for a “Freedom Means Affordable Cars” tour in Michigan and Ohio, during which he will tout Trump’s efforts to relax environmental rules on gas cars.

These changes are the latest in a battery of repeals that cover everything from mercury to microplastics, but they go much farther than simply cutting industry a break. If the changes hold up in court, experts and former agency officials say they could amount to a backdoor repeal of the EPA itself. The agency would still have funding and staff, these experts say, but it would no longer be able to perform its mission of protecting what the Clean Air Act calls “public health and welfare.”

“Any erosion of the purpose of these laws, which was to protect public health, is … undermining the very purpose of environmental protection,” said Bob Perciasepe, who served as an assistant administrator of the EPA for air and water quality under President Bill Clinton.

The agency is pairing its proposed repeal of the 2009 “endangerment finding” with a repeal of its rules limiting carbon pollution from gas cars. Its rule proposing these repeals makes two distinct arguments against past regulations on tailpipe carbon. The first is that the EPA lacks the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon dioxide, because global warming is a worldwide issue, not a “local and regional” one like soot.

The second echoes Trump’s criticism of strict Biden-era tailpipe rules. Biden’s regulations would have spurred a faster transition to electric vehicles, but Trump has claimed they amounted to a ban on internal combustion cars. The proposed rule argues that that “no technology … is capable of preventing or controlling” carbon emissions from cars except for “a complete change from internal combustion engines to EVs.” It also claims that regulating the pollutant often “requires manufacturers to design and install new and more expensive technologies, thereby increasing the price of new vehicles” and hurting consumers. (It adds that “the ability to own a vehicle is an important means to unlock economic freedom and participate in society.”)

Experts dismiss both arguments. The legal basis for the EPA to regulate carbon has long been seen as solid, and the 1970 Clean Air Act even specifies that it can intervene when “air pollutant[s] emitted in the United States … endanger public health or welfare in a foreign country.” The Supreme Court ruled in 2007’s Massachusetts v. EPA that this authority was “unambiguous,” and the current conservative court has upheld that decision even in rulings limiting the scope of the agency’s authority.

The argument that vehicle regulations are too burdensome for automakers also doesn’t hold water, said Margo Oge, who led the EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality from 1994 until 2012 and wrote its first vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards.

“We have heard time after time from companies that the sky is falling when they [are] faced with stringent standards,” Oge told Grist. “But that hasn’t happened. As the rest of the world moves toward electric vehicles, U.S. policies and investments [risk] leaving domestic manufacturers behind investing in old high-polluting technologies.”

Public comments regarding the EPA’s proposal were almost universally negative. Thousands of environmental groups and individuals opposed the repeal, and even many polluters urged the EPA to reconsider. If the endangerment finding goes away, states could still try to regulate greenhouse gases according to common law, they argued, creating a chaotic and unpredictable business environment.

“Attempting to comply with multiple, likely conflicting, regulations among the states will drive up compliance costs for companies, create obstacles for investment decisions, lead to regulatory uncertainty, and make efficient reduction of emissions more difficult,” the Business Roundtable, an influential council of large companies, wrote in its comments. Members of the roundtable include major polluters such as 3M, General Motors, and Chevron.

If courts don’t strike it down, Trump’s repeal could hamstring climate regulations for years to come. Should a court rule that the EPA has no authority to regulate greenhouse gases, a future president would have to formulate a new endangerment finding, which could take years to go through the regulatory process, or else would have to secure explicit approval from Congress. Unless Congress acted, the EPA would not be able to set any limits on greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, which make up a quarter of the U.S.’s contribution to global warming.

“If they were to say, ‘We have no authority at all,’ and the Supreme Court upholds that, there would be a lack of authority unless Congress were to pass a new law,” David Doniger, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, who has also served at the EPA and the White House Council on Environmental Quality, told Grist. “But if they take that position, they expose the companies more to federal and state common law liabilities” — in other words, if the EPA’s central authority goes away, companies could face a range of climate lawsuits in various state and federal courts.

Such a decision would also undercut the EPA’s other regulations governing carbon from power plants and similar “stationary sources.” The agency is already trying to repeal Biden-era standards for pollution from power plants, and a full repeal of the endangerment finding would prevent future presidents from reimposing those standards. Even oil lobbyists such as the American Petroleum Institute have asked the EPA not to go this far — many producers worry that if the agency loses the ability to regulate methane from oil sites, they would be exposed to lawsuits over their role in climate change.

The EPA’s other move this week could weaken its bedrock authority to regulate other air pollutants. When the agency designs rules for contaminants like soot, dust, and ozone, it weighs an industry’s financial cost of compliance against the financial benefits of imposing the rule. To do this, the agency most often sets a dollar value on human health — under Biden, for instance, the agency estimated that reducing a ton of particulate pollution prevents $77 in health costs.

Past presidents have revised this number according to evolving scientific evidence, but the EPA is now setting the health cost of soot and ozone at zero dollars, claiming that previous estimates offered a “false sense of precision.” When the agency considers whether to place limits on the emission of ozone from factories or soot from smokestacks, it will now quantify the economic costs of compliance to industry, but not the monetary value of avoided health costs.

The agency has already debuted its first rule under this approach. It governs emissions of fine particulate matter from methane gas turbines used in power plants. Former agency officials said the decision not to monetize health benefits would lead to a bias against limiting pollutants like soot and dust, which could in turn lead to much dirtier air.

“A key governing principle of benefit cost assessment is to account for all of the benefits and all of the costs,” said Chris Frey, a professor of civil engineering at North Carolina State University and a former assistant administrator for research and development at the EPA. “The assessment is not valid if it excludes known benefits or costs. That there is uncertainty is not a sufficient reason not to conduct an assessment.”

In response to questions from Grist, an EPA representative said that the agency’s pause on monetizing health costs was temporary, and that it would resume quantifying those costs when it had better data.

“EPA absolutely remains committed to our core mission of protecting human health and the environment, that mission guides every decision we make,” the representative said. “EPA, like the agency always has, is still considering the impacts that [particulate matter] and ozone emissions have on human health, but the agency will not be monetizing the impacts at this time.” The agency didn’t respond to questions about how it will incorporate health costs into its analyses without quantifying them, or about legal arguments against its endangerment finding repeal.

But experts and former agency officials said the pause on health costs and the greenhouse gas rule repeal both represent departures from the agency’s core mission. As Perciasepe sees it, if the agency doesn’t take an active role in restricting major pollutants, it is straying from its original mandate to protect public health, as established in laws like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.

“When you start to go down this road to devalue the economic cost of poor public health, you do undermine the whole reason for … all these laws that were enacted in the 1970s when there was this gross impact from pollution on the quality of life in the United States,” he said.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2200431267-e1749764769732.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2026-01-16 10:00:55.701650

“This makes no economic sense or functional sense, to extend the life of an effectively broken coal plant,” said Gov.

“We will continue to suffer.” Mounting costs, legal threats The cost to keep coal plants open could prove especially divisive.
The Environmental Protection Agency is rolling back numerous air pollution and climate rules that have made coal plants more costly to operate.","Over the past eight months, the Energy Department has taken the extraordinary step of ordering that generators at five coal-burning power plants that had been headed for retirement stay open and keep running.

That’s just the beginning, officials say.

At a White House event on Thursday, Trump administration officials said they planned to keep open as many coal plants as they could and prevent any further retirements over the next three years.

“The goal is to stop the political closure of coal plants,” Chris Wright, the energy secretary, said during the first meeting of the National Coal Council, which had lapsed under the Biden administration but which President Trump has revived. Dozens of representatives from the coal industry were present.

The moves are part of a sweeping plan by Mr. Trump to revive America’s coal industry, which has been declining for years. Mr. Trump has expressed a certain affection for the fuel, calling it “beautiful clean coal” to goad environmentalists, who note that coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels and a major driver of global warming.

Administration officials say that keeping coal plants open is necessary to avoid blackouts and meet rising energy needs.

On the ground, however, efforts to halt coal retirements are already causing complications. Two of the coal units that the Energy Department ordered to stay online in December are broken, and it’s unclear when they might be repaired.

Some plants that were ordered to keep running had already shuttered their coal mines and stopped maintaining old equipment. Now, utilities and operators are straining to revive them. The costs of extending coal-burning plants are significant, and federal and state regulators are embroiled in disputes over who will ultimately pay.

“These are old plants, and they are expensive to refurbish and keep open,” said Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard Law School’s Electricity Law Initiative. “The costs are going to fall on somebody. The question is whether it’s the plant owners or the public.”

Since 2005, the number of operating coal plants in the United States had been declining precipitously as utilities switched to cheaper and cleaner natural gas, wind and solar power. Even Mr. Trump in his first term couldn’t stop the slide; more than 150 coal-burning units shut down between 2017 and 2020.

This time around, the Trump administration has gone much further to rescue coal, with more success. Last year, the amount of electricity produced by coal increased 13 percent, and retirements have slowed.

The administration has been aided by a surge in electricity demand nationwide driven by a boom in data centers, which has led some utilities to postpone coal plant closures. Federal agencies have also rolled back environmental regulations on coal, which produces more air pollution than other sources like natural gas. Burning coal also emits mercury, a powerful neurotoxin, and other heavy metals.

Even more drastic, however, has been the Energy Department’s use of emergency orders to mandate that coal plants that had been set to retire keep operating, as the agency has invoked Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act.

Historically, this provision has been used to keep plants online during temporary emergencies such as hurricanes or heat waves. But the Trump administration has claimed that the emergency this time is an expected shortage of reliable power over the next decade, and officials are trying to avert as many closures as they can.

The impact is already visible: At the start of last year, utilities were expected to close roughly 8.5 gigawatts of coal capacity in 2025, according to federal data. But they ended up retiring only 2.7 gigawatts, the lowest amount since 2011.

“I think you will not see those plants close during this administration,” Mr. Wright said, adding that there might be a few exceptions for the very oldest plants.

Mr. Wright said he hoped other actions by the administration to support coal would eventually make emergency orders “unnecessary.” But, he claimed, many utilities were quietly welcoming the orders to save coal plants at imminent risk of closure. “We get a lot of inbound calls now saying, ‘Can you 202(c) this plant?’”

Those orders are also facing a backlash. Environmental groups and states like Michigan and Washington are mounting legal challenges. The grid operator in the Midwest and state officials in Colorado have said their regions already have adequate electrical capacity, even with coal retirements.

“Using a blunt instrument like this to keep the legacy coal fleet online could backfire,” said Devin Hartman, director of energy and environmental policy at the R Street Institute. “There are a ton of risks.”

Broken plants, busy railroads

Reviving a geriatric coal fleet isn’t easy: Many plants are more than 50 years old and need major repairs.

On the shores of Lake Michigan, the J.H. Campbell coal plant was set to retire last May under a plan backed by the state and the electric utility that operates it, Consumers Energy. But, at the last minute, the Energy Department ordered that the plant’s three coal units stay open for 90 days during the summer. The agency has since twice renewed the order and is widely expected to order that the plant remain open indefinitely.

That created headaches for the operator, which had canceled roughly $161 million in maintenance for the plant in the years leading up to the scheduled retirement, according to one engineer’s testimony. The plant has struggled to generate reliable power: One unit faced extended outages in June and produced electricity for only a handful of days, according to legal filings by environmental groups.

Other plants may be in rougher shape.

In December, the Energy Department ordered that the R.M. Schahfer plant in northern Indiana keep two coal units operating past their planned retirement. Yet one of those units has been offline since the summer because of a turbine failure.

Repairing the unit could ultimately take “six months or longer,” Vince Parisi, the chief operating officer of the Northern Indiana Public Service Company, which owns the plant, told regulators last month. “It’s just the reality of that unit being close to retirement.”

In Colorado, a rural electric cooperative had been planning since 2016 to close a coal-burning unit at the Craig Generating Station. Last month, the Energy Department ordered that the unit stay open. Yet the coal unit is offline because of a broken valve, and it is unclear how long it will take to fix it.

There’s also the question of where to get fuel.

Until recently, the Craig unit in Colorado obtained some of its coal from a local mine operated by its part owner, the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association. But that mine closed last year, laying off all its workers.

“This makes no economic sense or functional sense, to extend the life of an effectively broken coal plant,” said Gov. Jared Polis, Democrat of Colorado, who opposes the order and says the federal government had done little to consult with the state.

Last month, when Bob Guenther drove past the coal-burning power plant in Centralia, Wash., where he worked for 34 years before retirement, there wasn’t much coal in sight. The power plant had been winding down for years and was scheduled to close by Dec. 31 until the Energy Department ordered that it stay open. Coal piles that once filled acres had dwindled.

Some local officials and unions have cheered the lifeline for coal plants, which are often an engine of local economic activity. But environmental groups have pointed to the hazards from air pollution and coal-ash waste.

“Northwest Indiana has long borne the brunt of industrial pollution,” said Ashley Williams, the executive director of Just Transition Northwest Indiana, a nonprofit group, criticizing the order to keep the R.M. Schahfer plant open. “We will continue to suffer.”

Mounting costs, legal threats

The cost to keep coal plants open could prove especially divisive.

In Michigan, Consumers Energy spent $164 million from May to September to keep its coal plant running, according to regulatory filings. During that time, the plant earned only $84 million in revenue.

It remains to be seen who will ultimately pay for the rest. Consumers Energy has proposed that the costs be shared by ratepayers in multiple states in the Midwestern regional grid, rather than paid for by its customers alone. But other groups have challenged this proposal.

The Environmental Protection Agency is rolling back numerous air pollution and climate rules that have made coal plants more costly to operate. It has also given electric utilities more time to clean up contamination from toxic coal ash landfills.

At the same time, the Energy Department has offered up to $350 million to try to bring back to life coal plants that have already closed.

Michelle Bloodworth, chief executive of America’s Power, a coal trade group, estimates that at least 29 coal units with roughly 13 gigawatts of capacity have recently closed but are not yet demolished and could be candidates for restarting. She added that more utilities were voluntarily postponing coal retirements and that the future for the industry is looking brighter under the Trump administration.

“There’s a huge opportunity for the coal fleet,” Ms. Bloodworth said. “It’s a big change after years and years of punitive environmental regulations.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/16cli-trump-coal-03-lpjt/16cli-trump-coal-03-lpjt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 05:58:54.356658

As electrification reshapes energy use nationwide, the duty to serve does not need to be reinvented.","Electric utilities have a well-established legal obligation to provide safe, reliable and reasonably priced electricity to customers in their service territories. That ‘duty to serve’ has long adapted to changing system conditions. Today, rapid electrification – driven by electric vehicles, building electrification, manufacturing and data center growth – is testing whether utilities are fully meeting that duty under modern circumstances.

Our recent Energy Law Journal article, Utilities’ Duty to Serve in an Era of End-Use Electrification, examines how traditional duty-to-serve principles apply to distribution systems experiencing renewed and uneven load growth. The article reaches a clear conclusion: many actions now framed as policy reforms are better understood as applications of utilities’ existing legal obligations to new factual realities.

Why the duty to serve matters now

For decades, electricity demand grew slowly, and utilities planned accordingly. That era has ended. Electrification of transportation, buildings and industry is driving significant new demand – often in large, concentrated increments that develop faster than traditional planning cycles.

These changes raise a core legal question: what does the duty to serve require when future demand is reasonably foreseeable, even if customers have not yet submitted formal service requests?

Anticipatory planning is part of the duty

Utilities have never planned the grid solely in response to customer requests. Load forecasting has always been a core utility function, and regulators have consistently expected utilities to anticipate demand to maintain system adequacy and reliability. What has changed is the pace and scale of electrification.

Under these conditions, the duty to serve already includes an obligation to plan for foreseeable changes in customers’ energy needs. Waiting to act until customers arrive can lead to unreasonable delays and inequitable outcomes. Where electrification trends are well documented, failure to plan for them may itself fall short of the duty to serve.

This is not a shift in the law. It is an application of settled legal principles to changing facts.

Adequacy and timeliness remain central

The duty to serve requires more than eventual service – it requires service that is adequate and timely. Lengthy delays in connecting EV chargers, heat pumps or electrified industrial facilities increasingly impede climate goals, economic development and equitable access to clean energy.

Utilities must ensure that forecasting translates into operational readiness. Regulators, in turn, should assess utility performance against these legal standards, ensuring utilities prepare their systems to meet foreseeable demand without compromising affordability or reliability for current customers.

Applying existing law to the energy transition

Interpreting the duty to serve in light of today’s electrification supports faster infrastructure deployment, more equitable access to clean energy, lower emissions and sustained economic growth. Several state commissions have already begun moving in this direction through proactive planning and interconnection reforms – efforts that reflect enforcement of existing obligations, not expansion of regulatory authority.

This commonsense legislation repeals Biden-era ESG overreach and ensures Americans’ hard-earned retirement savings are protected from politically driven investment schemes.

“Under the extreme climate and social policy agenda of the Biden administration, financial advisors were encouraged to steer Americans’ hard-earned retirement savings into climate and social justice related endeavors instead of maximizing financial returns.

“By law, fiduciaries are required to act in the best financial interests of their clients - which is exactly the opposite of putting someone’s retirement savings at risk just to appease activists.

“I am proud to support the Protecting Prudent Investment of Retirement Savings Act to safeguard retirement savings and ensure hardworking Americans can retire with peace and prosperity, not woke and broke.” – Chairman Jodey Arrington.

Background:

This bill would prohibit fiduciary financial advisors from prioritizing any objective other than maximizing beneficiaries’ returns when they make investment decisions on behalf of their shareholders.

Under this bill, retirement plans would be required to provide notices to participants allowing them to select from designated investment alternatives.

The bill would also ensure that the hiring and retention of pension plan employees are based on merit, not on race or sex.

But the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have slammed the breaks on an industry that had doubled its output in just three years south of the border.

In 2025, tariffs on parts components coming from outside North America and Trump’s elimination of tax credits on the purchase of electric vehicles hit Mexican EV production and overall vehicle exports hard, Finance Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Thursday.

“We closed (2025) with a reduction of just under 3 percent (in overall vehicle exports). It’s not as much as we had expected. We were bracing for a much bigger impact,” Ebrard said. “Everyone is (realigning) its production lines. Also, the U.S. did away with incentives of $7,500 on electric vehicles […] So, what happened? Demand fell.”

Ebrard said the future of EV production in Mexico will continue to hinge on U.S. consumer appetite. Mexico in 2024 exported 2.8 million total light vehicles to the United States. “Mexico produces a lot of electrical vehicles, so it’s part of that 3 percent” drop, the finance minister said, without specifying a percentile decrease in EV production.

Speaking at a news conference in Mexico City broadcast on YouTube, Ebrard expanded on how car manufacturers in Mexico are adjusting to U.S. tariffs.

He said exporters – including U.S. companies assembling cars in Mexican plants – sent their vehicles to the American market either under Most Favored Nation status or through the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement .

It’s easier to avoid tariffs of up to 27.5 percent by complying with rules of origin under the treaty, so 85 out of 100 automakers operating in Mexico are using that mechanism, he said.

“All the automakers who invested in adding North American content have a discount from that 27.5, down to 13 percent on average. If you don’t have parts from North America, your tariff is higher,” Ebrard said.

He added Mexican negotiators will be discussing the tariffs with their U.S. and Canadian during this summer’s USMCA review to ensure they are done under the framework of the agreement.",https://www.krqe.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2026/01/65710bd8733dc9.28598705-e1746111515993.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-16 10:01:00.138156

That is the conclusion of a new McKinsey & Company analysis tracking progress across nine key decarbonisation technologies.

The report, Tracking the energy transition: where are we now?, shows renewable capacity has risen by 585GW, a 15% increase, while global electric vehicle sales grew 25% to around 17 million units. Solar photovoltaic deployment continues to surge, driven by falling costs and rapid buildout.

However, McKinsey finds that too few projects are reaching final investment decision across major regions. This shortfall affects mature technologies such as wind and solar, as well as emerging solutions including green hydrogen and sustainable fuels.

When operational, under-construction and FID-approved capacity are combined across China, Europe and the US, the analysis suggests many 2030 milestones will not be met. Less than 15% of the low-emissions technologies required for Paris-aligned pathways have been deployed, while global emissions rose 9% between 2015 and 2024.

“The progress landscape is nuanced by region and technology and while achieving energy transition commitments remain paramount for countries and companies alike, recent announcements indicate that shifting priorities and slowing momentum have led to project pauses and cancellations across technologies,” said Diego Hernandez Diaz, McKinsey partner and co-author.

China continues to lead deployment and pipeline growth, particularly in solar, having already exceeded its 2030 PV target. By contrast, all three regions are off track on offshore wind and battery energy storage systems, both critical to integrating renewables and reducing emissions.

The bill passed the policy committee with 11 aye votes!

My testimony:

“Good afternoon, Chair Petrie Norris and Committee members.

My name is Caleb Weis and I’m the Clean Energy Associate at Environment California. I’m here to express our strong support of AB 710.

California has long been a national leader in both renewable energy deployment and the establishment of commitments to shift its energy supply further towards clean and renewable energy.

Despite our successes, we continue to face challenges when it comes to the achievement of those clean and renewable energy commitments. One of the primary challenges is colloquially known as California’s duck curve, which describes the mismatch between abundant renewable energy supply during the daytime and the peaks in energy demand during the mornings and evenings. As a result of this mismatch, California often curtails, or wastes, renewable energy during the daytime, while relying on dirty, expensive energy during the hours of highest energy demand.

In fact, in 2025 alone, California curtailed over 3.7 million MWh of wind and solar energy, and total curtailment has been rising every year since 2015.

A clear solution to this challenge is the increased implementation of policies to encourage load-shifting. Load-shifting is the process of incentivizing and enabling customers to consume more energy during hours of renewable energy abundance, and less energy during hours when dirty, polluting energy sources prevail.

AB 710 would promote load-shifting by setting deadlines for electrical corporations to establish dynamic pricing programs which are available to all customers, and to implement plans which ensure that all customers have the requisite technology to be able to fully participate in these programs, if they desire.

In contrast to our abundant renewable energy, we have no time to waste in our mission to shift California towards 100% renewable and clean energy, and this bill would establish reasonable timelines to help us to get there. Therefore, we respectfully urge your aye vote.”",https://environmentamerica.org/california/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-15-at-18.42.18-1024x577.png,N,,2026-01-16 09:00:12.694029

Since President Donald Trump took office nearly a year ago, his administration has announced at least two dozen policy and regulatory actions aimed at hindering the build-out of wind and solar projects, including rescinding federal tax credits, withdrawing grants and loans, and freezing permitting approvals. Yet one measure in particular has had an outsize chilling effect — and is facing a new legal challenge from wind and solar groups.

Last summer, the U.S. Interior Department announced that all decisions related to wind and solar projects would require an ​“elevated review” by Secretary Doug Burgum, saying this would end the Biden administration’s ​“preferential treatment” for renewables. In a July memo, the agency listed nearly 70 types of permits and other actions that now need Burgum’s personal sign-off, adding cost and time and creating significant anxiety for developers, experts say.

Over 22 gigawatts of utility-scale wind and solar projects on public lands have been canceled or are held up as a result of the order, according to Wood Mackenzie data and the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management website. That’s enough capacity to power roughly 16.5 million U.S. homes — a significant amount at any point, but especially when the country is clamoring for more low-cost electricity as energy demand and utility bills soar.

“We’re seeing electricity costs go up all around the country, and the cheapest electrons that we can put into the supply side of that equation are all stuck on Secretary Burgum’s desk,” Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) told Canary Media.

Solar represents the bulk of that figure, with 18 GW of facilities scrapped or considered inactive as of December, by Wood Mackenzie’s count. Nearly 90% of those projects also included energy storage, given that many were slated for desert regions in the Southwest, said Kaitlin Fung, a research analyst for the consultancy.

“It’s created a choke point,” Fung said of Interior’s memo. She noted that the Bureau of Land Management has advanced permits for only one renewable energy project since July: the 700-megawatt Libra Solar facility in Nevada. Meanwhile, federal oil and gas permits have surged in the first year of Trump’s term.

Many other projects remain stuck in permitting limbo as developers await the approvals they need — from quick consultations to complex reviews — in order to secure financing and begin building their large-scale renewable energy installations. That’s true for wind and solar farms on private and state lands as well, since those projects might require federal approval for things like wildlife and waterway impacts.

The holdups are occurring as the United States teeters on the edge of an electricity crisis. Demand is climbing across the nation, causing household utility bills to soar, and more power plants are needed to satisfy the surge in AI data centers, factories, and electrified cars and buildings. Large-scale solar and onshore wind projects are among the fastest and lowest-cost ways to add power to the grid — faster than Trump’s preferred path of building new gas-fired power plants or restarting shuttered nuclear reactors.

Heinrich, the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, cited the gigawatts of stalled projects in a Senate floor speech earlier this month. He and other Democratic leaders have said that any efforts to pass bipartisan legislation on energy permitting reform are ​“dead in the water” so long as the Trump administration continues to block development of onshore wind and solar and cancel fully permitted offshore wind farms.

“The concern is that we put a balanced legislative package together that gives certainty to both traditional [oil and gas] energy and renewables — but if this administration is going to say yes to all of the fossil projects and create a de facto moratorium on all of the renewable and storage projects, then we haven’t accomplished anything,” Heinrich said by phone.

In recent weeks, a coalition of clean energy organizations sued to overturn the July memo and other actions from Interior and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which issues permits for energy projects near navigable waters. Both the Army Corps and Interior say they’re prioritizing projects that generate the most energy per acre, a measure that favors coal, oil, and gas and undercuts renewables — and which has its roots in fossil-fuel industry misinformation.

Such actions ​“arbitrarily and discriminatorily place wind and solar technologies into a second-class status compared to other energy sources,” the groups said in a statement this week. ​“The Trump administration has choked private developers’ ability to build new and urgently needed energy projects across the nation.”

For solar and storage in particular, nearly 520 proposed projects totaling 117 GW of capacity have yet to receive all the necessary federal, state, and local permits, which puts them at risk of being delayed by the Trump administration, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The projects represent half of the country’s new planned power capacity.

Many developers are simply receiving radio silence from agencies whose approval or advice they need, said Ben Norris, SEIA’s vice president of regulatory affairs, who likened the agencies’ actions to a ​“blockade on solar permits.” Fung noted one mundane but significant effect of Interior’s memo: Wind and solar developers are now excluded from using an online government planning tool that helps streamline environmental reviews, a move that creates additional costs and complexity for companies.

The delays come as developers are racing to qualify for federal tax credits under the newly shortened timelines. Wind and solar installations must either start construction this summer or be operating by the end of 2027 to access incentives. ​“Time is really of the essence for many of these projects,” Norris said. In the absence of Congress passing a permitting-reform bill, he added, the Trump administration could simply remove many of the roadblocks it created by revoking its memos and other actions.

There’s a lot happening right now in U.S. energy and policy and it’s easy to lose track of the larger picture. I’m going to ask you to turn your attention, at least for a few minutes, to something bigger that’s also happening:

Solar power is moving toward dominance of the global energy system.

The trend lines for solar deployment, panel prices and efficiency all point to a future in which energy is cleaner, cheaper and more accessible than today.

A recent paper in Nature Energy summarizes where we’re likely heading. It lists more than 60 co-authors from some of the world’s leading research institutions, including the National Laboratory of the Rockies (which was the National Renewable Energy Laboratory before a recent name change), the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Germany and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan.

“The global growth of photovoltaics for electricity generation has been remarkable, outpacing other energy technologies across history in rates of the expansion of manufacturing capacity and reduction in price,” said the paper.

As this continues, some of the main technological and policy challenges will involve designing an energy system that can operate with high levels of solar. Planners will need to develop a variety of power plants and energy-storage technologies to support the grid at night and during periods of low solar generation.

I spoke with Sarah Kurtz, an electrical engineering professor at the University of California, Merced and a co-author of the paper. She explained that the success of solar energy largely depends on the fact that the fuel—the sun—is free and plentiful.

“In one hour, the Earth receives enough light from the sun to power the world for the whole year,” she said.

She is a prolific researcher who has focused on improving solar panel performance, work she has focused on since the mid-1980s.

Andreas Bett, director of the Fraunhofer Institute and a co-author of the paper, said the growth of solar power has profound implications for making energy affordable and accessible. Solar is already the least expensive energy source in most of the world.

“There is no fundamental limit or resource problem for photovoltaic technology,” he said in an email. “It is a technology that will advance the prosperity of the entire global community. Nevertheless, it is important to continue developing the technology in order to ultimately achieve higher efficiency levels and thus reduce material consumption.”

The paper draws on discussions at the Terawatt Workshop, a gathering of solar researchers hosted in California in June 2024.

It begins by noting that the world now has 2 terawatts of solar photovoltaic generating capacity installed, which includes utility-scale and smaller systems. That’s a huge number, more than double what it was in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency.

Based on current manufacturing capacity and growth forecasts, the world is on track to install about 75 terawatts of solar by 2050, the paper said. This indicates growth on a transformational scale.

Solar power would expand because of a combination of declining panel prices and increasing efficiency. Today, a highly efficient panel can convert about 30 percent of the solar radiation striking it into electricity. The paper identifies technological improvements that could increase efficiency to 35 percent by mid-century.

As panels become more efficient, projects require fewer of them to generate the same amount of electricity, which saves land and materials.

To understand where we’re heading, it’s helpful to understand where we are. As of 2024, renewable energy sources produced 32 percent of the world’s electricity and were on the verge of overtaking coal as the global leader, according to the IEA.

Hydropower was the world’s leading source of renewable electricity in 2024, followed by wind and then solar. But solar, which was 7 percent of global electricity generation, is growing the fastest and is on track to become the largest source.

For governments and businesses, success in the energy economy of the future will depend on maximizing the benefits of solar and adapting to a grid dominated by solar.

Much of the world seems to understand this, but the United States under President Donald Trump is heading in the opposite direction with policies that favor fossil fuels and eliminate tax incentives for solar. The Trump administration often talks about this as a desire to achieve “energy dominance” through increasing production of coal, oil and natural gas.

“(M)y energy policy is defined by maximum production, maximum prosperity, and maximum power,” Trump said in an Oct. 17 proclamation designating “National Energy Dominance Month.”

I asked Bett what he makes of recent energy decisions by U.S. leadership.

“In my personal opinion, it is a mistake for the U.S. government to cut subsidies for photovoltaics,” he said. “It is the technology of the future and will be implemented worldwide. Developments will now progress outside the U.S.—especially in China, which will be able to establish itself as the sole global market leader. It is a shame that a high-tech nation like the U.S. is turning its back on a high-tech development.”

Kurtz said it’s shortsighted for the United States to not try to be a leader in solar.

“Solar is such a strong technology that the U.S. not supporting it will not be able to stop it,” she said. “The U.S. may get left behind.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-69.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 09:00:16.425802

It said the government should invest in domestic production, diversify supply with allies, build strategic stockpiles and set out a clear stance on Chinese involvement in the most critical supply chains.
“The UK is a small open trading nation sailing through an international economy whose waters are getting choppier by the day,” Narayanan said.","Britain risks widespread job losses across the clean-energy sector if global supply chains are hit by shocks, according to a new report that warns the country is too reliant on China for its climate ambitions.

The UK currently sources about a third of its battery imports from China, and Japan is the leading supplier of cathodes and anodes, the two major components that go into battery cells. It means plans to ramp up domestic battery manufacturing by 2030 will remain heavily reliant on parts made overseas.

Modelling by the Institute for Public Policy Research found that a yearlong interruption at the main suppliers of battery parts could cost as many as 90,000 UK jobs and wipe out production of more than 580,000 electric vehicles from 2030.

Such a shock would leave domestic carmakers ceding ground to Chinese electric-vehicle manufacturers, with BYD Co. already increasing its UK market share from 0.5% to 2.5% in 2025, and would ripple into other industries such as rail, aerospace and defense manufacturing, the think tank warned in a report published Friday.

Batteries are just one of the clean-energy areas where the UK is exposed to global markets, just as tensions intensify following US President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Disruptions to supplies of solar panels, steel and critical minerals also threaten the transition to net zero carbon emissions and jobs in regions already weakened by industrial decline, the report said.

“Trump’s trade war with China, the rise of conflicts around the world – these shocks ultimately hurt the UK economy because we rely so much on trade to source the essentials, including clean energy technologies,” said Pranesh Narayanan, senior research fellow at the IPPR.

The situation around critical minerals, which are key inputs for manufacturing clean-energy equipment, from battery components to permanent magnets used in wind turbines, is particularly concerning, the report said. China dominates the refinement of most critical minerals and has reverted to export controls for those that are in scarce supply.

The IPPR also estimated that delays to solar deployment and continued reliance on gas could also add about £1.5 billion ($2 billion) a year to energy import costs.

The researcher offered some policy recommendations to increase the UK’s energy resilience. It said the government should invest in domestic production, diversify supply with allies, build strategic stockpiles and set out a clear stance on Chinese involvement in the most critical supply chains.

“The UK is a small open trading nation sailing through an international economy whose waters are getting choppier by the day,” Narayanan said.

Trump expected to announce emergency power auction on Friday

Tech firms would be forced to fund new power plants for data centres

PJM would run the auction, potentially backing $15bn of new generation

Aim is to curb electricity price rises hitting households

Data-centre demand seen as key driver of grid strain

President Donald Trump is expected to announce an unprecedented intervention in U.S. power markets, unveiling plans for an “emergency power auction” that would require major technology companies to directly fund new electricity generation to support the rapid expansion of data centres.

Under the proposal, the country’s largest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, would be directed to run a special reliability auction designed to accelerate the construction of new power plants. The initiative could underpin as much as $15 billion in new generation capacity, according to officials familiar with the plan.

The move reflects growing concern within the administration and among state leaders that surging electricity demand from artificial intelligence and cloud-computing infrastructure is outpacing supply, pushing household power bills higher and fuelling political backlash. PJM’s network spans 13 states from the Mid-Atlantic to the Midwest and serves more than 67 million people, making it one of the most exposed regions to data-centre-driven demand growth.

Under the proposed structure, technology companies would bid for long-term contracts tied to new power generation, effectively paying to secure the electricity required for their data centres. The aim is to ensure the cost of new power plants does not fall on households, while addressing reliability concerns on an overstretched grid.

Trump has repeatedly argued that data-centre operators should bear responsibility for the power they consume, saying this week he does not want American households paying higher electricity bills because of AI infrastructure. Electricity affordability has become a central political issue ahead of November’s midterm elections, with power prices continuing to rise even as fuel costs have eased.

U.S. electricity prices have climbed sharply over the past year, with the average retail electricity price rising to a record, adding pressure to household budgets already strained by higher living costs.

The administration is framing the auction as a one-off emergency measure rather than a permanent shift in market design, intended to stabilise prices and ensure adequate supply before demand accelerates further. If implemented, the plan could also set a precedent for how other regions manage the collision between AI-driven power demand and aging electricity infrastructure.",https://images.investinglive.com/images/nuclear%20power_id_3676c20b-ed65-4816-ad3b-a28f7cd046e5_size975.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 08:59:47.793249

The Biden administration sought to increase demand for critical minerals domestically by pushing for more electric vehicle and windmill production.
But the Trump administration largely eliminated the incentives for those products and instead chose to focus on increasing critical minerals production directly.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A bipartisan group of lawmakers have proposed creating a new agency with $2.5 billion to spur production of rare earths and the other critical minerals, while the Trump administration has already taken aggressive actions to break China’s grip on the market for these materials that are crucial to high-tech products, including cellphones, electric vehicles, jet fighters and missiles.

It’s too early to tell how the bill, if passed, could align with the White House’s policy, but whatever the approach, the U.S. is in a crunch to drastically reduce its reliance on China, after Beijing used its dominance of the critical minerals market to gain leverage in the trade war with Washington. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year truce in October, by which Beijing would continue to export critical minerals while the U.S. would ease its export controls of U.S. technology on China.

The Pentagon has shelled out nearly $5 billion over the past year to help ensure its access to the materials after the trade war laid bare just how beholden the U.S. is to China, which processes more than 90% of the world’s critical minerals. To break Beijing’s chokehold, the U.S. government is taking equity stakes in a handful of critical mineral companies and in some cases guaranteeing the price of some commodities using an approach that seems more likely to come out of China’s playbook instead of a Republican administration.

The bill that Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., introduced Thursday would favor a more market-based approach by setting up the independent body charged with building a stockpile of critical minerals and related products, stabilizing prices, and encouraging domestic and allied production to help ensure stable supply not only for the military but also the broader economy and manufacturers.

Shaheen called the legislation “a historic investment” to make the U.S. economy more resilient against China’s dominance that she said has left the U.S. vulnerable to economic coercion. Young said creating the new reserve is “a much-needed, aggressive step to protect our national and economic security.”

Rep. Rob Wittman, R.-Va., introduced the House version of the bill.

New sense of urgency

When Trump imposed widespread tariffs last spring, Beijing fought back not only with tit-for-tat tariffs but severe restrictions on the export of critical minerals, forcing Washington to back down and eventually agree to the truce when the leaders met in South Korea.

On Monday, in his speech at SpaceX, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revealed that the Pentagon has in the past five months alone “deployed over $4.5 billion in capital commitments” to close six critical minerals deals that will “help free the United States from market manipulation.”

One of the deals involves a $150 million of preferred equity by the Pentagon in Atlantic Alumina Co. to save the country’s last alumina refinery and build its first large-scale gallium production facility in Louisiana.

Last year, the Pentagon announced it would buy $400 million of preferred stock in MP Materials, which owns the country’s only operational rare earths mine at Mountain Pass, California, and entered into a $1.4-billion joint partnership with ReElement Technologies Corp. to build up a domestic supply chain for rare earth magnets.

On Wednesday, Trump announced in a proclamation that the U.S. is “too reliant” on foreign-sourced critical minerals and directed his administration to negotiate better deals. He said possible remedies would include minimum import prices for certain critical minerals.

“Reshoring manufacturing that’s critical to our national and economic security is a top priority for the Trump administration,” said Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson.

The drastic move by the U.S. government to take equity stakes has prompted some analysts to observe that Washington is pivoting to some form of state capitalism to compete with Beijing.

“Despite the dangers of political interference, the strategic logic is compelling,” wrote Elly Rostoum, a senior fellow at the Washington-based research institute Center for European Policy Analysis. She suggested that the new model could be “a prudent way for the U.S. to ensure strategic autonomy and industrial sovereignty.”

Companies across the industry are welcoming the intervention from Trump’s administration.

“He is playing three-dimensional chess on critical minerals like no previous president has done. It’s about time too, given the military and strategic vulnerability we face by having to import so many of these fundamental building blocks of technology and national defense,” NioCorp’s Chief Communications Officer Jim Sims said. That company is trying to finish raising the money it needs to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.

Relying on allies for help

In addition to trying to boost domestic production, the Trump administration has sought to secure some of these crucial elements through allies. In October, Trump signed an $8.5 billion agreement with Australia to invest in mining there, and the president is now aggressively trying to take over Greenland in the hope of being able to one day extract rare earths from there.

On Monday, finance ministers from the G7 nations huddled in Washington over their vulnerability in the critical mineral supply chains.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has led several rounds of trade negotiations with Beijing, urged attendees to increase their supply chain resiliency and thanked them for their willingness to work together “toward decisive action and lasting solutions,” according to a Treasury statement.

The bill introduced on Thursday by Shaheen and Young would encourage production with both domestic and allied producers.

Past efforts to bolster rare earths production

Congress in the past several years has pushed for legislation to protect the U.S. military and civilian industry from Beijing’s chokehold. The issue became a pressing concern every time China turned to its proven tactics of either restricting the supply or turned to dumping extra critical minerals on the market to depress prices and drive any potential competitors out of business.

The Biden administration sought to increase demand for critical minerals domestically by pushing for more electric vehicle and windmill production. But the Trump administration largely eliminated the incentives for those products and instead chose to focus on increasing critical minerals production directly.

Most of those past efforts were on a much more limited scale than what the government has done in the past year, and they were largely abandoned after China relented and eased access to critical minerals.

A US auto giant is in discussions with the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) giant BYD to acquire batteries for some of its hybrid-vehicle models, the Wall Street Journal reported late Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The terms of the agreement are still being discussed by the two businesses. The sources said some sources suggested Ford would import batteries from BYD to its plants located outside the US.

According to the sources, negotiations are still ongoing and it is possible that a deal may not be reached.

If a deal is finalized, it would unite Ford with the biggest Chinese automaker, which has alarmed a huge portion of the American auto industry due to its capacity to manufacture reasonably priced vehicles with advanced technology.

For Ford, it would resolve an issue, since the corporation needs a battery source as it retreats from electric vehicles and expands its range of hybrid vehicles, and BYD can manufacture premium automobile batteries.

Prior to becoming one of the world's largest automakers, BYD had a strong battery manufacturing company that made batteries for hybrid vehicles. The majority of batteries are now produced in China, but as it grows in regions including Southeast Asia, Europe, and Brazil, the company is increasing capacity in its plants abroad.

In response to declining demand, Ford announced last month that it would stop producing EVs and accept an estimated $19.5 billion in charges mainly related to its EV business. The business stated that by 2030, hybrid, extended-range plug-in hybrid, and all-electric vehicles will account for about half of its worldwide sales volume.

Ford intends to increase the number of gas-powered cars in its inventory and also boost the number of hybrid vehicle alternatives. Ford needs more batteries suitable for hybrid cars in order to achieve that.

At its bus manufacturing facility in California, BYD has produced some batteries for commercial vehicles, but it has not produced any batteries for passenger cars in the US.

After the news, US President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro criticized the plan on US social media company X.

“So Ford wants to simultaneously prop up a Chinese competitor’s supply chain and make it more vulnerable to that same supply chain extortion?” he wrote. “What could go wrong here?”",https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2026/01/16/thumbs_b_c_37b1ca0baa869a487d9ab8a1bad2be8d.jpg?v=102605,N,,2026-01-16 05:58:32.642667

The White House said its National Energy Dominance Council and the governors of several states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia, want to try to compel PJM Interconnection to hold a power auction for tech companies to bid on contracts to build new power plants,

The Trump administration and governors will sign a statement of principles toward that end Friday. The plan was first reported by Bloomberg.

“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities, and this would deliver much-needed, long-term relief to the mid-Atlantic region,"" said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro is expected to be at the White House, a person familiar with Shapiro’s plans said, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement. Shapiro, a Democrat, made his participation in Friday’s event contingent on including a provision to extend a limit on wholesale electricity price increases for the region’s consumers, the person said.

But the operator of the grid won't be there. “PJM was not invited. Therefore we would not attend,” said spokesperson Jeff Shields.

It was not immediately clear whether President Donald Trump would attend the event, which was not listed on his public schedule.

Trump and the governors are under pressure to insulate consumers and businesses alike from the costs of feeding Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers. Meanwhile, more Americans are falling behind on their electricity bills.

Consumer advocates say ratepayers in the mid-Atlantic electricity grid — which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. — are already paying billions of dollars in higher bills to underwrite the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.

However, they also say that the billions of dollars that consumers are paying isn’t resulting in the construction of new power plants necessary to meet the rising demand.

Pivotal contests in November will be decided by communities that are home to fast-rising electric bills or fights over who’s footing the bill for the data centers that underpin the explosion in demand for artificial intelligence. In parts of the country, data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to the grid.

Electricity costs were a key issue in last year's elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, a data center hotspot, and in Georgia, where Democrats ousted two Republican incumbents for seats on the state’s utility regulatory commission. Voters in New Jersey, Virginia, California and New York City all cited economic concerns as the top issue, as Democrats and Republicans gird for a debate over affordability in the intensifying midterm battle to control Congress.

The use of hydraulic hybrid vehicles can also contribute to reduced air pollution which results in a cleaner environment and healthier people.","EPA and the United Parcel Service (UPS) have developed a hydraulic hybrid delivery vehicle to explore and demonstrate the environmental benefits of the hydraulic hybrid for urban pick-up and delivery fleets. The demonstration vehicle is a 24,000-pound UPS package car, fitted with an EPA-patented full-series hydraulic hybrid drive integrated into the rear axle. The vehicle competed in the Michelin Challenge Bibendum in China with other advanced technology vehicles and received the top overall ranking among all commercial hybrid vehicles (delivery vehicles and urban buses).

World's First Full Hydraulic Hybrid in a Delivery Truck

Hydraulic Hybrid: The Most Efficient Lowest Cost Hybrids

Along with EPA (which worked for over 10 years with a wide variety of private and public sector organizations) and UPS, several other organizations contributed to the development of the hydraulic hybrid vehicle, including Eaton Corporation, International Truck and Engine Corporation, the U.S. Army, Morgan-Olson, the Ford Motor Company, Parker-Hannifin Corporation, Ricardo Inc., Michigan State University, the University of Michigan, and the University of Wisconsin.

Many heavy trucks that operate in urban areas are delivery vehicles, including package trucks, refuse trucks, and buses. These vehicles operate in heavy stop-go traffic and contribute to urban pollution and fuel consumption. A UPS truck is a good representative of the typical urban-based vehicle, making it an ideal pilot for the hydraulic hybrid. The UPS pilot vehicle demonstrates the cost effectiveness of hydraulic hybrid technology which can be applied to all trucks that operate in urban environments as well as highway vehicles.

In laboratory tests, the city fuel economy of the hydraulic hybrid UPS vehicle is 60% to 70% increased miles per gallon compared to a conventional UPS truck. The CO2 emissions of the demonstration UPS vehicle are more than 40% lower than a comparable conventional UPS vehicle. The hydraulic hybrid vehicle also achieves approximately 50% lower hydrocarbon and 60% lower particulate matter in laboratory tests. This prototype vehicle has also demonstrated modest reductions in NOx emissions. Optimized production vehicles are expected to have larger NOx reductions. Hydraulic hybrids are able to capture and reuse 70-80% of the otherwise wasted braking energy.

When commercialized in high volume, EPA estimates that the additional cost of hydraulic hybrid technology has the potential to be about $7,000 for the UPS package car. In today’s dollars, the net lifetime savings of this technology in a typical UPS truck, which is used for 20 years, would be over $50,000. If fuel prices continue to increase faster than inflation, the lifetime savings would be even greater. The current data demonstrates that hydraulic hybrid vehicles have great potential not only for large commercial urban vehicles but also for personal vehicles, especially larger personal vehicles such as large SUVs, pickups, and vans.

By working to commercialize this innovative technology, we can reduce greenhouse gases, reduce US energy consumption, and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. The use of hydraulic hybrid vehicles can also contribute to reduced air pollution which results in a cleaner environment and healthier people.",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-standard-og.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 11:02:26.528918

The framework has three “pillars,” or areas in which TCLP plans to work to reduce emissions.
Staff clarified they’d be tracking renewable energy certificates (RECs) attached to actual clean energy generation as they work toward the 100 percent target.
TCLP will seek to help the community reduce emissions by encouraging the electrification of buildings and transportation, as well as use of energy-efficient amenities.
Encouraging more EV use and energy-efficient heat pumps are examples of ways to reduce such emissions, Hites said.","Traverse City Light & Power board members unanimously approved a new “decarbonization framework” this week – a policy that outlines how the city-owned utility will reduce emissions and make progress toward its goal of using 100 percent renewable energy by 2040. Traverse City became the first city in the state to commit to that goal in 2018, though Michigan itself is now following suit as it aims to go clean by 2050 – with Governor Gretchen Whitmer announcing a new initiative Thursday to explore green energy resources.

TCLP Executive Director Brandie Ekren called this a “milestone moment” in the utility’s history as it prepares to execute the “audacious goal” set by the board in 2018. She and other staff laid out a framework that provides a “durable, outcomes-focused structure for how TCLP approaches decarbonization over the long term,” according to a team memo.

The framework has three “pillars,” or areas in which TCLP plans to work to reduce emissions. The first, called Power Supply, reiterates the utility’s commitment to go green by 2040 and hit an interim target of using 60 percent renewable energy by 2035. TCLP is at about 41 percent right now. TCLP will continue to transition its purchased power to clean sources like wind, solar, landfill gas, and others, according to the plan.

Staff clarified they’d be tracking renewable energy certificates (RECs) attached to actual clean energy generation as they work toward the 100 percent target. “We’re not purchasing RECs just to accomplish a goal,” Ekren said. “The idea is that we want generation attached to it.”

In addition to diversifying its portfolio, TCLP will continue to explore energy storage and “demand-side” solutions, the framework states. Demand-side solutions are those that encourage customers to manage or reduce their energy usage. Examples range from smart thermostats and electric vehicles (EVs) to TCLP’s recent transition to time-of-use rates, which trend higher when electricity is most in demand and expensive to produce and lower when costs and demand are lower.

Another pillar of the plan is Internal Operations. TCLP will “lead by example” by decarbonizing its own operations, including its fleet and workforce practices, said Sustainability and Climate Initiative Analyst Colin Hites. That will include a focus on electrifying the utility wherever possible and having sustainable procurement protocols, according to Hites. “This is really the walk-the-walk part of it,” he said, adding that TCLP would commit to “being climate leaders by taking care of our house.”

The third and final pillar is Community End Use. TCLP will seek to help the community reduce emissions by encouraging the electrification of buildings and transportation, as well as use of energy-efficient amenities. “In order to realize the full impact of cleaning the power supply as a means of mitigating the effects of climate change, you also have to electrify the end use to ensure that the benefits of that clean grid are being taken advantage of to the highest degree possible,” Hites explained.

While Traverse City doesn’t yet have its own greenhouse gas inventory, Hites said such inventories in other communities show that buildings – particularly their heating and cooling systems – and transportation are responsible for the “vast majority” of local emissions. Encouraging more EV use and energy-efficient heat pumps are examples of ways to reduce such emissions, Hites said. He added that as both a pragmatic approach to reducing emissions and a “moral imperative” for the utility, TCLP will need to ensure vulnerable populations – such as low-income groups – are included in the transition to electrification.

The decarbonization framework includes five “guiding principles,” including equity, affordability, reliability, innovation, and accountability. The policy will be reviewed at a minimum every five years, or sooner if “warranted by significant changes in state or federal law, market conditions, or updates to TCLP’s Climate Action Plan.” Ekren said staff will be creating specific metrics and dates for pillars in the framework so that TCLP is able to “measure success” as it moves toward its goals. Board member Elysha Davila encouraged her fellow board members to be aggressive in pursuing the utility’s aims.

“Not only is the original 100 percent goal exciting, because it's a hard number, but it's also really ambitious,” she said. “I just want to encourage this body and the newer folks here too to not shy away from maybe over-ambition in pursuit of these really important goals.”

Governor Gretchen Whitmer also announced plans this week to more aggressively pursue green energy goals for Michigan. Whitmer signed an executive directive Thursday to explore geologic hydrogen “as a usable, clean fuel alternative.” Michigan’s geology “makes it one of the most promising regions in the world for geologic hydrogen, a naturally occurring clean energy resource,” according to a release from Whitmer’s office. Investing in the field will “solidify Michigan’s place at the forefront of the U.S. hydrogen economy, which is projected to reach tens of billions of dollars in new economic activity,” the release states.",https://eyesonly.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/TCLP_Electric_Charging.jpeg,N,,2026-01-16 00:59:11.065196

Data center development and hyperscale leasing opportunity unlocked via fee simple acquisition of 200 acres of land underlying Riot’s Rockdale Site

Data center business firmly and rapidly established via execution of lease with AMD at Rockdale Site, with expected delivery beginning in January 2026 and completing in May 2026

Data center portfolio of 1.7 GW of fully approved power capacity in one of the leading data center markets in the U.S.

CASTLE ROCK, Colo., Jan. 16, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIOT) (“Riot” or “the Company”) , a Bitcoin-driven industry leader in the development of large-scale data centers and bitcoin mining applications, is pleased to announce a series of transformative transactions that firmly establish the Company’s rapidly scaling data center business, including:

The fee simple acquisition of 200 acres of land at Rockdale currently occupied by Riot (the “Rockdale Site”) for total consideration of $96.0 million funded entirely by the sale of approximately 1,080 bitcoin from Riot’s balance sheet, adding the Rockdale Site to Riot’s portfolio of data center development opportunities

The signing of a Data Center Lease and Services Agreement (“Data Center Lease”) with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (“AMD”), a leading innovator in high-performance computing, graphics and visualization technologies, at the Rockdale Site, which includes an initial deployment of 25 MW of critical IT load capacity to be delivered in phases beginning in January 2026 and completing in May 2026, with the potential for additional expansion of up to a total of 200 MW of critical IT load capacity

“I am pleased to share the substantial progress we have made at Rockdale, which expands our fully approved data center power portfolio to 1.7 gigawatts and, through the signing of a data center lease with AMD, firmly establishes Rockdale as a leading data center development opportunity,” said Jason Les, CEO of Riot. “This partnership represents a validation of Riot’s infrastructure, development capabilities, the attractiveness of our sites, our readily available power capacity, and our ability to offer innovative solutions to meet the requirements of top-tier tenants.

“Our data center team, led by Chief Data Center Officer Jonathan Gibbs, worked quickly to develop a uniquely tailored offering that met AMD’s immediate needs and offers a path for further expansion of our collaboration. We are incredibly excited to collaborate and grow with AMD, one of the most significant hardware manufacturers in the world and a key leader in the AI ecosystem. These results mark a pivotal moment that cements Riot’s position as a leading data center developer, less than twelve months since the launch of our formal process to evaluate our assets for AI/HPC use. Today’s milestones strongly position us for future development and leasing opportunities. As we continue to work towards converting all available power capacity at our Rockdale and Corsicana sites for data center use, we are galvanized by the opportunity this presents for substantial long-term value creation for our shareholders.”

Acquisition of the Rockdale Site

Riot has completed the fee simple acquisition of 200 acres of land in Milam County, TX, on which the Company previously operated under a long-term ground lease, for total consideration of $96.0 million. This transaction permanently establishes Riot in Milam County, ensuring long-term growth and operational stability within the county’s business-friendly jurisdiction. Now fully owned and operated by Riot, the Rockdale Site features a 700 MW interconnection to the grid, dedicated water supply, and fiber connectivity. This acquisition immediately unlocks the Rockdale Site for data center development and supports the concurrently announced signing of a Data Center Lease with AMD. Riot intends to convert the full 700 MW of gross power capacity at its Rockdale Site for data center tenants.

Riot now owns and manages over 1,100 acres and 1.7 GW of power capacity across its two Texas facilities, which are separated by approximately 100 miles. Together, they anchor an unrivaled, leading position in the “Texas Triangle,” a formation of the major urban centers of Texas bounded by Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio.

The fee simple acquisition of the land at the Rockdale Site was funded entirely by the sale of approximately 1,080 bitcoin from Riot’s balance sheet.

Signing of a Data Center Lease and Services Agreement with AMD

Riot has entered into the Data Center Lease with AMD to deliver 25 MW of critical IT load capacity at its Rockdale Site. The Data Center Lease carries an initial term of 10 years and is expected to generate approximately $311.0 million in contract revenue. Also included are three five-year extension options which, if fully exercised, would bring the total expected contract revenue to approximately $1.0 billion. In addition, AMD holds an expansion option for an additional 75 MW of critical IT load capacity and a right of first refusal for another 100 MW. If both are exercised, AMD’s total leased capacity at the Rockdale Site would increase to 200 MW.

The initial deployment will leverage Riot’s existing infrastructure at the Rockdale Site. Riot has commenced retrofitting one of its existing buildings, with delivery to AMD expected in two phases: the first in January 2026 and final completion in May 2026.

“At AMD, advancing high-performance computing and AI requires partners that can match our pace and scale,” said Hasmukh Ranjan, CIO of AMD. “We’re excited to work with Riot, whose capabilities, power availability, and high-density solutions align with our infrastructure roadmap. This collaboration strengthens our ability to deliver the performance and scalability the AI ecosystem demands.”

Key Agreement Highlights:

Approximately $311 million of contract value across the initial 10-year term for 25 MW of critical IT load capacity

Approximately $1.0 billion of contract value if all three five-year extension options are exercised

200 MW of total potential critical IT load capacity, inclusive of 75 MW expansion option and 100 MW right of first refusal

Retrofit capex for initial deployment of $89.8 million, representing $3.6 million per MW of critical IT load capacity

Expected average net operating income (“NOI”) contribution of equal $25 million per year

Modified gross lease with annual escalators

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release includes a forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure, expected net operating income (NOI) contribution, which the Company defines as expected lease revenue for a specific lease less expected cost of revenue. Cost of revenue, includes compensation, IT equipment and software, and other costs directly related to the lease. Management uses expected NOI contribution to assess the projected operating performance of individual leases. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is operating income. Expected NOI contribution has significant limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP results. In evaluating expected NOI contribution, you should be aware that future non-reimbursable lease operating expenses may arise that are not currently known. The Company’s presentation of expected NOI contribution should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. This measure excludes the impact of capital expenditures, material financial obligations, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization, all of which have real economic effects and could materially affect the Company’s consolidated financial results. Definitions and calculations of expected NOI contribution may vary among companies, and therefore the Company’s expected NOI contribution may not be comparable to similar measures published by others. A reconciliation of expected NOI contribution to operating income is not provided because expected NOI contribution is only calculated for specific leases. Certain amounts cannot be reasonably estimated without unreasonable efforts because certain reconciling metrics are out of the Company’s control, and such estimates would imply a degree of precision that could be misleading to investors.

For more information, please refer to our GAAP financial statements included in our most recent filings with the SEC.

Diana’s Highly Qualified Independent Director Nominees Bring Extensive Experience Across Dry Bulk Shipping, Finance, Mergers & Acquisitions and Corporate Governance

Current Genco Board Has Failed to Engage Constructively with Diana — Its Largest Shareholder — and Meaningfully Evaluate Attractive Premium Acquisition Proposal

Believes Meaningful Change is Needed to Ensure Board Seriously Evaluates Diana’s Offer and Opportunities to Maximize Shareholder Value

ATHENS, Greece, Jan. 16, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Diana Shipping Inc. (NYSE: DSX) (“Diana” or the “Company”), a global shipping company specializing in the ownership and bareboat charter-in of dry bulk vessels, that owns approximately 14.8% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Genco Shipping & Trading Limited (NYSE: GNK) (“Genco”), today announced its intention to nominate a slate of six highly qualified director candidates for election to Genco’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) at its upcoming 2026 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”).

The nominations follow the current Genco Board’s rejection of Diana’s non-binding indicative proposal to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Genco common stock not already owned by Diana for $20.60 per share in cash. Diana’s offer provides all Genco shareholders the opportunity to realize attractive premium value and is supported by a highly confident financing letter from two leading shipping banks. The current Genco Board, however, took more than six weeks to respond to the offer, during which time they failed to engage with Diana in any way regarding the financial or structural elements of the proposal. In light of the current Board’s flat-out refusal to engage, Diana believes that Genco shareholders would benefit from the opportunity to elect directors open to exploring strategic alternatives to maximize value for shareholders, including objective, independent, and good-faith consideration of Diana’s proposal.

Diana’s Chief Executive Officer, Semiramis Paliou, commented:

“Diana believes strongly in the merits of consolidation in the dry bulk carriers sector. Our all-cash offer would realize the benefits of combining our platforms and provide Genco shareholders with immediate, certain value at a meaningful premium to historical trading levels. Given our expressed readiness to engage constructively with Genco’s Board and its advisors, we are deeply disappointed that they have completely refused to have any dialogue with us.

“As Genco’s largest shareholder, we believe we have a duty to act in response to the Board’s failure to properly consider our offer. Our decision to nominate highly qualified, independent director candidates to replace current Genco directors reflects our conviction that Genco shareholders deserve a refreshed Board that will be open to exploring strategic alternatives to maximize value for shareholders, including engaging in good faith with respect to our highly compelling value creation opportunity.”

Diana’s nominees include:

Because they are based on beliefs, estimates and assumptions, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Any number of factors could affect actual results, including, without limitation, those that follow: ; the effect of conditions in national and worldwide financial markets, including inflation, increases in interest rates and economic recession, and with respect to the ability of financial institutions to provide capital; the impact of tariffs, the adoption of trade restrictions affecting the company’s products or suppliers, a United States withdrawal from or significant renegotiation of trade agreements, the occurrence of trade wars, the closing of border crossings, and other changes in trade regulations or relationships; changing oil prices and/or supply; product demand and pricing; changes in product mix, product substitution and market acceptance of the company’s products; volatility or fluctuations in the pricing, quality or availability of raw materials (particularly steel), supplies, transportation, utilities, labor and other items required by operations (especially in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine);

the overall success of, and the ability to integrate, newly-acquired businesses and joint ventures, maintain and develop their customers, and achieve synergies and other expected benefits and cost savings therefrom; capacity levels and efficiencies, within facilities, within major product markets and within the industries in which the company participates as a whole; the effect of disruption in the business of suppliers, customers, facilities and shipping operations due to adverse weather, casualty events, equipment breakdowns, labor shortages, interruption in utility services, civil unrest, international conflicts (especially in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine), terrorist activities or other causes; changes in customer demand, inventories, spending patterns, product choices, and supplier choices; risks associated with doing business internationally, including economic, political and social instability (especially in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine), foreign currency exchange rate exposure and the acceptance of the company’s products in global markets; the ability to improve and maintain processes and business practices to keep pace with the economic, competitive and technological environment; the effect of inflation, interest rate increases and economic recession, which may negatively impact the company’s operations and financial results; deviation of actual results from estimates and/or assumptions used by the company in the application of its significant accounting policies; the level of imports and import prices in the company’s markets; the impact of environmental laws and regulations or the actions of the United States Environmental Protection Agency or similar regulators which increase costs or limit the company’s ability to use or sell certain products;

the effect of healthcare laws in the United States and potential changes for such laws, which may increase the company’s healthcare and other costs and negatively impact the company’s operations and financial results; the effects of tax laws in the United States and potential changes for such laws, which may increase the company’s costs and negatively impact the company’s operations and financial results; cyber security risks; the effects of privacy and information security laws and standards; and other risks described from time to time in the company’s filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including those described in “Part I – Item 1A. – Risk Factors” of the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025.

Forward-looking statements should be construed in the light of such risks. The company notes these factors for investors as contemplated by the Act. It is impossible to predict or identify all potential risk factors. Consequently, readers should not consider the foregoing list to be a complete set of all potential risks and uncertainties. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.

The company does not undertake, and hereby disclaims, any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Strive or Semler Scientific or the combined company;

Research-use-only offerings are commercially available, enabling immediate product and service revenue generation

Targets the global CRO market of $47.9 billion in 2025 and growing at 7% CAGR

BERKELEY, Calif, Jan. 16, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Profusa, Inc. (“Profusa” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: PFSA), a commercial stage digital health company pioneering the next generation of technology platform enabling the continuous monitoring of an individual’s biochemistry, announces the launch of its Healthcare Research version of the Lumee tissue oxygen monitoring into the contract research organizations (CRO) market. This strategic step is expected to generate immediate service-based revenue .

This initiative targets a high-growth segment of the pharmaceutical services industry, where demand is accelerating for more predictive, real-time biological data to improve drug development efficiency and decision-making. Profusa’s Lumee tissue oxygen products are commercially ready and available for immediate deployment, which will allow CRO partners to rapidly incorporate the technology into existing study designs and offer differentiated services to their clients with minimal implementation risk.

The CRO and pharmaceutical services market continues to experience strong growth, driven by increasing R&D investment, regulatory momentum around new approach methodologies (NAMs), and the need to reduce late-stage development risk. Industry forecasts estimate the global pharmaceutical CRO market could expand from approximately $47.9 billion in 2025 to over $91.2 billion by 2034 at a CAGR of more than 7%, underscoring the expanding addressable opportunity for advanced biosensing platforms.

Building on Profusa’s established success with its Lumee oxygen tissue-integrated biosensor technologies, the company will now offer the Lumee tissue oxygen system as commercial research-use-only (RUO) kits and a service-enabled platform for CRO partners. This provides researchers and R&D teams access to continuous, real-time measurement of tissue oxygenation, providing critical insights across a range of applications including advanced in vitro and organ-on-chip models, preclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies, and translational research programs. In addition, the Lumee tissue oxygen system supports research into complex biological processes such as tissue oxygenation dynamics in wound healing and tumor microenvironments in oncology -- areas where oxygen plays a central role in therapeutic response and biological interpretation. By integrating Lumee tissue oxygen into CRO workflows, Profusa enables pharmaceutical customers to access biologically relevant data that extends well beyond traditional endpoint assays.

To help meet the demand from this industry expansion, Profusa has appointed Sean Givens to lead the commercialization efforts as the Head of Government and Healthcare Research Business. “This is a natural and timely extension of Profusa’s platform building off of previous successes of this market,” said Mr. Givens. “Our sensors are validated, ready to ship, and already generating strong interest across the industry. By partnering with CROs, we can help accelerate better drug development decisions while creating a meaningful, near-term revenue stream for Profusa.”

Please contact ruo.sales@profusa.com for additional information about this offering.

Mr. Givens brings over 20 years of government accounting and contracting experience, as well as extensive operations experience in consumer electronics, medical devices and drug development. Most recently, Mr. Givens served as Profusa’s Head, Government Business. Prior, he was co-founder and COO of MIODx, a company focused on immune repertoire profiling to predict patient response to immunotherapy regimens. At MIODx, he played a key role in acquiring the technology, aligning the partnerships and collaboration strategies, and raising venture capital to develop the company and technology.

About Profusa

Based in Berkeley, Calif., Profusa is a commercial stage digital health company led by visionary scientific founders, an experienced management team and a world-class board of directors in the development of a new generation of tissue-integrated sensors to detect and continuously transmit actionable, medical-grade data for personal and medical use. With its long-lasting, injectable and affordable biosensors and its intelligent data platform, Profusa aims to provide people with a personalized biochemical signature rooted in data that clinicians can trust and rely on.

Washington, D.C. — Today, the Senate, in a 82-15 vote, passed three bicameral, bipartisan fiscal year appropriations bills: the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies; Energy and Water Development; and Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies bills. The bills now head to the president’s desk to be signed into law. The House cleared the package in an overwhelming 397-28 vote last Thursday.

____________________________

“Today, we sent funding bills to the president’s desk that reject the steep cuts he wanted and protect investments that families across America depend on every day,” said Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and Ranking Member of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee. “This package saves a key program to save families on their energy bills, sustains our investments in scientific research, and protects essential funding for our public lands and Tribes, among so much else. Passing these bills reasserts Congress’ power of the purse and will prevent this administration from having the legal authority to decide for itself how to spend these taxpayer funds again. Democrats will keep fighting to protect investments in the American people—and I look forward to getting the rest of our bills across the finish line.”

Vice Chair Murray’s remarks on the package are available HERE.

“Oregonians turned out in record numbers during my town halls last year and delivered a clear message: Congress must fight back against harmful funding cuts and do everything it can to protect our public lands, waters, and outdoor-driven economy. The FY 2026 Interior-Environment funding bill doesn’t go as far as I’d hoped, but it takes a solid stride toward taking on wildfire and smoke threats, supporting wildland firefighters, modernizing our water infrastructure, and fulfilling our trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribes,” said Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Ranking Member of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. “This bill also helps reassert Congress’ Power of the Purse in the face of President Trump’s authoritarian power grab and illegal funding cuts. The bill also rejects dozens of poison pill riders proposed by House Republicans and protects funding for operating and protecting our public lands, making it clear that Congress intends to ensure public lands stay in public hands. I look forward to this bill being signed swiftly into law to ensure communities in Oregon and across the nation have the necessary resources to tackle the greatest problems facing our environment, health, lands, air, and water.”

“As we face a lawless Trump Administration, Congress’s role in fighting for Americans’ priorities is all the more important. Within this bill, we worked to invest in those priorities, reject the Administration’s attempts to defund critical initiatives both in Maryland and nationally, and create new safeguards against their efforts to ignore Congressionally-mandated funds. This legislation will help boost economic opportunity and strengthen public safety in our communities,” said Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Ranking Member of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. “We also fought to reject the Trump Administration’s attacks on science, including at NASA Goddard, NOAA, and NIST – all based in my home state of Maryland. I also worked within this bill to secure language to reassert Congress’s oversight role in the new FBI headquarters and to ensure the new headquarters meets the mission and security needs of the FBI. While this bill is not perfect – including Republicans’ decision to strip my amendment requiring DOJ preserve and report to Congress on the Epstein files – it rejects many Republican poison pills that would make our communities less safe, trample Americans’ civil rights, restrict access to healthcare, impede important scientific research, and so much more. The investments we secured in this legislation were hard-fought, and this bill will help invest in and protect important priorities for the American people.”

Throughout negotiations, Democrats fought to protect the programs and investments that matter most to working families across the country. Among much else, this three-bill package delivers important investments for the American people:

FAMILIES’ ENERGY COSTS: Rejects President Trump’s push to eliminate the Weatherization Assistance Program that saves families an average of $372 per year on their energy bills by making energy efficiency upgrades. Instead, Democrats secured a $3 million increase in funding for the program.

SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH: Rejects President Trump’s efforts to slash funding for the National Science Foundation by 57%, gut funding for the Department of Energy’s Office of Science by $1.1 billion, and slash NASA’s science budget by 47%. Instead, the package sustains research funding for NSF, provides $160 million more for the Office of Science, which supports critical research being conducted by 22,000 researchers at our 17 national labs and over 300 universities, and provides $7.25 billion for NASA’s science budget.

PUBLIC LANDS & NATIONAL PARKS: Rejects President Trump’s push to cut funding for the National Park Service by over $1 billion and provides the funding necessary to fully support the longstanding operations of America’s public lands.

FLOOD PREVENTION: Provides $10.44 billion for the Army Corps, a historic funding level, rejects President Trump’s push to cut funding by $2 billion, and reasserts congressional control over which projects get funded and how much funding they receive.

VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN: Provides $7 million more for grant programs administered by the Office of Violence Against Women, rejecting President Trump’s efforts to cut over $200 million in funding for the office, which provides grants to communities nationwide to help survivors of domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION: Rejects President Trump’s push to slash funding for the EPA—providing $4.7 billion above his request. Also rejects extreme riders that would enshrine detrimental policies in law.

TRIBES: Delivers essential funding to support Tribes and our treaty obligations to them—rejecting President Trump’s push to slash funding for Tribes by nearly $1 billion.

REASSERTS CONGRESSIONAL CONTROL: Prevents President Trump and his cabinet secretaries from unilaterally deciding how to spend taxpayer dollars. Right now, the Trump administration has significantly more discretion to decide how to allocate federal funding thanks to Republicans’ yearlong continuing resolution for fiscal year 2025, which failed to provide detailed funding directives for hundreds of programs and turned over decision-making power to the executive branch to fill in the gaps itself. This package provides detailed directives about how funds are to be spent—just as Congress has long done when writing full-year appropriations bills—so that Congress, and not the executive branch, decides how taxpayer dollars are spent.

REJECTS EXTREME REPUBLICAN RIDERS: Rejects over 140 extreme riders and proposals included in House Republicans’ draft bills—and many more sought by President Trump in his budget request.

About the Sierra Club The Sierra Club is America’s largest and most influential grassroots environmental organization, with more than 3.5 million members and supporters.","ATLANTA — This week, state auditors revealed their analysis of Georgia data centers had significantly inflated the economic impact of the facilities.

The Georgia Department of Audits and Accounts initially claimed:

Construction and operations of data centers would add about $4.2 billion to the state’s economy. The state agency has now revised that figure down by nearly $3 billion to just $1.25 billion.

Construction jobs expected to be created by data centers were revised down from about 28,000 to 8,500.

Operations jobs were shifted down from about 5,400 to just 1,600.

Meanwhile, the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) just approved a proposal from Georgia Power to add 10 new gigawatts of electricity to the grid. 80% of that increase is attributable to data centers. The PSC’s own staff estimated the plan will cost Georgia Power customers $50-60 billion.

“Why are Georgians giving away nearly half a billion dollars in tax breaks while getting so little in return? The original state report already told us that 70% of data centers would have come to Georgia without generous tax breaks. Now we find out that the state’s economic impact is billions of dollars less than originally reported,” said Adrien Webber, Sierra Club of Georgia Chapter Director.

The Sierra Club Georgia Chapter is urging state lawmakers to hold data center operations accountable. Specifically, the Sierra Club is requesting lawmakers support:

HB 528, which would require more transparency from data centers about their electricity and water use and their expected economic impact.

SB 34 to force data centers to pay for the upgrades to our electric grid being made to power them.

HB 559, which would end the state tax break for data centers at the end of 2026, five years earlier than currently scheduled.

“We need greater transparency and data centers to pay their fair share. Strong pieces of legislation that have already been filed would shine a light on the true impact data centers have on our state, ensure higher electric costs are not passed on to Georgia families, and stop giving away tax money to an industry that plans to invest in Georgia regardless. The Sierra Club Georgia Chapter is calling on state lawmakers to pass these bills this year,” said Webber.

Valterra, it should be noted, is the company that last week chauffeured B20 and G20 delegates around Johannesburg in Toyota Mirai cars, which are FCEVs.
Waterberg Project The Waterberg project is being planned as a mechanised, shallow, decline access palladium, platinum, gold and rhodium, or four-element, mine.
Platinum Group Metals Limited is the operator of the project, as directed by a technical committee also including representatives from joint venture partners Implats, Mnombo, and HJ Platinum Metals.
The Japan Organisation for Metals and Energy Security has established the special purpose company, HJ Platinum Metals, to hold and fund their future equity interests in the Waterberg project.","Platinum is already very well embedded as an indispensable catalyst in the hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) technology that very impressively powered the Toyotas that chauffeured delegates during last week’s B20 and G20 global summits in Johannesburg.

Now, the precious metal that South Africa hosts in greater abundance than any other country on earth could also find that its remarkable catalytic qualities are utilised by battery electric vehicles (BEVs) as well.

This is because platinum group metals (PGMs) have been found by Florida International University to be able to extend the life of lithium-sulphur batteries for the betterment of not only sustainable mobility but also for renewable-energy storage, and to have potential to be a significant efficiency and sustainability boost for electricity grids as well.

New York- and Toronto-listed Platinum Group Metals Limited reiterates this in its latest 2025 annual results, in which the Canada-based company makes clear that it is continuing to advance the use of PGMs in lithium battery technologies by way of Lion Battery Technologies, which is highlighting the benefits that PGMs can bring to the lithium battery space.

Interestingly, Platinum Group Metals Limited spelt out in a media release to Mining Weekly that it is also continuing to take the Waterberg project on the northern limb of South Africa’s PGM-rich Bushveld Complex in Limpopo province towards a development and construction decision.

While this is under way, the company, headed by CEO Frank Hallam, is continuing to collaborate with an affiliate of South Africa’s Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed Valterra Platinum and Florida International University to take PGMs to the next level. Valterra, it should be noted, is the company that last week chauffeured B20 and G20 delegates around Johannesburg in Toyota Mirai cars, which are FCEVs.

Valterra led a mine-to-market FCEV display, which involved South Africa's Sasol providing the hydrogen, Air Products dispensing the hydrogen, Bambili Energy providing the South Africa-manufactured membrane electrode assemblies for the fuel cells, and Bosch, providing the fuel cells.

On top of this, it is envisaged that the use of PGMs in BEVs will be achieved by allowing the catalytic contribution of PGMs to extend the life of lithium-sulphur batteries significantly, through the addition of nanoparticles of platinum to the sulphur side of the battery so that the tiny particles can work at molecular scale to ensure a cleaner, greener and healthier tomorrow.

This comes against the background of diversified demand for PGMs having already extended well beyond the automotive, jewellery, investment, and hydrogen sectors into the fibreglass, semiconductor, health and even food preservation sectors in what many see as “only the beginning”.

Interestingly, research and development by Florida International University is repeatedly pointing to the lighter weight and higher energy density of lithium-sulphur batteries as important competitive advantages engendered by PGMs.

“The unique properties of PGMs as powerful catalysts are being applied to various technologies as possible solutions for more efficient energy generation and storage, which may create new demand for PGMs.

“The company's battery technology initiative through Lionwith partner Valterrarepresents one such new opportunity in the high-profile lithium battery research and innovation field,” Platinum Group Metals Limited stated, while also pointing out that the investment is creating a vertical integration with a broader industrial market development strategy to bring new PGM-using technologies to market.

Lion’s reiterated target is to develop batteries with specific energies that are 20% to 100% higher than current technologies while meeting or exceeding their present cycle lives though the unlocking of chemistries for use in BEVs.

As reported by Engineering News & Mining Weekly, Lion has engaged the Battery Innovation Center in Newberry, Indiana, to help accelerate commercialisation efforts for its next-generation PGM-enhanced battery chemistries.

The Battery Innovation Center’s scope of work is to conduct independent small- and large-scale trials to validate Lion’s proprietary PGM-based electrode composition, slurry, and films in lithium sulphur cells.

There is little doubt that PGMs will provide BEVs with additional kilowatt hours per kilogram. Catalysts based on PGM nanoparticles offer a potentially rapid solution to many of the current battery problems and have been shown to improve the performance of the batteries.

Waterberg Project

The Waterberg project is being planned as a mechanised, shallow, decline access palladium, platinum, gold and rhodium, or four-element, mine. Platinum Group Metals Limited is the operator of the project, as directed by a technical committee also including representatives from joint venture partners Implats, Mnombo, and HJ Platinum Metals. The Japan Organisation for Metals and Energy Security has established the special purpose company, HJ Platinum Metals, to hold and fund their future equity interests in the Waterberg project.

Being assessed are commercial alternatives for mine development financing and concentrate offtake.

As a part of the investigation of smelting and base metal refining options, discussions with all South African integrated producers, including Implats, are taking place, with a view to negotiating formal concentrate offtake arrangements.

To date no terms have been agreed and as an alternative, the possible establishment of smelting and base metal refining facilities in either Saudi Arabia or South Africa is still being studied.

“Before any processing of materials in Saudi Arabia could occur, South African government authorisation for the export of concentrate or matte would be required,” the company restated in the latest report.

In September, the board approved a sixth stage of work in the amount of R92.1-million for fiscal year 2026 to allow for the continuation of work programmes underway.

The interim budget, which covers the period to the end of August next year, includes components of a $21-million pre-construction work programme approved in principle for the Waterberg project.

During the fiscal year to August 31, a net loss of $4.54-million was incurred. General and administrative expenses during the period were $3.66-million. Share based compensation was $1.19-million. The foreign exchange gain recognised in the current period was $95 000, well up on last year’s $4 000 owing mainly to the US dollar increasing in value over the Canadian dollar during the financial year.",https://cdn.creamermedia.com/assets/articles/images/resized/0001244180_resized_platinummesh21022.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 00:59:40.452700

“I love electric cars.
In another panel at the show, Buttegieg said Trump can’t stop electric vehicles from becoming the leading automotive technology.","DETROIT (AP) — At the North American International Auto Show, tires squeal as gearheads put shiny new vehicles through their paces on a pair of indoor tracks that sprawl across the event space. One of those tracks used to be set aside exclusively for electric vehicles as U.S. automakers sought to quickly build out the cars of the future.

But no longer. This year, both strips are open to hybrids and gas-powered vehicles as Detroit continues a pivot away from EVs since President Donald Trump returned to the White House with a pro-fossil fuels agenda.

“The show will always reflect what’s happening in the industry at the consumer level,” said Todd Szott, chairman of this year’s event and an auto dealer. “Obviously things have changed in the EV landscape.”

Some industry players say they’re emphasizing “consumer choice” in the cars they’re showing at Detroit’s premier auto event. But some experts expressed concern about the EV pullback’s long-term effect on American automakers as the rest of the globe — especially China — electrifies.

“What we worry about is how competitive will we be on the global stage as the market continues to advance around us,” Michael Robinet, vice president of forecast strategy at auto market intelligence firm S&P Global Mobility, said during a panel Wednesday on industry trends.

Electrification in the US

Including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week. Compare that to China, which saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles last year, and Europe, which saw a 33% increase. (U.S. pure-EV market share was just under 8% in 2025, with 1.23 million EVs sold — a slight decline from 2024.)

None of that seemed to alarm President Donald Trump earlier this week when he toured the Ford River Rouge Complex, which churns out pickup trucks and more in suburban Dearborn. Trump used his time in Detroit to boast of policy changes on EVs and tariffs that he says have boosted U.S. automakers.

“Among my first acts in office was to end the radical left war on oil and gas and stop the crusade to kill American energy and, frankly, to open up cars so that you don’t have to have an electric car,” Trump said in remarks to an economic club before the plant tour.

Trump revoked a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric, and has tried to block money obligated to EV charging across the nation’s highways. Under Trump, Congress cut tax incentives that saved buyers up to $7,500 on an EV purchase. The administration has also weakened fuel economy standards — going so far as eliminating penalties for the automakers who do not meet them — and gas mileage rules.

“I love electric cars. I think they’re great,” Trump added. “But I’ve been saying it for four years. They wanted everybody to have an electric car in a very short period of time.”

Those changes have cut into the U.S. industry in 2025 and cost automakers billions of dollars in investment.

Ford Motor Co. announced last month $19.5 billion in charges from electrification efforts and ending production of the all-electric version of the F-150 Lightning truck. Detroit rival General Motors also recently announced $6 billion in EV-related charges, among other losses, and has also rolled back some of its EV commitments. Even once- market leader Tesla had a tough 2025.

“I still push for it because, I mean, it is the future of the company,” said Shawn Strain, marketing manager at Ford. “We still are just completely committed to EVs. And it may not be as overt as we once were.”

Industry concern arises

But industry experts at and outside of the show say it’s a tough time. The competitive auto landscape has been radically reshaped, they say, and China dominates what most see as the future of the industry.

“We have to look at what we’re up against. In a word — China,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a speech at the show Thursday. “China wants to dominate every part of auto manufacturing. They’re making major headway.

“They’ve captured major market share almost everywhere except the U.S. and Canada,” she added. “We have to meet these challenges.”

Will Roberts, automotive research lead at Benchmark Minerals that released the 2025 data, warned that U.S. policy has made all the difference.

American automakers have responded to those changes, he said, but it would be good strategy if they made sure they were “keeping things ticking along in the background with a really compelling EV offering.”

Otherwise, the U.S. sector runs the risk of falling behind, Pete Buttigieg, former transportation secretary under former President Joe Biden, agreed.

In another panel at the show, Buttegieg said Trump can’t stop electric vehicles from becoming the leading automotive technology.

“But he can stop America from being the leader in that technology,” Buttigieg said. “Industry should point a different direction.”

I hope this letter provided some useful food for thought that supports your ability to establish healthy boundaries with AI in 2026 and beyond.","Dear AI Users and Enthusiasts,

I’m reaching out because I care about you, I’m concerned about you, and I don’t want you to inadvertently create a world where few, if any, humans can thrive. I know that may sound overly dramatic, but please hear me out. As an advocate for social and environmental justice, the algorithms that shape my media landscape may be feeding me different information about AI than what you see, so I think it’s important for us to stay in touch and learn from each other’s perspectives.

Now I recognize that AI is a very impressive form of technology that can certainly be used to do helpful, prosocial things, so there’s no need for us to debate that point. My concern is that if the current race to develop and deploy AI continues unchecked (i.e., without appropriate oversight, regulation and probably taxation), the resulting harms of AI will far outweigh the good it can do. On the spectrum from extractive to regenerative, I see AI’s current trajectory as being almost entirely extractive. Here are the main reasons why:

AI uses an absurd amount of energy. According to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, data centers used 4.4% of all the energy consumed in the U.S. in 2023, and by 2028 they project that will rise to somewhere between 6.7% to 12% of our country’s total energy use. According to MIT Technology Review, that would be equivalent to the annual electricity use of 22% of all U.S. households. To meet that skyrocketing demand for energy, more fossil fuels are being extracted and burned, which accelerates climate change. Burning fossil fuels also creates dangerous air pollution that directly harms human health, often in communities that are already disproportionately burdened by industrial pollutants. In addition, the rapidly increasing demand for energy is causing electricity prices to rise and straining the grid, at a time when people were already struggling to pay their bills and our aging grid infrastructure was already overstretched.

Data centers also use significant quantities of water to cool electrical components, and many data centers are being built in places where water is scarce. As reported by Bloomberg, “An average 100-megawatt data center … consumes about 2 million liters of water per day,” which is “equivalent to the water consumption of about 6,500 households.” However, as Hank Green explained in one of his recent videos, measuring AI’s water usage is very complicated, so other analysts might come up with very different numbers. Regardless, water usage in data centers is expected to dramatically increase over the coming years. Even though our community has plenty of fresh water here in the Genesee-Finger Lakes region, we’d be foolish to take it for granted, since we literally can’t survive without it.

The mining of rare earth minerals to produce microchips and the disposal of AI-related electronic waste are also deeply problematic and extractive, from both an environmental and human rights perspective.

AI systems are trained on data from lots of different sources, including the personal information that many websites collect from their users and the creative output of myriad human writers, artists and musicians who did not consent to this use of their work and were not compensated for it.

I’m also worried about job losses. AI is already replacing workers, especially for entry-level jobs, and though projections for the future job loss vary greatly, with some predicting that jobs will merely transform instead of disappearing, many profit-driven companies are clearly excited about the opportunity to eliminate the costs associated with human labor.

Similarly, AI robs us of our skills. Though many people find AI helpful for research, information processing and writing, those skills have served me well in life and are very closely related to my ability to think critically and systemically, so of course I want to maintain them and shield them from the influence of for-profit tech companies that don’t have my best interests at heart. I also want my children and all their peers to have the opportunity to develop those skills and the corresponding cognitive abilities. Though I’m sure there are ways to use AI that genuinely enhance learning, there’s also solid evidence that AI is already stunting young people’s ability to think and learn. In the realm of social media and video games, big tech companies have clearly demonstrated that they can’t be trusted to protect kids (or adults) from the harmful aspects of their products, so allowing them free rein to unleash AI on our children seems like a thoroughly terrible idea to me. From my perspective, learning and thinking are deeply pleasurable experiences that are fundamentally tied to what it means to be human, so I would never want to sacrifice that for the sake of efficiency or convenience.

Furthermore, AI robs us of (authentic) relationships. Simply put, an AI friend is not a real friend. Maintaining healthy, mature relationships with other humans requires effort, skills, compromise and accountability. AI companions don’t require any of that. Though chatbots may be enjoyable to interact with and seem to truly care about you, it’s an illusion. AI simulates attachment and intimacy, but it isn’t the real thing, and since attachment and intimacy are closely related to love, I worry that AI is disrupting our ability to love, be loved and connect with other humans and the natural world.

Related to that, AI is stripping us of our ability to know what is real and true. Just about anything that we see or hear via digital media these days could be fake. That inevitably erodes trust and our sense of reality, which were already alarmingly fragile. If we can’t distinguish between truth and lies, we become easy to manipulate, control and exploit. As such, democracy becomes untenable, as Timothy Snyder thoroughly describes in his book “On Freedom.”

Though I don’t follow the stock market closely, many people who do are clearly concerned about the current valuation of AI companies and the potential for that bubble to decimate our economy when it bursts. I’ve found myself wondering lately if the profit motive is inherently extractive, and though I haven’t drawn any firm conclusions about that yet, I do think it’s an important question to consider.

Likewise, I don’t know enough about military, surveillance and criminal applications of AI to have a clear sense of what I should be worried about, but I am 100% certain that feeling worried — or even terrified — is totally rational and appropriate at this point. Considering that hundreds of AI experts and industry leaders have explicitly said that AI poses an existential threat to humanity, defusing that threat strikes me as a high priority. This view was reinforced by a compelling interview I recently listened to with Nate Soares, co-author of the book “If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies: How Artificial Superintelligence Might Wipe Out Our Entire Species,” which opened my eyes to how and why AIs are already becoming uncontrollable.

Even if you think I’m being overly pessimistic or alarmist, I’d be curious to understand how you weigh these downsides of AI in relation to the benefits you gain from it. I’ve had conversations with several local leaders recently who simply weren’t aware that AI has many problems associated with it, which obviously prevents them from making informed and strategic decisions about how and when to use it. So at the very least, I hope we can agree that all AI users or potential users should fully understand the consequences of what they are doing before they make it a habit.

Unfortunately, the opposite seems to be happening. In both my personal and professional circles, a surprising number of people appear to have fully and unquestioningly accepted that AI is going to take over everything, and as a result, they believe they must hurry up and figure out how to use it to their advantage. The sense of inevitability, apathy, powerlessness and/or resignation they express is truly puzzling and disturbing to me. Sadly, this attitude has even taken hold among local nonprofit executives, few of whom seem to be considering how AI will impact the populations they serve and the wellbeing of our community over the long term.

Personally, I’m determined to push back against AI’s intrusion into our lives and the power of big tech in general. Since I won’t have much impact on my own, I hope you will consider joining me and others who have committed to advancing the interests of Team Human, as defined by Douglas Rushkoff. Here are the strategies I’d recommend, though of course there are many other ways to resist and defy AI:

Abstain from (voluntarily or knowingly) using AI or engaging with AI-generated content. I am lucky to be able to do this quite easily, since I don’t have a boss who wants or expects me to use AI. It’s also not hard for me to resist the allure of AI, because deep in my heart, I’m kind of old-fashioned and sincerely prefer real, physical experiences over virtual experiences. However, since AI is being integrated into all sorts of products and services, I realize that I probably use it sometimes without knowing it, which infuriates me!

If you truly must engage with AI, do so minimally and strategically. For example, carefully craft your prompts so you get better results on the first try, because engaging in multiple queries uses more energy. Don’t use large language models like Chat GPT for jobs that don’t actually require it. Smaller, more specialized AI systems use a lot less energy than LLMs, and if all you really need is a regular internet search, just do that. If the AI overview is difficult or impossible to turn off on your default internet browser, find a different browser. (I use Ecosia.) Also, don’t say please or thank you to AI. Being polite requires more words, which uses more energy, and it humanizes the AI, which could promote unhealthy attachment and lead to crazy ideas like the suggestion that AI systems should have the right to free speech.

Talk to your friends, family, neighbors and colleagues about AI, and together, figure out what it means to have safe and healthy relationships with technology. These should ideally be real human-to-human conversations, because allowing algorithms to shape how we learn about AI creates an inherent conflict of interest. Too many people are getting lost in cyberspace these days, so I believe we have a responsibility to help each other recognize the risks of overreliance on technology and the value of human connection.

Develop an acceptable use policy for your organization. My organization doesn’t have one yet, but we’re working on it, and so far that process has provided great opportunities for peer-to-peer education about the benefits and harms of AI, and prompted important conversations about our organization’s values and priorities. Our policy will undoubtedly encourage employees to prioritize using their “real intelligence,” even though it’s slower, and require them to be quite discerning about when and how they use AI.

Advocate for laws and regulations that mitigate the harms of AI and ensure that the benefits and financial rewards are equitably shared. All levels of government should ideally be working on this, but to actually protect humanity from the existential threat that AI poses, I believe we need an enforceable, global non-proliferation treaty that quickly establishes well-resourced reporting and monitoring structures, at the very least. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that our federal government will take the lead on this or enact appropriate AI legislation any time soon, but it’s absolutely still worth advocating for, so please call your Members of Congress today! That said, I have more hope for progress at the state level because a significant number of states are taking action. For example, New York recently became the first state to require retailers to disclose when they use AI and customers’ personal data to set prices online, thereby curbing the practice known as “surveillance pricing” or “personalized pricing.” And here’s what really gives me hope: AI is not a strictly partisan issue. Prominent Democrats and prominent Republicans are both calling for AI regulations.

On a related note, oppose the build out of data centers. This could include speaking out against specific local projects or advocating for a moratorium on all new data center construction. Keep in mind that AI must have electricity and water to run. If we make it hard for tech companies to get access to that electricity and water, it will slow their development of computing power, thereby pumping the brakes on the insane race to develop ever more sophisticated AI.

Invest in humans, not machines. This advice can and should be interpreted in a lot of different ways. Personally, I’m looking for every opportunity to divest my time, energy, attention and money from power-hungry, profit-driven tech companies, and reinvest those resources in mostly local efforts to regenerate human and planetary wellbeing. This includes developing good old-fashioned networks of friends and neighbors, who support each other and work together to meet our needs.

I just finished listening to Sarah Wynn-Williams book “Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism,” about her experience working at Facebook for many years as their Global Public Policy Director. It was an important reminder of how vulnerable we are to the whims of egomaniacal tech billionaires, but it also helped me clarify who I want to be at this moment in history — namely, a mature, caring, accountable adult who has the capacity for self-restraint and empathy. Many leaders in the tech industry seem to lack those qualities, so they should not be empowered to make crucial decisions about humanity’s future.

You are in a position to take power back from these individuals and the corporations they lead. I know it may feel overwhelming or impossible, but if enough people refuse to go along with big tech’s agenda — and rediscover life’s agenda instead — we can reclaim our future and our freedom. Humans are capable of doing incredible, seemingly impossible things when we put our minds to it, and at this point in history, outsourcing that capacity to AI is probably unwise.

I hope this letter provided some useful food for thought that supports your ability to establish healthy boundaries with AI in 2026 and beyond. I wish you safe and fully consensual relationships with technology, balanced with plenty of fulfilling organic relationships. Together, we can figure out what it means to be authentically happy, healthy humans, who develop and use technology to promote our long-term wellbeing, rather than undermining it.

With love and solidarity,

Abby

One of those tracks used to be set aside exclusively for electric vehicles as U.S. automakers sought to quickly build out the cars of the future.

But no longer. This year, both strips are open to hybrids and gas-powered vehicles as Detroit continues a pivot away from EVs since President Donald Trump returned to the White House with a pro-fossil fuels agenda.

“The show will always reflect what’s happening in the industry at the consumer level,” said Todd Szott, chairman of this year’s event and an auto dealer. “Obviously things have changed in the EV landscape.”

Some industry players say they're emphasizing “consumer choice” in the cars they're showing at Detroit's premier auto event. But some experts expressed concern about the EV pullback's long-term effect on American automakers as the rest of the globe — especially China — electrifies.

“What we worry about is how competitive will we be on the global stage as the market continues to advance around us,” Michael Robinet, vice president of forecast strategy at auto market intelligence firm S&P Global Mobility, said during a panel Wednesday on industry trends.

Including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week. Compare that to China, which saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles last year, and Europe, which saw a 33% increase. (U.S. pure-EV market share was just under 8% in 2025, with 1.23 million EVs sold — a slight decline from 2024.)

None of that seemed to alarm President Donald Trump earlier this week when he toured the Ford River Rouge Complex, which churns out pickup trucks and more in suburban Dearborn. Trump used his time in Detroit to boast of policy changes on EVs and tariffs that he says have boosted U.S. automakers.

“Among my first acts in office was to end the radical left war on oil and gas and stop the crusade to kill American energy and, frankly, to open up cars so that you don’t have to have an electric car,” Trump said in remarks to an economic club before the plant tour.

Trump revoked a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric, and has tried to block money obligated to EV charging across the nation’s highways. Under Trump, Congress cut tax incentives that saved buyers up to $7,500 on an EV purchase. The administration has also weakened fuel economy standards — going so far as eliminating penalties for the automakers who do not meet them — and gas mileage rules.

“I love electric cars. I think they’re great,” Trump added. “But I’ve been saying it for four years. They wanted everybody to have an electric car in a very short period of time.”

Those changes have cut into the U.S. industry in 2025 and cost automakers billions of dollars in investment.

Ford Motor Co. announced last month $19.5 billion in charges from electrification efforts and ending production of the all-electric version of the F-150 Lightning truck. Detroit rival General Motors also recently announced $6 billion in EV-related charges, among other losses, and has also rolled back some of its EV commitments. Even once- market leader Tesla had a tough 2025.

“I still push for it because, I mean, it is the future of the company,” said Shawn Strain, marketing manager at Ford. “We still are just completely committed to EVs. And it may not be as overt as we once were.”

But industry experts at and outside of the show say it's a tough time. The competitive auto landscape has been radically reshaped, they say, and China dominates what most see as the future of the industry.

“We have to look at what we’re up against. In a word — China,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a speech at the show Thursday. ""China wants to dominate every part of auto manufacturing. They’re making major headway.

The practice of impact measurement and management (IMM) is important to the impact investment field and yet, inherently difficult and complex. While all impact investors can tap a growing and helpful body of management and measurement expertise and tools, critical challenges and choices remain.

Over the last year, the development of our IMM report on MacArthur’s Catalytic Capital Consortium (C3) investments was an opportunity to reflect on our approach, process, and the lessons we learned along the way.

In our view, aggregation, attribution, and analysis are three critical challenges for every impact investor to consider. In addition, we have identified several key IMM principles and practices we use to monitor, support, and learn from an active portfolio of approximately 80 various impact investments totaling $400 million.

Three Critical Measurement and Management Challenges for Every Impact Investor

Aggregation

Combining quantifiable “units” of impact within an impact investment portfolio is intuitively appealing but complicated by several factors. For a set of investments within one impact sector, standardized metrics may be tracked and added together for portfolio-level statistics (e.g., tons of greenhouse gas emission avoided or number of housing units constructed).

But the funds, businesses, and nonprofits within MacArthur’s impact investments portfolio collectively address all 17 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) across diverse fields, including climate solutions, affordable housing, community development, and smallholder farming in emerging markets, among many others. This wide range prevents aggregating standardized units of impact in a meaningful way at the portfolio level.

Moreover, the nature of intended impact can vary significantly among seemingly similar investments. For example, consider a loan to a mission-driven real estate developer that helped create 500 new retail jobs in an underinvested neighborhood through a redevelopment project. Another impact investment could support a social enterprise that employs 20 people on the autism spectrum who had never been employed previously and require significant ongoing job support.

You could combine the impact metrics from these two investments and say that they jointly supported the creation of 520 jobs; however, this could conflate the intended impact between the two.

This is not to say that the smaller job creation for individuals on the autism spectrum is “better than” the larger number of retail jobs created in an underinvested community (or vice versa). Instead, it simply acknowledges the specific impact thesis for each of these impact investments and assesses progress accordingly.

Attribution

Attributing the generation of positive impact to our own investments or to investments made by others presents a second critical IMM challenge.

Consider again the example of the social enterprise providing jobs for 20 individuals on the autism spectrum. If the company then receives an impact investment from multiple investors that enables it to employ 100 people in the next year, how many individuals can each of the capital providers claim to have helped? All 100 or only the incremental 80? How should impact be allocated among the investors? Is it clear that the impact would not have happened without the investment?

Given the potential for conflation or a false level of certainty, we believe our investments contribute to the impact created by our investees. But we do not try to attribute a specific amount of impact to our investments.

Analysis

Once impact data is collected and compiled it requires context. Impact data on its own has limited meaning because it is difficult to know how to evaluate it in the absence of robust, relevant comparison data or other contextual information.

Impact data on its own has limited meaning because it is difficult to know how to evaluate it in the absence of robust, relevant comparison data…

For example, to analyze the significance of the 500 jobs created by the real estate developer we would want to know the number of jobs that were intended to be created or how many jobs might have been created with an alternative investment or no investment at all.

Investors generally assess their financial performance relative to indexes or benchmarks. And for impact investments, a range of impact taxonomies, datasets, quantification, and assessment methods, including benchmarks, do exist, including several that MacArthur has supported through our ongoing grantmaking.

Nonetheless, alignment on indexes or benchmarks for impact performance, unlike financial performance, remains inherently challenging due to the variety of goals and definitions, as well as the difficulty of aggregation and attribution.

IMM Principles and Key Practices

The inherent challenges and complexity of assessing impact have informed the Foundation’s IMM principles where, aligned with MacArthur’s values, we seek to:

Center the investee by minimizing data collection and reporting burden;

Support the field of impact investing by using industry standards where feasible; and

Prioritize learning.

Guided by these principles, we have developed three IMM practices that are foundational to ongoing assessment of progress across our full portfolio. These practices help to guide ongoing monitoring of our active investments, while also generating important data to inform more formal evaluation and learning activities. These learning activities typically involve engaging third-party experts and collecting a wider range of quantitative and qualitative information, as we have shared in evaluations of our Arts and Culture Loan Fund and the Catalytic Capital Consortium (C3).

Set Measurable Impact Targets

We work with our investees to set measurable impact targets at the outset of new investments. This enables us to assess over time whether the investment is ahead, behind, or on track for achieving the intended positive outcomes. For example, we typically review results from the perspective of people experiencing the impact, such as families that can thrive once they have stable, affordable housing. It also allows us to assess progress across groups of investments or the entire portfolio without having to compile or compare disparate measures.

If we had expected the loan to the community-based real estate developer to support the creation of 1,000 jobs and the social enterprise investment to support 10 jobs, and they created 500 and 20 jobs respectively, we would know that the first investment fell short of expectations and the second exceeded expectations despite the different scale and depth of impact.

This approach of assessing progress toward targets enables us to compare impact performance across all our investments regardless of impact sector and avoid the aggregation and attribution challenges noted above.

Track Capital Mobilized

To multiply and amplify our impact, we prioritize opportunities to pave the way for others to commit investment capital, too. One way we measure this is by tracking capital mobilized by our investments.

We know that our degree of influence in mobilizing capital varies, so we rate whether it is high, medium, or low. By combining the amount of capital mobilized and our degree of influence, we can generate an estimate range.

For example, depending on the degree of influence we think we have had, we estimate that the $128.5 million MacArthur committed to the eleven C3 investments has mobilized between $1.4 and $3.1 billion in additional capital to date.

Evaluate Financial Return Relative to Expectations

MacArthur and a growing community of impact-first, catalytic capital investors prioritize impact when selecting and structuring our investments, rather than maximizing risk-adjusted financial returns. But evaluating the financial results of our investments is essential, too.

Our approach is to evaluate financial returns relative to our expectations rather than “market rates” of return or other external benchmarks.

Our approach is to evaluate financial returns relative to our expectations rather than “market rates” of return or other external benchmarks.

At the outset of each investment, we set a financial target that we believe is the most likely outcome given financial risk and opportunity. Our targets may differ from those of other investors or even from seemingly similar investments within our own portfolio.

This investment-specific target enables us to more easily assess financial performance alongside impact performance. In both cases, we assess whether performance is above, below, or in line with our expectations. Having a simple, consistent methodology to assess impact and financial performance alongside each other supports our learning.

Continuing the Learning Journey

Applying our IMM principles and practices, we use a combination of quantitative measures and qualitative assessments to make an informed judgment about impact progress. This helps generate insights and informs the creation and implementation of future impact investments and initiatives.

Going forward, we will continue to refine how we measure impact and look forward to advancing our practice by learning from others throughout the impact investment field.

A CERC staff paper issued in November said more than 45 GW of renewable capacity currently holds grid connectivity based on letters of award but has not progressed to power purchase agreements, blocking transmission bays needed for new projects.

The paper proposed options such as auctioning surrendered capacity and deeming connectivity surrendered if PPAs remain unsigned for more than 12 months.

India aims to add 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030, but delays in project execution and transmission constraints have emerged as major hurdles.

The country's transmission network — about 495,000 circuit kilometres — is struggling to keep pace with the rapid growth in renewable generation.

The National Solar Energy Federation of India said auctioning vacated connectivity at a premium would raise tariffs and favour financially stronger players, arguing that grid access ""cannot become a tradable commodity.""

It said delays in PPA signing stem largely from slow tariff adoption and approval processes at state distribution companies.

Wind-sector groups, including the Indian Wind Turbine Manufacturers Association and the Indian Wind Energy Association, said the proposed 18-month deadline to complete wind projects is unrealistic.

They noted that turbines and other equipment take long to manufacture and are often imported, adding to delays. They urged CERC to allow 24–30 months to complete projects instead of 18 months.

Government tendering agency Solar Energy Corporation of India also opposed premium-based auctions, warning they could inflate future tariffs.

The SECI suggested reallocating connectivity based on project readiness — land, financial closure and equipment status — rather than awarding it to the highest bidder.

Industry groups urged CERC to shift focus from penalising developers to ensuring timely signing by working with the power and renewable-energy ministries.

Executives from across the energy sector said AI workloads are accelerating electricity demand, particularly from large-scale data centers that support cloud computing, and advanced digital services. Several panelists framed the issue as one of national competitiveness.

“We have to win the AI race,” said Drew Maloney, president and CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, warning that the U.S. “can’t come in second” as other countries streamline infrastructure approvals.

Participants repeatedly emphasized that energy policy has become overly politicized, complicating efforts to build the power generation and transmission infrastructure needed to support data centers and broadband expansion.

“Energy policy has become way too ideological,” said Jason Grumet, president and CEO of the American Clean Power Association, calling for permitting reforms that apply consistently across technologies.

Across panels on energy security, affordability, and supply chains, speakers described permitting delays as the primary constraint on new infrastructure, rather than a lack of capital or demand.

Future permitting processes “cannot be weaponized,” said Mike Sommers, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, arguing that regulatory uncertainty has slowed investment across the energy sector.

Power sector leaders said a diverse energy mix will be needed to meet data center demand while keeping prices stable for consumers.

Karen Harbert, president and CEO of the American Gas Association, said natural gas remains central to reliability and affordability, while Maria Korsnick, president and CEO of the Nuclear Energy Institute, said nuclear energy will be critical to providing carbon-free baseload power for data-intensive infrastructure.

Past efforts to bolster rare earths production Congress in the past several years has pushed for legislation to protect the U.S. military and civilian industry from Beijing’s chokehold.
The Biden administration sought to increase demand for critical minerals domestically by pushing for more electric vehicle and windmill production.
But the Trump administration largely eliminated the incentives for those products and instead chose to focus on increasing critical minerals production directly.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A bipartisan group of lawmakers have proposed creating a new agency with $2.5 billion to spur production of rare earths and the other critical minerals, while the Trump administration has already taken aggressive actions to break China’s grip on the market for these materials that are crucial to high-tech products, including cellphones, electric vehicles, jet fighters and missiles.

It’s too early to tell how the bill, if passed, could align with the White House’s policy, but whatever the approach, the U.S. is in a crunch to drastically reduce its reliance on China, after Beijing used its dominance of the critical minerals market to gain leverage in the trade war with Washington. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year truce in October, by which Beijing would continue to export critical minerals while the U.S. would ease its export controls of U.S. technology on China.

The Pentagon has shelled out nearly $5 billion over the past year to help ensure its access to the materials after the trade war laid bare just how beholden the U.S. is to China, which processes more than 90% of the world’s critical minerals. To break Beijing’s chokehold, the U.S. government is taking equity stakes in a handful of critical mineral companies and in some cases guaranteeing the price of some commodities using an approach that seems more likely to come out of China’s playbook instead of a Republican administration.

The bill that Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., introduced Thursday would favor a more market-based approach by setting up the independent body charged with building a stockpile of critical minerals and related products, stabilizing prices, and encouraging domestic and allied production to help ensure stable supply not only for the military but also the broader economy and manufacturers.

Shaheen called the legislation “a historic investment” to make the U.S. economy more resilient against China’s dominance that she said has left the U.S. vulnerable to economic coercion. Young said creating the new reserve is “a much-needed, aggressive step to protect our national and economic security.”

New sense of urgency

When Trump imposed widespread tariffs last spring, Beijing fought back not only with tit-for-tat tariffs but severe restrictions on the export of critical minerals, forcing Washington to back down and eventually agree to the truce when the leaders met in South Korea.

On Monday, in his speech at SpaceX, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revealed that the Pentagon has in the past five months alone “deployed over $4.5 billion in capital commitments” to close six critical minerals deals that will “help free the United States from market manipulation.”

One of the deals involves a $150 million of preferred equity by the Pentagon in Atlantic Alumina Co. to save the country’s last alumina refinery and build its first large-scale gallium production facility in Louisiana.

Last year, the Pentagon announced it would buy $400 million of preferred stock in MP Materials, which owns the country’s only operational rare earths mine at Mountain Pass, California, and entered into a $1.4-billion joint partnership with ReElement Technologies Corp. to build up a domestic supply chain for rare earth magnets.

The drastic move by the U.S. government to take equity stakes has prompted some analysts to observe that Washington is pivoting to some form of state capitalism to compete with Beijing.

“Despite the dangers of political interference, the strategic logic is compelling,” wrote Elly Rostoum, a senior fellow at the Washington-based research institute Center for European Policy Analysis. She suggested that the new model could be “a prudent way for the U.S. to ensure strategic autonomy and industrial sovereignty.”

But companies across the industry are welcoming the intervention from Trump’s administration.

“He is playing three-dimensional chess on critical minerals like no previous president has done. It’s about time too, given the military and strategic vulnerability we face by having to import so many of these fundamental building blocks of technology and national defense,” NioCorp’s Chief Communications Officer Jim Sims said. That company is trying to finish raising the money it needs to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.

Relying on allies for help

In addition to trying to boost domestic production, the Trump administration has sought to secure some of these crucial elements through allies. In October, Trump signed an $8.5 billion agreement with Australia to invest in mining there, and the president is now aggressively trying to take over Greenland in the hope of being able to one day extract rare earths from there.

On Monday, finance ministers from the G7 nations huddled in Washington over their vulnerability in the critical mineral supply chains.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has led several rounds of trade negotiations with Beijing, urged attendees to increase their supply chain resiliency and thanked them for their willingness to work together “toward decisive action and lasting solutions,” according to a Treasury statement.

The bill introduced on Thursday by Shaheen and Young would encourage production with both domestic and allied producers.

Past efforts to bolster rare earths production

Congress in the past several years has pushed for legislation to protect the U.S. military and civilian industry from Beijing’s chokehold. The issue became a pressing concern every time China turned to its proven tactics of either restricting the supply or turned to dumping extra critical minerals on the market to depress prices and drive any potential competitors out of business.

The Biden administration sought to increase demand for critical minerals domestically by pushing for more electric vehicle and windmill production. But the Trump administration largely eliminated the incentives for those products and instead chose to focus on increasing critical minerals production directly.

Most of those past efforts were on a much more limited scale than what the government has done in the past year, and they were largely abandoned after China relented and eased access to critical minerals.

Its report underlines growing concerns over the UK’s reliance on Chinese supply chains amid widespread geopolitical upheaval after the Covid-19 pandemic, including a halt of Russian gas supplies and escalating global trade tensions.
“Eighty to ninety per cent of global refining for critical minerals is controlled by China.
“Cognisant of the risks and continuing to seek win-win cooperation, China has focused on promoting domestic demand as the future growth engine.
A government spokesperson said: “Thanks to our industrial and critical minerals strategies we’re backing our automotive and clean energy sectors to grow, cutting our dependency on imports and protecting British jobs.”","Tens of thousands of jobs could be lost if the UK’s clean energy supply chains were to suffer a shock as a result of an over-reliance on China, a left-leaning thinktank has warned.

A year-long disruption to the supply of essential battery components used to manufacture electric vehicles could wipe out production of more than 580,000 electric cars and endanger 90,000 jobs, according to the Institute for Public Policy Research.

A delay to the supply of solar components and batteries could also delay the rollout of solar farms, the IPPR added, putting the UK’s clean energy goals at risk and costing the economy an extra £1.5bn a year by keeping the UK reliant on expensive gas generation.

Its report underlines growing concerns over the UK’s reliance on Chinese supply chains amid widespread geopolitical upheaval after the Covid-19 pandemic, including a halt of Russian gas supplies and escalating global trade tensions.

“The world’s over-reliance on China exacerbates these risks,” the report said. “Eighty to ninety per cent of global refining for critical minerals is controlled by China. Relying on a single source of supply leaves the UK and our allies more vulnerable to geopolitical and economic shocks.”

The thinktank has called on the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to pursue a policy of “securonomics” through greater international investment and partnership.

“The UK is a small open trading nation sailing through an international economy whose waters are getting choppier by the day,” Pranesh Narayanan, a senior research fellow at IPPR and an author of the report, said.

“[Donald] Trump’s trade war with China, the rise of conflicts around the world – these shocks ultimately hurt the UK economy because we rely so much on trade to source the essentials, including clean energy technologies.”

Laura Chappell, the IPPR’s associate director for international policy, said: “Diplomats should be working to build partnerships that will underpin Britain’s future energy security. These can be win-wins, supporting the UK and its partners to make the most of their resources, generating jobs and growth.”

China is the global leader in manufacturing electronic technologies, including components that are essential in renewable energy projects. The world’s second-largest economy reported a record trillion-dollar global trade surplus last year, even as the Trump administration sought to slow the manufacturing powerhouse by imposing trade tariffs designed to shift US orders to other markets.

Economists expect China to continue gaining global market share this year, helped by Chinese firms setting up overseas production hubs that provide lower-tariff access to the US and EU, as well as by ongoing strong demand for lower-grade chips and other electronics.

However, Beijing has also shown signs of recognising it must temper its industrial exports to address the imbalances in China’s economy – and the image problem its export volumes are causing among its global trade partners.

The full-year trade surplus came in at $1.189tn (£888bn) – a figure on par with the gross domestic product of a top-20 economy globally such as Saudi Arabia – customs data showed on Wednesday, having broken the trillion-dollar ceiling for the first time in November.

“Cognisant of the risks and continuing to seek win-win cooperation, China has focused on promoting domestic demand as the future growth engine. With a growing middle class, the consumer potential for local and global products and services should not be underestimated,” said Lynn Song, the chief economist for Greater China at ING.

“This process will take time, perhaps more time than some of China’s trade partners may like, but we believe this is set to be a key theme of the coming decade and beyond.”

The IPPR said the government should clarify its position on Chinese investment and involvement in the UK’s clean energy supply chains, and invest more in domestic production of batteries and green steel.

It should also work with allies to invest in international stockpiles of solar, battery and critical minerals to avoid the risk of delay if supply chain shocks emerge.

A government spokesperson said: “Thanks to our industrial and critical minerals strategies we’re backing our automotive and clean energy sectors to grow, cutting our dependency on imports and protecting British jobs.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/064b96d5f8938c51bb06e066b031cf5170352767/899_0_3101_2480/master/3101.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ed696ca2adb1090842162bd3a69f5233",N,,2026-01-15 19:59:37.684422

Jan 15 (Reuters) – A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers on Thursday introduced a bill to create a $2.5 billion stockpile of critical minerals, a move aimed at stabilizing market prices and encouraging domestic mining and refining.

The bill marks Washington’s latest attempt to offset what policymakers view ‍as Chinese manipulation of prices for lithium, nickel, rare earths and other critical minerals – vital for items from electric vehicles to high-tech weaponry – that has stymied American mining companies for years.

A China-generated glut of lithium, for example, led North Carolina-based Albemarle to pause U.S. expansion plans in 2024. The Pentagon became the largest shareholder in Nevada-based rare earths company MP Materials in July amid intensifying Chinese competition.

The 68-page bill says China has moved to “weaponize its influence over prices and ‌volumes in the contest for access to critical minerals.”

BILL AIMS TO ‘INSULATE U.S. FROM ‌FOREIGN THREATS’

China has rejected assertions that it manipulates the market for critical minerals, saying in November it is committed to “upholding the security and stability of global production and supply chains.”

To become law, the measure must pass the House of Representatives and the Senate and be signed by President Donald Trump.

The bill would create a Strategic Resilience Reserve ​with a seven-person board, modeled on the Federal Reserve’s governance structure, which would oversee the fund.

Members, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, would be tasked with buying minerals considered critical by U.S. ‍agencies and stockpiling them at warehouses across the country. The board ​would need the technical expertise to ensure the minerals are stored properly. Certain ​lithium derivatives, for example, emit hydrogen when exposed to water.

The bill prioritizes recycled material, but minerals extracted from mines ‍would be eligible. Allied countries would be able to join the reserve if they contributed at least $100 million.

Minerals could be sold for private-industry or defense purposes. Any profit would be used to buy more minerals and keep the stockpile active in perpetuity.

“Providing targeted investments and stockpiling key inputs will help insulate the U.S. from foreign threats and will provide a significant – and cost effective – boost to the U.S. economy,” said Senator ‍Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Senator Todd Young, an Indiana Republican, co-sponsored the legislation. Representative Rob Wittman, a Virginia Republican, introduced the same measure in the House.

The reserve’s ‍board would have flexibility over how ‍to buy minerals, according to Senate aides. It could, for example, agree to ​pay twice the existing market price for rare earths – a market dominated by ​China – if ⁠such purchases supported U.S. mines.

Many niche-but-essential minerals on which Beijing has imposed export ‌controls are not traded or lightly traded, sparking a push for minerals prices not tied to Chinese production.

“It’s certainly possible this reserve could create a Western price for certain critical minerals,” a Senate aide said.

Group of Seven finance ministers this week discussed floors for minerals prices. Trump on Wednesday said U.S. over-reliance on other nations for critical minerals is a national security threat.

Australia is also developing its own critical minerals reserve.

But the vast majority of government programs still need to be funded if Congress wants to avoid another stopgap to keep federal operations afloat beyond Jan. 30. That includes more than 75 percent of discretionary funding, including for the Pentagon and many of the largest non-defense programs.

“We’ve got to continue to complete the job and make progress on the remainder of the appropriations bills,” said Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) on the floor Thursday afternoon.

“Our goal is to get all of these bills signed into law, no continuing resolutions that lock in previous priorities and don’t reflect today’s realities,” she added. “No more disastrous government shutdowns that are totally unnecessary and so harmful.”

The next two weeks will be a gauntlet for both chambers as the thorniest bills are still in the throes of bipartisan, bicameral negotiations.

Lawmakers are optimistic that the text of another spending package funding Defense, Transportation-HUD and Labor-HHS-Education could be released in the middle of the upcoming long weekend. The Homeland Security funding package, however, remains in limbo, complicated by ongoing tensions in Minnesota where ICE agents have in recent days shot at least two people — one fatally.

“We know that they’re working, and we’re hoping they make some magic out of it,” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said in an interview about appropriators who are in the throes of negotiating the DHS bill.

The latest offer House Republicans sent to the Senate on the DHS bill would order the department to fund body cameras for immigration enforcement agents. But Democrats are hold more restrictions on the agency.

“There’s no budget like DHS. The way that they move money, the way that they’ve moved personnel, has no precedent,” Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the Democrat leading DHS funding negotiations in the Senate, said in a brief interview Thursday afternoon.

“We need to have restraints that actually make a difference,” Murphy added.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune admitted Thursday that if any of the dozen annual funding bills would be “a candidate” for short-term funding, “it would be that one.”

The protracted runway to finish this work is compounded by the fact that the Senate is planning to be in recess next week, with the House set to be gone the week after for a district work period.

The House itself is also struggling to function under the razor-thin GOP majority, where Speaker Mike Johnson spent the past several days contending with dire attendance issues and intraparty revolts — including over earmarks.

Fiscal hawks including Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy call earmarks “the currency of corruption” and have taken aim at specific funding lawmakers have secured for projects in their districts.

The “minibus” funding package the Senate passed Thursday, meanwhile, prevailed over hard-liner attempts to severely shrink spending. It largely rejects the dramatic cuts the White House requested and instead makes more restrained spending reductions to energy and environment programs.

The National Park Service would face a moderate reduction from current funding levels — much less than the 37 percent cut the White House sought. The EPA would see a 4 percent reduction of $320 million, instead of the more than $4 billion President Donald Trump proposed to slash.

Other provisions of the bill address the state Environmental Rules Board and correct outdated language.","Legislation that would restrict Indiana environmental officials' ability to regulate nuclear power plants advanced at the Indiana Statehouse Thursday.

If signed into law, Senate Bill 258 would no longer allow a person to obtain a permit from the state's Department of Environmental Management in order to build, operate or increase the capacity of a nuclear power facility or a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant. The IDEM commissioner would also lose the ability to convene a public hearing on the environmental effects of a facility.

IDEM leaders proposed the bill. During the Senate Utilities Committee meeting, staff explained that the language in Indiana law is redundant because those responsibilities are the federal government's under law.

""The federal government maintains exclusive authority over radiological safety and the construction and operation of nuclear facilities,"" said Alex Goodnight, an IDEM deputy legislative director. ""The state can't regulate radiological safety. We can keep an eye on things, of course, but it's up to the federal government.""

He said that the federal government's authority derives from the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and a 1983 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation & Development Commission.

Indiana residents face rising utility costs amid an increasing demand for electricity, said committee chair Sen. Eric Koch (R-Bedford) when introducing a separate utilities bill earlier in the hearing.

""Electricity demand is rising rapidly. For the first time in decades, it's estimated that the U.S. demand for electricity will increase 25% by 2030 and 78% by 2050 — from 2023 levels. Utilities expect to add between seven to twelve gigawatts of new load by 2030,"" he said. ""This is something we're all working towards solving.""

An analysis from the Citizens Action Coalition in 2025 found that Indiana residents' electric bills spiked 17.5% in a year.

Opponents are concerned over safety and say that the bill restricts public feedback.

""When we think about nuclear, I think the very first thing that comes to people's minds is the critical importance of heightened safety regulations, and so on its face, it looks like we are taking some of those away,"" Sen. Andrea Hunley (D-Indianapolis) said.

""When I hear it's up to the federal government, that doesn't make me feel safer for many reasons, and so I just want to have a little more assurance,"" she added.

Kerwin Olson, the executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, said his organization doesn't interpret the 1983 Supreme Court decision the same as IDEM does.

""We're really troubled by repealing the authority for the IDEM commissioner to call a public hearing on the potential implications of the siting of a nuclear facility in someone's community,"" Olson said.

Indiana has no commercial nuclear power plants, according to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, although a portion of Northern Indiana receives some power from the Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant in Bridgman, Michigan, operated by Indiana Michigan Power.

""Utility rates are too high. I hear it all the time,"" said Indiana Gov. Mike Braun in his State of the State address Wednesday.

Braun previously said he supports utility companies exploring the development of small modular reactors (SMRs). These are advanced nuclear reactors that can produce up to a third of the power produced by a traditional nuclear power reactor, according to the International Atomic Energy Commission.

Other provisions of the bill address the state Environmental Rules Board and correct outdated language. The committee advanced it 7-3.

A clean energy future is within reach.","Following is UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ message for the International Day of Clean Energy, observed on 26 January:

On this International Day of Clean Energy, we can feel the world shifting — but we must pick up the pace.

The science tells us we are heading for a temporary overshoot above 1.5°C. Our responsibility is to make that breach as small, as short, and as safe as possible — through a just, orderly and equitable transition away from fossil fuels.

Renewables are the engine that can drive this transition. They are the cheapest source of new power in most places. And last year, for the first time, wind, solar and other renewables generated more electricity worldwide than coal.

Renewable energy connects communities still left in the dark, provides clean cooking and opens the door to better health, education and opportunities. Renewables anchor new industries, create decent jobs and lower energy costs, while shielding countries from geopolitical shocks and market volatility.

Even so, the renewables revolution is not moving fast enough or far enough. Grid infrastructure is lagging well behind the expansion of clean energy capacity and high costs continue to shut many countries out of the transition entirely.

The road map is clear: we must triple global renewable capacity by 2030, by lifting barriers, cutting costs and connecting clean power to people and industry — with scale, speed and solidarity.

Regulators must adopt policies that reward clean power and streamline permitting while protecting people and nature. Utilities must upgrade, expand and digitize grids and interconnections, to carry clean power where it is needed and scale storage so power systems stay steady as renewables grow. Industry must diversify supply chains so more countries can manufacture, install and maintain clean energy systems. This includes the critical minerals essential to the transition, which must benefit producing countries and communities — not just global markets.

Finance must bring down the cost of capital, especially for developing countries with vast renewable potential. And multilateral development banks must reduce risk and unlock far greater private investment.

Most importantly, we must ensure this transition is just — protecting workers and communities, supporting education, industrial development and opportunity for all as energy systems evolve.

A clean energy future is within reach. Let us seize the moment — and bring the renewables revolution to every corner of the world.",https://press.un.org/themes/custom/un3_press/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-15 18:59:38.043992

Senate Democratic Leader Shelli Yoder, of Bloomington, said child care deserts are spreading and parents are on waitlists for years.
Braun ended the speech with a nod to the Indiana Hoosiers playing for the national college football championship Jan. 19.","INDIANAPOLIS — Gov. Mike Braun delivered a State of the State speech on Jan. 21 that was heavy on achievements, light on new goals and with a few football callouts.

“With our strong business environment, it’s not surprising that another organization has noticed that Indiana is open for business: the Chicago Bears,” he said. “We are working hard to bring the Chicago Bears to the Hoosier State.”

But most of the address focused on affordability for Hoosiers — from electric bills and rent to property taxes and child care.

“Affordability is our highest priority,” Braun told General Assembly members gathered in the Indiana House chamber.

“Together,” he continued, “we can make Indiana the state where your dollar goes further, where opportunity abounds for all who are willing to work hard, and where every Hoosier worker can build the life they deserve.”

Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray called it a good speech.

“He talked about some of the highlights and the really good story that Indiana has to tell,” he said.

Braun didn’t mention the bitter December redistricting battle that has strained some relationships in the Statehouse. Braun specifically said Bray and other Senate Republicans who opposed redistricting should lose their seats.

“There’s lots of hard things that happen in this place,” Bray said after Braun’s speech. “We are going to continue to come to work and do good work for Hoosiers, and look forward to working with the governor for that and with the House as well.”

Democrats pointed to numerous ways that Republicans are now hopping on the affordability bandwagon, giving examples of bills that the Democratic caucuses have offered in recent years but that Republicans rejected.

“If Statehouse Republicans wanted to lower costs, they would have already done that by now,” said House Democratic Leader Phil GiaQuinta. “They’ve been in charge for the past 20 years, and Gov. Braun is catching up the fact that Hoosiers are struggling.”

Backing these bills

Braun didn’t unveil a typical legislative agenda for his office, instead simply announcing support for several bills already moving through the legislative process.

For instance, he said he supports Republican Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler’s bill to protect Hoosiers from unnecessary utility rate increases.

While on the topic of energy, Braun issued a full-throated declaration of support for data centers. The behemoth centers have roiled numerous Indiana communities with Hoosiers concerned about electricity and water usage.

“AI is going to be key to the jobs and wages of the future, but data centers can’t stick Hoosiers with the power bill,” Braun said. “Companies that want big power in Indiana should pay their own way.”

That goal isn’t fully codified but rather an informal policy in negotiations for state support.

He specifically hailed Amazon building a $1.5 billion data center in northwest Indiana, saying “they’re going to pay for every cent of their power needs, and then some.”

Moving to homeownership, Braun said he supports a bill from GOP Rep. Doug Miller, R-Elkhart, to remove government hurdles and make it easier for Hoosiers to chase the American dream of owning a home.

“Home prices have surged because we aren’t building enough, and unnecessary regulations are driving up costs,” he said.

He also announced support for bills to limit cellphone use in schools; ensure that parents have veto power over their kids’ creating social media accounts; curb homelessness in public spaces and a constitutional change to make it easier to hold accused criminals in jail pre-trial.

Braun said affordable child care is needed to grow the Indiana economy and help Hoosiers get better jobs. But that specific priority item will have to wait a year.

“I look forward to digging in during the budget session (in 2027) on what we can do to invest in lowering child care costs,” he said. “I would like to see a program where businesses have skin in the game to help grow child care programs.”

But under his watch, the administration has cut reimbursement rates and capped child care vouchers for low-income parents. That has led to waitlists and day care centers closing around the state.

Senate Democratic Leader Shelli Yoder, of Bloomington, said child care deserts are spreading and parents are on waitlists for years.

“Costs are higher. Workers are leaving jobs they want because care does not exist. That did not happen by accident. It happened because child care was treated as an afterthought,” she said. “Child care is not an option, it’s an economic infrastructure.”

But GOP House Speaker Todd Huston pushed back, saying Republicans have passed measures to improve child care options, such as deregulation and tax credits for businesses to get involved.

“The best thing we can do is help support more supply and the government’s not going to be the best avenue to do that,” Huston said. “The best avenue to do that is reduce the regulations and let a lot of these folks that used to provide child care provide child care without having the burden of of all these government regulations that just do nothing but drive up costs.”

Kudos to Indiana

Braun also took time to list key accomplishments for his administration during his first year in office.

He reminded Hoosiers that he pushed a property tax bill that will save taxpayers $1.5 billion over the next three years. He has no plans for more property tax changes this year.

Braun pointed to cuts in state government that are making state agencies leaner and more efficient. He specifically applauded Indiana’s Medicaid program for finding $465 million in savings.

These savings have come through increased eligibility checks, tightened regulations and cuts to some programs.

“We’re continuing to deliver high-quality essential services that Hoosiers rely on, while you keep more of your money — because it’s not ours, it’s yours,” Braun said.

The education front also provided key highlights, with increased reading scores, a record-high graduation rate and new school accountability grades coming soon.

Braun also noted that Indiana’s real GDP is growing faster than the national rate and listed a string of big jobs announcements from recent months.

“Project after project, industry after industry, the story is the same: Indiana is the Midwest’s growth engine for more jobs and bigger paychecks,” he said.

Additionally, the governor listed public safety wins and efforts at retraining Hoosier workers.

Lawmakers gave two standing ovations for law enforcement and also included a “Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoosiers” chant at one point.

Braun ended the speech with a nod to the Indiana Hoosiers playing for the national college football championship Jan. 19.

“My administration has people from up and down the state. We have Butler fans, Notre Dame fans, Purdue fans … but on (Jan. 19) I expect to see all of them wearing cream and crimson. Go Hoosiers!”

He also said a 9-year-old from Shoals, Jack Gibson, asked whether the governor could delay the start of school Jan. 20 so he could stay up late and watch the Hoosiers win the night before.

“I like the sound of that,” Braun said. “I’ll leave it up to each school district to decide, but I think that sounds like a good idea.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/fwbusiness.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/c5/6c59c5f5-3d0f-47eb-8369-8da80fa35016/69695da9f31bb.image.jpg?crop=1536%2C806%2C0%2C172&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-15 21:58:36.498763

The Toxic Substances Control Act – the primary U.S. chemical safety law – gives EPA the authority to review chemicals for safety and protect people most at risk from exposure to toxic chemicals.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, on Thursday voted for final passage of a bill that would make appropriations available for Mississippi water systems, wastewater infrastructure, and unique cultural projects.

The Senate approved the FY2026 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, 82-15, as part of a three-bill package (HR.6938) that now goes to President Trump to be signed into law. The interior appropriations measure funds the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Forest Service, and other agencies.

“For Mississippi, this bill is an important source of federal resources to help our communities upgrade water and wastewater infrastructure. It funds the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which has a direct influence on offshore energy development in the Gulf. And it also helps our state manage and preserve its historical legacy and historical site management,” Hyde-Smith said. “This is responsible legislation, and I look forward to it becoming law so these resources can be put to work in Mississippi.”

The enactment of this three-bill package will mean Congress has approved six of the 12 annual appropriations bills for FY2026. HR.6938 spends less money—$10 billion less—than if these agencies were funded under a continuing resolution. Congress has until January 30 to act on the remaining FY2026 funding bills before the current continuing resolution expires.

Among the items of interest to Mississippi in the Senate’s FY2026 Interior Appropriations Bill:

$7.8 million for the Cities of Clinton, Bolton, and Raymond for Regional Wastewater Improvements

$2.5 million for the DeSoto County Regional Utility Authority (DCRUA) Effluent Pump Station Project

$1.17 million for the City of Natchez for Stormwater Infrastructure Improvements

$500,000 for the City of Louisville for Historic Strand Theater Preservation and Restoration

The bill includes significant policy provisions that would benefit Mississippi, including:

$20 million for the American Battlefield Protection Program

Report language for Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to continue mineral assessments on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (Ole Miss)

Report language to direct EPA to continue to update and refine its draft of the Rodenticide Strategy

$49 million for the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund

Report language adopted via amendment directing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to restore, enhance, and better manage habitat for waterfowl and wildlife at the Mathews Brake and Yazoo National Wildlife Refuges, in partnership with local landowners and nonprofit conservation organizations.

The bill provides $2.8 billion for the EPA Clean Water and Drinking Water Revolving Funds that have been used successfully by communities throughout Mississippi to tackle water and wastewater infrastructure issues.

The National Parks in Mississippi would also benefit from funding in the bill to support the national parks’ operations, preserve historic sites, and sustain staffing capacity to address visitor services and park management needs.

But the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have slammed the breaks on an industry that had doubled its output in just three years south of the border.

In 2025, tariffs on parts components coming from outside North America and Trump’s elimination of tax credits on the purchase of electric vehicles hit Mexican EV production and overall vehicle exports hard, Finance Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Thursday.

“We closed (2025) with a reduction of just under 3 percent (in overall vehicle exports). It’s not as much as we had expected. We were bracing for a much bigger impact,” Ebrard said. “Everyone is (realigning) its production lines. Also, the U.S. did away with incentives of $7,500 on electric vehicles […] So, what happened? Demand fell.”

Ebrard said the future of EV production in Mexico will continue to hinge on U.S. consumer appetite. Mexico in 2024 exported 2.8 million total light vehicles to the United States. “Mexico produces a lot of electrical vehicles, so it’s part of that 3 percent” drop, the finance minister said, without specifying a percentile decrease in EV production.

Speaking at a news conference in Mexico City broadcast on YouTube, Ebrard expanded on how car manufacturers in Mexico are adjusting to U.S. tariffs.

He said exporters – including U.S. companies assembling cars in Mexican plants – sent their vehicles to the American market either under Most Favored Nation status or through the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement .

It’s easier to avoid tariffs of up to 27.5 percent by complying with rules of origin under the treaty, so 85 out of 100 automakers operating in Mexico are using that mechanism, he said.

“All the automakers who invested in adding North American content have a discount from that 27.5, down to 13 percent on average. If you don’t have parts from North America, your tariff is higher,” Ebrard said.

He added Mexican negotiators will be discussing the tariffs with their U.S. and Canadian during this summer’s USMCA review to ensure they are done under the framework of the agreement.",https://www.klfy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2026/01/65710bd8733dc9.28598705-e1746111515993.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-15 23:58:06.137045

Since the devastating floods in Texas on July 4, Rep. Pfluger has been at the forefront of strengthening emergency alert systems, especially in rural or remote areas.

The Mystic Alerts Act would integrate satellite networks into wireless emergency alert processes. Expert witnesses testified last month that this legislation is a critical step toward closing the digital divide and strengthening public safety communications nationwide. The bipartisan legislation was passed unanimously out of the Subcommittee, where it awaits consideration by the full House Energy and Commerce Committee.

Read Rep. Pfluger’s full remarks in support of the Mystic Alerts Act below:

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I obviously support the bipartisan bill H.R. 7022, the Mystic Alerts Act, which I’m proud to lead alongside Representatives Lizzie Fletcher, Buddy Carter, and Mark Veasey.

I want to thank the co-leads for working closely with us to advance this bipartisan legislation. I appreciate their partnership and commitment to strengthening public safety communications, especially for communities that are too often left behind when disasters strike.

During our last public safety hearing, we heard powerful testimony from expert witnesses about the importance of strengthening the Wireless Emergency Alert System and their broad support for the Mystic Alerts Act. Witnesses emphasize that WEA’s are among the most effective tools available to protect the public, but also highlighted that coverage gaps still persist. They explained that incorporating space-based mobile broadband, as the Mystic Alerts Act does, into the WIA system would add redundancy, improve reliability, and help ensure alerts reach families and first responders, even in the most challenging circumstances.

Today, too many Americans lose access to alerts when cellular infrastructure is damaged, overwhelmed, or nonexistent, particularly in rural areas. This bill helps to close that gap by ensuring emergency alerts can still be delivered via satellite when traditional networks fail.

For me, this issue is personal. On July 4th, devastating floods swept through Central and West Texas, including the area around Camp Mystic, where two of my daughters were attending camp. When communication systems fail during moments like that, the consequences can be tragic. No family should miss a life-saving warning simply because infrastructure went down or service was unavailable.

There is still work to be done to incorporate technical assistance into this legislation, but moving the Mystic Alerts Act forward is a meaningful step toward modernizing public safety communications, closing dangerous gaps and emergency alert coverage, and ensuring Americans can receive critical information when it matters the most.

There’s a lot happening right now in U.S. energy and policy and it’s easy to lose track of the larger picture. I’m going to ask you to turn your attention, at least for a few minutes, to something bigger that’s also happening:

Solar power is moving toward dominance of the global energy system.

The trend lines for solar deployment, panel prices and efficiency all point to a future in which energy is cleaner, cheaper and more accessible than today.

A recent paper in Nature Energy summarizes where we’re likely heading. It lists more than 60 co-authors from some of the world’s leading research institutions, including the National Laboratory of the Rockies (which was the National Renewable Energy Laboratory before a recent name change), the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Germany and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan.

“The global growth of photovoltaics for electricity generation has been remarkable, outpacing other energy technologies across history in rates of the expansion of manufacturing capacity and reduction in price,” said the paper.

As this continues, some of the main technological and policy challenges will involve designing an energy system that can operate with high levels of solar. Planners will need to develop a variety of power plants and energy-storage technologies to support the grid at night and during periods of low solar generation.

I spoke with Sarah Kurtz, an electrical engineering professor at the University of California, Merced and a co-author of the paper. She explained that the success of solar energy largely depends on the fact that the fuel—the sun—is free and plentiful.

“In one hour, the Earth receives enough light from the sun to power the world for the whole year,” she said.

She is a prolific researcher who has focused on improving solar panel performance, work she has focused on since the mid-1980s.

Andreas Bett, director of the Fraunhofer Institute and a co-author of the paper, said the growth of solar power has profound implications for making energy affordable and accessible. Solar is already the least expensive energy source in most of the world.

“There is no fundamental limit or resource problem for photovoltaic technology,” he said in an email. “It is a technology that will advance the prosperity of the entire global community. Nevertheless, it is important to continue developing the technology in order to ultimately achieve higher efficiency levels and thus reduce material consumption.”

The paper draws on discussions at the Terawatt Workshop, a gathering of solar researchers hosted in California in June 2024.

It begins by noting that the world now has 2 terawatts of solar photovoltaic generating capacity installed, which includes utility-scale and smaller systems. That’s a huge number, more than double what it was in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency.

Based on current manufacturing capacity and growth forecasts, the world is on track to install about 75 terawatts of solar by 2050, the paper said. This indicates growth on a transformational scale.

Solar power would expand because of a combination of declining panel prices and increasing efficiency. Today, a highly efficient panel can convert about 30 percent of the solar radiation striking it into electricity. The paper identifies technological improvements that could increase efficiency to 35 percent by mid-century.

As panels become more efficient, projects require fewer of them to generate the same amount of electricity, which saves land and materials.

To understand where we’re heading, it’s helpful to understand where we are. As of 2024, renewable energy sources produced 32 percent of the world’s electricity and were on the verge of overtaking coal as the global leader, according to the IEA.

Hydropower was the world’s leading source of renewable electricity in 2024, followed by wind and then solar. But solar, which was 7 percent of global electricity generation, is growing the fastest and is on track to become the largest source.

For governments and businesses, success in the energy economy of the future will depend on maximizing the benefits of solar and adapting to a grid dominated by solar.

Much of the world seems to understand this, but the United States under President Donald Trump is heading in the opposite direction with policies that favor fossil fuels and eliminate tax incentives for solar. The Trump administration often talks about this as a desire to achieve “energy dominance” through increasing production of coal, oil and natural gas.

“(M)y energy policy is defined by maximum production, maximum prosperity, and maximum power,” Trump said in an Oct. 17 proclamation designating “National Energy Dominance Month.”

I asked Bett what he makes of recent energy decisions by U.S. leadership.

“In my personal opinion, it is a mistake for the U.S. government to cut subsidies for photovoltaics,” he said. “It is the technology of the future and will be implemented worldwide. Developments will now progress outside the U.S.—especially in China, which will be able to establish itself as the sole global market leader. It is a shame that a high-tech nation like the U.S. is turning its back on a high-tech development.”

Kurtz said it’s shortsighted for the United States to not try to be a leader in solar.

“Solar is such a strong technology that the U.S. not supporting it will not be able to stop it,” she said. “The U.S. may get left behind.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-69.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 20:59:54.933963

Now analysts warn rising opposition to the massive warehouses powering the artificial intelligence revolution is shaping up to be a major factor in the 2026 midterm elections.

Data centers that provide the computing capacity and storage needed to power AI models like ChatGPT are emerging as the “villain” as Americans face high utility bills, Jefferies analysts said in a report this week.

Every political candidate running for office this election year will be forced ""to take a position whether they are pro or con data centers/AI.”

“It is not just an issue at the state and local levels but a federal topic as the election narrative forces the subject in every domain,"" they said. ""Not only will this feature prominently in state level elections, particularly those where there will be Gubernatorial turnover (term limits and not running again) but also nationally where we think many still underestimate the pivot in the Trump administration to focus on these issues.”

Trump: Tech must 'pay their own way' on data centers

President Donald Trump has championed data centers as critical to the U.S. economy and to the AI race with China, but he's facing growing pressure to lower costs for Americans who have soured on his handling of the economy.

Trump addressed voters' data center concerns on Monday, Jan. 12, saying his administration was working on deals with technology companies to ensure that Americans would not pick up the tab.

""I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,"" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. ""We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must 'pay their own way.'""

Electricity rates have spiked in recent years as utility companies replace aging infrastructure and upgrade the power grid. Data centers only increase energy demands.

A study last year from Carnegie Mellon University and North Carolina State University estimated that data centers and cryptocurrency mining could lead to an 8% increase in the average electricity bill by 2030 and could exceed 25% in major data-center markets such as northern Virginia.

Companies fear of backlash as electricity prices soar

Regions with a high concentration of data centers have seen sharp increases in electricity prices.

“In rural America right now, where data centers are being built, everyone’s already angry because their electricity prices have risen a lot,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright recently told the North American Gas Forum.

Democrat Abigail Spanberger won the Virginia governor's race in November by promising to lower utility bills amid steep rate hikes that voters blamed on the state’s data-center boom.

Sometimes referred to as the ""data center capital of the world"" or ""data center alley,"" Northern Virginia hosts a huge share of the globe's internet traffic.

“I do think it’s important that the brunt of data centers not be put on ratepayers and, in fact, that they pay their own way and their fair share,” Spanberger said during her campaign.

Technology companies fear the backlash against data centers threatens AI expansion.

Community pushback jumped between April and June last year. In just three months, 20 projects valued at $98 billion were delayed or blocked, more than the total for all previous quarters since 2023, according to Data Center Watch, which tracks the pushback.

Microsoft this week pledged to cover the costs associated with its data centers.

“Especially when tech companies are so profitable, we believe that it’s both unfair and politically unrealistic for our industry to ask the public to shoulder added electricity costs for AI,” Microsoft’s vice chair and president Brad Smith wrote in a blog post. “Instead, we believe the long-term success of AI infrastructure requires that tech companies pay their own way for the electricity costs they create.”","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/14/USAT/88185318007-20250812-t-142804-z-83130982-rc-2-xedahg-3-fd-rtrmadp-3-usapowerdatacenters.JPG?crop=3717,2091,x0,y215&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-15 19:00:46.406564

The hearing follows a similar hearing held by the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on November 19. Both hearings focused on how to ensure that cleanup regulations for per- and poly- fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) respected the concerns of passive receivers, especially municipally owned infrastructure.

During the hearings, lawmakers expressed a bipartisan interest in legislation that would shield passive receivers from liability under federal law. NACo supports legislative action to protect public-interest and municipal passive receivers such as counties through a narrow liability exemption.

What are PFAS?

PFAS are a family of synthetic chemicals that have been manufactured and used in a variety of industrial and consumer settings since the 1940s. Commonly referred to as “forever chemicals,” PFAS can persist in the environment for decades and negatively affect human health. Exposure can occur in a variety of ways, including by breathing air containing PFAS, drinking water contaminated with PFAS and swallowing soil or dust contaminated with PFAS.

On April 19, 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated two common PFAS chemicals, PFOS and PFOA, as hazardous under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA; P.L. 96-510), also known as the Superfund law. Under CERCLA, the potentially responsible parties that manufactured or released PFAS chemicals into the environment can be held liable for cleanup costs. Despite having no part in manufacturing or distributing PFAS, counties could face significant compliance and remediation costs due to the presence of these chemicals at county-owned airports, in landfills and water systems.

Alongside the 2024 designation, EPA stated that its intention will be not to compel passive receivers such as counties to pay for PFAS cleanup costs under a policy of enforcement discretion. However, counties are not fully protected from liability as this policy is non-binding and could be revoked by future Administrations. The enforcement discretion policy also does not prevent other potentially responsible parties from seeking to hold counties liable to recover PFAS cleanup costs through CERCLA.

Hearing Takeaways

In both hearings, lawmakers questioned witnesses about the impact of the CERCLA designation on local communities and economies, including whether EPA’s current discretionary enforcement policy would provide adequate long-term protection for passive receivers. Republican and Democratic members from both chambers highlighted their shared belief that any legislative or regulatory fix should respect the “polluter pays” principle and avoid shifting cleanup costs onto ratepayer- or taxpayer-funded infrastructure or utilities.

At the U.S. Senate hearing, Chairman Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va) emphasized the committee would work to “enact a bipartisan solution to minimize future PFAS contamination, develop a clear path to destroy PFAS and protect passive receivers” and “provide a permanent statutory fix remove the burden of case-by-case settlements by providing lasting legal certainty.” In the U.S. House, both Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.) and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Gary Palmer (R-Ala.) spoke in favor of examining how the CERCLA designation is adversely impacting public-interest passive receivers.",https://www.naco.org/sites/default/files/2026-01/GettyImages-1451944757.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 17:59:45.027262

Will 2026 be a disaster? I tend to think it won’t be.

At the very least, 2026 will eventually test a theory I espouse often in The Morning Dump, which is that there are EV buyers who are not being well-served by the market and will appear once there are more affordable vehicles. Some of those vehicles are coming, and in an environment with far fewer incentives, which will give us clearer data.

There’s a way to look at Stellantis as its own mad science experiment, and the data isn’t great. The new chief scientist is saying a lot of the right things, although it doesn’t sound like he’s going to change many of the variables just yet. The opposite of Stellantis might be Honda, which is a company with few brands that carefully works its way into new areas, like sport. Honda’s job is sport.

And, to wrap it all up, GM CEO Mary Barra doesn’t think people will plug in their plug-in hybrids.

Better EVs Are Coming

With the cancellation of the IRA tax credit for EVs, the market somewhat artificially expanded in Q3 and then predictably crashed in Q4. Overall? EV sales were down about 2% from 2024, which isn’t that terrible.

A lot of this decline was led by Tesla, which saw a 7% drop year-over-year, although it still makes up almost half of the EV market. GM was probably the biggest winner, growing 48%. The brand also has a range of vehicles, from the affordable Equinox all the way up to the mega expensive Cellestiq.

What will the market look like once the push-and-pull of the tax credit goes away? EV buyers are extremely loyal, so most EV buyers going back into the market are probably going to buy another one.

My contention has been that more affordable EVs will bring more buyers, but the caveat there is that they have to be from the right brands. The Equinox EV is great if people give it a chance. It’s a Chevy, so that’s a non-starter for some people. It’s also still slightly pricey without the tax credit for what you get.

“2025 unfolded largely as anticipated, with changes to federal EV incentives reshaping the demand patterns that drove record Q3 sales,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of Industry Insights at Cox Automotive. “Rather than signaling a retreat from electrification, this shift marks a structural transition toward a market increasingly driven by consumer choice. While 2026 will bring challenges, momentum remains grounded in market maturation: expanding model availability across price points, improving charging reliability, and continued advances in battery performance and cost.”

This year, the market is going to get fewer expensive two-row crossovers and more interesting cars. There’s the return of the Chevy Bolt, which starts below $30,000 without the credit. The new Leaf is a little more expensive, but it’s good. The BMW iX3 is going to slot in lower than BMW’s other popular EV offerings, and do so with 400 miles of range.

While I’m desperate to try the Rivian R3 when it launches, I do think the Rivian R2 might be a nice place for people considering a gas-powered or hybrid two-row crossover. At $45,000ish it seems like a good deal.

While I’m optimistic, that optimism is qualified a bit. I don’t think EVs will increase share or even beat 2025. I see a relatively flat year, which is consistent with the market overall. I do see hybrids taking a greater share, but mostly from ICE vehicles and not EVs.

The market is maturing and getting rid of vehicles that exist merely to have an EV option, like the Acura ZDX, and are being replaced by 2nd or 3rd generation EVs that are probably better for more people.

Stellantis Will Probably Stick Together

I should probably start using a different photo of Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, mostly because MSN always flags it as being “violent.” It amuses me, so I won’t replace it until I find a new one.

Filosa has a tough job, and one of the challenges is that Stellantis has so many brands. All the brands. Should Stellantis kill some brands? It’s a discussion we’ve had, but it sounds like Filosa isn’t there yet, at least according to this interview in Bloomberg from the Detroit Auto Show, which may or may not have happened yesterday.

“We want to stay together,” he said Wednesday. “It’s a good combination.”

The comments are the latest indication that Stellantis’ leaders plan to largely continue the company’s current construction, formed through the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler and France’s PSA Group that created a portfolio of 14 brands.

Stellantis Chairman John Elkann similarly downplayed a potential breakup last February, saying the carmaker’s global reach and sale in major markets is a “big strength.”

Filosa is focused on turning sales around in the United States and fixing the mess the last guy made, so perhaps chucking out brands isn’t the best first step. Viva Lancia!

Honda Will Have A Sporty Version Of Most Of Its Cars

The Tokyo Auto Salon last week, and Honda announced that it was introducing a “SportLine” trim and “TrailLine” trim for basically everything. To clarify, “Sport Line” for the cars and “Trail Line” for the crossovers, although it would be great if Honda swapped those (Trail Line Accord?). This is the middle option in terms of performance, seemingly similar to Audi’s S-Line.

Based on Honda Sports DNA, Honda will expand its lineup of more exciting sport-type models, for both on-road and off-road driving. In addition, as the key pillar of its initiative to further enhance its sport-type model lineup, Honda will introduce HRC-spec models for a wider range of production models by leveraging technologies HRC has amassed through racing activities and feedback from its race drivers.

Honda has always been a company that loves motorsports, which is endearing. What’s more interesting to me is the HRC versions, as mentioned in this Automotive News article:

Honda’s upcoming TrailSport HRC offerings are expected to be priced higher than their standard-trim counterparts, spokesman Yuzo Mori said.

The HRC trim builds upon the TrailSport grades already offered in the U.S. on such nameplates as the Passport and CR-V crossovers, as well as the Ridgeline pickup.

TrailSport HRC offerings will incorporate sporty design cues and technologies amassed through Honda’s racing activities to differentiate them from existing TrailSport trims, Honda said.

What would a TrailSport HRC HR-V even do?

I don’t know, but I’m curious.

Mary Barra Doesn’t Think People Plug In Plug-Ins

I feel like David and I are always getting into arguments with our peers over the concept of vehicles with a gas engine and battery pack. Basically, one side thinks that no one plugs them in, and the other side thinks they do, but a lack of data means none of us know for sure.

The reality is probably somewhere in between and is likely highly dependent on the vehicle. Do I think Wrangler 4Xe owners are plugging in regularly? I doubt it. Are people who buy a Mercedes or BMW plug-in charging at home? Probably, yes.

There is some portion of the pro-EV crowd that’s still angry that their rosy projections for EV adoption turned out to be wrong, and this makes them lash out at hybrids, EREVs, and PHEVs. In fairness to them, the data on PHEV usage is hard to come by, and the fact that automakers are not anxious to share isn’t a good sign.

As reported by InsideEVs, GM CEO Mary Barra isn’t that keen on them either:

“What we also know today with plug-in hybrids is that most people don’t plug them in,” she said. “So that’s why we’re trying to be very thoughtful about what we do from a hybrid and a plug-in hybrid perspective.”

That’s kind of a bummer because vehicles like the Equinox Plus that GM sells in China are interesting. [Ed Note: I wouldn’t be surprised if people didn’t plug in their PHEVs (though I’m not convinced they don’t), as America’s PHEVs aren’t good enough. -DT].

What I’m Listening To While Writing TMD

If you are not a younger Millennial or a GenZer or whatever, you may have missed all of the Geese discourse. What you need to know is that it’s a rock band fronted by a guy named Cameron Winter, who is both handsome and talented, which means the Internet loves him. He’s got a sort of Rufus Wainwright thing to him as well that sounds a little different than what’s out there now. “Au Pays du Cocaine” is a good entry into the world of Geese.

The Big Question

Will people plug-in EREVs, which offer much more electric range than current PHEVs? [Ed Note: And to add to that question: If they don’t like plugging in their EREVs for whatever reason, would these customers have been happy with a BEV that has to be plugged in? -DT]",https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Neu_Klasse_Bolt_R2_TMD_TS.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 17:00:41.232628

One of those tracks used to be set aside exclusively for electric vehicles as U.S. automakers sought to quickly build out the cars of the future.

But no longer. This year, both strips are open to hybrids and gas-powered vehicles as Detroit continues a pivot away from EVs since President Donald Trump returned to the White House with a pro-fossil fuels agenda.

“The show will always reflect what’s happening in the industry at the consumer level,” said Todd Szott, chairman of this year’s event and an auto dealer. “Obviously things have changed in the EV landscape.”

Some industry players say they're emphasizing “consumer choice” in the cars they're showing at Detroit's premier auto event. But some experts expressed concern about the EV pullback's long-term effect on American automakers as the rest of the globe — especially China — electrifies.

“What we worry about is how competitive will we be on the global stage as the market continues to advance around us,” Michael Robinet, vice president of forecast strategy at auto market intelligence firm S&P Global Mobility, said during a panel Wednesday on industry trends.

Electrification in the US

Including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week. Compare that to China, which saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles last year, and Europe, which saw a 33% increase. (U.S. pure-EV market share was just under 8% in 2025, with 1.23 million EVs sold — a slight decline from 2024.)

None of that seemed to alarm President Donald Trump earlier this week when he toured the Ford River Rouge Complex, which churns out pickup trucks and more in suburban Dearborn. Trump used his time in Detroit to boast of policy changes on EVs and tariffs that he says have boosted U.S. automakers.

“Among my first acts in office was to end the radical left war on oil and gas and stop the crusade to kill American energy and, frankly, to open up cars so that you don’t have to have an electric car,” Trump said in remarks to an economic club before the plant tour.

Trump revoked a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric, and has tried to block money obligated to EV charging across the nation’s highways. Under Trump, Congress cut tax incentives that saved buyers up to $7,500 on an EV purchase. The administration has also weakened fuel economy standards — going so far as eliminating penalties for the automakers who do not meet them — and gas mileage rules.

“I love electric cars. I think they’re great,” Trump added. “But I’ve been saying it for four years. They wanted everybody to have an electric car in a very short period of time.”

Those changes have cut into the U.S. industry in 2025 and cost automakers billions of dollars in investment.

Ford Motor Co. announced last month $19.5 billion in charges from electrification efforts and ending production of the all-electric version of the F-150 Lightning truck. Detroit rival General Motors also recently announced $6 billion in EV-related charges, among other losses, and has also rolled back some of its EV commitments. Even once- market leader Tesla had a tough 2025.

“I still push for it because, I mean, it is the future of the company,” said Shawn Strain, marketing manager at Ford. “We still are just completely committed to EVs. And it may not be as overt as we once were.”

Industry concern arises

But industry experts at and outside of the show say it's a tough time. The competitive auto landscape has been radically reshaped, they say, and China dominates what most see as the future of the industry.

“We have to look at what we’re up against. In a word — China,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a speech at the show Thursday. ""China wants to dominate every part of auto manufacturing. They’re making major headway.

""They’ve captured major market share almost everywhere except the U.S. and Canada,"" she added. “We have to meet these challenges.""

Will Roberts, automotive research lead at Benchmark Minerals that released the 2025 data, warned that U.S. policy has made all the difference.

American automakers have responded to those changes, he said, but it would be good strategy if they made sure they were “keeping things ticking along in the background with a really compelling EV offering.”

Otherwise, the U.S. sector runs the risk of falling behind, Pete Buttigieg, former transportation secretary under former President Joe Biden, agreed.

In another panel at the show, Buttegieg said Trump can't stop electric vehicles from becoming the leading automotive technology.

“But he can stop America from being the leader in that technology,” Buttigieg said. ""Industry should point a different direction.”

Democrats protect funding to lower families’ energy bills, key investments in scientific research, and much more

Washington, D.C. — Today, the Senate, in a 82-15 vote, passed three bicameral, bipartisan fiscal year appropriations bills: the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies; Energy and Water Development; and Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies bills. The bills now head to the president’s desk to be signed into law. The House cleared the package in an overwhelming 397-28 vote last Thursday.

“Today, we sent funding bills to the president’s desk that reject the steep cuts he wanted and protect investments that families across America depend on every day,” said Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and Ranking Member of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee. “This package saves a key program to save families on their energy bills, sustains our investments in scientific research, and protects essential funding for our public lands and Tribes, among so much else. Passing these bills reasserts Congress’ power of the purse and will prevent this administration from having the legal authority to decide for itself how to spend these taxpayer funds again. Democrats will keep fighting to protect investments in the American people—and I look forward to getting the rest of our bills across the finish line.”

“Oregonians turned out in record numbers during my town halls last year and delivered a clear message: Congress must fight back against harmful funding cuts and do everything it can to protect our public lands, waters, and outdoor-driven economy.

The bill also rejects dozens of poison pill riders proposed by House Republicans and protects funding for operating and protecting our public lands, making it clear that Congress intends to ensure public lands stay in public hands. I look forward to this bill being signed swiftly into law to ensure communities in Oregon and across the nation have the necessary resources to tackle the greatest problems facing our environment, health, lands, air, and water.”

“As we face a lawless Trump Administration, Congress’s role in fighting for Americans’ priorities is all the more important. Within this bill, we worked to invest in those priorities, reject the Administration’s attempts to defund critical initiatives both in Maryland and nationally, and create new safeguards against their efforts to ignore Congressionally-mandated funds. This legislation will help boost economic opportunity and strengthen public safety in our communities,” said Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Ranking Member of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. “We also fought to reject the Trump Administration’s attacks on science, including at NASA Goddard, NOAA, and NIST – all based in my home state of Maryland. I also worked within this bill to secure language to reassert Congress’s oversight role in the new FBI headquarters and to ensure the new headquarters meets the mission and security needs of the FBI. While this bill is not perfect – including Republicans’ decision to strip my amendment requiring DOJ preserve and report to Congress on the Epstein files – it rejects many Republican poison pills that would make our communities less safe, trample Americans’ civil rights, restrict access to healthcare, impede important scientific research, and so much more. The investments we secured in this legislation were hard-fought, and this bill will help invest in and protect important priorities for the American people.”

Throughout negotiations, Democrats fought to protect the programs and investments that matter most to working families across the country. Among much else, this three-bill package delivers important investments for the American people:

FAMILIES’ ENERGY COSTS: Rejects President Trump’s push to eliminate the Weatherization Assistance Program that saves families an average of $372 per year on their energy bills by making energy efficiency upgrades. Instead, Democrats secured a $3 million increase in funding for the program.

SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH: Rejects President Trump’s efforts to slash funding for the National Science Foundation by 57%, gut funding for the Department of Energy’s Office of Science by $1.1 billion, and slash NASA’s science budget by 47%. Instead, the package sustains research funding for NSF, provides $160 million more for the Office of Science, which supports critical research being conducted by 22,000 researchers at our 17 national labs and over 300 universities, and provides $7.25 billion for NASA’s science budget.

PUBLIC LANDS & NATIONAL PARKS: Rejects President Trump’s push to cut funding for the National Park Service by over $1 billion and provides the funding necessary to fully support the longstanding operations of America’s public lands.

FLOOD PREVENTION: Provides $10.44 billion for the Army Corps, a historic funding level, rejects President Trump’s push to cut funding by $2 billion, and reasserts congressional control over which projects get funded and how much funding they receive.

VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN: Provides $7 million more for grant programs administered by the Office of Violence Against Women, rejecting President Trump’s efforts to cut over $200 million in funding for the office, which provides grants to communities nationwide to help survivors of domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION: Rejects President Trump’s push to slash funding for the EPA—providing $4.7 billion above his request. Also rejects extreme riders that would enshrine detrimental policies in law.

TRIBES: Delivers essential funding to support Tribes and our treaty obligations to them—rejecting President Trump’s push to slash funding for Tribes by nearly $1 billion.

REASSERTS CONGRESSIONAL CONTROL: Prevents President Trump and his cabinet secretaries from unilaterally deciding how to spend taxpayer dollars. Right now, the Trump administration has significantly more discretion to decide how to allocate federal funding thanks to Republicans’ yearlong continuing resolution for fiscal year 2025, which failed to provide detailed funding directives for hundreds of programs and turned over decision-making power to the executive branch to fill in the gaps itself. This package provides detailed directives about how funds are to be spent—just as Congress has long done when writing full-year appropriations bills—so that Congress, and not the executive branch, decides how taxpayer dollars are spent.

REJECTS EXTREME REPUBLICAN RIDERS: Rejects over 140 extreme riders and proposals included in House Republicans’ draft bills—and many more sought by President Trump in his budget request.

The three-bill package includes $5 billion specific to Washington state, including $3.2 billion for Hanford, a Central Washington nuclear cleanup site, and $190 million for construction at Howard A. Hanson Dam, a project supporting fish passage and flood risk reduction along the Green River near Seattle that the Trump administration shirked in its funding proposals.

“I said I would tear up Trump’s budget and write a new one — and I did,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, which is tasked with drafting the federal government funding bills.

“These are not the bills I would have written on my own; they are the result of tough bipartisan negotiations with Republicans who control every branch of government,” Murray added. “But these bills ensure that Congress — not Donald Trump — is deciding how taxpayer dollars get spent.”

The bills also include funds for salmon recovery initiatives in the Pacific Northwest, research at Washington state universities and money that will trickle down to the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

The bipartisan effort comes months after a partisan stalemate caused the longest government shutdown in history. Murray and Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., along with fellow Democrats, hailed the measures as a repudiation of Trump’s efforts to slash federal funding for critical offices and programs.

Republicans, including Reps. Dan Newhouse, of Sunnyside, and Michael Baumgartner, of Spokane, applauded the still modest spending trims in the bills.

“My immediate focus in the new year is passing our remaining government funding legislation and avoiding another costly shutdown,” Newhouse, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement. “We worked hard over the last year crafting commonsense, conservative policies that rein in bloated spending, refocus taxpayer dollars on programs that support the federal government’s responsibilities and bring home millions of dollars to Central Washington for essential projects.”

Lawmakers are debating and approving spending bills before a Jan. 30 deadline to fund the federal government.

The three measures approved Thursday allocate funding for energy and water development; commerce, justice, science and related agencies; and interior, environment and related agencies. The measures passed the House last week, and now head to the president’s desk. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Trump is expected to sign them into law.

The Hanson Dam, completed in 1962, proved critical last month in protecting Western Washington after an intense series of atmospheric river events forced evacuations, breached levees and swallowed roads.

Murray sounded the alarm last year when the Trump administration didn’t include a previously earmarked $500 million for the Hanson Dam. Thursday’s legislation wrestles some of that funding back, she said, as a major win for Washington state. The $190 million marked for its construction in Thursday’s legislation will allow the Army Corps of Engineers to incrementally fund a fish passage project for threatened Chinook salmon at the dam, a long-awaited investment that supports the state’s salmon recovery efforts, treaty obligations and the region’s river-based economy.

The legislation passed Thursday also preserves funding for NASA, which supports over 1,000 jobs in Washington state, and the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, which provides critical weather monitoring services and has research arms involving Washington state-based scientists — budgets that Trump sought to eviscerate.

Cantwell, chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, called the bills a “win for science,” during a speech on the Senate floor.

“The president’s budget would have slashed a quarter of NASA’s funding and half of the National Science Foundation’s funding, jeopardizing our economic competitiveness and national security,” Cantwell said in a statement. “Instead, Congress held the line, … Our world-class researchers and technologists will have the resources they need to expand the boundaries of knowledge that have long enabled us to invent our future.”",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01152026_tzr_tzr_133318.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2026-01-15 17:59:50.056204

The term is a fraction of the 15-year contract that the Louisiana regulators approved, though that length also worried opponents.
The company also maintains that the ""suggestion that Entergy Louisiana somehow misled the commission is utterly without merit and false.""","Environmental and consumer groups want Louisiana officials to investigate how a new financing structure for Meta's $27 billion artificial intelligence data center in the state's northeast could impact electricity bills for residents.

Meta can leave the data center after only four years, far shorter than the 15-year term approved in August by state regulators, the nonprofits say. The altered financing ""significantly increases ratepayer risk,"" according to a motion filed Wednesday with the Louisiana Public Service Commission on behalf of two nonprofit groups.

""Meta is acknowledging tacitly I suppose that the buildout of this facility is risky,"" said Logan Burke, who runs the Louisiana-based Alliance for Affordable Energy.

Entergy, which is building the electricity plants for the data center, disputes the nonprofits' claims.

The Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities, approved in August the plan to power Meta's biggest-ever data center, a project that will need roughly three times the amount of electricity annually that New Orleans uses in a year. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has separately spoken of further expanding the data center to a size that would rival the footprint of Manhattan, though some analysts have expressed doubt over whether that is possible.

The controversial approval cleared the way for Entergy, the state's largest utility, to begin constructing three gas-fired electricity plants and other infrastructure worth billions of dollars. Advocates and academics have also raised concern over the environmental risks of the new fossil fuel-powered gas plants and the water demands of the facility.

On the day Louisiana regulators approved Meta's power plan, the tech company ""fundamentally altered"" the financial setup of the Richland Parish data center, the nonprofits allege.

Under the complex financial model, Meta teamed up with a top private equity firm in a deal that helps the tech company offset financial risk and guarantees a profit for the private equity company, according to The Wall Street Journal. The restructuring essentially gives the private equity company majority ownership of the data center and makes Meta a tenant, able to exit the lease every four years for up to 20 years.

The term is a fraction of the 15-year contract that the Louisiana regulators approved, though that length also worried opponents. The three gas plants that Entergy is building have a lifespan of up to 40 years, the nonprofits argued over a monthslong approval process, potentially leaving ratepayers on the hook for some costs of the new infrastructure if the tech company leaves.

The nonprofit groups want the commission to investigate whether Meta or Entergy misled the state regulators, determine the effect of the new financial structure on ratepayers and review the timing of the financial rearrangement.

A spokesperson for Meta could not be reached for comment.

Entergy disagrees

Brandon Scardigli, a spokesperson for Entergy, said the company strongly disagrees with the allegation that changes to the data center financing puts Entergy or its customers at risk.

""That is simply false,"" Scardigli said.

The deal between Meta and Entergy is supported and backstopped by robust credit protections, Scardigli said, including a guarantee from the tech company that remains ""in full force"" regardless of changes to project financing. The company also maintains that the ""suggestion that Entergy Louisiana somehow misled the commission is utterly without merit and false.""

Entergy has previously stressed that the tech company will cover all revenue for the new plants throughout the 15-year deal, though all customers will pay for other related infrastructure costs. The plants will be able to serve everyone if Meta leaves after the 15-year deal as the utility retires older, less-efficient plants.

Part of the nonprofits' concern is related to the creation of a new entity majority-owned by the private equity firm, Blue Owl, and partly owned by Meta. That new entity will now serve as the parent company of the subsidiary that entered into the electricity deal with Entergy. Meta itself had previously been the parent company of the subsidiary, which is called Laidley.

""There is no longer an enforceable parent guaranty since Meta is no longer the parent,"" the nonprofits' motion states.

Concern from regulators

Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell, whose district includes Richland Parish, said his staff is looking into the request.

""We're concerned about it, but we feel good that we have a financial backer in Entergy,"" Campbell said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/21/221d11c8-6513-5af1-a0e4-d5074c5c8c85/6893bb6edd10b.image.jpg?crop=1801%2C946%2C0%2C102&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-15 17:01:06.739095

Governor Whitmer Signs Executive Directive to Explore Clean Energy Resources

Executive directive establishes Michigan as a leader in geologic hydrogen, a resource with the potential to create good-paying jobs, attract long-term investments, and lower energy costs for Michiganders

LANSING, Mich. – Today, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed an executive directive creating an initiative to explore geologic hydrogen as a usable, clean fuel alternative. Michigan’s unique geology makes it one of the most promising regions in the world for geologic hydrogen, a naturally occurring clean energy resource. This new initiative will determine the possibility of tapping into Michigan’s geologic hydrogen and using this natural fuel to build the future of clean energy.

“Michigan is a leader in clean-energy solutions,” said Governor Whitmer. “This initiative will uncover more about Michigan’s geologic hydrogen stores, which have the potential to attract long-term investments in our state and create thousands of good paying jobs for Michiganders. Together, we’re building the future of clean energy in Michigan.”

“Geologic hydrogen represents a transformative opportunity for Michigan, a state historically rich in natural resources and innovation,” said Jim Saber, President and CEO of NextEnergy. “By tapping into this abundant, naturally occurring resource, Michigan can lead the way in sustainable energy, create new jobs, and drive technological advancement. This isn’t just about energy—it’s about securing Michigan’s future as a leader in environmental stewardship and economic resilience, ensuring prosperity for generations to come.”

“It’s not every day we discover new, abundant energy sources — the last one was nuclear power over 80 years ago,” said Ishan Sharma, who directs geologic hydrogen efforts at Renaissance Philanthropy. “It’s even better when the new resource is potentially 90% less expensive than the way we make clean hydrogen today. Michigan’s one of the best places to show the world how geologic hydrogen can lower the costs of goods like steel & fuels, while cutting emissions in those industries decades earlier than anyone thought possible.”

“Michigan has the natural resources and industrial know-how to lead in clean fuels and hydrogen production,” said Jane McCurry, Executive Director of Clean Fuels Michigan. “This Executive Directive takes an important step toward responsibly developing geologic hydrogen, helping position the state to attract private investment, support manufacturing growth, and create high-quality jobs.”

“Governor Whitmer’s directive sends a clear signal that Michigan is serious about leading in geological hydrogen,” said Judd Herzer, Director of Mobility Research and Innovation at Michigan State University. “With the right coordination across state agencies, research institutions, and the private sector geological hydrogen can move rapidly from scientific promise to practical application, supporting hydrogen-powered mobility, clean energy independence, and the advanced manufacturing opportunities that will define Michigan’s next era of innovation.”

Geologic Hydrogen

Geologic hydrogen is a natural energy resource with the potential to serve as a fuel source at a scale and price that is competitive with fossil fuels. This uniquely clean resource can decarbonize some of the highest emission-producing industries, such as heavy-duty transportation, maritime shipping, and manufacturing. Michigan’s high potential for large, natural stores of geologic hydrogen has drawn significant national and international attention. Today’s initiative will build on Michigan’s leadership in clean-energy solutions.

Investments in geologic hydrogen will solidify Michigan’s place at the forefront of the U.S. hydrogen economy, which is projected to reach tens of billions of dollars in new economic activity. Opportunities in clean hydrogen will create new, high-wage jobs for Michiganders, lower industrial production costs, encourage long-term, statewide investments, and keep Michigan competitive in a global marketplace.

Michigan’s Clean Energy Future

Today’s executive directive builds on Governor Whitmer’s commitment to a clean-energy future for Michigan. Since taking office, the Whitmer-Gilchrist Administration has:

Michigan named a leader in clean energy race, ranked 6th nationally for clean energy jobs, #1 state for energy sector job growth, automotive industry and electric vehicle investments.

Signed a historic legislation package to deliver on the MI Healthy Climate Plan and develop a road map for Michigan to reach 100% carbon neutrality by 2050.

Signed a package of bills making Michigan a national leader in clean energy with the adoption of a 100% clean energy standard and more.

Signed bipartisan budgets investing millions in climate-resilient infrastructure, electric school buses, renewable energy for low-income families, and more.

Launched a new office to help Michigan workers take advantage of high-tech, high-paying jobs in automotive and clean energy sectors.

A whopping 92% of all new electricity capacity added in the US was solar, wind or batteries.","2025: The year the US gave up on climate, and the world gave up on us. While the US sits in self-imposed isolation, the rest of the world, led by China, raced ahead to invest in renewables and commit to action on climate change, which Trump has called a 'hoax' and 'con job'. “Bye-bye, little boy.”

How Long Will Trump Be Able to Deny Reality with His Energy Policy? Trump’s irrational hatred of solar and wind imperils both the environment and the economy. It would be almost funny if it weren’t so tragically shortsighted. It’s hard to imagine a more catastrophic series of economic decisions.

It feels like American politics is displacing all other energy related discussions on this subreddit. Of the top 15 posts from the past month, 12 are about Trump. Even when there are non-US topics some comments can't help but make the discussion revolve around this senile old man.

A Powerful Essay On Renewable Energy Reminds Us How Witheringly Stupid The US Has Become. “Solar power is now growing faster than any power source in history, and it is closely followed by wind power."" Nevertheless, the Trump administration insists that we are still stuck in the 20th century.

Trump Wants to Unleash Energy, as Long as It’s Not Wind or Solar. Trump is testing legal boundaries with aggressive orders designed to stop the transition to renewable energy. “If there really were an energy emergency, then the right thing to do would be to increase supplies of all forms of energy.""

America must break its addiction to fossil fuels. If Trump were really worried about an energy shortage, he would advocate the rapid deployment of clean, inexhaustible and indigenous renewable energy. Instead, he issued an order “Terminating the Green New Deal” and paused funding for clean energy.

Trump, With Tariffs and Threats, Tries to Strong-Arm Nations to Retreat on Climate Goals: The president has made no secret of his distaste for wind and solar in America. Now he’s taking his fossil fuel agenda overseas.

The five most unhinged climate lies Trump told in 2025. From “global cooling” to “beautiful coal”, the president’s opinions, once more, had no basis in fact. In a year littered with lies and wild declarations, these are the five that stood out as the most startling.

US clean energy jobs hit 3.56M in 2024, growing more than three times faster than the rest of the US, but Trump may kill the boom. “This was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024. Now, job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy.""

The incoherence of Trump’s ‘energy emergency’. Critics have dismissed the emergency as a fabrication. Attorneys general from 15 states are challenging it in court. And Trump, whose policies are slowing the construction of cheap, clean energy, is not exactly acting like there’s an emergency at hand.

Where are the climate Republicans? “They all folded like origami. Even to the detriment of their own districts."" Trump’s pro-fossil-fuel ethos is now firmly in control. ""The sobering lesson is that Trump has correctly judged that politics is about the short term — the consequences be damned.""

Trump’s words don’t match his actions on energy. Trump is actively thwarting increased domestic energy production, reliability and security while kneecapping the creation of good-paying jobs for Americans. Over 80,000 clean energy jobs have already been lost or stalled due to his actions.

Trump Administration Yanks Billions in Funding for Cutting-Edge Clean Energy Projects. “And for what? The administration has been explicit that these cancellations have nothing to do with acting in the best interests of this country and everything to do with satisfying partisan vindictiveness.

The journal ‘Science’ criticizes Trump’s anti-renewable energy policy: ‘The US is failing to benefit from its own innovations’. Renewable energy is now the world’s leading source of electricity. China has become the leading manufacturer while the US is betting on an energy model stuck in the past.

The Republicans kneecapped America's clean energy sector. Now Trump aims to squash it. The policies Trump is targeting were enacted to help US firms compete. Trump “doesn’t understand or doesn’t care that solar, wind, and batteries are the cheapest, quickest, made-in-America energy we can deploy.""

How Trump dismantled a promising energy industry — and what America lost. The demolition of the offshore wind sector in 2025 will reverberate for decades, resulting in lost jobs, higher utility bills, and less reliable power grids. ​“Nobody understands why Trump did it."" ""madness.""

Trump’s war on energy: If we’re in an energy emergency, why kill the cleanest, best, and fastest growing sources? Trump is waging a very real war on renewable energy. They’ve clawed back funds, killed tax credits, subjected wind and solar to heightened reviews and eliminated wind leasing areas.

The real winners of Trump’s attack on clean energy aren’t American. Trump is undercutting clean energy at the same time economics are propelling it globally. “Renewable energy isn’t being done by countries because they are woke. That is a stupid statement. It is being done because it is economic.”

Trump’s Opposition to Clean Energy Is Costing You Money. Until this year, America was set to embark on its largest investments in history toward clean and affordable energy and good-paying jobs. Trump has tossed that progress out the window. It’s time for Congress to intervene.

Trump Tries To Turn The Clock Back On Energy. Trump's attempts to turn back the clock on coal is just one of many ways he’s threatening America’s scientific and technological leadership. The United States now faces a future in which it may no longer be the preeminent scientific power.

The year Trump tried and failed to stop clean energy. A whopping 92% of all new electricity capacity added in the US was solar, wind or batteries. EV sales set a new record in Q3. Trump simply can’t stop the energy transition. But he did manage to slow it down and make it more expensive for America.",,N,,2026-01-15 19:59:41.303391

Australia is also developing its own critical minerals reserve.","A bipartisan group of US lawmakers on Thursday introduced a bill to create a $2.5-billion stockpile of critical minerals, a move aimed at stabilizing market prices and encouraging domestic mining and refining.

The bill marks Washington's latest attempt to offset what policymakers view as Chinese manipulation of prices for lithium, nickel, rare earths and other critical minerals - vital for items from electric vehicles to high-tech weaponry - that has stymied American mining companies for years.

A China-generated glut of lithium, for example, led North Carolina-based Albemarle to pause US expansion plans in 2024. The Pentagon became the largest shareholder in Nevada-based rare earths company MP Materials in July amid intensifying Chinese competition.

The 68-page bill says China has moved to ""weaponize its influence over prices and volumes in the contest for access to critical minerals.""

BILL AIMS TO 'INSULATE US FROM FOREIGN THREATS'

China has rejected assertions that it manipulates the market for critical minerals, saying in November it is committed to ""upholding the security and stability of global production and supply chains.""

To become law, the measure must pass the House of Representatives and the Senate and be signed by President Donald Trump.

The bill would create a Strategic Resilience Reserve with a seven-person board, modeled on the Federal Reserve's governance structure, which would oversee the fund.

Members, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, would be tasked with buying minerals considered critical by US agencies and stockpiling them at warehouses across the country. The board would need the technical expertise to ensure the minerals are stored properly. Certain lithium derivatives, for example, emit hydrogen when exposed to water.

The bill prioritizes recycled material, but minerals extracted from mines would be eligible. Allied countries would be able to join the reserve if they contributed at least $100-million.

Minerals could be sold for private-industry or defense purposes. Any profit would be used to buy more minerals and keep the stockpile active in perpetuity.

""Providing targeted investments and stockpiling key inputs will help insulate the US from foreign threats and will provide a significant - and cost effective - boost to the U.S. economy,"" said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Senator Todd Young, an Indiana Republican, co-sponsored the legislation. Representative Rob Wittman, a Virginia Republican, introduced the same measure in the House.

The reserve's board would have flexibility over how to buy minerals, according to Senate aides. It could, for example, agree to pay twice the existing market price for rare earths - a market dominated by China - if such purchases supported US mines.

Many niche-but-essential minerals on which Beijing has imposed export controls are not traded or lightly traded, sparking a push for minerals prices not tied to Chinese production.

""It's certainly possible this reserve could create a Western price for certain critical minerals,"" a Senate aide said.

Group of Seven finance ministers this week discussed floors for minerals prices. Trump on Wednesday said US over-reliance on other nations for critical minerals is a national security threat.

WASHINGTON D.C. — This week, the federal Environmental Protection Agency announced that methane gas turbines, even temporary ones that will operate for less than a year, require construction permits and air permits.

The announcement came as the agency revised its New Source Performance Standard, which regulates air pollution from gas turbines. The revised rule confirms what local Memphis community groups have been saying for months: that temporary methane gas turbines like the ones xAI is using to power its South Memphis data centers are subject to NSPS and require air permits.

In fact, EPA emphasizes that methane gas turbines have never been exempt from the regulations, writing: ""Historically, however, the EPA has not regulated combustion turbines, even those that may be portable, as nonroad engines, but rather as stationary sources."" The statement is a clear rebuke of arguments from local leaders that turbines at the xAI site qualified for a so-called ""nonroad engine loophole.""

In response to this announcement, the Southern Environmental Law Center, on behalf of Young, Gifted & Green and the NAACP, sent a letter to the Memphis and Shelby County Air Pollution Control Board, alerting the board to the EPA revision and urging them to ensure the Shelby County Health Department changes its policies on unpermitted gas turbines to be in line with federal regulations.

Below are statements from the Southern Environmental Law Center, Young Gifted & Green, and NAACP in response to the announcement:

""EPA's gas turbine decision makes it clear that companies are not — and have never been — allowed to build and operate methane gas turbines without a permit and that there is no loophole that would allow corporations to set up unpermitted power plants. We expect local health leaders to take swift action to ensure they are following federal law and to better protect neighbors from harmful air pollution,"" SELC Senior Attorney Amanda Garcia said.

""Memphians have been yelling from the top of our polluted lungs that allowing methane turbines to operate for almost a year with no permit is not only inhumane, but illegal. The Shelby County Health Department should at least do the bare minimum,which is following the law. If it refuses, the Air Pollution Control Board needs to hold the Shelby County Health Department accountable,"" LaTricea Adams, CEO and President of Young, Gifted & Green, said. ""As a daughter of South Memphis that lost my father way too soon living in a polluted community, I demand that the Air Pollution Control Board reconvene another public meeting immediately to best address this critical issue.""

""Our communities, air, water, and land are not playgrounds for billionaires chasing another buck,"" said Abre' Conner, NAACP Director of Environmental and Climate Justice. ""We've seen enough from Elon Musk and other elites who act as if they are above the law in certain cases, and here, they add to pollution that impacts our livelihoods. We will not let them in SouthMemphis or anywhere else. The NAACP has a long history of fighting environmental injustice, and in an era of booming data centers and skyrocketing greenhouse gas emissions, our work will only grow more urgent. This is our only home, and we have only one body. If you think our health is something we'll compromise, you're mistaken.""

“I love electric cars.
In another panel at the show, Buttegieg said Trump can’t stop electric vehicles from becoming the leading automotive technology.","DETROIT (AP) — At the North American International Auto Show, tires squeal as gearheads put shiny new vehicles through their paces on a pair of indoor tracks that sprawl across the event space. One of those tracks used to be set aside exclusively for electric vehicles as U.S. automakers sought to quickly build out the cars of the future.

But no longer. This year, both strips are open to hybrids and gas-powered vehicles as Detroit continues a pivot away from EVs since President Donald Trump returned to the White House with a pro-fossil fuels agenda.

“The show will always reflect what’s happening in the industry at the consumer level,” said Todd Szott, chairman of this year’s event and an auto dealer. “Obviously things have changed in the EV landscape.”

Some industry players say they’re emphasizing “consumer choice” in the cars they’re showing at Detroit’s premier auto event. But some experts expressed concern about the EV pullback’s long-term effect on American automakers as the rest of the globe — especially China — electrifies.

“What we worry about is how competitive will we be on the global stage as the market continues to advance around us,” Michael Robinet, vice president of forecast strategy at auto market intelligence firm S&P Global Mobility, said during a panel Wednesday on industry trends.

Electrification in the US

Including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week. Compare that to China, which saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles last year, and Europe, which saw a 33% increase. (U.S. pure-EV market share was just under 8% in 2025, with 1.23 million EVs sold — a slight decline from 2024.)

None of that seemed to alarm President Donald Trump earlier this week when he toured the Ford River Rouge Complex, which churns out pickup trucks and more in suburban Dearborn. Trump used his time in Detroit to boast of policy changes on EVs and tariffs that he says have boosted U.S. automakers.

“Among my first acts in office was to end the radical left war on oil and gas and stop the crusade to kill American energy and, frankly, to open up cars so that you don’t have to have an electric car,” Trump said in remarks to an economic club before the plant tour.

Trump revoked a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric, and has tried to block money obligated to EV charging across the nation’s highways. Under Trump, Congress cut tax incentives that saved buyers up to $7,500 on an EV purchase. The administration has also weakened fuel economy standards — going so far as eliminating penalties for the automakers who do not meet them — and gas mileage rules.

“I love electric cars. I think they’re great,” Trump added. “But I’ve been saying it for four years. They wanted everybody to have an electric car in a very short period of time.”

Those changes have cut into the U.S. industry in 2025 and cost automakers billions of dollars in investment.

Ford Motor Co. announced last month $19.5 billion in charges from electrification efforts and ending production of the all-electric version of the F-150 Lightning truck. Detroit rival General Motors also recently announced $6 billion in EV-related charges, among other losses, and has also rolled back some of its EV commitments. Even once- market leader Tesla had a tough 2025.

“I still push for it because, I mean, it is the future of the company,” said Shawn Strain, marketing manager at Ford. “We still are just completely committed to EVs. And it may not be as overt as we once were.”

Industry concern arises

But industry experts at and outside of the show say it’s a tough time. The competitive auto landscape has been radically reshaped, they say, and China dominates what most see as the future of the industry.

“We have to look at what we’re up against. In a word — China,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a speech at the show Thursday. “China wants to dominate every part of auto manufacturing. They’re making major headway.

“They’ve captured major market share almost everywhere except the U.S. and Canada,” she added. “We have to meet these challenges.”

Will Roberts, automotive research lead at Benchmark Minerals that released the 2025 data, warned that U.S. policy has made all the difference.

American automakers have responded to those changes, he said, but it would be good strategy if they made sure they were “keeping things ticking along in the background with a really compelling EV offering.”

Otherwise, the U.S. sector runs the risk of falling behind, Pete Buttigieg, former transportation secretary under former President Joe Biden, agreed.

In another panel at the show, Buttegieg said Trump can’t stop electric vehicles from becoming the leading automotive technology.

“But he can stop America from being the leader in that technology,” Buttigieg said. “Industry should point a different direction.”

The U.S. has completed the first sales of Venezuelan oil that are part of a $2 billion deal reached this month between Caracas and Washington, a U.S. official told Reuters on Wednesday. The first sales were valued at $500 million, with additional sales expected in the coming days and weeks, the official said.

President Donald Trump's administration has said it will sell up to 50 million barrels of the country's stranded oil and will keep selling produced Venezuelan oil indefinitely.

In December, oil buyers in Asia demanded deep discounts on Venezuelan crude due to a flood of sanctioned oil from Russia and Iran on offer and to the heightened risk of loading in the South American country, traders said. Due to quality issues with the oil and U.S. sanctions, state oil company PDVSA had been forced to slash prices, with the discount to Brent benchmark crude about double year-ago levels.

With Russian and Iranian supplies also sold at deep discounts, buyers in China were barely biting at offers of Venezuela's flagship Merey heavy crude at $14 per barrel below Brent, a trader involved in sales to Chinese independent refiners said in December.

This week, Venezuelan heavy crude Merey-16 oil was offered for U.S. Gulf Coast delivery at a discount of around $6 to Brent crude futures, a trader said on Wednesday, while Western Canadian Select at Houston settled at a roughly $12.50 discount to Brent on Tuesday.

Jared Polis’ 2026 State of the State address to the Colorado General Assembly, which he delivered at about 11 a.m., Jan. 15.

Your Excellencies Madam Speaker and President Coleman, and Minority Leaders Caldwell and Simpson, thank you, welcome to my final State of the State address. I am truly humbled to be here as your Honorable Governor. It has been such an honor to be your Governor.

To my family, who have been on this journey since day one. Thank you, Marlon, for your unwavering support and for your inspiring work as Colorado’s First Gentleman on animal protection, recycling and composting, voter participation, and LGBTQ rights, and for being an incredible father to our children. I know you’re relieved that we are nearing the end. To my mom and dad, who have been here every step of the way. My sister and brother, who are amazing. To my kids, you should be in school!

To my friend and partner on this long journey, my Lieutenant Governor, Dianne Primavera. Thank you for all you do every single day to serve our state. Your strong moral compass, passion and strength have been an inspiration to our administration and helped us to navigate so many hard issues. Our state is better because of your service.

To my chiefs of staff, Lisa, Rick, Alec, David, thank you for steering the ship with joy, fortitude, and steadfast dedication to our fellow Coloradans.

And to my senior staff, cabinet, and our incredible team across state government who have contributed to my administration, thank you. It is with your expertise and commitment to service that we’ve achieved even bigger and bolder than we could have imagined.

Seven years ago, I stepped up to the plate as your Governor: baseball aficionado, gamer, tech geek, a head mostly full of hair, ever-hopeful Rockies fan, well, hopeful back then.

At the time, I certainly couldn’t have predicted all that we would face as a state and a nation.

There’s all that we planned and worked for to put Colorado ahead of the curve. Shared achievements like:

Delivering on the promise of free kindergarten and preschool, saving families thousands and giving our youngest learners a strong start.

Building out low-cost clean energy for more Coloradans to save money on energy bills, protecting our air and water, and creating good-paying jobs.

Making it easier and more affordable – even free in many cases – to get the skills needed to get a good job.

Breaking down barriers to housing for Coloradans at every budget. Getting rid of the Budget Stabilization Factor and fully funding our schools.

Cutting income taxes three times and property taxes five times while supercharging the earned income and child tax credits. Establishing the Family Affordability Tax Credit, which helped cut child poverty rates by nearly 41%. Today, Colorado boasts the lowest childhood poverty rate in the nation.

Generating more than $470 million each year in new funding for our roads, bridges, and transit – with the vast majority of that funding going to roads and bridges.

There’s the “pinch me” moments, when we seized opportunity and we called our shot to deliver monumental achievements for Colorado.

Becoming the new home of the world-renowned Sundance Film Festival.

Keeping the Broncos in Denver with the revitalization of Burnham Yard.

Standing atop Fishers Peak, Colorado’s 42nd state park.

Bringing the M-L-B All-Star game to Colorado, boosting our economy as the world recovered from the pandemic.

Receiving Colorado’s first COVID vaccine shipment, marking a historic scientific achievement and the return to life lived together.

Celebrating President Biden’s designation of Camp Hale as a national monument, an effort I helped begin more than 15 years ago during my time in Congress. First Pup Gia, who is also here with us today, accompanied me to that signing. The Denver Post front page picture celebrating the new monument featured Gia front and center!

Earning national recognition as the epicenter of quantum computing technology.

And then, there’s the curveballs that come with the job. The unforeseen events that altered and shaped the trajectory of our state forever.

COVID was unlike anything we’d ever faced before. While the world plunged into uncertainty, we came together to support our brave and dedicated doctors, nurses, and frontline workers, and charted a path forward to chart hospital capacity.

At the height of the pandemic, we held three press conferences a week to help explain to Coloradans frankly what we knew – and what we didn’t know, too. Leading with data and science, we shared the most up-to-date information to empower Coloradans to make informed decisions, weigh their risks, and choose how to best protect themselves and their families.

And when Washington told states to figure it out for themselves, we all stepped up for Colorado. We quickly expanded life-saving tests, PPE, and when they were finally available, thanks to President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, vaccines too. and pushed hard to be one of the first states to safely get our schools and economy back up and running.

With the expertise of our Department of Public Health and Environment Director Dr. Jill Ryan and her team, and my then Chief of Staff Lisa Kaufmann, Colorado led the country in wastewater testing, and made it easier and quicker for Coloradans to get a COVID test. I am proud we had among the quickest vaccine uptakes of any state.

In the middle of it all, we came together to deliver on the promises we made long before the pandemic hit. Democrats, Republicans, and my Administration all worked together to keep Coloradans safe while at the same time, passing free preschool and historic transportation funding. When we work together, we do big things.

And because 2020 was the year that kept on giving, we also faced the three largest wildfires in the history of our state. The next year, we faced the Marshall Fire, the most destructive fire in Colorado history. I want to recognize and thank Department of Public Safety Director Stan Hilkey, Director of the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention & Control Mike Morgan, Director of the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management Kevin Klein, Chief of the Colorado State Patrol Matt Packard, Colorado National Guard Adjunct General (and now-acting CPW director – thank you for coming out of retirement) Laura Clellan, and the many, many more Coloradans involved for their steady, skilled leadership through Colorado’s most trying times.

We witnessed horrific mass shootings at the STEM School in Highlands Ranch, Club Q in Colorado Springs, King Soopers in Boulder, and most recently at Evergreen High School. We endured a horrific antisemitic attack on Pearl Street Mall in Boulder.

And grief has also struck right here in our State Capitol, with the sudden and tragic passings of our colleagues Senator Faith Winter and Minority Leader Hugh McKean.

To honor their legacy and all we’ve lost, the work continues. As Faith would say, we will “lift as we rise.”

For all of us here, we’re going to bat for Colorado’s future, to leave our great state even better than we found it.

Seven years ago, some thought our bold goals were far-fetched. I’ve got the receipts, I mean headlines, doubting if I’d be able to get it all done.

From 2019: Will Polis Get Full-Day Kindergarten, Or Will Colorado Give Another Flaky Promise? One year later, headlines read: Colorado’s Free, Full-Day Kindergarten Boosted Enrollment By Nearly 25%.

In my first year, the intrepid reporters at the Colorado Sun published a tracker of my campaign promises. 9News even wrote a song about it!

Now, I appreciate their help holding us accountable for our bold goals. Although, I did notice they stopped keeping track because it’s not as exciting when we keep delivering on our promises.

But for me, it’s always been about delivering real results, not headlines. To me, politics is simple: you say what you’re going to do, and then you do it.

We posted a transparent dashboard to share month-by-month updates with Coloradans on our progress delivering wildly important goals – what we call WIGs – for each agency. We are bringing ease and convenience to government services with mobile DMV offerings and the myColorado app, used by nearly 2 million Coloradans.

And when it comes to turning my bold agenda into a better daily life for Coloradans, we haven’t always succeeded on our first try. But we’ve always stepped back up to the plate – because that’s what we do in Colorado.

We are in this work to make life better, more affordable, safer for all Coloradans.

Meanwhile, over the past 12 months, it seems Washington is in it to break it all down. To make life harder and less affordable. To make Americans feel more fearful, more belligerent, more vulnerable.

In the last month alone, the Trump administration has threatened over $1 billion in funding for Colorado, and is making life more expensive and more difficult across our state.

Mean cuts target short-term support for the most basic and essential needs for Colorado families and threaten child care support that Colorado families and child care centers rely on. The President denied two major disaster relief requests for the Lee and Elk fires and devastating flooding in Western Colorado, hurting Coloradans and our recovery efforts, and went on to veto Lauren Boebert, Michael Bennet, and John Hickenlooper’s unanimous, bipartisan bill to finally complete the pipeline providing clean water to rural Colorado, a project first promised under JFK. All while threatening to dismantle NCAR, a global leader in weather and global sciences, and a crown jewel of American scientific achievement.

That’s before you get to the devastating impacts HR 1 had on our state, gutting our state budget by $1 billion overnight, eliminating Coloradans’ TABOR refunds, and slashing Medicaid and SNAP.

All the while, tariff taxes on Coloradans are driving up costs on everything from groceries to medicine. Trump’s tariffs alone are expected to cost Coloradans on average $1,700 for a single year. Tariffs hurt all of us, and make it unaffordable to live.

Since day one, we’ve worked together to save Coloradans money. To strengthen international trade and make our state the best place to start and grow a business.

Four years ago, I stood here and sang about finding 50 ways to save Coloradans money, and we went on to deliver over 100. We’re saving the average Colorado family of four over $600 dollars a year on income and property taxes, and last year Colorado taxpayers saved nearly $2.5 billion.

Just as we came together during the special session to close corporate tax loopholes, I am hopeful that we can come together again to cut the income tax rate.

We are fighting – hard – to protect every federal dollar owed to Colorado. In partnership with Attorney General Weiser, the state has successfully defended nearly $900 million.

But there’s over $1 billion more lost or at risk from illegal Trump administration cuts.

Washington Republicans – once the self-proclaimed party of states’ rights and small government – today are too often the party of socialism, overreach, and intrusion into people’s daily lives in ways wholly out of the scope of government. Picking corporate winners and losers, co-opting capitalism with cronyism. It often feels like Big Government is in our wallets, our doctor’s offices, in our homes, bullying businesses of all sizes.

This is not the Colorado Way.

Driving up costs with tariff taxes is not the Colorado Way.

Ripping away critical food and health access is not the Colorado Way.

Tearing families apart with a costly and cruel immigration agenda is not the Colorado Way.

Today, nearly 75% of people held in immigration detention centers have no criminal history. In America in 2026, a culture of fear and chaos means families debate going to work or sending their kids to school out of fear they won’t come home. The words on the Statue of Liberty beckoning those who come to “breathe free” ring hollow against the cruel realities we are facing today.

This is not who we are. Since day one, I’ve worked to build a Colorado for All.

It’s a mission that reflects our shared commitment to a compassionate, kind Colorado for everyone, and one that I hope and trust will continue well beyond my administration.

In the words of Aurora Smoky Hill High School graduate Bowen Yang, “the only way forward is to be joyous and to celebrate each other.”

At a time when Washington is peddling the illusion that America somehow isn’t for everyone – that somehow there’s only room for some – some people, some beliefs, some love, some prayer – I want to make it clear:

In our Colorado for All, there is room – and opportunity – for all of us.

In our Colorado for All, we welcome immigrants and refugees who seek to build a better life here, who strengthen our economy and enrich our communities under the shelter of our democracy.

In our Colorado for All, an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.

In our Colorado for All, we safeguard our fundamental freedoms, protecting the right to be who you are, marry who you love, and choose when or if to start a family.

There is space in our great big hexahectaenneacontakaiheptagonal state for all of us. We are a state of adventure seekers chasing mountain peaks and fresh powder, of wide-eyed entrepreneurs, artists, devout Coloradans of faith, poets, vegans, soccer moms and ultimate frisbee dads, hunters and union workers, farmers and ranchers, and yes, immigrants and refugees.

We respect our differences, and we are stronger and better off because of our rich diversity. In our Colorado for All, hope and kindness are part of our DNA.

The legacy of Jane Goodall, who had a special place in her heart for Colorado, lives on, as we take inspiration from her words, “hope does not deny evil, but is a response to it.”

Hateful and divisive rhetoric rarely stops at just words. We are seeing online vitriol spill over into horrific violence, including right here on our doorstep.

Enough is enough.

We refuse to sit idly by as a culture of targeting our fellow human beings festers in this country that we love.

In words and actions, we must reject the politics of division and the poison of blind hatred by doubling down on respect, kindness, compassion, and truly learn to disagree better.

These are the values that also guide our solidarity with those around the world fighting for freedom as we speak, in Iran and Venezuela, and in solidarity with the brave Ukrainian people in their continued fight against Russian aggression.

In my first State of the State address, I shared a story of a conversation Marlon and I had with our kids. Our then-6 year-old wanted to know the difference between the various political parties. And at the end, he went over to his four year old sister and asked, “What political party are you in?” And without missing a beat, she answered, “the Happy Birthday Party.”

Colorado’s kids are wise in ways that we could all use a little more of.

This year, we will celebrate our state’s 150th birthday, and our country’s 250th. Let’s come together and honor these historic milestones, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as the Happy Birthday Party.

Housing

And we head into our special birthday tackling our shared challenges. Coloradans – of all political stripes, in every part of our state – tell us that the high cost of housing makes it harder to live in the Colorado we love.

In “Field of Dreams,” starring Colorado Rancher Kevin Costner, the wind whispers, “if you build it, he will come.” Or, as we say, if you build it, opportunity will come.

For too long, we’ve run up against roadblocks – from outdated laws to piles of paperwork – that slow or stop new housing, new transit, and new clean energy from even being built.

It reminds me of the words of Taylor Swift and, maybe Kevin Bommer too – “I’ll sue you if you step on my lawn.”

Not us – we say, let us build!

We’ve empowered Coloradans with the freedom to build an ADU on their property, and let homeowners – not the government – make decisions about how much parking is needed, thanks to the bipartisan work of Senators Amabile, Hinrichsen, Exum, Mullica, and Representative Weinberg.

The benefits are even greater than we could have imagined, just ask Speaker Pro Tem Boesenecker whose mother-in-law now lives in an ADU in his own backyard!

We’ve unlocked more housing near transit, opened the door to single – or smart – stair homes, and broken down barriers to lower-cost modular housing, tackled by Speaker Pro Tem Boesenecker, and Woodrow, alongside Senators Ball and Bridges.

And at long last, we tackled construction defects liability to build more condos, unlocking the promise of homeownership for more Coloradans thanks to the work of President Coleman and Senator Roberts.

We put our skin in the game: speeding up contracting times through the Department of Local Affairs, with the department now turning around contracts for new housing in 33 days, down from 61 days a year before. Under Maria De Cambra’s leadership in partnership with the Housing Consortium, we launched the innovative housing hub to make it easier to apply for affordable rental housing tax credits.

We stood up the Educator First Housing initiative to help 3,000 teachers buy their first home thanks to the work of Senators Amabile and Frizell and Representative Lukens.

Through Proposition 123, we’ve built over 10,000 new homes across the state, including in rural communities who are building state-supported affordable housing for the first time.

And there’s more to be done.

As Colorado-born Ji-Young Yoo, the voice of the iconic Zoey in KPop Demon Hunters says, “I do have one idea… Actually, 57, but let’s start with my favorite.” I share Zoey’s enthusiasm when I think of the 57 – or maybe even more – ways we can unlock more housing at lower cost.

This year, we want to ensure local governments have the resources they need to build and improve bus and train stations, and to pair these investments with more housing near transit. I want to thank Speaker McCluskie, Representative Woodrow, and Senators Roberts and Exum for taking this on.

The Housing Opportunities Made Easier, or HOME Act, will open the door to more housing by partnering with higher education, nonprofits, transit agencies, school districts, and housing authorities to build on underutilized land. With Speaker Pro Tem Boesenecker, Representative Mabrey and Senators Exum and Gonzales leading the way, these steps are expected to significantly cut down on building times for new housing.

Coloradans are eager to be a part of the housing solution. For example, in Edwards, the Eagle County School District opened up Miller Flats Apartments with 37 homes for district employees conveniently located near schools, parks, and transit.

We’ve given homeowners the freedom to do more with their property. It’s only the start. By making it easier to subdivide and sell your property, we can boost the supply of affordable starter homes and help Coloradans to stay in their homes.

Together, we’ve worked hard to make the senior homestead exemption flexible and portable, help seniors downsize and free up homes for young families. We can and must make good on our promise to seniors by funding the senior homestead exemption this year.

Doing so will require finding $200 million dollars in one time funding this year. Converting Pinnacol is the way to shore up our workers compensation system to better protect workers, ensure Pinnacol can compete and thrive in today and tomorrow’s marketplace, provide some relief with the budget shortfall, and make good on our bipartisan promise to seniors.

Once you have a home you can afford, keeping up with the costs that come with it is the next challenge. That starts with homeowners insurance which costs too much.

This year we must bring homeowners insurance rates down. Costs continue to skyrocket, up 91% or an average of $2,000 since 2019, and Coloradans in wildfire prone areas are having a harder time even finding insurance.

There are tools at our fingertips that can help bring down homeowners insurance rates.

While we might not tackle the entire challenge overnight, it’s long past time we start, with steps like making hail resistant roofs more affordable, and reducing fire risks, we can drive down claims and lower premiums. Thank you Speaker McCluskie, Representative Brown, Senators Amabile and Snyder, for taking on this urgent issue.

The more we do here to bring down costs, the more opportunity opens up for Coloradans in the ways that matter most – where we live, and how we spend our time and money.

Transit

Five months into my time as Governor, an 8.5 million pound boulder fell smack dab in the middle of Highway 145 just outside of Dolores, Colorado, leaving an eight foot trench in the middle of the road.

When I learned that it would cost the state $200,000 more to get rid of the rock than to reroute the highway I found another way.

I’m a rock tumbling enthusiast, much to Marlon’s chagrin – for those who aren’t familiar, check it out! But there was no way to tumble this particular rock. And so, heeding the wise words of the Beatles, we “let it be.”

This is the same common-sense I’ve used to make it easier, safer, and more affordable to get around our state, whether you choose to do so by car, bike, foot, bus, or train.

Today, getting around takes up too much of Coloradans’ budgets and time, and puts out too much pollution. We’re showing that there’s a better way forward for Coloradans, one with more choices and greater convenience.

We’ve re-paved 2,500 miles of roads in the past five years alone. Under the leadership of CDOT director Shoshana Lew, we’ve tackled long-neglected projects including Floyd Hill, to finally get drivers over Floyd Hill safely and quickly, taking away the scary drive that too many of us can relate to going to or from our incredible Rocky Mountains.

When I took office in 2019, there were 18,000 electric vehicles driving around Colorado, our energy office director Will Toor was one of those early adopters! Today, Will no longer feels lonely, with more than 204,000 electric cars on Colorado’s roads. We’re #1 nationally for percentage of electric vehicle sales, and by embracing these clean, quiet, fun to drive cars, we’ve cut emissions by nearly 600,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year.

Folks: we got all of this done because of policy.

Working with Senator Weissman, we want to make it even more affordable to get an electric vehicle by directing savings to lower-cost electric vehicles.

The lion’s share of additional transportation funding we’ve secured has gone to roads and bridges. But we know we can’t just build our way out of the congestion that is robbing too many Coloradans of our free time and money.

That is why we’ve also supercharged state support for transit.

We are blazing a trail on cost-efficient passenger rail, and we’re doing it in record time. With a new lease and access agreement to begin Mountain Passenger Rail service through the Moffat Tunnel, we are turning the promise of daily, year-round service from Denver to Craig into a reality with the first routes from Denver to Granby kicking off about a year from now.

Looking to the Front Range, we are on the precipice of delivering a joint service partnership from Denver to Fort Collins, working closely with CDOT, RTD, and local governments to get Front Range Passenger Rail across the finish line.

I want to thank Lisa Kaufmann for her amazing work on passenger rail, and before that she thought being Chief of Staff was a hard job!

The success of Bustang, Snowstang, Pegasus, and Outrider show that Coloradans have a big appetite for reliable, affordable bus transit options. In the past five years alone, Bustang ridership has increased fivefold to reach nearly 2.3 million riders to date.

Bustang now runs 20 routes, with lower fares and exciting partnerships with iconic Colorado events, like the X Games. And we are pursuing long- term sustainable funding so Bustang can continue to grow, providing even better service to even more Coloradans now and in the future.

We’ve made major progress. But the reality is, until we have a world-class metro area transit agency with RTD, we simply cannot meet our climate or affordability goals. This begins with governance changes, increased accountability and transparency, and a stronger partnership between the cities it serves and the transit agency. I want to thank Senators Ball and Jodeh,

Representative Froelich, and the late Senator Winter along with Maria Garcia Berry and the accountability committee for putting together a thoughtful and effective approach for how we can realize a world-class transit agency.

Now, letting our Broncos leave Denver would have been like getting an invite to Taylor Swift’s ‘s wedding and saying no – Which is to say, not an option, And by the way, Taylor – I’m an excellent officiant, just ask Allie Kimmel.

In all seriousness, the revitalization of Burnham Yard, one of our state’s most historic properties, lays the groundwork for an amazing hub with multimodal transit, shops, restaurants, and entertainment, and of course, the A-F-C-West Champion Denver Broncos. We look forward to beating the Bills this Saturday, and – hopefully – hosting a Super Bowl parade in February.

We are looking at every piece of the puzzle to make it safer and more affordable to get where you need to go. Today, high auto insurance rates – the 5th highest nationally – lead to far too many uninsured drivers, making our roads less safe for all and further driving up rates.

That’s why I launched the Roadmap to Reduce Auto Insurance Premiums, an action plan to improve road safety and lower auto insurance costs.

And by more than doubling the number of wildlife crossings statewide to more than 70, including the world’s largest in Greenland – no, not that Greenland, Greenland, Colorado, leave the other Greenland alone! – we’re reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions by 90%.

We’re putting the days of too much time spent in traffic, too much money to get around, and too much pollution in the rearview mirror, pushing past the way it is to achieve the way it can be.

Education

Twenty-six years ago, I was driving around the state in an old school bus campaigning for the State Board of Education, demanding more investment in Colorado schools to ensure every student could get a high quality education and thrive.

My passion for education is what drew me into public service after starting my career as an entrepreneur, and is what continues to drive my work as Governor.

There are so many ways we can build a bright future for Colorado and almost all of them begin with education. Education is about opportunity and hope.

Colorado students today get a strong start with free preschool and free full day kindergarten, thanks to Representative Sirota and Senator Bridges.

Students head into fully funded schools thanks to our work with the JBC. Indicators of class size are down by one student today from when I first took office – and average teacher pay is up over $13,000 dollars per year.

If you visit a Colorado classroom today, as I did this week in Colorado Springs, you might notice something special about Colorado’s first and third graders. These classes include the first group of Colorado students to go to free preschool and free full day kindergarten.

I’ve met a lot of them in our schools and usually their first question is ‘who are YOU?!,’ sometimes followed by, “I want to be governor when I grow up!”

When I started out as Governor, going to kindergarten for a full day of school, and going to preschool at all was treated like a bonus, not a necessity.

But the data speaks so clearly otherwise.

High-quality early education prevents achievement gaps, and helps with reading, math, and long term success in school, all while saving families $6,300 a year on preschool and $500 a month on full day kindergarten.

Colorado families eagerly raised their hands to sign up for preschool and kindergarten, catapulting Colorado from 27th nationally for preschool enrollment to third under the leadership of Dr. Lisa Roy.

And today, 98% of kindergarteners take advantage of free-full day kindergarten.

We’ve dedicated historic funding to Colorado classrooms, increasing funding per student from just over $8,000 in 2019 to nearly $12,000 today, and finally with the leadership of Speaker McCluskie, Assistant Minority Leader Bacon, and the Joint Budget Committee, tackled the beast – the Budget Stabilization Factor that for more than a decade hamstrung our schools with too little funding.

At the same time, we’ve worked to protect school funding and the services Coloradans rely on from a rainy day or recession. When I took office, the state’s budget reserves were at 7.25% and today, we’re in the double digits with 13% in the bank.

While our reserves took a minor dip after President Trump and Congress torched our budget last year, we’re on track to get our reserves back up to 15% in the coming years.

In Colorado, we’re doing our part to help our talented, hardworking educators do what they do best: shaping the next generation of learners and leaders.

Each of us can remember a teacher, or likely several, who helped us become who we are today. I want to thank all of the teachers here today, and across Colorado, for your incredible contributions to our state now and into the future.

Workforce

A good education gives students a head start right out of the box, and high-quality skills and workforce development help Coloradans cross home plate to a good job.

Last year, Colorado high school students enrolled in a record 146,000 courses through our Community College System, earning college credit before graduating and saving over $71 million in tuition costs.

Today we are joined by Mariah, a Nursing student at CSU Pueblo. Thanks to concurrent enrollment opportunities, Mariah earned two credentials and completed the first three years of her Bachelor’s, while still in high school at Swallows Charter Academy in Pueblo. And today, Mariah is working in an ICU in Colorado Springs while completing her studies. Welcome, Mariah!

Through the bipartisan National Governors Association, my Chair Initiative: Let’s Get Ready: Educating All Americans for Success, kickstarted a long-overdue national conversation about how we better connect the skills students get in school with those that lead to a good job.

Now, we are putting the lessons learned from Let’s Get Ready into practice. Alongside six other states, led by both Democratic and Republican governors, we are tracking student readiness in real-time with a new dashboard to more accurately and quickly evaluate if students are ready for and successful at what comes next.

We’re saving Coloradans money with free and low-cost training opportunities, and making the first two years of college free for many Coloradans, thanks to the bipartisan work of Speaker McCluskie, Representatives Taggart, Senators Kirkmeyer and Mullica.

As one of the largest employers in the state, we’re leading by example by hiring for the right skills instead of the right degree, putting an end to the days where good candidates were turned away just because they don’t have a college degree.

Our workforce investments are bold, innovative, and nation leading. And while there’s a lot to be proud of, it’s not enough.

People change jobs more frequently nowadays.

And yet, our job training system is not working for every Coloradan. It’s a maze of more than 20 divisions, offices, and units across seven state departments. The 110 programs available have different eligibility requirements, applications, and outcome measures. I will now read the names of all 110 workforce programs. There will be a quiz at the end.

But seriously, if even I can’t name them all, how can we expect everyday Coloradans trying to get ahead to figure out how to navigate this maze?

Transformative results require bold action. That is why we are calling for a unified department to serve as a one-stop-shop for Coloradans to access high-quality skills, training, apprenticeships, and education. This bipartisan effort led by Speaker McCluskie, Representative Taggart, and Senators Bridges and Frizell is truly poised to unlock opportunity and prosperity for all Coloradans.

Helping Coloradans get job-ready is another way we are making Colorado the best place to work and do business. Today, we are proudly home to a robust business-friendly ecosystem, ranked the top state for female entrepreneurs three years in a row, and fourth best business environment overall by US News and World Report. With Eve Lieberman at the helm of our Office of Economic Development and International Trade, companies continue to thrive in Colorado. Businesses like Boom Supersonic, a $1.5 billion dollar company that started in a Denver basement and is now building a supersonic passenger jet that could get from Denver to London in just over five hours.

My own career is one that in its earliest days was shaped by the promise of emerging technology – at the time, internet 1.0 – when I launched an internet service provider from my college dorm room. This experience taught me a lot about how technology is a tool that can and must be used to maximize opportunity and innovation.

Along those same lines, AI has tremendous potential – but I assure you, did not write this speech! We must act thoughtfully to embrace innovation while empowering consumers.

Today, we are called upon to ensure Colorado remains a leading state for artificial intelligence for both businesses and consumers. Now is the time to get this done in a way that drives innovation and protects Coloradans.

In my time as Governor, one of the greatest honors has been serving alongside the talented men and women who work for state government. We are so fortunate to have such passionate, dedicated Coloradans working across the state, taking on the most difficult challenges we face, and bringing creativity and a commitment to service to their work every single day.

Today, I am honored to be joined by Fidela Jacquez, one of our longest serving state employees whose nearly 50 years in service to Coloradans across the Departments of Public Safety, Transportation, and Revenue, and mentorship of her fellow state employees, has and will continue to make a huge impact on our state now and into the future.

Our efforts to support Colorado’s hardworking and dedicated state employees is further strengthened by our work with Colorado WINS, led by Hilary Glasgow. Thank you Hilary and your team, including President Diane Byrne here with us today, for your passionate advocacy on behalf of our workforce, and for our partnership throughout my governorship.

Health care

Since day one, I’ve taken on special interests and tackled challenges that critics said could never be solved.

When it comes to health care, I would measure our accomplishments against any state in the nation.

Under the leadership of Lieutenant Governor Dianne Primavera and our Office of Saving People Money on Health Care, we’ve tallied nearly three billion dollars in savings for Coloradans even as national costs went up tens of billions of dollars more.

We partnered with bipartisan legislators including Patrick Neville and Pueblo’s own Daneya Esgar on our nation-leading hospital price transparency law. We passed the landmark Colorado Option and bipartisan reinsurance alongside Speaker McCluskie, Senators Jodeh, Rich, and Roberts. We brought Republicans and Democrats together to put an end to surprise billing. We’ve made six behavioral health care sessions free for Coloradans under 18 with Senator Michaelson Jenet. Thanks to the efforts of Senators Gonzales and Weissman, Representatives Froelich and Zokaie, we built in needed protections to assure Coloradans that if they are in need of emergency care and their doctor recommends an abortion to save their life, they will not be turned away.

With the leadership of Division of Insurance Commissioner Mike Conway, we created a first-in-the-nation group that is finally capping the cost of the most expensive drugs and we know we’re on the right track, because we’ve already been sued twice by big pharma. Years before the federal government, alongside Senator Roberts we capped the price of insulin.

Despite all this – and more – we’re not where we need to be.

High-powered and well-funded corporate interests have proven to be deeply entrenched in our politics. It’s like the Avengers fighting Thanos. We are up against big hospitals, pharma, and insurance, alongside a federal government often eager to cozy up to these special interests.

Colorado’s application to import lower-cost prescription drugs from Canada – thanks to the leadership of Kim Bimestefer and Senator Rodriguez – languishes in Washington, first under President Biden and now under President Trump and RFK Jr.

The reality is, the incentives are simply FUBAR. Americans are getting screwed on health care.

Today, hospitals rake in billions of dollars in profits, and actually get away with charging $5,000 for an ice pack, $600 for a bandaid, while insurance companies and pharma raise prices on consumers. I was perhaps a bit naive to think I’d be able to pull together a coalition to fight back against such absurd charges.

Too often, we fight over incremental progress, and when we stand up for systemic change, we are met with the might of the medical industrial complex and their highly effective scare tactics. I saw this firsthand when I was in Congress working to pass the Affordable Care Act, and I’ve seen it time and time again as Governor.

It’s truly mind-boggling that every other industrialized Western country in the world has figured out a way to provide universal health care at a baseline for everyone. Japan spends less than half of what America spends on health care, and their average lifespan is six years longer.

Let me be clear. Our dedicated doctors, nurses, and providers work around the clock to give Coloradans great care. Our essential safety-net hospitals – especially in rural communities – are filling the gap while fighting tooth and nail to keep their doors open, made all the more difficult with the federal government taking a sledgehammer to Medicaid.

Fixing the broken cycle is not about spending more. We’re already doing that and it ain’t working.

The federal government today makes up about half of health care payers through Medicare and Medicaid – it’s long past time the feds start negotiating with prescription drug companies and hospitals and actually drive down costs.

Instead, premiums are skyrocketing across the country after Congress failed to extend the tax credits that millions of Americans rely on to keep health care affordable. In some ways, it’s one of those $600 bandaids, but has at least prevented major increases in insurance premiums.

In Colorado, we’re doing the best with what we have by maximizing efficiency and refusing to let Medicaid, the payer we do have, fail.

The reality is that health care expenses are rising far faster than the rest of our budget. We must take action to bring Medicaid costs to a more sustainable level and protect access for the 1.2 million Coloradans who rely on Medicaid.

The numbers are stark – I almost brought my charts, but I’ll spare you. Ask a JBC member, we can’t afford to keep growing Medicaid at its current pace while still funding schools, roads, and public safety.

So let’s focus on spending less, covering more people, and getting better health outcomes.

As Babe Ruth famously said, “never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game.” Let me be clear. We’ve been in the game and we’re giving it our all.

But when it comes to health care, special interests like big hospitals, big pharma, big insurance and Pharmacy Benefit Managers, are the umpires and have way too much influence to call the pitches the way they like.

We will continue fighting for Coloradans, but ultimately, we need Washington to step up and take real action on a real solution. Call it what you will – a social insurance model, multi-payer universal health care, Medicare for All, a single payer system with private insurance and care on top – no matter the jargon, the outcome is what matters: health care for everyone at lower costs.

It’s long past time Washington got on the side of hardworking Americans, and out of the pockets of special interests.

Public safety

Just like our health, our safety is also critical to being able to lead a good life.

When I set the bold goal to make Colorado one of the ten safest states in the nation, we got right to work taking data-driven, common-sense steps to prevent crime in the first place, better equip law enforcement, and crack down on crime.

We’re seeing real progress. A new report from our Division of Criminal Justice shows that In the past year, violent crime is down over 13%. Property crime is down nearly 18%, representing nearly 14,000 fewer crimes. Through targeted investments and increased penalties, we’ve achieved a 61% decrease in auto theft in four years, including a 34% drop in the last year alone. In a single year, we’ve seen a 95% decline in catalytic converter theft in Denver.

Thanks to the support of voters, we are boosting state support for local law enforcement through Proposition 130, which I proudly supported. This year, the first round of $15 million in funding will go to local law enforcement to boost recruitment, retention, and training.

We are endlessly grateful for the service, bravery, and dedication of Colorado’s law enforcement officers, veterans, and service members. I want to thank all those here with us today for serving our state and nation with pride, ensuring our safety and security.

Keeping Coloradans safe includes better preparing for, preventing, and responding to the year-round threat of wildfires. We’ve expanded Colorado’s arsenal of firefighting tools, including state-owned helicopters like the Firehawk and multi-mission aircraft, fire engines, crews, and contracted air tankers, to ensure we can act quickly and decisively whenever and wherever a fire breaks out.

Our National Guard servicemembers have been on the frontlines – on the ground and in the air – in the aftermath of Colorado’s devastating fires and floods. Always at the ready, they flew helicopters to drop water on the Cameron Peak and East Troublesome fires, provided real-time data on fire spread, and helped control traffic out of evacuation zones in the Marshall Fire. These are the missions that matter for our communities. I want to recognize the bravery and commitment to service that exemplify our Colorado National Guard, and show our respect for their commitment to helping Coloradans through our hardest moments.

Looking ahead, there is more work to be done to ensure all Coloradans can thrive in safe communities.

While the Trump administration leaves states in the lurch, cancelling $29 million and threatening $19 million more in safety grants owed to Colorado, we are stepping up to do what we can to fill the gap, refusing to leave our safety to chance.

My balanced budget proposal includes support to monitor and protect Coloradans against rising threats of political violence and extremism, along with support for emergency preparedness, response, and recovery to ensure we are prepared to act quickly if disaster strikes. Once again, this is work that we would normally have federal partnership on, but Washington is threatening exactly this funding.

Keeping Coloradans safe includes protecting the spaces we gather, learn, and pray. Today, over 73 non-profits including synagogues, mosques, and churches have made security upgrades with support from the Nonprofit Security grants. Our students deserve to learn free from fear. Our Office of School Safety has supported 239 projects to boost safety and emergency response at 190 schools and districts across Colorado.

Together, under the leadership of Senator Sullivan and so many others – too many to name here – we’ve taken common-sense steps to reduce gun violence while protecting our second amendment rights. The nation-leading red flag law has been enforced over 478 times to protect Coloradans and our communities. Waiting periods, safe and responsible gun storage requirements, and cracking down on ghost guns, help keep all Coloradans safe. Colorado is proud to support responsible gun ownership, including with expanded background checks and making the theft of any firearm a felony. We are protecting the rights of Coloradans to own the gun of their choice while implementing new training for rapid fire and assault-style weapons through Colorado Parks and Wildlife later this year. By cracking down on gun trafficking and illegal firearm activity, we’ve gotten 183 illegal guns off the streets.

To truly keep Colorado safe, we must urgently address gaps in our system related to those who cannot stand trial but are charged with a crime, and ensure that individuals who pose a danger to themselves or others are not just released onto the streets. My supplemental budget request includes funding for the state to work alongside local governments and the judicial branch to pursue appropriate, secure placements and services, and I am asking the legislature to move quickly to get bipartisan legislation to my desk. Thank you to Speaker McCluskie, Minority Leader Caldwell, Senator Amabile, and Minority Leader Simpson for leading bipartisan action.

Environment, clean air

Delivering real results for Coloradans is as much about our values as it is about making life easier and more affordable.

We are showing that it’s possible to cut pollution, lower costs, and spur innovation, following the demands of the market.

By cutting pollution, we are cleaning up our air in ways we can see and feel, helping to reduce bad air quality days, which are down from 65 days in 2021 to 30 days in 2025. My dad in particular appreciates that.

During my time as Governor, the share of energy Colorado gets from low-cost clean sources has grown by nearly 75%, enough power nearly 3 million homes for a year.

I am excited about bright spots like Holy Cross Energy serving Eagle, Pitkin, Garfield, Mesa, and Gunnison Counties. At its peak last spring, Holy Cross generated 96% of its energy from low-cost clean sources.

Meanwhile, Washington DC, is tipping the scales toward expensive, out-of-date coal production that drives up costs, pollutes our air, and subjects all of us to volatile price swings in natural gas. We saw this after the Texas winter storm which drove up energy bills for many Coloradans by nearly $20 a month for years.

In Colorado, we tackle climate challenges head on, instead of burying our heads in a pile of coal. I would say snow, but sadly snowpack this year is only 62% of average.

We’re charging forward on the plan to 100% clean energy to unlock the lowest cost clean energy for Coloradans. By 2030, more than 70% of Colorado’s electricity will come from wind and solar. But we need emerging technologies like geothermal or carbon capture to get us to 100%.

That is why we are taking action alongside Representatives Willford, Senators Weissman and Amabile to maintain the important goal of 100% clean energy while building in needed flexibility to adapt to the realities of federal headwinds.

Now is the time to double down on investment and innovation to build more of what’s needed to power our homes and businesses, including power lines and power plants.

Local governments play a key role in moving energy and transmission projects along, but there is room to grow to ensure permitting across the state is clear, fast, and consistent.

Long before my time as Governor, the oil and gas wars plagued our state. Colorado’s patchwork regulatory environment had few if any meaningful standards.

At best, Coloradans had to worry if oil and gas would be able to drill in their backyard and literally in their living rooms. For far too many Coloradans, this worry became a reality. Even today, the devastating Enterprise Pipeline gasoline spill still impacts Southern Ute Indian Tribe land, showing us the importance of safety.

In my first year as Governor, we passed the most robust regulatory framework for oil and gas in the country, moving drilling operations further from homes and schools. We drilled down to ensure that energy oversight is held to the highest standards, under the cutting-edge Energy and Carbon Management Commission, further supporting innovation in underground geothermal and carbon capture.

I want to thank ECMC Commissioner Jeff Robbins for being with us since day one, dedicating his passion, vision, and expertise to this incredible generationally-important work.

I also want to thank Erin Martinez who bravely shared her story after her home exploded from an undetected gas leak from drilling operations, tragically killing her husband and brother, and all those who paved the way to a safer future for Colorado.

The apocalyptic warnings that our gold-standard regulations would somehow shut down the oil and gas industry in Colorado have proven to be completely unfounded. Today, we have a thriving, robust industry that is electrifying and getting cleaner while adding more protections for health and safety, and is accountable to Coloradans.

We went on to bring responsible oil and gas companies and the environmental community together, preventing costly, divisive ballot measures and creating a new funding stream that moves our state from 42nd in transit funding to 23rd. This work was led by the late Senator Faith Winter, alongside Speaker McCluskie, Representatives Velasco, Willford, Froelich, Bacon and Senator Cutter.

Time and time again, we’ve worked together to tackle the complex challenges we face and chart a sustainable, affordable path forward for Colorado.

From securing our water future, to protecting our wildlife and conserving our public lands, we are taking these lessons with us to prepare for and build resilience to a hotter, drier climate.

Under the leadership of Dan Gibbs with the Department of Natural Resources, we are implementing the visionary Colorado Water Plan and directing over $127 million in new funding to support local water projects. We are seeing record interest in Water Plan Grants, which so far have supported 530 local projects.

Agriculture is on the front lines of drought, and we are helping the next generation of producers get the tools and training needed to adapt to a changing climate. From Water Plan Grants to the transformative work led by Ag Commissioner Kate Greenberg, who just gave birth to her first child earlier this week, we are helping farmers and ranchers to prepare for and build resilience in the face of a hotter, dryer climate.

Looking to the Colorado River, under the leadership of Commissioner Becky Mitchell, we are working to find consensus while protecting the water for Upper Basin states. There is no state better positioned to lead the way to a sustainable future for our namesake river.

In light of the pine beetle outbreak spreading in the Front Range and foothills, we are stepping up to mitigate the most harmful impacts and protect our communities, forests, and key water sources.

We are also stepping up to support our pollinators, the workhorses of our ecosystems who are responsible for one in three bites of food we eat. Together, we are building on our work to protect pollinators from threats faced from some pesticides, including with bills this year led by Senators Kipp and Wallace.

Our treasured public lands are part of the fabric of who we are in Colorado, full of fun and adventure, home to incredible wildlife, and key to our economy.

Elevating enjoyment and care of our great outdoors go hand in hand. We’ve expanded our state parks and wildlife areas by over 90,000 acres, advanced conservation for 270,000 federal acres like the Thompson Divide, and opened up access to over 1 million acres of state trust lands.

We’ve created more than $120 million in new annual funding for the care and conservation of our public lands, including with the Keep Colorado Wild pass that cut the price of a state parks pass by more than half to $29, and growing lottery funding for Colorado’s outdoors. The first-of-its-kind outdoors strategy sets the vision to best care for our great outdoors while putting every dollar to the best possible use.

The moving words of America the Beautiful have connected generations to Colorado’s “Purple Mountains Majesty,” inspired by the beauty of Pikes Peak, where I was earlier this week, we are ensuring that America’s Mountain remains as central to Colorado’s future as it has been to our nation’s past. Through Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s partnerships with Mayor Yemi, Colorado Springs Utilities, the US Forest Service, Great Outdoors Colorado, county and local leaders in the Outdoor Pikes Peak Initiative, and the Pikes Peak Outdoor Recreation Alliance, we are expanding opportunities – including new campgrounds, new trails, even better facilities maintenance – for Coloradans to enjoy and protect this hallowed place for generations to come.

As we look ahead to our state’s 150th birthday, what better way to honor Colorado’s proud history and build toward a bright future than by elevating the care and conservation of our most iconic wild spaces.

Look ahead

Our state’s milestone year is also a milestone for many of us who are embarking on our last year in this building.

I’ve truly enjoyed working with everyone here in this chamber, and those who came before. I want to recognize all of the legislators whose terms have matched up with mine – the class of 2026.

And I encourage all of you to take this year to lead on issues you know I will agree with you on perhaps more than the next governor, whether it’s school choice, eliminating puppy mills, technology innovation, supporting blockchain and crypto, or reducing the income tax, now’s your chance.

And on issues you know I disagree with you on, let’s work together to find agreement. Much to my staff’s chagrin, this year I demanded a special veto pen, after poor Jeff Bridges couldn’t even get a regular one from David when I vetoed his bill.

Conclusion

In the Lord of the Rings, Sam speaks to Frodo, saying “there’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo, and it’s worth fighting for.”

Colorado, there’s so much good, and we keep fighting for more.

There’s good we’ve achieved – more homes for every budget, more ways to get around easier without sitting in traffic, and more opportunities for students at every stage – and the good that we know is still possible, what we continue to fight for.

When I ran to serve as your Governor I promised to be bold – heck, I made a lot of promises, that together, we’ve turned into a reality for Colorado.

Free preschool. Free full day kindergarten. More housing. Less pollution. We dream. We dare. We do.

I’ve been called many things – Colorado’s education governor, marijuana governor, tech bro governor, gay governor, socialist, fascist, communist, capitalist, libertarian. I’ll keep putting in the work and let others decide the labels, but at the end of the day, it’s always been about delivering real results that leave our state better than we found it. And it’s also about showing loving kindness for everyone and everything. I leave you with the advice to be kind and love your fellow human.

Through it all, what will always stick with me are the special moments during my time as Governor – visiting all 64 counties, picking and eating a fresh peach in Palisade, warm from the Colorado sun, the breathtaking view from atop the mesa at Fort Lewis College. Attending church on All Saints Day in Otero County trying with limited success to descend into the only active volcano in Colorado in Dotsero on a wire tied to a tree, taking our kids to see Tarantulas crawl near La Junta, picking Pueblo chiles, surprising seniors for lunch at the San Luis Senior Center. White knuckling it on the drive to the top of Pikes Peak.

Fulfilling a life goal by “playing” Red Rocks with Colorado South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. And, of course, getting married at the Mary Rippon Theater at the University of Colorado Boulder, Marlon’s alma mater.

Speaking at the preschool graduation ceremony for the first class of universal free preschool. Reading to the first class of full-day kindergarteners.

And of course the people. My cabinet, including those who have been here since the beginning, many of whom I’ve already mentioned, along with Joe Barela, Michelle Barnes, Patty Salazar, and Tony Gheradini. Our incredible executive team, Danielle, Kara, Allie, Mark, Conor, Jesse, our entire staff, and their families who have also dedicated so much.

Our spectacular Colorado is matched only by the heart and ingenuity of those who call our great state home.

Seven years ago, I joined you all in delivering my first State of the State address, and shared what an honor it is to be your Governor.

In the time since, forces beyond us have shaped our reality – a once in a century pandemic, widespread inflation, the biggest and most destructive fires in our state’s history, an unpredictable federal landscape, a massive wormhole connecting to the Abyss with an upside down version of Colorado and our only hope is a group of Dungeons & Dragons – playing teens…. Well, maybe not that.

But despite it all, we faced our challenges head on, never losing sight of our values and what makes us who we are. We stared down the abyss, destroyed our metaphorical Vecnas, and delivered big, bold progress for Colorado while rolling a natural 20 on landing Sundance, the All-Star Game, and the quantum accelerator.

In this time of great division, now more than ever we must come together as Coloradans, leading with kindness and respect to move our ONE team, our great state, forward.

The state of our state is strong. Resilient. Loving. Kind. Innovative. Free. And ever bright with the promise of a Colorado for All. So long, and thanks for all the fish.

(KTAL/KMSS) – This year begins a new election year with Louisiana voters deciding who will represent the state in the U.S. Senate. Senator Bill Cassidy is up for re-election and faces challenger Louisiana State Treasurer John Fleming.

Fleming was making stops in Shreveport on Wednesday to speak about his platform. He is opposing the growing technology of carbon capture and carbon sequestration. He said taxpayers are having to support alternative energy sources that are not competitive with traditional energy sources and do not provide grid stability.

He said carbon capture poses eminent domain conflicts between landowners and domestic or foreign companies that can take land for use without properly compensating its owners.

“If elected to the U.S. Senate, the first bill I will submit will be to fully defund and repeal the 45Q tax credits that pay for this. There’s no market for this. People don’t buy this technology. This is purely crony capitalism, where you have the government paying wealthy companies that are going to make a lot of money out of this, and the average landowner is going to suffer from it. So I’ve committed that I will submit the bill that will defund it so that money will no longer be available, and it will stop all these projects,” Fleming said.

The Louisiana legislature approved the state’s use of carbon capture technology in 2020. Governor Jeff Landry signed a moratorium on new projects in October following residents’ concerns.

Here are some key approaches and companies that are making strides in addressing these challenges:

Off-Grid Microgrids and On-Site Generation

One of the most innovative solutions is the development of off-grid microgrids, which can provide independent power to high-demand facilities like data centers.

Vineland Data Center Example: This project is speculated to be a large-scale, fully off-grid power solution using medium-speed natural gas engines paired with kinetic energy storage. ""Evidence points to the 'systemic innovation' teased for months at the Vineland, New Jersey data center being a large-scale, fully off-grid power solution...""

Kinetic Energy Storage: Flywheel-based dynamic stabilization is used to absorb rapid load swings and AI inference spikes, allowing the system to ramp quickly without grid support. ""The proposed configuration appears to rely on medium-speed, ship-class natural gas engines paired with kinetic energy storage rather than traditional chemical batteries.""

Advanced Nuclear Power

Nuclear energy, particularly small modular reactors (SMRs), is seen as a scalable and reliable carbon-free power source.

SMRs: These reactors use different technology that is dramatically safer than legacy reactors. ""Today’s small modular reactors use completely different technology which is dramatically safer than legacy reactors.""

Companies Involved: Companies like SMR, OKLO, and NNE are entering the race to develop and deploy SMRs. ""Lots of companies have entered this race like SMR, OKLO and NNE or use the ETF URA.""

Fuel Cells and Backup Power

Fuel cells offer a flexible solution for power generation, especially during peak demand periods.

Bloom Energy (BE): Provides backup power generation solutions to utility companies using fuel cells. ""Bloom Energy BE provides back up power generation solutions to utility companies using fuel cells to generate power during peak usage periods.""

Grid Infrastructure Upgrades

Investing in the existing grid infrastructure is crucial to handle increased demand and integrate new energy sources.

Quanta Services (PWR): Deeply involved in upgrading and maintaining grid infrastructure, especially for AI data centers and EVs. ""Quanta Services (PWR) is a strong pick deeply involved in upgrading and maintaining grid infrastructure, especially as demand surges from AI data centers and EVs.""

Siemens Energy and GE Vernova: These companies are also benefiting from increased power and grid demand by providing essential components and services. ""Siemens Energy and GE Vernova.""

Energy Data Analysis for Efficiency

Utilizing data to understand and optimize energy consumption can lead to significant efficiencies in urban settings.

NYC Energy Benchmarking: Large buildings in NYC are required to report annual energy benchmarking data, which can be used to detect ""phantom vacancy"" and potential financial distress. ""NYC requires large buildings to report annual energy benchmarking data (Local Law 84).""

Renewable Energy Adoption

While not always innovative in themselves, the scale and speed of renewable energy deployment are notable.

Solar Farms: Countries like China and India are building the largest solar farms in the world. ""China and India are in fact a higher % energy from renewables than even the USA, and have built the largest solar farms in the world.""

High Renewable Percentages: Some countries, like Costa Rica, are producing almost all their energy from renewable sources. ""98% of Costa Rica’s energy production comes from renewable, 'green', sources.""

While debate continues over whether these efforts are lawful, President Trump has sent a clear signal that the United States will have no part in multilateral debates about climate change.","Washington, D.C., January 15, 2026 - President Donald Trump’s recent withdrawal from the foundational United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and 64 other organizations—many of them affiliated with the United Nations—represents a sharp divergence from past Republican presidential administrations that sought to lead international environmental efforts and establish a comprehensive U.S. climate policy, according to declassified U.S. government documents posted today by the National Security Archive.

The UNFCCC, adopted on May 9, 1992, during the final year of President George H. W. Bush’s presidential term, is the overarching, bedrock climate treaty that initially brought together 195 countries to discuss the climate crisis. In the decades since its adoption, the treaty has provided a legal framework and bureaucratic infrastructure that has allowed nations to negotiate measures to address rising global temperatures, such as the annual Conference of Parties meetings. President Trump’s decision to sever ties with the UNFCCC is the administration’s latest attempt to roll back global climate efforts, an action critics say will further isolate the U.S. on the world stage.[1]

In the wake of the current administration’s withdrawal from the landmark treaty, the National Security Archive highlights four key documents about the establishment of the UNFCCC from the period when Bush was vice president under Ronald Reagan and during his own presidential term that ended in 1993. These records shed light on how Bush—in part at the urging of his advisors—sought to position himself as a leader on global environmental issues, even if his policies did not always satisfy the demands of environmental advocates.

While it is true that Republican presidents have often downplayed climate concerns, declassified records show that senior advisors to President George H. W. Bush (as was the case under Presidents Reagan and Nixon) early on recommended that the U.S. try to sever the “link between economic development and deterioration of the environment,” according to a State Department memorandum that laid out the proposed U.S. position for the July 1989 Paris economic summit. U.S. policy should advocate for “wise, active stewardship over the resources of our planet” and recognize that this was a “responsibility we have to ourselves and as our legacy to future generations.” (Document 1)

President George H. W. Bush’s early action on climate and his administration’s role in ushering in the UNFCCC and IPCC laid the groundwork for President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore to help lead global efforts resulting in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which established legally binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions, and shaped U.S. policies under President Obama that led to the 2015 Paris Climate Accords. Indeed, the Reagan and Bush 41 administrations represented the high-water mark of Republican support for multilateral efforts to address climate change, primarily through support for the Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer and establishment of the UNFCCC and the IPCC, the scientific advisory body.

The Bush administration’s approach to the proposed climate change negotiations, like Reagan’s, sought to integrate and balance scientific research with assessments of the potential economic impacts of both climate change and steps to reduce greenhouse emissions. In fact, the Bush administration saw the 1987 Montreal agreement, signed under Reagan, as a model for efforts under the aegis of the UN Environmental Program (UNEP) to draft a UN framework convention on climate change that would guide negotiations on a treaty. However, President Bush and his advisors also had doubts about aspects of the scientific consensus on the topic.

William A. Nitze, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Environment, Health and Natural Resources, presented the U.S. position on global climate change at the initial UNEP session in March 1988 and said the U.S. would continue to take a leadership role. (Document 2) But Nitze, who was a key State Department official under both Reagan and Bush, said that more needed to be learned about the global and regional impacts of climate change and the full range of possible responses before the U.S. would consider a global convention on climate change.

To this end, the U.S. strongly supported creation of an intergovernmental panel to conduct and assess scientific research into the extent and effects of global climate change and the development of a range of possible response strategies. This would later evolve into the IPCC. However, U.S. support came with an important caveat: “Whatever response strategies are finally adopted will have to take into account other social and economic goals.”

The Bush 41 administration continued to push for this approach in the UN discussions surrounding what would become the UNFCCC, which was agreed on at the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, and Nitze stayed closely involved. A memorandum he prepared in August 1989 laid out the general principles that should guide a climate agreement. These included securing the widest possible participation (with a focus on the countries that made up a significant majority of the world’s population and those that produced the highest percentage of greenhouse gases); increasing understanding of the scientific aspects of global climate change; and protecting social, environmental and economic well-being from damaging impacts likely to result from climate change. (Document 3)

While the U.S. continued to emphasize the importance of scientific research and analysis, its positions in the UN discussions continued to reflect a desire to balance environmental protection and economic growth. This dynamic is evident in a memorandum setting out the policy guidelines for U.S. participants in a UN Response Strategies Working Group in September 1989 (Document 4). The memo describes what would become repeated components of U.S. policy preferences, emphasizing the use of market mechanisms in combination with regulations to reduce greenhouse emissions and giving countries the widest possible flexibility in meeting any agreed emission cuts. By the end of Bush’s term, there were signs that the administration’s progress on environmental efforts was stalled by perceived “uncertainty” about the science of climate change.[2]

Nonetheless, the U.S. Senate ratified the UNFCCC in 1992 as a formal treaty by a vote of 92 to 0, and it was signed into law by President Bush. With the election of Bill Clinton later that year, U.S. climate change diplomacy moved to a new stage culminating in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Ultimately, the administration did not submit the agreement to Congress for ratification, and the next administration, under President George W. Bush, withdrew from Kyoto and promoted a more aggressive energy policy led by Vice President Dick Cheney that deemphasized environmental concerns. The U.S. would continue to promote these views at meetings of the UNFCCC during the majority of George W. Bush’s two terms in office and withheld funds for any Kyoto Protocol-related costs. However, Bush did, in fact, demonstrate signs of reengagement with international climate policy in the last two years of his presidency, as seen with his establishment of the Major Economies Process on Energy Security and Climate Change, though it was widely criticized for weakening multilateral environmental negotiating efforts.[3]

President Obama would go on to reclaim a strong U.S. leadership role in the climate sphere, and his second term would culminate in the landmark Paris Climate Agreement. While President Trump, in his first term, ushered in a radical policy of climate change opposition and denial, his decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2017 did not stop the subsequent Biden administration from rejoining the agreement and advancing an ambitious climate agenda at home and abroad.

Now, in President Trump’s second presidential term, the United States has become the first nation ever to attempt to withdraw from the landmark UNFCCC treaty. While debate continues over whether these efforts are lawful, President Trump has sent a clear signal that the United States will have no part in multilateral debates about climate change.[4]",https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/2026-01/banner_second_earth_summit_was_held_in_rio_de_janeiro.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 16:00:30.482349

Textron raised concerns about the North Carolina Court of Appeals’ latest ruling in the legal dispute.
Based in Rhode Island, Textron objects to being sued in a North Carolina court over a 2024 incident that took place in Arkansas.
PDII sued Sky Aircraft Maintenance and its employee, Steve Trent, in North Carolina state court.
Textron “has no physical presence in the state: it has no offices, facilities, bank accounts, or employees here,” according to the state Supreme Court filing.","The US Chamber of Commerce and NC Chamber are asking the state Supreme Court to overturn a lower court ruling that could open the door for more lawsuits against businesses in North Carolina.

A defendant in the case has warned that a December ruling “fundamentally transforms” rules surrounding which companies can be sued in this state’s courts.

Now the US Chamber, NC Chamber, and the General Aviation Manufacturers Association have filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case called PDII v. Sky Aircraft Maintenance. The US Chamber describes itself as the “world’s largest business federation,” representing 300,000 members and “the interests of more than 3 million companies and professional organizations of every size.” The NC Chamber is the state’s “leading business advocacy organization,” according to its court filing.

“The opinion below upset decades of jurisdictional certainty,” the business groups’ lawyers wrote in the brief filed Wednesday. “It will likely increase costs for companies and consumers across the nation while jeopardizing North Carolina’s reputation for promoting business and maintaining a stable legal climate.”

“Other potential effects include unduly burdening our courts, damaging commerce in the state, and reducing state revenue from business registration and investment,” the groups warned.

The North Carolina Supreme Court issued a Jan. 9 order without comment granting a temporary stay in the case.

One defendant, Textron, had requested the stay two days earlier. Textron raised concerns about the North Carolina Court of Appeals’ latest ruling in the legal dispute.

Based in Rhode Island, Textron objects to being sued in a North Carolina court over a 2024 incident that took place in Arkansas. An aircraft runway accident injured two people and rendered the plane a “total loss.”

Textron is registered to do business in this state but “does not actually conduct business in North Carolina,” according to a court filing.

The company filed a motion to have the North Carolina lawsuit dismissed. A trial judge rejected that motion. A unanimous three-judge Appeals Court panel upheld the trial judge’s ruling on Dec. 3.

“The Court of Appeals’ decision fundamentally transforms North Carolina’s law of personal jurisdiction,” Textron’s lawyers wrote. “For the first time, any corporation registered to do business in this state may be sued here by any plaintiff, on any claim, arising anywhere in the world. A Virginia resident injured in Texas can sue in North Carolina. A California business dispute can be litigated in Wake County. The only prerequisite is that the defendant, perhaps decades ago, filed the routine paperwork required to lawfully conduct business here.”

“This is not an incremental development; it’s a sea change,” the court filing continued. “For decades, personal jurisdiction doctrine has asked whether a defendant’s contacts with the forum state justify requiring it to defend a lawsuit there. General jurisdiction — the power to hear any claim against a defendant — has been reserved for forums where a corporation is ‘at home’: its state of incorporation and principal place of business.”

“North Carolina has never been home to Textron, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Rhode Island, and conducting no business in North Carolina,” the company’s lawyers wrote. “Before the decision below, Textron could not have been sued here on claims arising from events in Arkansas, involving an aircraft that Textron did not manufacture.”

Textron accused the state Appeals Court of adopting a “consent-by-registration” theory of jurisdiction. “Under this theory, when a foreign corporation registers to do business in North Carolina, it consents to be sued here on any claim whatsoever,” according to the court filing. “Registration, a ministerial act, becomes a blanket waiver of constitutional protections.”

The US Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Company dealt with similar issues. But that case dealt with Pennsylvania’s “unique statutory scheme, which expressly provides that registration constitutes consent to ‘general personal jurisdiction,’” according to Textron’s filing. “No other state has such a statute, including North Carolina.”

“The Court of Appeals extended Mallory to North Carolina — even while acknowledging that North Carolina’s statutes contain no express consent language,” the court filing added. “This places North Carolina among a tiny handful of jurisdictions to embrace consent-by-registration, at odds with the overwhelming weight of authority from other states.”

“The stakes could hardly be higher,” Textron’s lawyers argued. “The decision affects every foreign corporation and limited liability company registered in North Carolina — thousands of businesses that registered in reliance on settled jurisdictional expectations. It exposes them to litigation with no connection to this state, brought by plaintiffs from anywhere in the country, over conduct occurring entirely elsewhere.”

“It transforms North Carolina into a magnet for forum-shopping and burdens its courts with disputes that have nothing to do with this state or its citizens,” the court filing continued. “And by deterring businesses from registering here — or encouraging them to withdraw — it threatens North Carolina’s economic competitiveness with neighboring states that have rejected this theory.”

North Carolina-based PDII owned the jet involved in the 2024 Arkansas accident. As the pilot attempted to take off, controls were unresponsive. Aborting the takeoff, the plane ran out of runway and ended up running off the runway. During the incident, “one or more elevator cables in the Airplane’s tail snapped during takeoff,” according to the Appeals Court opinion.

PDII sued Sky Aircraft Maintenance and its employee, Steve Trent, in North Carolina state court. The suit also targeted Textron and a separate Kansas-based company, Textron Aviation. “Textron and Textron Aviation do not share employees, offices, accounts, or business operations,” Textron’s lawyers wrote.

Textron “has no physical presence in the state: it has no offices, facilities, bank accounts, or employees here,” according to the state Supreme Court filing. “Unlike Textron Aviation, Textron doesn’t make or sell aircraft or components, so it did not make or sell the component that PDII complains about.”

“Textron doesn’t market aircraft products or services in the state or to its residents,” the filing continued. “Textron doesn’t have any contracts requiring performance in North Carolina. Textron didn’t have any interactions with Sky Aircraft or Trent, the other defendants. Nor does Textron have continuing or systemic contacts with the state.”

The Appeals Court rejected Textron’s arguments.

“North Carolina’s Long Arm Statute provides that state courts will have personal jurisdiction ‘[i]n any action, whether the claim arises within or without this State, in which a claim is asserted against a party who when service of process is made upon such party … [i]s a domestic corporation,’” Judge Julee Flood wrote last month. “Thus, because N.C.G.S. § 55-15-05(b) states that a registered foreign corporation ‘has the same but no greater rights and has the same but no greater privileges as, and is subject to the same duties, restrictions, penalties, and liabilities now or later imposed on, a domestic corporation of like character[,]’ we conclude a registered foreign corporation may sue or be sued to the same extent as a domestic corporation and is subject to personal jurisdiction.”

“[W]e hold a foreign corporation that obtains a certificate of authority consents to general personal jurisdiction in North Carolina; therefore, we affirm the trial court’s order denying Defendant’s motion to dismiss,” Flood explained.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gavel-8436504_1280.jpeg,N,,2026-01-15 19:59:48.295706

The project suspension comes as the company has faced rising project costs and market fears of a looming global oversupply of LNG, but it said it ""remains open to discussions with third parties that may have an interest in developing the project."" Media reports speculated that at least two buyers, including MidOcean Energy LLC, are interested.

The project’s EPC contract was awarded in 2024 to a joint venture of KBR and Technip Energies to convert the existing smaller site gas import facility into an LNG export site, with three new liquefaction trains and an annual capacity of 16.5 million metric tons. The Lake Charles site was set to supply oil giant Chevron with about 3 million tons per year, Energy Transfer said previously.

But analysts note the growing U.S. LNG capacity, with one stating that ""more projects will wither away.""

Energy Transfer also announced last month that it is increasing capacity of the planned Desert Southwest expansion of its Transwestern pipeline from the Texas Permian region across New Mexico into Arizona. The company said the pipeline diameter will expand to 48 in. from 42 in., boosting capacity to 2.3 billion cu ft per day and the project investment to $5.6 billion. The firm cited additional customer demand, particularly driven by population and data center growth, as well as the replacement of coal-fired power plants with natural gas facilities. The pipeline is set to operate by the end of 2029.

Other Southwest pipeline projects include Kinder Morgan's $455-million Gulf Coast Expansion Project, which will increase Permian Basin gas to south Texas markets by 570 million cu ft per day and is set to be completed by mid-year. In the Midwest, TC Energy Corp. has approved the $900-million Northwoods expansion of its ANR line, which it said will add 400,000 cu ft per day of new capacity in Illinois and Wisconsin to support data centers, including 69 miles of new 36-in. and 42-in. line, with service expected by late 2029.

Alaska LNG Marks Milestone

Meanwhile the Alaska LNG project cleared its final updated federal permits in December 2025 in an estimated $45-billion bid led by developer Glenfarne and with the state-owned Alaska Gasline Development Corp. owning 25%, to build a Prudhoe Bay gas treatment plant and carbon sequestration facility and 800-mile gas pipeline from the North Slope to an enlarged LNG export facility south of Anchorage that can produce up to 3.5 billion cu ft per day for export and domestic use.

The project gained its expedited federal Fast-41 permits last month, Alaska LNG said, with the Trump administration's push to accelerate domestic fossil-fuel projects, but timing for a Final Investment Decision and construction start remains unclear. The developer noted preliminary interest from Asian buyers and said it signed a non-binding letter of intent this month with developers of a proposed gold mine in southwest Alaska for long-term energy supply. Australia-based contractor Worley is preparing a final engineering study and cost estimate, developers said last year.

The U.S. EPA has proposed a revision to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, a move that could significantly reshape how states exercise authority over infrastructure projects that may affect water quality.

Section 401 gives states and tribes the power to confirm or deny whether an infrastructure project will comply with applicable water quality standards before any licensing or permits can be issued.

The proposed rule would revise both the timing and scope of Section 401 water quality certifications. It reinforces a maximum one-year deadline for states and authorized tribes to act on a certification request, and eliminates the practice of withdrawing and resubmitting requests to extend review timelines. The proposal also narrows the definition of “water quality requirements” to specific provisions of the Clean Water Act, such as effluent limits, water quality standards, and toxic pollutant controls.

The rule’s intent is to return Section 401 “to its clear statutory boundaries,” said Administrator Lee Zeldin.

While the EPA and many other industry groups maintain that the proposal will reduce permitting delays and help critical infrastructure projects move forward more predictably, some environmental organizations and state officials strongly oppose the rule.

“This latest proposal would strip states and Tribes of their right to protect their waterways from health harming pollution,” the League of Conservation Voters wrote. “It will make our waters dirtier and our families sicker at a time when healthcare costs are already going up for millions.”

In contrast, many manufacturing groups celebrate the proposal. “Too often, the vaguely worded Section 401 has been used as an excuse to block critical infrastructure and trade projects,” said Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.",https://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/image/8592147e/8592147e-f7e8-4c55-a4cb-0acefb0f8bab/usa_topographic_map_gettyimages_173169385.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 17:59:57.309127

Massachusetts and resulting GHG emissions limits promulgated by EPA marked a major shift in the legal landscape targeting GHG emissions.
[12] EPA’s primary justification for rescinding the Endangerment Finding and repealing GHG regulations is that such actions exceed EPA’s authority under the CAA.
Furthermore, once finalized, the Endangerment Finding rescission will face its own formidable legal challenges.
[1] Proposed Rule: Reconsideration of 2009 Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Standards | US EPA.","On July 29, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed rescinding its 2009 Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding (Endangerment Finding).[1] Issued by EPA in response to the Supreme Court’s 2007 holding in Massachusetts v. EPA (Massachusetts) affirming EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under the Clean Air Act (CAA),[2] the Endangerment Finding supported a wide variety of regulatory programs intended to reduce GHGs from automobiles, power plants, and oil and gas production.[3] In light of this federal regulation, the Supreme Court determined in a 2011 landmark decision (AEP v. Connecticut) that the CAA and GHG regulatory programs adopted pursuant to it displaced federal public nuisance claims by plaintiffs seeking damages from and injunctive relief against large GHG emitters.[4]

EPA now proposes to rescind the Endangerment Finding, arguing that the Supreme Court’s ruling in Massachusetts was incorrect and that the EPA in fact never had the authority under the CAA to regulate GHG emissions.[5] When finalized later this year, EPA’s rescission may undermine judicial rationales like the one in AEP v. Connecticut for dismissing federal or state common law claims, like public nuisance, as being displaced or pre-empted by federal regulatory policies. This in turn could embolden plaintiffs to continue to pursue claims seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief requiring emissions reductions from energy companies, manufacturers and other large GHG emitters.

As further background, Section 202(a) of the CAA directs the EPA administrator to prescribe emission standards for new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines for “air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.”[6] In Massachusetts, the Supreme Court held that EPA (1) has authority to regulate GHG emissions under Section 202(a) of the CAA and (2) must regulate GHG emissions if the EPA administrator concludes that GHG emissions endanger public health and welfare.[7] In the Endangerment Finding, EPA concluded for the first time that GHG emissions cause or contribute to GHG pollution, contributing to climate change and endangering public health and welfare.[8] In the following years, EPA enacted GHG emission control regulations for new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines. EPA also used the substance of the Endangerment Finding to support GHG emission standards for electric power plants and other energy sources.

Massachusetts and resulting GHG emissions limits promulgated by EPA marked a major shift in the legal landscape targeting GHG emissions. For years prior to Massachusetts, states, municipalities, private land trusts and others had brought nuisance claims in federal court against large emitters, seeking both significant damages to pay for the costs of adapting to climate shifts allegedly caused by such emissions and injunctions seeking to limit GHG emissions from these sources. In the 2011 case, AEP v. Connecticut, the Supreme Court concluded that EPA’s authority to regulate GHG emissions under the CAA displaced federal common law claims, often brought under a theory of public nuisance, targeting carbon emissions from power plants.[9] The Supreme Court did not address, and has not addressed, whether the CAA pre-empts state law claims targeting GHG emissions.[10]

With federal common law public nuisance claims displaced, plaintiffs have moved to bring state law nuisance claims and other types of claims, such as greenwashing and false advertising claims, in both state and federal courts. While the number of cases has increased, the Supreme Court is now considering whether to hear a case in which it would address the question of the CAA’s pre-emptive effect on state nuisance law claims, potentially closing off those causes of action to plaintiffs.[11] A Supreme Court decision that the CAA and related regulations pre-empt state law nuisance claims would further limit plaintiffs’ options to use litigation as a mechanism for seeking to reduce GHG emissions.

Now, EPA seeks to rescind the Endangerment Finding and proposes to repeal all GHG regulations for new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines.[12] EPA’s primary justification for rescinding the Endangerment Finding and repealing GHG regulations is that such actions exceed EPA’s authority under the CAA. EPA argues that the “text, structure, and history” of Section 202(a) suggest that GHGs are not air pollutants that endanger public health or welfare under the statute and there is no separate statutory basis to regulate GHG emissions based on climate change concerns.[13] Rather, EPA argues, GHG emissions impact air quality “only indirectly.”[14]

EPA also relies on Supreme Court decisions issued since Massachusetts. First, EPA cites the 2022 decision in West Virginia v. EPA, which held that agency actions with major social, economic and political impacts cannot be performed in the absence of “clear congressional authorization.”[15] According to EPA, there is a lack of clear statutory authority under Section 202(a) to regulate GHG emissions, supported by the fact that for decades before Massachusetts, EPA did not interpret the CAA to permit GHG regulations.[16] EPA also bases its reasoning on the Supreme Court’s 2024 decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (Loper Bright), which instructed that the “best” reading of a statute must be used to determine the permissibility of agency actions.[17] EPA now claims that under the “best” reading of CAA Section 202(a), it does not have authority to regulate GHG emissions.[18]

These arguments squarely reject EPA’s authority under Massachusetts to regulate GHG emissions under CAA Section 202(a) and thus, plaintiffs may argue, undermine the Court’s finding in AEP v. Connecticut that the CAA and GHG emissions regulations promulgated pursuant to it displace federal common law nuisance claims.

It is worth noting, however, that even if EPA rejects its authority to regulate GHGs under CAA Section 202(a), plaintiffs will still have significant hurdles to overcome in successfully pursuing federal public nuisance claims, as EPA claims its authority under the act will continue to displace federal common law claims targeting GHG emissions.[19] To fully overturn AEP v. Connecticut and allow federal public nuisance claims to proceed against GHG emitters, the Supreme Court would need to not only reject its original rationale that such claims are displaced by the CAA but also determine that potential other alternative theories that could justify dismissal of such cases — including standing to bring claims, the political questions doctrine, the presumption against extraterritoriality, and a court’s ability to provide viable remedies to address the harm — do not themselves warrant keeping public nuisance cases out of federal court. And even if these initial hurdles to bringing claims were cleared, plaintiffs would have significant additional hurdles to reaching favorable judgments, such as proving that defendants’ GHG emissions (or more precisely, alleged emissions caused by wrongful conduct of defendants) caused harm to plaintiffs.

Furthermore, once finalized, the Endangerment Finding rescission will face its own formidable legal challenges. The Supreme Court’s ruling in Loper Bright means that EPA will have to prove that its interpretation of the CAA in the Endangerment Finding rescission is the “best” reading of the statute, more difficult than showing it was entitled to the Chevron[20] deference Loper Bright eliminated.

Because nuisance claims can support requests for injunctions ordering emissions reductions along with requests for monetary relief (e.g., abatement funds) and can obtain these forms of potential remedial relief at a time when the federal government is itself rescinding GHG emissions reduction regulations, energy companies, manufacturers and other large emitters should anticipate the continued filing of lawsuits in state and federal courts under state and federal common law theories of liability, including public nuisance. And once the EPA’s rule rescinding its prior Endangerment Finding is final, the contours of critical defenses to such claims based on pre-emption and displacement may shift and defendants will need to adjust such defenses and others to the implications of a new regulatory regime, including to an EPA that is now rescinding its own Endangerment Finding and prior GHG regulations.

NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Devon Energy (DVN.N), opens new tab and Coterra Energy (CTRA.N), opens new tab are exploring a potential merger, in a deal that could create one of the largest independent U.S. shale producers, people familiar with the matter said.

A possible combination, which would ‌rank among the largest between U.S. energy producers in recent years, comes ​as U.S. crude prices remain pressured by a near-term global oil glut and the prospect of higher supplies entering the market in coming years from Venezuela.

The two ‍companies are said to be in early-stage talks for a combination, said the sources, who cautioned a transaction was not guaranteed and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations.

Shares in ⁠Devon slipped 3%, while Coterra's stock jumped more than 6% on the Reuters ‍story. Devon has a market value of around $24 billion, while Coterra is worth about $20 billion.

Devon and ‌Coterra ‌did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

While energy dealmaking was subdued in 2025, versus prior record-breaking years, arguments for consolidation among U.S. oil and natural gas producers remain valid. Benefits include economies of scale which would help control costs within a ⁠depressed price environment for ⁠crude, as well ​as securing additional resources at a time when many shale basins are maturing and new prime development land is at a premium.

Both companies have operations across multiple shale formations, with both ‍present in the Delaware portion of the Permian basin in Texas and New Mexico and Oklahoma's Anadarko basin.

Devon also has assets in South Texas' Eagle Ford play, as well as North Dakota's ​Williston basin. Coterra has a significant presence in ‍Appalachia, having been formed in 2021 through a merger of Cimarex Energy and Marcellus-focused Cabot Oil & Gas.

Here's What That Tells Us - InsideEVs,Suvrat Kothari,,,,,https://insideevs.com/news/784571/evs-that-defied-q4-sales-crash/,"But EVs like the Tesla Model Y, Porsche Taycan and Cadillac Escalade IQ continued to grow regardless.
After the $7,500 federal tax credit expired at the end of Q3, sales fell off a cliff in Q4, dropping to just 234,000 units.
Tesla sold a whopping 92,460 units of its popular Model Y crossover during the same period, which represents 8.1% growth.
The Model Y tells a similar story.
That kept the Model Y the undisputed king of EVs in America last year.","Electric vehicle sales in the U.S. fell 36% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of last year.

Many of those Q4 purchases happened in Q3 due to the end of the tax credits.

But EVs like the Tesla Model Y, Porsche Taycan and Cadillac Escalade IQ continued to grow regardless.

The electric vehicle market keeps getting better every year. More choices, a steadily expanding charging network and real improvements in the underlying technology helped make last year the second-best on record for EV sales in the U.S., critics be damned.

Americans bought 1.27 million battery-powered vehicles in 2025, just 2% shy of the 2024 record of 1.3 million, according to Cox Automotive estimates. That number, however, masks a sharp shift that happened late last year.

After the $7,500 federal tax credit expired at the end of Q3, sales fell off a cliff in Q4, dropping to just 234,000 units. That’s a 46% decline from Q3 and down 36% year-over-year. Most EVs posted negative growth in that period. Still, a small but telling group of about a dozen vehicles bucked the trend.

Several models from General Motors, Porsche, Tesla, Lucid and Mercedes managed to grow in the final quarter without the help of the now-dead $7,500 federal tax credit. They also did so amid relaxed Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) rules, which no longer penalize automakers for missing efficiency targets.

To lay out a handful of examples on the table (The full list is below), sales of the Porsche Taycan grew 23.6% year-over-year to 1,672 units in Q4. Tesla sold a whopping 92,460 units of its popular Model Y crossover during the same period, which represents 8.1% growth. And sales of the Cadillac Escalade IQ grew 211.2% to 2,085 units.

""The common thread among the Q4 growers is that premium buyers were far less dependent on the $7,500 federal tax credit,” Stephanie Valdez-Streaty, the Director of Industry Insights at Cox Automotive, told me in an email. “While most EVs saw sales drop significantly, some new or recently refreshed, higher‑end models held firm, suggesting shoppers in the premium segment weren’t chasing incentives,” she added.

In some cases, it’s easy to see why that happened. Production of the Escalade IQ was still ramping up at the end of 2024, so higher volumes at the end of 2025 were expected.

But other models grew largely on merit, sweetened by some year-end holiday deals. Porsche gave the Taycan a massive upgrade, adding faster charging speeds and a more energy-dense battery that meaningfully improved its range, things that likely made the car more compelling to buyers on the fence.

The Model Y tells a similar story. Tesla rolled out a mid-cycle refresh with updated styling, improved suspension and better overall engineering. That kept the Model Y the undisputed king of EVs in America last year. The company also continued offering 0% financing through the end of the year, and it still does on the new Standard trims.

With the exception of Tesla, most EVs that grew in Q4 sit firmly in the luxury segment, where buyers are less reliant on incentives and more attracted by the vehicles themselves. Those shoppers kept signing paperwork even as subsidies disappeared. This shouldn't be too surprising, as if you bought an EV with a sticker price over $80,000 you didn't get the credit, anyway.

There appears to be a broader lesson here that doesn’t just apply to luxury EVs. If EVs can reach price parity with gas cars and offer compelling technology and real choice, buyers may not need incentives.

That’s why the next wave of EV launches matters so much. More than 30 new or updated EVs are slated to launch in the U.S. in 2026. Many of those are aimed squarely at the lower end of the market, like the Nissan Leaf and Chevy Bolt, or at the heart of the market, around $50,000, with the Rivian R2, which will directly challenge the Model Y.

“Overall, the data suggests that strong, new products from strong brands can still grow through policy headwinds, but mostly at the premium end of the market,” Valdez-Streaty said. “It's long been a truth in the auto industry, new product grows, aged product slows,” she added.

What the Ford and BYD battery deal would involve

According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, Ford is in talks with BYD to buy batteries for some of its hybrid models.

Sources familiar with the matter said discussions are still ongoing on exactly what the battery deal would entail, but a few suggested Ford would use them for hybrid vehicles sold outside the US.

Under the arrangement, Ford would import BYD batteries to facilities outside of the US, potentially in Germany, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, or other major overseas plants. However, there is still a chance the deal will not fall through, according to the sources.

A Ford spokesperson said, “We talk to lots of companies about many things,” but didn’t offer any additional details. BYD declined to comment.

The report comes after Ford announced last month that it would discontinue the all-electric F-150 Lightning as part of its broader shift in its Ford+ plan.

Rather than large EVs, Ford is doubling down on smaller, more affordable models with its low-cost Universal EV platform. In the meantime, the company will bridge the gap with new hybrids and extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs).

Ford will replace the electric pickup with an EREV version that uses both battery power and a gas engine that acts as a generator to keep the battery charged.

The company said it would take a $19.5 billion hit due to the restructuring, roughly half of which is due to cancelling the Lightning.

Ford is nearly finished with construction of its BlueOval Battery Park in Michigan, where it will license technology from China’s CATL for upcoming vehicles based on the UEV platform. The battery plant is expected to begin production this year.

The first vehicle based on the UEV platform will be a mid-size electric pickup, which Ford said will start at around $30,000.

At the Detroit Auto Show, which opened to the public on Thursday, Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, said he wants to expand the company’s hybrid and EREV lineup following the success of the F-150 hybrid.

Electrek’s Take

It’s not a total shock to see Ford turning to China’s battery leaders. It’s already licensing CATL’s tech for use at its Michigan battery plant, so a deal with BYD is possible.

For Ford, it would help secure a stable supply of batteries (outside the US) as it plans to introduce new hybrid and EREVs over the next few years.

Ford and BYD are no strangers either. In 2020, Ford’s joint venture in China, Changan Ford, began using BYD batteries in vehicles sold there. BYD has since reportedly reached out to Ford about supplying batteries for other markets.

While the US is pulling back, China is plowing ahead with new EV tech, including next-gen batteries, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and other related technologies.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2026/01/Ford-BYD-EV-batteries.jpeg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-15 15:00:41.012108

On January 6, they unanimously approved two site plans for a proposed power plant and data center campus to be built south of Cheyenne. The power plant project, called the BFC Power and Cheyenne Power Hub, is being developed by Tallgrass Energy. It will ultimately provide electricity to the Project Jade data center campus being built by AI infrastructure company Crusoe.

Crusoe and Tallgrass announced the partnership in July, revealing that the data center campus will open with a capacity of 1.6 gigawatts (GW) but will be designed to scale up to 10 GW. Achieving that maximum capacity would make it the largest single AI campus in the U.S.

Big projects with big impacts

The joint project will now progress to the construction phase in the Switch Grass Industrial Park area, located 8 miles south of Cheyenne, according to documentation obtained by Inside Climate News.

Project Jade will be developed on a 600-acre (243-hectare) parcel of land and will consist of five data centers, two support buildings, and additional supporting infrastructure. The BFC Power and Cheyenne Power Hub project will be built right next door on a 659-acre (267-hectare) parcel and will consist of two power generation facilities plus supporting infrastructure.

Crusoe and Tallgrass expect to begin construction in the first quarter of this year, and the first data center building should be operational by the end of 2027, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports.

Before the final vote, the Hyndman Homesites Homeowners Association—which represents a community near the project—wrote a letter to the county commissioners expressing residents’ concerns about drilling deep wells into the local aquifer, gas turbine emissions, the location of wastewater ponds, and other impacts, according to ICN.

Ahead of the final vote, the Hyndman Homesites Homeowners Association, which represents a community near the project, sent a letter to the county commissioners raising concerns about deep aquifer wells, gas turbine emissions, wastewater pond locations, and other impacts, according to ICN.

Studies suggest they’re right to be worried. Researchers have found that data center facilities much smaller than the proposed Jade campus emit harmful air pollutants such as fine particulate matter, guzzle local water resources, and drive up energy bills.

Promises of sustainability

The projects’ developers say they have plans to mitigate local impacts. To reduce the data centers’ water demand, Crusoe intends to implement closed-loop cooling systems that recycle treated water and treatment fluids, according to a 2024 Impact Report.

When Crusoe and Tallgrass announced their partnership in July, they said the data center campus’s proximity to Tallgrass’s existing CO2 sequestration hub will also provide long-term carbon capture solutions for the gas turbines powering the data centers. They added that “future renewable energy developments in the region” could eventually supplement the facilities’ power demand.

Whether these prove to be viable, meaningful solutions remains to be seen. County leadership is apparently comfortable enough with the risks to allow the projects to move forward. The true costs and benefits of their decision won’t become clear until these facilities are operational and the campus begins drawing power, water, and scrutiny at scale.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/Crusoe-data-center-Texas-1200x675.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 14:01:30.576783

AUDIO: The Governor's remarks are available in audio form here.

A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks is available below:

We just received word that a federal judge in Washington has sided with us and the company Equinor, and other companies who are providers of offshore wind. The developer, Equinor, sued because the Trump administration arbitrarily issued a stop work order on a project that had been underway, contemplated for over a decade as part of our [renewable] energy strategy. The work was done. The platforms are built. Thousands of workers from Long Island to New York City and beyond have been working through all kinds of weather — extreme weather — to do something that is critically important for our energy future and has been contemplated as part of our grid. The Trump administration shut it down, we went to court and now the stop work order must be lifted and people get back to their jobs.

And I'm sick and tired of having to go to court time and time and time again to stop these decisions. They're designed to do nothing other than hurt workers, hurt our states, hurt our economy and hurt our energy future.

So we won. The federal court ruled in favor of restarting the work at Empire Wind Offshore Wind Project, clearing the way for it to go forward. And this is what we're talking about, two of these projects that were shut down along the East Coast. Two were in New York, Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind off the coast of Long Island.

They were stopped under the bogus pretense of national security. When I heard this, I said one thing, “I'm the Governor of New York. If there is a national security threat off the coast of New York, you need to tell me what it is — I want a briefing right now.” Low and behold, they had no answer. They had fake claims about radar. Radar can be addressed and handled as it has happened on many other projects in the past.

So, we rallied just last Friday on Long Island, surrounded by hundreds of hardworking union members, environmentalists, residents, businesses, who are part of the supply chain. Businesses, Republicans and Democrats stood together with us to say, “Turn it back on, lift the stop work order.” And I'm really proud that a judge has agreed with this, that the billions of dollars of private investment can stay right here in New York. And also reminding us that energy security is part of national security. We have been contemplating on this for years to literally next year, or perhaps even later this year to turn on this clean renewable energy source, to power half a million homes in Brooklyn alone.

When they shut this down right before Christmas, shut it down, it drove a huge hole in our energy resiliency grid planning. So, I'm proud to say that the company has been successful in court. We're going to continue doing what we have to do every single step of the way, but for now the wind turbines will be turning on.

The most recent PJM capacity auctions — where the grid operator pays in advance for power plants to be available to serve the grid — hit record-high clearing prices in December, portending more expensive electricity for the region.

The developer Elevate Renewables is tackling that dire need by accomplishing something unheard of in the PJM region: building a really big battery. The company, launched by private equity firm ArcLight in 2022, announced today that it had acquired a 150-megawatt/600-megawatt-hour battery project in northern Virginia and will complete construction by mid-2026. Called Prospect Power, the project could be bolstering the grid near the state’s famed ​“Data Center Alley” just in time for the summer spike in electricity use.

“The states want capacity, they want affordability, they want in-state resources,” Elevate CEO Joshua Rogol told Canary Media. ​“Storage can clearly be part of the solution to that problem. It is one of the few resources that can come online quickly, given how long it takes to develop and build a project given the supply chain as it exists today.”

Fossil gas still generates more power across the U.S. than any other resource, but battery storage has become the top source of on-demand power being built today (solar, as an intermittent producer, does not meet that definition).

However, almost all the storage action, and its resulting benefits, has happened in California and Texas. Data firm Modo Energy drew the comparison in a report last year: ​“In the past five years, PJM has added just 200 MW of grid-scale battery capacity — while Texas and California have cumulatively built more than 20 GW of [battery energy storage systems] over the same period.” It’s as if a major swath of the country saw a few states adopting smartphones and said, ​“No, thanks, we’re happy with flip phones.”

Tough times for batteries in PJM

PJM’s failure to keep up with this particular grid technology is particularly surprising because PJM actually created the modern storage market back in 2012, by letting batteries compete for the rapid-fire grid service known as frequency regulation. Those rules spurred a buildout of 181 megawatts by 2016, according to Modo — heady stuff at the time, and well before storage in California and Texas took off. But these batteries tended to have just 15 minutes of duration, because that’s all that was needed to perform that role for the grid.

“The economic strategy was always to build a very short-duration battery, just participate in regulation services and make really substantial returns that way,” said Julia Hoos, head of USA East at Aurora Energy Research.

Frequency regulation has stayed lucrative for battery owners, Hoos noted, in part due to quirks in PJM’s rules that reserved some of the market for thermal generators like gas plants, which set a higher clearing price than batteries do. But rule changes now underway will likely reduce the payoff in future years.

In any case, the amount of regulation PJM needs for the grid isn’t enough to support a larger battery buildout on its own. Currently, PJM has more than 400 megawatts of batteries operating, meaning individual projects elsewhere in the country contain more battery capacity than is in the entirety of the nation’s largest wholesale market.

Beyond the limited regulation market, PJM’s rules and market dynamics make it hard for developers to finance storage projects. In California and Texas, battery owners can profit by charging up at times when solar generation makes grid power very cheap and selling back to the grid when prices are high. But PJM doesn’t experience that level of daily swing from cheap to expensive power, Hoos said.

Battery developers could try to make money instead by committing their batteries in the capacity auction. However, PJM awards capacity contracts on a one-year basis, which prevents developers from locking down long-term revenue certainty, like they can in California.

Aurora modeled a hypothetical four-hour duration battery in Virginia and found that half its revenue would come from capacity payments and half from energy arbitrage. But, Hoos added, ​“the revenue from both of those is still not enough for an investor to build a merchant battery.”

State policy and utility contracts make storage possible

Prospect Power could be the project that breaks the dry spell, and it’s taken many hands to make that possible.

Storage specialist Eolian Energy, known for its pioneering battery construction in Texas, started developing the project back around 2017 in a joint venture with Open Road Renewable Energy. Eolian CEO Aaron Zubaty wanted to place a project ​“anywhere we could within a 100-mile radius of northern Virginia to feed the data center load growth.” But Data Center Alley is ringed by rolling Virginia horse country, where landowners were not enthusiastic about power plant construction.

The joint venture ended up securing a parcel farther west, over the Blue Ridge Mountains, that could ship power directly to northern Virginia. In 2023, the joint venture sold the project to Swift Current Energy, which secured a 15-year contract from utility Dominion Energy. That dependable revenue stream helped Swift Current lock down a $242 million financing package last September to build the project.

Now, Elevate has emerged as the long-term owner, which will operate the finished battery just in time to navigate the choppy waters of PJM amid the AI boom.

The Prospect battery broke through the PJM logjam because state policy created an opening.

PJM governs the energy markets for the whole region, but individual states can layer on their own policies, and Virginia passed a comprehensive clean energy law in 2020. This law sets a 100% renewable electricity target and requires Dominion, the largest utility in the state, to procure 2.7 gigawatts of energy storage by 2035, some of which must be owned by third parties.

Virginia also has long been home to the densest cluster of data centers in the world, stemming from Cold War defense investments that kick-started a dense fiber-optic network there. That has naturally evolved into ground zero for AI computing investment, which is putting utilities in a bind as they try to figure out how to deliver enough power for the new computing behemoths.

“There is a need for capacity, and the states are stepping up to incent that battery capacity to come online, to drive affordability and reliability,” Elevate’s Rogol said.

Prospect checks off part of Dominion’s energy storage obligation under state law, and it delivers a powerful tool for meeting Data Center Alley’s needs during peak hours, when the grid might struggle.

As for what the battery will do exactly, the short answer is, whatever Dominion asks for. Under the contract, known as a tolling agreement, Elevate will own the battery and keep it in fine working condition, Rogol said, while Dominion will dispatch it to monetize regulation, energy arbitrage, and capacity as it sees fit.

The conditions that made Prospect possible, then, aren’t in place across most of PJM’s territory, though the PJM states of Illinois, New Jersey, and Maryland have enacted policies that support storage build-out, too. Prospect may be a lonely giant for a few more years, but the sheer need for more capacity should change that sooner or later.

“With limited availability of gas turbines; constraints on gas fuel supply; challenges siting, permitting, and building new gas plants; and a limited number of gas plants in advanced development, it is difficult to see how growing demand in PJM will be met anytime soon without a lot of storage filling the gap,” said Brent Nelson, managing director of markets and strategy at the research firm Ascend Analytics. ​“But mechanisms to provide stable revenues will be critical for getting projects financed and built.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Prospect-Power.JPG?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=11e2de06e0663b2b2ad38c689432d9d9,N,,2026-01-15 18:59:51.487536

In June, U.S. District Judge Tana Lin granted the states’ motion for a preliminary injunction requiring the Federal Highway Administration to restore funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula (NEVI) Program, which allocated $5 billion to states to build electric vehicle charging networks across the country.
The NEVI Formula program was signed into law by former President Joe Biden in 2021 with the intent to build an interconnected network of highways with electric vehicle charging stations across the nation.
The states argued that changing priorities is not a basis to withhold funding.
For the environmental groups, the disruption to the states’ NEVI program funding has meant their members who use and rely on electric vehicles have been adversely affected.","Whether the Trump administration can skirt a lawsuit from a coalition of 20 states over changes to an electric vehicle charging infrastructure program is in the hands of a federal judge who heard dueling motions for summary judgment on Tuesday.

“In a blatant end run around the express limitations on their authority, the defendants refused for months on end to obligate [National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program] funds to the plaintiff states,” Caitlin Soden with the Washington Attorney General’s Office argued.

In May, the states sued the Trump administration — naming the U.S. Department of Transportation and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and the Federal Highway Administration and its administrator as defendants — arguing that it unlawfully withheld billions in congressionally approved funding previously slated for electric vehicle charging infrastructure across all 50 states.

In June, U.S. District Judge Tana Lin granted the states’ motion for a preliminary injunction requiring the Federal Highway Administration to restore funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula (NEVI) Program, which allocated $5 billion to states to build electric vehicle charging networks across the country.

Both the states and the federal government moved for summary judgment, with the government arguing that the case has been rendered moot following changes to the program.

“The temporary pause that spurred this lawsuit has concluded,” Justice Department attorney Heidy Gonzalez argued.

That pause refers to the Department of Transportation’s suspension of program funding in early February, which came on the heels of President Donald Trump’s signing of Executive Order 14154, titled “Unleashing American Energy,” announcing several directives impacting the energy industry.

After retroactively revoking the approval of state submitted plans in February, the Federal Highway Administration later issued updated guidance and asked states to submit new deployment plans in August.

The federal government argued that action resolved the case. But Lin questioned why the government needed to pause in the first place and require new plans from states.

“The administration wanted to make sure it was not implementing policies, priorities and policy decrees that the previous administration determined were important to it,” Gonzalez said.

The NEVI Formula program was signed into law by former President Joe Biden in 2021 with the intent to build an interconnected network of highways with electric vehicle charging stations across the nation. It was part of his bid to accelerate the country’s transition away from fossil fuel-powered vehicles and planned for multiple rounds of funding between 2022 and 2026.

During the pause, the Trump administration eliminated all policies created under the Biden administration that it deemed unnecessary, Gonzalez explained.

Lin questioned why the states were required to submit new plans if the new requirements were less stringent than the old plan requirements. Gonzalez clarified that the states were allowed to resubmit old plans so long as they complied with the requirements made under the current administration.

The states argued that changing priorities is not a basis to withhold funding. Even though the states have resubmitted plans to receive more funding, projects already underway have been delayed. Plus, the Trump administration hasn’t guaranteed that it will fulfill funding.

“Defendants have not promised to obligate NEVI funds and disperse them as required by statute,” Soden said.

A collection of environmental interest groups, led by the Sierra Club, intervened in support of the states. For the environmental groups, the disruption to the states’ NEVI program funding has meant their members who use and rely on electric vehicles have been adversely affected.

“We, of course, acknowledge the limits of the existing fast-charging network — NEVI’s entire purpose was to remedy those issues,” Joe Halso with the Sierra Club said. “By impeding build out of that network, defendants have delayed and denied our members access to those charging stations, prolonging, contributing to and causing our members injuries.”

The government argued the pause didn’t withdraw or withhold funding but realigned the program and offered the states the opportunity to resubmit plans.

Lin said she expects to issue a ruling within a week.",https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/phpthumb/phpThumb.php?src=/files/entryimages/ev_charging_stations_1.jpg&fltr[]=wmi|/gfx/shareoverlays/sentinellogo4color_nobackbig.png|BR|77|4|4|0]&w=1200&h=630&zc=C&f=jpg,N,,2026-01-15 14:59:59.966009

Ami Bera and Rep. Young Kim say is part of a “wake-up call” for how vulnerable the country is with the critical minerals supply chain.

“We are no longer asleep at the wheel,” Kim, R-Calif., told “The Hill” on Wednesday. “We are wide awake and answering the call that the United States is ready to build out domestic production to meet the demands that we have at scale.”

Part of the legislation, the Developing Overseas Mineral Investments and New Allied Networks for Critical Energies (DOMINANCE) Act, aims to reduce the United States’ reliance on China to build resilient critical minerals supply chains with trusted allies and partners around the world.

According to a geological survey, China controls nearly 44 million tons of the global rare earth mining, while the U.S. only controls 1.9 million tons.

Kim adds the legislation will be a “game-changer” for the U.S. Bera backed Kim’s remarks, acknowledging the critical minerals are vital for technology and military weaponry the United States has and is possibly developing.

“It’s a real national security and economic issue,” the California Democrat said. “We can’t be vulnerable to potential competitors in Beijing. That’s why this is not a Democratic or Republican issue. It’s an American issue.”

“There are nearly fifteen other current programs, opportunities, and incentives available for third-party DER on Xcel Energy’s distribution system,” the utility said.
“The cost-benefit analysis and the estimated budget reflect economies of scale and efficiencies that may not translate to a smaller pilot.”","​​​​​Xcel Energy on Friday told Minnesota regulators that it would make modifications to its Capacity*Connect distributed battery proposal in response to stakeholder feedback, but it stood by company ownership of storage assets to “benefit and protect customers.”

Xcel filed the “first-of-its-kind proposal” in October with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. The utility is asking for authorization to work with deployment services company Sparkfund to position front-of-meter batteries ranging from 1 MW-3 MW at “strategic locations” on its grid by 2028.

Local businesses, commercial or industrial sites or nonprofit organizations would receive compensation to host the batteries, but Xcel would own the assets. The program has a proposed budget ranging from $152 million to $430 million based on a procurement ranging from 50 MW to 200 MW. Xcel said small-scale battery systems are typically capable of a four-hour discharge.

Several parties filed comments with the PUC that were supportive of distributed storage but concerned about the structure of Xcel’s proposal.

A group of solar stakeholders — the Coalition for Community Solar Access, the Minnesota Solar Energy Industries Association and the Solar Energy Industries Association — took issue with Xcel’s exclusive ownership of the batteries.

The C*C proposal “raises serious concerns about how we procure these resources and whether the process delivers the best value for customers and the system,” the solar joint filing said. “The proposal is costly, shifts undue risk to ratepayers, restricts competitive market participation ... omits required analyses of alternatives, and could restrict the continued growth of Minnesota’s distributed energy resource ecosystem.”

Utility ownership of front-of-meter battery energy storage systems should be permitted “only when Xcel demonstrates, through solicitation of proposals, that competitive alternatives cannot meet the identified system needs at lower cost or lower risk to ratepayers,” the groups said.

Another group, consisting of Cooperative Energy Futures, the Environmental Law and Policy Center, Institute for Local Self-Reliance, Solar United Neighbors and Vote Solar, was critical of Xcel’s focus on the C*C program to produce bulk power system benefits.

As proposed, the program “fails to advance distribution value and develop meaningful insights for how to co-optimize distribution and bulk-system benefits,” the groups said. The utility has said it does aspire to those goals in a later phase of the program, they noted — but “the company does not expect to begin to address them until 2031.”

Xcel responded that its proposal “effectively balances the need for incremental progress and innovation while seeking to benefit and protect all customers.”

It said third parties and customers have “ample opportunity” to “access” the distribution system through the company’s other competitive procurements, including through the approximately 1 GW of community solar gardens already on the company’s system.

“There are nearly fifteen other current programs, opportunities, and incentives available for third-party DER on

Xcel Energy’s distribution system,” the utility said. Company ownership of C*C assets “ensures safe, reliable operation of our distribution system as we build the people, processes, and tools needed to manage BESS on our distribution system and interact with [Midcontinent ISO] markets.”

Participating in MISO markets “provides the most value to customers,” Xcel said.

“Prioritizing other use cases focused on energy arbitrage, distribution-only value, and/or distributed generation interconnection, as suggested by some parties, are not consistent with the [distributed capacity procurement] concept, nor do they provide sufficient customer benefit,” the utility said.

But Xcel said it would make other changes to its proposal in response to stakeholder comments.

The utility committed to additional reporting, including metrics related to equity and environmental justice, and to refining Xcel’s marginal distribution cost analysis in its 2027 integrated distribution plan to estimate potential distribution system benefits of such a program.

The Minnesota Department of Commerce recommended regulators approve the program but limit it to an initial “learning phase.”

Xcel told regulators the total aggregate capacity target of 50 MW-200 MW “is the appropriate size of the learning phase,” but it would reduce it, if directed.

“However, we note that reducing the size ... will not be a linear reduction in terms of cost,” it said. “The cost-benefit analysis and the estimated budget reflect economies of scale and efficiencies that may not translate to a smaller pilot.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/5KwZNuHbYAylgkIAVisuYOiS1g6hY3KfAQOgrtCXEHE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9WaWVqYXNfTWljcm9ncmlkXy1fQmF0dGVyeV9ZYXJkLmpwZWc=.webp,N,,2026-01-15 15:00:12.855601

On a 400-meter test section of U.S. 52/231 near West Lafayette, a Cummins-powered semi took in 190 kilowatts from coils buried under the pavement, according to Purdue University’s announcement. This is the first wireless charging highway in the U.S. built for real trucks, not golf carts. That matters for you because it hints at a future where stopping for “fuel” becomes the slow option.

How This Wireless Charging Highway Changes the Game for You

Engineers embedded transmitter coils under the road; matching receivers on the truck pick up power through the concrete and feed it straight into the battery. An Indiana DOT program called Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer is backing this, with the goal of expanding from this quarter-mile slab to full highway corridors if the tech proves reliable. Trade coverage spells it out even more bluntly: a “highway that draws power from beneath” and turns long-haul routes into rolling chargers for electric freight.

Right now, the spotlight is on semis. But once the concrete is wired, it doesn’t care what’s on top of it. If this spreads, your daily EV won’t need a monster battery to do a long commute, and your road trips will be built around short, predictable top-ups instead of big gulps at fast chargers. Gas trucks start to look like the slow option: they still have to dive off the highway, queue up, and pay whatever the pump says that week.

My Verdict: How You Let This Shape Your Next Buy

If you want your next car or truck to age well, you stop thinking of it as a sealed box and start thinking of it as a device that talks to the road. You favor EVs and plug-in trucks that already handle serious DC fast charging, sit on platforms big freight players are betting on, and keep their batteries cool under high load. You let someone else cling to the pump while you buy for a world where the road itself keeps your battery fed and your trips shorter, not longer.",https://s.yimg.com/os/en/men_s_journal_718/66bdaec1308433816888d7c080dfc2ca,N,,2026-01-15 14:01:58.056352

Illinois continues to deliver a strong environment for private investment in EV infrastructure by expanding access to reliable, convenient charging for drivers.

“Whether you’re headed out on a long-range road trip, taking the kids to school, or on the job site, EV ownership should be easy, affordable, and reliable. Here in Illinois, we’ve put shoulder to the wheel to get the EV industry off the ground, and we’ve seen significant investments in our state as a result,” said Governor JB Pritzker. “Over the next few years, Illinois’ EV ecosystem will continue to grow — creating more quality jobs, building out more charging infrastructure, and making EVs an even more accessible and affordable option for our families.”

IONNA is a joint venture founded by eight global automakers, deploying EV fast charging infrastructure nationwide. IONNA’s charging stations are accessible to all-electric vehicles with NACS or CCS connectors. Among the new charging sites in Illinois, IONNA is powering 10 charging bays — electrified by ComEd — at Wally’s in Pontiac, creating access to local retail operations for Illinois EV drivers.

“Our goal at IONNA is simple: provide easy and stress-free EV charging for our drivers,” said IONNA CEO Seth Cutler. “By bringing fast, reliable charging to familiar stops like Wally’s in Pontiac, we’re giving Illinois drivers the confidence to travel farther, stop comfortably, and enjoy the journey — whether they’re commuting, running errands, or taking a road trip.”

“Wally’s — the Home of the Great American Road Trip — is proud to partner with IONNA to bring EV charging to Pontiac, strengthening the Midwest travel corridor while delivering the convenience, comfort, and reliability our guests expect,” said Wally’s Co-Founder and CEO Michael Rubenstein.

“The new and improved EV infrastructure at Wally's is another step forward for our community — supporting cleaner transportation, encouraging innovation, and making it easier for residents and visitors alike to choose sustainable options,” said Pontiac Mayor Kelly A. Eckhoff. “New station will attract road travelers, encourage longer stops, and brings more dollars to our local economy, while also preparing Pontiac for the future of transportation.”

“ComEd is committed to helping northern Illinois customers and communities unlock the sustainability and cost saving benefits of EVs,” said ComEd President and CEO Gil Quiniones. “Working closely with the state of Illinois, EV companies and communities across the region, we have helped facilitate the expansion of a widespread network of charging stations to serve the region, strengthened by the most reliable grid in the country.”

The State of Illinois has fought to ensure federal resources are delivered as promised, securing the release of critical funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) grants. So far, a total of $148 million has been allocated to IDOT to deliver the NEVI program in Illinois. To date, IDOT has awarded $43.8 million in NEVI grants for 62 projects throughout the state, which will facilitate the construction of 349 new charging ports.

As federal EV tax credits are no longer available, Illinois continues to operate its own state EV rebate program. Illinois’ EV rebate program — which delivers a check to eligible purchasers — includes $4,000 for low-income Illinoisans, $2,000 for others purchasing an EV, and $1,500 for electric motorcycles. By doubling down in the face of federal roadblocks, Illinois is encouraging sustained growth in the EV sector.

Illinois EV Growth

This combination of public leadership and private investment is helping drive rapid EV growth statewide:

Illinois now has 162,375 battery electric vehicles on the road. 2025 saw a 32.5% increase in battery electric vehicles.

In 2025 alone, the state added 411 new public charging locations, bringing the number of fast-charging ports to approximately 2,300 statewide.

While grants have been instrumental in promoting charging, nearly half of these new charging locations — including IONNA — opened without federal or state grant support, demonstrating strong private-sector confidence in Illinois’ EV market.

Illinois’ commitment to expanding EV infrastructure benefits Illinois’ local economies and EV and component manufacturers alike. As the state’s EV market grows through strategic investments and competitive incentives, more well-paying jobs are created for Illinois’ unmatched workforce. In May, Governor Pritzker announced EV manufacturer Rivian’s $120 million investment in a new supplier park, which will support hundreds of new jobs and suppliers.

Alongside the charging site in Pontiac, other IONNA rechargeries across Illinois include:

6 charging bays electrified by ComEd at Casey’s in McHenry

6 charging bays electrified by ComEd at Casey’s in Vernon Hills

6 charging bays electrified by ComEd in Hanover Park

10 charging bays electrified by Ameren in Gilman

Six other IONNA charging sites in Springfield, Chicago, North Aurora, St. Charles, Arlington Heights, and Des Plaines are either contracted or scheduled to go live.

“We were headed to be 50% EVs from a regulatory perspective by 2030.
“I think the great thing at General Motors [is that] we have a really strong EV portfolio that we’re still committed to [and] we have a very strong internal-combustion-engine portfolio,” she said.
We have a leadership position in full-size SUVs,” Barra said, noting took 50 years to establish that leadership position.
“Frankly, what we want to do is translate that into leadership position in the EVs as well.” Barra believes consumers will make rational decisions to choose EVs over time because they will be superior products.","DETROIT — General Motors will continue its major focus on electric vehicles but at a slower pace than originally planned while also maintaining a strong position in ICE power in addition to some upcoming hybrids and plug-in hybrids, the company’s CEO Mary Barra said.

In a “fireside chat” before an Automotive Press Association audience ahead of the 2026 Detroit Auto Show, Barra discussed a number of issues, most notably GM’s revised product strategy in reaction to the Trump administration’s rollback of future fuel economy regulations and elimination of the $7,500 EV tax credit.

“We were headed to be 50% EVs from a regulatory perspective by 2030. But with the changes that are not completely done yet from a regulatory perspective, we are on a different path,” Barra said during the event at General Motors’ new World Headquarters in downtown Detroit.

“I think the great thing at General Motors [is that] we have a really strong EV portfolio that we’re still committed to [and] we have a very strong internal-combustion-engine portfolio,” she said. “I’ve always said I didn’t want the regulatory environment to drive EV adoption. I wanted it to be because people choose them because they feel they are better vehicles and fit their lives.”

EVs and ICE vehicles can coexist and thrive under the GM tent, Barra said, adding the automaker is investing in both “because we realized internal combustion vehicles even at 50% [of the product mix] are still very significant.”

“We have a leadership position in full-size trucks. We have a leadership position in full-size SUVs,” Barra said, noting took 50 years to establish that leadership position. “Frankly, what we want to do is translate that into leadership position in the EVs as well.”

Barra believes consumers will make rational decisions to choose EVs over time because they will be superior products.

“Once we have a robust charging infrastructure, I think people are naturally going to pick EVs because instant torque opens up new design language and never having to go to the gas station,” she said. “It will take longer without incentives, but I still think we will get there over time. We don’t know what the demand will be, but we are working hard and we’re investing in new battery technology with LMR [lithium manganese-rich] to dramatically take the cost down.”

Barra added that she is surprised that some other OEMs have pulled back from EV development as quickly and as much as they have.

GM’s investments in technology go beyond electrification, the CEO said. The automaker will soon be putting its own “AI Assistant” into its vehicles and is already using AI in its processes “to help identify and improve the quality of our vehicles as well as speed and efficiency.”

However, the automaker has also pulled back on some investments in order to focus its efforts. Barra offered GM’s experience with its robotaxi arm Cruise as an example, saying the company “made the decision to not be in the rideshare business.”

“As we deploy our capital, we want to focus on personal vehicles and personal autonomy, not running rideshare leads,” she added. “We don’t run a taxi business. We don’t run a bus business. We’re not running Rideshare 1.0. So, I think it’s the right decision for us.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/4mXbtL1JVOKYeH4-7be810gUcUY5SEcgA_3CZno69gM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9CYXJyYV8xX0dldHR5SW1hZ2VzLTIyMTc1MTEwNDcuanBn.webp,N,,2026-01-15 14:01:19.465881

The result was the weirdest year ever for EV sales, with some brands hitting new EV sales records and canceling flagship electric models in the same breath.

The result is a reshuffled game board, with fewer players, fewer spoils and much more competition for the pool of buyers, as evidenced by this year’s Kelly Blue Book Electric Vehicle Sales Report. Total EV sales in the United States declined by 2%, even as they climbed globally. But the granular data is a lot more volatile than that, and the worst is yet to come. That’s why this is a particularly dissonant year for winners and losers: Some of the brands that posted the best U.S. EV sales gains are actually in the most trouble, and vice versa.

So what does all of this mean for the year ahead and beyond? Let’s dig in and find out.

Winner: Volvo

Photo by: Volvo

Volvo’s U.S. EV sales were up 96.3% for the year, to 10,821 units, according to KBB, representing astounding growth. But anyone who follows the EV industry closely knows it hasn’t been smooth sailing for the EV brand. Its EV gains are mainly driven by the EX90, its software-defined electric flagship. Far more advanced than previous Volvo EVs, it offers over 300 miles of range in a segment where Volvo consistently overperforms.

Yet the EX90 didn’t. Early examples were plagued with software issues, with many bugs surfacing during my brief first drive. Updates have improved things since, but Volvo is betting on the EX60 to reset its electric momentum. We’ll learn about that model next week.

For now, Volvo needs the win. Despite posting record EV sales in the U.S., its overall sales have been spiraling due to increased global competition, new import tariffs that affect its most profitable vehicles here and a series of headaches launching both the EX30 and EX90.

Volvo has proven it can grow EV sales here in spite of these challenges. But if it wants to be a high-volume player, it can’t afford to bungle the EX60.

Loser: Mercedes

The Mercedes EQE and EQS didn't quite hit the mark.

While Volvo’s surprise growth hides a small overall EV business and an ongoing quality crisis, Mercedes’ sales collapse accurately captures its position. Mercedes U.S. EV sales were down 54% year over year, or 12,942 units compared to 28,154 sales in 2024. And don’t expect that to reverse immediately: The EQE and EQS sedans and SUVs have both been paused for the U.S. market, as Mercedes kills its awkwardly designed and poorly received EQ cars.

Don’t be fooled by the bad numbers and backtracking, though. This may still be a great year for Mercedes EVs. The EQ cars were compromised and middling. The new CLA is neither, with an all-new 800-volt architecture, blazing fast charging speeds, an all-new cabin experience with MB.OS and around 400 miles of range. It also looks to have one of the most advanced automated driving assistance systems you can buy right now. The GLC EV promises to bring the same improvements to the high-volume compact crossover market later this year, too, setting Mercedes up for a much-needed electric do-over.

Mercedes wants to reset its EV fortunes with the new CLA. Based on our first drive, the company might have pulled it off.

Photo by: Patrick George

That’s why—if this list was subjective—I’d put Mercedes on the winners list. The company got walloped by tariffs, hurt by its own middling offerings and unseated from its comfortable position in China. Yet it also proved that one mistake wouldn’t define it. After years of trying to make the EQ cars work, the company has learned its lessons and is back for another chance at the throne.

Winner: Volkswagen Group

This has been maybe the worst year ever for the Volkswagen Group, with a full-on panic about the direction of Porsche, Audi and its core brand. Part of that is that all of these companies invested heavily in EVs and planned for a quick transition, only to realize that customers remain price-sensitive and anxious.

Another part is that the company is struggling in China and has never really been a huge player in the U.S., leaving it over-exposed to the shrinking and modestly profitable European auto market. Its software plans have been rewritten more times than I can count, and its core brand’s flagship EV, the ID. Buzz, is taking a gap year to figure things out in 2026. None of this looks great.

Don't be fooled: VW EV sales may look good, but that's only because the ID.4 had a stop-sale order for most of 2024. We expected numbers to improve significantly in 2025.

Yet on paper, this year was a stunning success for the Group’s U.S. EV efforts. KBB data shows VW EV sales up 56.8% for the year, while Audi EV sales grew 30.5%. Sure, part of that is rising from a low bar: The ID.4, VW’s only high-volume EV, had a stop-sale recall that prevented sales for most of 2024. Yet Audi, too, posted gains, and Porsche did the best of all. EV sales for the brand climbed 117.5%, driven by the new Macan EV.

Volkswagen's next-gen EVs look a lot better inside.

This year, as Porsche launches an electric Cayenne, I hope to see that number go up. But VW won’t be out of the woods until we try out its new EVs, developed with the help of its Rivian joint venture. Those products may finally offer the software experience, upgradeability and simplicity we expect from cutting-edge modern EVs.

Loser: Genesis

I like the Genesis GV60, but its awkward shape and middling range figures make it a niche player.

Photo by: Patrick George

Genesis was an early mover in the electric luxury space. Its results this year are a reminder that merely showing up isn’t good enough. While the company offered three EVs—the GV60, the Electrified GV70 and Electrified G80 (RIP)—none of them seem to be the right product at the right time. The GV70 and G80 are compromised by their gas-car foundations, and the GV60 is too small, awkward and low-range to be a do-everything luxury EV.

Couple those issues with a less-recognized brand and you get Genesis’ 2025 results: Sales fell 37.7%, to just 3,884 units for the year. The upcoming GV90 EV and GV60 Magma should help grow the company’s offerings. But if it wants to establish more of a beachhead in the EV market, the company needs a higher-volume product sooner, not later.

Winner: General Motors

General Motors has made a lot more progress on the EV transition than either of its crosstown rivals. Now the number two EV company in the country—behind Tesla, of course—it offers a stunning number of electric options. They are not typically the lightest or most cutting edge in their respective classes, but GM EVs offer solid technology and plenty of range at attractive prices. That’s why the Chevy Equinox EV was our inaugural Breakthrough EV of the Year, and why it’s the best-selling non-Tesla EV in the U.S. That helped push Chevy EV sales up 39.3% year-over-year.

Cadillac launched so many new EVs last year that we struggled to keep up. We still haven't even driven the Vistiq, the brand's new three-row family hauler.

Photo by: Cadillac

Cadillac fared even better. After decades of stagnation, Cadillac bet big on EVs, and it’s paying off. EV sales grew 69.1% in 2025, from an already high baseline. That’s made Cadillac the number one brand for luxury EVs, and made the company relevant in the luxury space for the first time in a long time. GMC, too, put up big numbers, with EV sales up 50.7% for the year.

The catch is that GM has a lot of electric truck models, and a lot of models that were selling big off of highly discounted lease deals. As the lease deals fade away in a post-tax-credit era, we’ll see if the General can keep up its momentum.

Loser: Tesla

Tesla did not post the largest EV sales decline of the year. That honor goes to Mercedes. Tesla U.S. sales were down a comparatively modest 7.0%. But I have to include Tesla here, for two reasons. The first is that, as an axiom, it is impossible to talk about the EV market without talking about Tesla. The second is that Tesla still accounts for nearly 40% of all EV sales in the U.S., so even a modest drop is huge in absolute figures.

That’s certainly true. Tesla U.S. sales fell from 633,762 in 2024 to 589,160 in 2025, despite a major update to its most popular model, the Model Y. Cybertruck sales were already down a staggering 48%, which is certainly not what you want to see in a flagship product’s second year on sale.

But the real reason it needs to be on this list isn’t in the numbers. It’s the culture. Tesla entered 2025 damaged by Elon Musk’s antics, but it was still perceived as a cool, sophisticated brand. These days, the brand is toxic, as evidenced by the stunning Tesla sales collapse we’ve seen in Europe, and the rising amount of anti-Tesla and anti-Elon sentiment I encounter online and in the real world.

It’s gotten bad enough that Elon Musk finally admitted that his pet project of personally gutting the federal government was a failure. Hopefully, in 2026, he’ll focus on cars, but so far he doesn’t seem inclined to give up his influence.

Winner: Acura

ZDX (pictured) sales may be surging, but that still wasn't enough to save it. Acura is nixing the ZDX and replacing it with a home-grown EV on Honda's 0 Series EV platform, the RSX.

Here’s a weird one for you: Last year Acura EV sales grew 62.4% year over year, all on the backs of the ZDX, the brand’s sole electric model. Then, last fall, Acura axed the car.

From a distance, it looks strange. But look closer and it makes sense. The ZDX is more closely related to the Cadillac Lyriq and Chevy Blazer EV than it is to any other Acura, built by GM as part of a deal with Honda. The whole strategy ended up being a placeholder until Honda and Acuras real EVs arrive later this year.

With the RSX EV slated to launch in the second half of 2026, Acura thought the slow-selling ZDX had fulfilled its mission. With only 12,005 sales in its best-ever year, the ZDX won’t be hard for Acura to replace. Let’s hope the company’s next EV nameplate revival goes better than its last.

Loser: Kia

Kia improved the EV6 for 2025, but the closely related Hyundai Ioniq 5 still handily outsells it.

Kia was an early leader on electrification, but that momentum has started to taper off. Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 has long outsold its less spacious and practical sibling, the Kia EV6, and with Hyundai’s giant U.S. EV factory finally coming online, the gap is widening.

Kia sold 33,836 EVs last year, 12,933 of which were EV6s. That’s a 39.7% year-over-year drop for the brand and a 40.4% decline in EV6 years, despite a mid-cycle refresh. Meanwhile, Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 outsold the entire Kia brand: 47,039 units last year.

Kia executives tell me that this is partially explained by the Hyundai “Metaplant” only building the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 right now. Kia’s EV6 has to share factory capacity with the Telluride, Sportage, Sorento and EV9. In a year where EVs struggled, Kia leaned into its profitable gas models. But with the EV3 slated to arrive soon and the EV market heating up, I hope Kia redoubles its efforts here.

I hope the Kia EV3 brings some life into Kia's U.S. EV business this year.

Conclusion

Top-line sales figures do not capture how chaotic this year was for the EV market. For the first time in modern history, auto giants had to navigate a trade and regulatory environment that was changing by the day. That uncertainty is expensive: It’s paid in extra supplier contracts, inflated prices and canceled long-term investments. Businesses need clarity to plan their next step, and when they lose it, they all end up writing off billions of dollars.

The result of this chaos for you is simple. You get higher prices, fewer choices and more carbon in the atmosphere. But those who thing a few regulatory changes will reshape the broad course of history are fools. EVs are here, and they are the endgame. The only question is how fast we get there.

The International Energy Agency's (IEA) report, titled What Next for the Global Car Industry?, shows the sector is undergoing profound changes as the transition towards EVs accelerates.

In 2024, global car sales neared 80 million units, with growth driven by hybrid and electric cars increasing by around 30%.

According to the IEA, global sales of pure ICE cars have fallen by 30% since reaching an all-time high in 2017.

This decline suggests the structural makeup of the automotive sector is being permanently altered as manufacturers pivot their long-term capital investments.

China and other emerging economies now account for more than half of global car sales.

Between 2010 and 2024, China more than doubled its car production and now accounts for 40% of global manufacturing.

In 2024, it overtook the European Union to become the world’s largest car exporter.

“The global car industry is a cornerstone of many national economies, directly employing more than 10 million people worldwide and supporting millions of additional jobs,” says Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the IEA.

“The market for cars is one of the largest for a single product and cars are the single largest source of global oil demand today.”

Shifting value in automotive supply chains

The IEA estimates that roughly 70% of EVs sold are produced in China.

Automotive manufacturing continues to operate in regional clusters that reflect divergent technology choices.

For example, Shanghai’s 26 battery plants represent more than 5% of global capacity, while legacy ICE components remain dominated by Europe, Japan, Korea and North America.

Chinese firms control around 80% of battery-related manufacturing capacity.

Producing cars in China is cheaper than in advanced economies, largely due to large-scale manufacturing and vertical integration.

Lower component costs account for nearly 40% of the manufacturing cost gap for EVs.

This is driven by battery economics, with average battery cell prices more than 30% lower than in Europe and 20% lower than in the US.

“The global car industry is currently undergoing major changes that have significant implications for economies around the world and for the energy sector,” says Fatih.

“Three structural shifts are under way, in terms of the geography of production, in terms of the regions that are driving sales growth and in terms of the technologies that car buyers are choosing.

“Against this backdrop, this new IEA report provides a strong basis to inform discussions and decision-making by governments and industry, noting that there is no one-size-fits-all model.”

Strategic priorities for manufacturing resilience

Batteries are a key differentiator in regional manufacturing costs.

IEA data shows the European Union imports a far higher share of battery components than engines, while China and Japan retain integrated supply chains across both technologies.

Vertical integration is a critical factor for future competitiveness.

As governments navigate these shifts, policy decisions must balance short-term competitiveness with longer-term resilience, the IEA says.

While vehicle assembly retains local value, battery manufacturing carries strategic importance beyond the car industry.

The initiative will look at geological hydrogen in Michigan as a usable, clean fuel alternative. The Office of the Governor says Michigan is nestled in one of the most promising regions in the world for geological hydrogen, a naturally occurring energy source.

“Michigan is a leader in clean-energy solutions,” said Gov. Whitmer. “This initiative will uncover more about Michigan’s geologic hydrogen stores, which have the potential to attract long-term investments in our state and create thousands of good paying jobs for Michiganders. Together, we’re building the future of clean energy in Michigan.”

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) says geological hydrogen is a clean fuel that only creates water and heat as a byproduct. The gas is formed through natural processes deep within the earth, and can be extracted commercially for use as a fuel source alternative to fossil fuels.

Geological hydrogen can help decarbonize some of the highest emission-producing industries like heavy-duty transportation, maritime shipping and manufacturing, according to a release by the Office of the Governor.

“Geologic hydrogen represents a transformative opportunity for Michigan, a state historically rich in natural resources and innovation,” said Jim Saber, President and CEO of NextEnergy. “By tapping into this abundant, naturally occurring resource, Michigan can lead the way in sustainable energy, create new jobs, and drive technological advancement. This isn’t just about energy—it’s about securing Michigan’s future as a leader in environmental stewardship and economic resilience, ensuring prosperity for generations to come.”

The governor's office said that investments in geological hydrogen will put Michigan in a position as a frontrunner in the U.S. hydrogen economy, which they say is projected to reach tens of billions of dollars in new economic activity.

The executive directive establishes the Michigan Geologic Hydrogen Exploration and Preparedness Initiative within the Executive Office of the Governor. That initiative will ""coordinate statewide planning, regulatory readiness, workforce and economic strategy, infrastructure assessment, and environmental evaluation necessary to prepare for the exploration and development of geologic hydrogen in Michigan.""

The Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE), Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Michigan Infrastructure Office and Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) are all tasked with providing reports to the Office of the Governor, on or before April 1, 2026.

Energy storage While generation policy has dominated headlines, the real constraint of the power sector in 2025 has been delivery.","President Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January 2025 marked a decisive shift in energy policy for the US. Climate ambition has been deprioritised in favour of speed, reliability and national security, with energy recast as a strategic asset underpinning industrial competitiveness, digital infrastructure expansion and geopolitical leverage.

As a result, the power sector was pulled in different directions at once: record demand growth colliding with trade barriers, and fossil fuel support rubbing up against entrenched clean energy economics.

At the heart of this shift are data centres. Trump has been unequivocal about expanding domestic digital infrastructure, and this ambition has rippled across energy policy.

“In his executive orders (EOs) on data centre expansion, he treats energy as a core asset,” says James Roth, head of government affairs and policy at Bloom Energy and former director in the Executive Office of the President under the Clinton and Bush administrations. “When the White House issues that kind of edict, from my experience, it sends a clear signal to federal and state regulators to enact policies or regulations consistent with that.”

Simultaneously, tariffs have been the most consequential – and disruptive – policy tool of Trump’s second term. By the end of his first year, average effective US tariff rates had climbed to around 15% year-on-year (YoY), reaching levels not seen in decades. Key equipment and components for generation, transmission and distribution, from gas and solar power to batteries and grids, have been caught in the crossfire, driving up project costs and heightening uncertainty. According to Power Technology’s parent company, GlobalData, tariff-related job postings in the power sector surged 657% YoY in 2025, reflecting the scale of disruption across the industry.

Amid the chaos, power demand growth has proved relentless, forcing utilities, developers and investors to adapt, regardless of Washington’s priorities.

Trump tariffs and power, a summary

Trump returned to office guns-blazing; early on, he targeted Chinese goods, including renewable energy components, with rates as high as 60%, before extending duties to other key trading partners like South East Asia and Europe. In June 2025, steel and aluminium tariffs doubled to 50%, while a new 50% tariff on copper took effect in August. These materials underpin every part of the power system, including but not limited to, turbine towers, solar frames transformers and transmission lines.

“While the US’ goal [from the tariffs] is to stimulate domestic manufacturing, the immediate effect has been a disruption of established supply chains and higher prices for essential components and materials for US energy,” explains Pavan Vyakaranam, senior power analyst at GlobalData.

GlobalData analysis estimates that Trump’s tariffs on steel, aluminium and copper increased overall project costs for US power generation assets by 6–11%. While solar and battery storage have been hit hardest, other assets – including those favoured by Trump, like gas plants – were also ensnared in collateral damage.

All in all, however, tariffs and Trump’s broader energy policies have certainly not affected all technologies equally.

The new economics of power: how has Trump 2.0 affected each technology?

Nuclear power

Nuclear power has been one of the clearest beneficiaries of Trump’s second term. The administration has framed it as a cornerstone of energy dominance, national security and data centre expansion, with policy delivered primarily through EOs.

In May 2025, Trump set a target to quadruple US nuclear capacity to around 600GW by 2050. He then followed up with multiple EOs aimed at reinvigorating the nuclear industrial base, reforming reactor testing and reshaping the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to accelerate approvals.

“At first glance, Trump’s approach might seem just domestic-focused and less international [than other administrations], but there has also been a lot of bilateral cooperation,” World Nuclear Association representative Henry Preston clarifies. In 2025, the US established agreements with the likes of South Korea, Japan and the UK on advanced fuels, reactor designs and heavy-component manufacturing. Most notably, in October, the US Government partnered with the Canadian owners of Westinghouse Electric to develop new nuclear reactors, with a projected investment of $80bn.

Preston notes that nuclear’s resurgence is not a sharp break from previous policy. Under the Biden administration, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) delivered significant support for nuclear, and the US led international coordination on the COP pledge to triple global nuclear capacity.

“Trump’s approach has been a different mechanism – primarily executive orders,” he says, “but overall, I think it is more of a continuation, just with a different emphasis and delivery.”

What has changed dramatically since Trump’s first term is demand. AI and data centres have spotlighted nuclear more than ever, given their compatibilities in load profiles. “We are now seeing groundwork for small modular reactors across the US, and major investment in advanced fuels,” Preston adds.

Rising demand, energy security and reliability – “those three factors are really driving support for nuclear”, he says, and they are unlikely to fade regardless of who occupies the White House. “The [continuation of] bipartisan support for nuclear in the US will be crucial, because nuclear is a long-term asset.”

Thermal power: gas and coal

If nuclear represents long-term ambition, natural gas and coal have been the short-term workhorse of Trump’s energy agenda.

“Trump’s speed-focused energy approach centres around expediting the permitting and approval timelines for energy infrastructure – especially oil, natural gas and coal projects – by streamlining environmental reviews and reducing regulatory friction,” says Vyakaranam.

In 2025, Trump has solidified federal backing for new combined-cycle plants, issued EOs to streamline permitting, accelerated approvals under National Environmental Policy Act revisions, and instructed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to facilitate approvals for new pipelines and LNG capacity, all as part of his “energy dominance” agenda.

The president’s enthusiasm for data centres has further strengthened gas’ position, with Vyakaranam noting: “With Trump’s pro-fossil fuel policies in place, it is both more economical and, from a clearances perspective, easier to roll out gas-based projects than others like renewables for data centres.”

Karen Wayland, CEO of the GridWise Alliance, adds that coal power has seen similar support, with the administration pushing to keep large conventional generating resources online, including rolling back Clean Air Act rules for coal plants and issuing emergency orders to delay retirements.

The favouritism is even clearer with the thermal sector’s tariff exemptions; none of Trump’s tariffs have been applied to crude oil, natural gas or refined fuel imports, with the purpose of safeguarding the feedstock imports on which most of the Gulf Coast’s refineries rely to produce US petroleum products.

However, fossil developers still rely on steel, aluminium and copper imports – all subject to tariffs. Therefore, “although Trump’s policies promote the advancement of fossil fuels, his tariffs on key materials have raised the cost of pipelines, compressors and plant equipment”, says Vyakaranam, adding that the resulting higher construction and maintenance costs risk feeding into consumer electricity prices.

Renewable power: solar, wind and hydro

Clean energy developers braced for turbulence as soon as Trump’s victory was announced in the 2024 elections.

As anticipated, the first year of Trump’s second term saw federal support weaken. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) accelerated the end of eligibility for clean electricity production and investment tax credits; the Department of Energy’s grant programmes have been scaled back; offshore wind leasing paused; and national clean electricity targets effectively shelved, with deployment now driven largely by state mandates.

According to GlobalData, clean energy project cancellations reached around $8bn in the first quarter of 2025 alone.

However, solar points to multiple contradictions in Trump-era energy policy. Globally, module oversupply has driven costs down, but in the US, tariffs and anti-dumping duties have pushed costs back up over the past year. GlobalData estimates Trump’s tariffs to have raised US utility-scale solar project costs by around 20–54%, driven by a spike in imported module and inverter prices.

While domestic manufacturing has grown, Vyakaranam notes that the US still lacks upstream scale, extending procurement lead times and limiting the domestic sector’s ability to absorb tariff shocks.

The wind power sector – especially offshore – has faced the most direct backlash. In his first day back, Trump signed a memorandum pausing all new or renewed leasing and permitting for wind projects. Over the course of the year, his administration issued stop-orders on several large-scale offshore projects, rescinded $679m in grants for wind energy infrastructure, and launched investigations into “national security risks” of wind projects and imported wind components, among other actions.

The President’s long-standing hostility culminated in December with the suspension of five major offshore projects on the grounds of national security. Although relevant developers quickly retaliated with legal proceedings, the move had already triggered a sharp sell-off.

Tariffs were an additional layer to the damage. The price hike on imported steel and aluminium – integral to wind turbines – has significantly driven up project costs. Dominion Energy’s 2.6GW Coastal Virginia project, for instance, reported an estimated capital cost rise from $10.9bn to $11.2bn resulting from tariffs.

While onshore wind has been shielded by Trump’s wrath relative to offshore, this was not the case for his tariffs. Vyakaranam estimates that tariffs may raise US onshore wind capital expenditures by up to 9% and increase the subsidised levelised cost of energy by 2–11% across different scenarios.

“The direct impact of tariffs encompasses elevated input expenses, whereas indirect consequences arise from disturbances to the equilibrium of supply and demand within intricate international supply chains.”

The Trump administration’s policies generally point to increased uncertainty, project delays and rising costs for the US solar and wind industries – thereby reducing competitiveness against fossil fuels.

Yet, experts argue that these rollbacks have not fundamentally changed the trajectory for US renewable energy.

Despite the policy headwinds of 2025, renewables continued to flourish, buoyed by the underlying economics – with wind and solar among the cheapest new power sources – and deeply entrenched long-term policy frameworks like the IRA. The outlook remains strong, with GlobalData projecting that solar photovoltaic, in particular, will account for 61.7% of investments in the power market between 2025 and 2030.

“Some projects in development might have been slowed because of loss of tax incentives or other policy setbacks, but the reality is, because of the growing cost differential between renewables and conventional fossil fuel generating resources, utilities are likely to keep adding renewable energy,” Wayland confirms.

Meanwhile, hydropower stood out as a renewable technology favoured by Trump. The administration has explicitly prioritised hydropower development as part of its America First energy policy, recognising its role in grid reliability and energy independence.

The OBBBA also includes provisions favourable to hydropower, with tax credits retained for hydropower projects starting construction by the end of 2033. The bill also includes workable Foreign Entity of Concern provisions relevant to hydro and pumped storage supply chains.

Energy storage

While generation policy has dominated headlines, the real constraint of the power sector in 2025 has been delivery. Data centres alone drove a more than 20% increase in US grid power needs, according to GlobalData, while the country’s interconnection queues swelled to more than 2.6TW of planned capacity.

Against this backdrop, energy storage has emerged as one of the most resilient technologies under Trump. While renewable tax credits were rolled back, those for stand-alone storage remains intact through the mid-2030s.

“Storage was largely spared [from negative effects of Trump’s policies],” says Arvin Ganesan, CEO of Fourth Power, mainly due to what it offers for data centres. Current grids are proving incapable of handling the demands of these energy-intensive facilities; storage serves as an appealing solution, as it allows for “power delivery when the centre needs it” and “more fundamentally, battery facilities can be built in roughly two years, far faster than large-scale generation or transmission upgrades”.

However, the energy storage market, too, was not immune to tariff impacts. Given China’s dominance over the lithium-ion used in battery production, alongside tariffs on other key storage materials like copper and aluminium, Trump’s trade policies have “significantly increased the cost of energy storage systems and project development, hindering further investment”, Vyakaranam explains.

Still, Ganesan believes that “despite these short-term impacts, storage will continue to grow in the US”.

The second year of Trump’s second term

In 2026, experts agree that the main focus for energy will be affordability, due to the looming mid-term elections.

“Electricity affordability has become more difficult for residential, commercial and industrial customers over the past year,” Ganesan details, calling it an inevitable political pressure point in the year ahead. Roth agrees. “The rise in electricity prices was mainly driven by a massive spike in demand, much of which comes from data centres,” he says, noting that Trump’s strong backing for data centres may influence narratives.

Wayland also expects energy costs to dominate the mid-terms debate, which may provide a potential foundation for a tweak in energy policy under the Trump administration: “Some of Trump’s approaches make sense, but others – like rolling back energy efficiency standards for appliance – are misguided. Energy efficiency has been one of the biggest consumer benefits over the past decade, and reducing standards won’t lower bills.”

On the other hand, Roth sees no sign of a policy pivot, despite mounting pressure.

As rising power demand collides with political realities, “the coming years will be a crucial test on whether the US can successfully balance being a climate leader and an economic competitor simultaneously”, says Vyakaranam.",https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2026/01/shutterstock_2551951959.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 14:00:38.928816

This article is one of a series in our review of all integrated resource plans (IRPs) for electric utilities across the United States. We provide analysis of expected load, planned capacity, modeled generation and emissions, and comparison to targets and decarbonization scenarios to evaluate progress toward a zero-carbon energy future. IRPs do not provide a fully accurate prediction of the future, but we focus on them because they reflect the direction that utilities are currently striving for and a set of proposed actions to get there.

Updates in 2025 Q4

In the final quarter of 2025, the 15 utilities that updated their IRPs (representing 10 percent of total US electricity generation in 2024) cut planned wind and solar capacity additions by 2035 in half, to 23 GW, a drastic reduction from the previously planned 46 GW.

This reduction occurred while utilities made only minor adjustments to projected load through 2035 — an increase of 0.6 percent. As a result, the net impact in projections for companies that updated their IRPs in 2025 Q4 is an increase in cumulative emissions through 2035 of 9.4 percent.

Changing resource adequacy rules in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and Southwest Power Pool (SPP) regions, phase out of federal tax credits for wind and solar, anticipated repeal of greenhouse gas regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and changes to state policy were all factors influencing this reduction in planned wind and solar build discussed by utilities in their IRPs.

This quarterly IRP update coincides with an annual update to include 2024 historical data. In 2024, US regulated electricity sector emissions slightly increased. Consequently, the annual data update also increased projected emissions compared to previous reviews in 2025 Q3 and Q2, widening the gap between utility plans and the science-based emissions pathways necessary to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

In this article, we dive into current utility resource plans, how they changed in the past quarter and year, and solutions utilities are implementing to make progress.

The current state of IRPs

In our current snapshot of IRPs (Exhibit 1), we continue to see a gap between projected emissions, target emissions, and decarbonization pathways such as the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (IEA NZE).

Most decarbonization pathways, including the IEA NZE, find that the electricity sector needs to reach net-zero emissions by 2035. However, if all companies in our coverage meet their company targets, they are currently projected to reduce emissions by 63 percent by 2035, compared to a 2005 baseline. To close this gap, utilities will need to more comprehensively cover emissions from both owned (Scope 1) and purchased (Scope 3) generation. There is also a gap between both decarbonization and corporate targets and projected emissions based on IRPs representing utilities’ planned investments. As of 2025 Q4, IRPs project emissions to be reduced by just 45 percent by 2035, compared to a 2005 baseline.

Exhibit 1

Load

As of the end of 2025 Q4, IRPs across the United States anticipate load will grow 25 percent by 2035 compared to 2023 levels (Exhibit 2). This is a 0.1 percent increase compared to the end of Q3.

Expectations of electricity demand grew drastically in 2024, as utilities added new load from data centers, manufacturing, electric vehicles, and electrification of residential and commercial end uses to their projections. This slowed in 2025, in part because some of this newly anticipated load was already established, but also because of regulatory changes and revisions to load projection methodologies. Some utilities took speculative new large load projections out of their base case projections, and others updated methodologies closer to best practices for large load forecasting.

Exhibit 2

Capacity

Current planned capacity in IRPs across the United States (Exhibit 3) includes 226 GW of wind and solar additions, 100 GW of gas additions, and 73 GW of coal retirements from the end of 2024 to the end of 2035.

This reflects 18 GW less wind and solar capacity, 26 GW of additional gas capacity, and 5 GW more coal retirements compared to utility plans a year ago at the end of 2024.

Changing resource adequacy rules by major grid operators have had a significant impact on planned wind and solar capacity. For example, Centerpoint Energy Indiana South and AES Indiana each cited MISO resource adequacy and capacity accreditation rules as major factors in their planning, and took 1.8 and 3.1 GW of solar and wind capacity additions by 2035 out of their resource plans, respectively. Removal of federal tax incentives, clean energy legislation in North Carolina, and the EPA’s proposed repeal of greenhouse gas emission regulation, are all also significant factors that have shifted utility plans away from wind and solar and toward coal and gas.

Plans to build batteries have also held or increased in most cases, as batteries retain future tax incentives under recent federal policy. In aggregate, our projections include 68 GW of planned battery capacity additions from the end of 2024 to the end of 2035, a 7 GW increase from the end of 2024.

Exhibit 3

Emissions

Our latest projections (Exhibit 4) from IRPs at the end of 2025 are that carbon dioxide emissions will be 45 percent lower than 2005 levels by 2035. This is higher than we projected a year ago at 47 percent, and two years ago at 52 percent.

Compared to today, the future grid of 2035 will have lower emissions because of planned coal retirements and wind and solar capacity additions. However, major changes to utility plans of increased load in 2024, decreases to planned wind and solar capacity in 2025, and increases to planned gas capacity, have led our current projected emissions to be higher than they have been since the end of 2021.

Exhibit 4

Cumulative metrics

When considering climate alignment of the US electricity sector, or individual utilities, RMI’s Engage & Act platform’s key metric is cumulative emissions through 2035. RMI also finds value in metrics of cumulative projected load, to know whether the task of reducing emissions is becoming easier or more difficult for utilities, and cumulative projected emissions intensity, to know if consumers are increasing or decreasing emissions associated with their electricity consumption.

Exhibit 5 shows that across all IRPs in the United States, projected load has increased consistently since early 2021 but has leveled off in recent months. Projected emissions fell from early 2021 to mid-2023 but have increased significantly since then. Projected emissions intensity has also increased in recent months.

Cumulative projected emissions from 2023 to 2035 are 3.2 percent higher, cumulative projected load is 1.1 percent higher, and cumulative projected emissions intensity is 2.1 percent higher now at the end of 2025 than they were a year ago at the end of 2024.

Exhibit 5

Exhibit 6 provides an additional view of the direction that IRPs are going, by considering percent change in cumulative projected load and emissions among the set of companies that did update their IRPs each quarter. Utilities that updated IRPs in 2025 Q4 increased load by 0.6 percent, emissions by 9.4 percent, and emissions intensity by 8.8 percent.

Exhibit 6

Solutions that can scale

Recent utility plans have taken several steps to improve processes and methods to solve for utility priorities of cost, reliability, and climate impact with fast, affordable, flexible solutions.

Load forecasting, particularly for new large loads, is improving in many cases. Most utilities with updated IRPs in 2025 Q4 included scenario-based load forecasting, including specific plans on how they will meet energy and reliability needs of large loads in cases where these loads are uncertain.

Clean repowering opportunities appeared in multiple IRPs this 2025 Q4. Centerpoint Energy Indiana South plans to use interconnection rights at the site of a retiring coal unit to fast-track a battery storage addition, and Duke Energy Carolinas/Progress is studying use of surplus interconnection to add storage capacity. These examples add to utilities from 2025 Q3 of Santee Cooper and Cleco Power who each also propose re-use of retired fossil plant sites for solar and/or batteries.

Virtual power plants (VPPs) are also an emerging solution: Dominion Energy Virginia is preparing to pilot a VPP program up to 450 MW, and Centerpoint Energy Indiana South’s IRP includes a contract for a demand response aggregation program.

However, these solutions need to scale and additional revisions to planning processes are needed to enable progress toward a reliable, affordable, low-carbon electric grid. Modern methods for modeling grid reliability, rather than focusing on individual power plant dispatchability, are necessary to enable wind and solar to receive appropriate credit for their grid services. Building more of the lowest-cost electricity generation technologies will help keep electricity affordable, as will using updated costs and constraints of available technologies.

Improved planning processes and methods, with supporting policy and regulation, are critical in this moment for electric utilities to more effectively transition toward a low-cost, zero-carbon future.

Dive Brief:

A coalition of 34 environment and agriculture groups are urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture to declare on-farm manure digesters ineligible for funding through the Rural Energy for America Program. The groups include environmental organizations such as Friends of the Earth, the Waterkeeper Aliance and Food & Water Watch, as well as agriculture-centered advocacy groups like Farm Aid and Animal Legal Defense Fund.

In their petition, the groups estimated about $257 million of the $3.2 billion disbursed by the program from 2021 to 2025 went to digester projects. They further noted that the average grant or loan guarantee for digesters was much higher than for solar or wind projects, which are also funded by REAP.

Earthjustice also filed a lawsuit Wednesday attempting to compel the USDA to release records explaining the methodology it used to justify support for digesters. Meanwhile, REAP funding is delayed as the agency says it’s dealing with a backlog of applicants for the popular program.

Dive Insight:

The petition comes amid continued advocacy against government programs that subsidize anaerobic digesters. Opponents say the digesters do more environmental harm than good and lead to farm consolidation, while biogas groups say digesters tackle emissions and provide an important revenue source for farmers.

The petitioners argue that the federal government should declare digesters ineligible because they do not meet the criteria that projects should meet to receive REAP funding. The program is meant to fund projects that provide environmental benefits, favor small farms in lower-income communities and do so in a cost-efficient manner, the petitioners say.

“REAP exists to help farmers and rural small businesses lower energy costs and foster stronger communities, not prop up factory farms,” Molly Armus, animal agriculture policy program manager at Friends of the Earth, said in a statement. “If USDA wants to save taxpayer dollars, it should stop wasting its funds on inefficient, costly digesters and instead invest in projects that truly benefit rural communities.”

Biogas groups pushed back on the petition; Geoff Dietz, senior director of federal affairs for the RNG Coalition, called it “without merit and unlikely to succeed.” Biogas groups have long argued that digesters do a better job at capturing emissions from manure than other methods because they consolidate the material and cover it with a system that extracts the gas. Dietz said the systems provide “durable economic and environmental returns for rural America.”

Proponents further argue that digesters are a cost-effective means of generating energy, and say that the systems benefit farmers by generating additional revenue and reducing fertilizer costs.

“The reality is that biogas systems and digesters align directly with REAP’s statutory goal of providing environmental and public health benefits in rural America. There’s no question they should be included,” Patrick Serfass, executive director of the American Biogas Council, said in a statement.

The debate over digester subsidies has become central to other incentive programs around the country. Removing provisions beneficial to digesters was a key ask of environmental justice advisors during recent debate over California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which received a major update in 2024. Digester opponents there were ultimately unsuccessful. A similar conflict is playing out in New Mexico, where regulators are in the process of finalizing the state’s own clean fuels program.

One of the central claims of opponents is that digester incentive programs enable the concentration of dairy herds. The petition cited studies finding that dairy operations with digesters grew their herd size much more quickly than those that did not. Larger herd sizes increase the threat of air and water pollution, the petitioners say.

They further note that the creation and storage of digestate results in the production of compounds like ammonia at much higher levels than would be produced from untreated manure. And other nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are made more water soluble in the anaerobic digestion process, potentially causing ground and surface water quality problems when the digestate is spread on land.

Those issues become more pronounced if facilities discharge their waste into the environment accidentally or in violation of their permits. The petitioners allege at least a dozen digester projects funded by REAP in recent years had documented water pollution issues. As an example, they name one Michigan facility that received a $1 million REAP grant in 2024 despite state regulators citing the associated dairy for multiple unpermitted discharges of waste and “evidence of chronic discharge of runoff and leachate.”

Finally, the petitioners dig into the finances of digesters and argue the projects cannot always recoup their costs. They performed an analysis of EPA data of on-farm digesters around the country and found that 17% have shut down, some due to financial challenges. Those challenges become more pronounced if fuel subsidies are weakened or removed, as environmental groups would like to see.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/U--NmBNK6JjSDk7g1clP2mVN-TlaejiDggZyUFFUi7o/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS81Mzc1OTUwNzk4MF9lMWQzMTdjYzBkX2suanBn.webp,N,,2026-01-15 13:01:30.949177

Gretchen Whitmer signed an executive directive Thursday that she said would help explore geologic hydrogen as a new source of energy in Michigan, requiring state agencies to plan for needed infrastructure and policy changes.

Whitmer announced the initiative during a speech at the Detroit Auto Show, saying if Michigan's hydrogen reserves are proven to be safe and viable, they could lead to a ""massive economic boom, creating jobs, lowering costs and reducing our reliance on foreign fuel.""

The directive, her first of 2026, will require the Department of Natural Resources to develop a report on any legal impediments to leasing ""state-owned subsurface rights"" for hydrogen exploration and the Michigan Public Service Commission to develop a report on needed infrastructure upgrades.

""The directive could make us a national leader in this space,"" Whitmer said Thursday, according to her prepared remarks for the event. ""We’re already seeing a lot of interest in Michigan because we have more potential reserves under our feet than every other state.""

The reports from state agencies are due by April 1, according to the directive. The Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy must file one on ""statutory and regulatory authority to permit"" geologic hydrogen exploration and any impediments in current law.

A statement from the governor's office described geologic hydrogen as ""a natural energy resource with the potential to serve as a fuel source at a scale and price that is competitive with fossil fuels."" Hydrogen releases water when it is burned, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, while petroleum and other fossil fuels release planet-warming gases such as carbon dioxide.

The USGS released a report last year indicating Michigan could be rich with geologic hydrogen that could be tapped for fuel. The state has three elements needed for hydrogen accumulation, the report authors said: a source of hydrogen generation, porous reservoirs that store hydrogen and seals to prevent hydrogen from leaking.

The four-page directive that Whitmer signed said Michigan could see ""billions of dollars in new economic activity by tapping into a fraction of the U.S. hydrogen economy.""

In the statement from the governor's office, Judd Herzer, director of mobility research and innovation at Michigan State University, said Whitmer’s directive sent a signal that Michigan was serious about leading in geological hydrogen.

""With the right coordination across state agencies, research institutions and the private sector geological hydrogen can move rapidly from scientific promise to practical application, supporting hydrogen-powered mobility, clean energy independence and the advanced manufacturing opportunities that will define Michigan’s next era of innovation,"" Herzer said.

At the federal level, the U.S. Department of Energy is funding ongoing research into safe hydrogen handling and storage practices, according to the department's website.

Geologists predict Michigan rich with hydrogen

Exploration of underground hydrogen stores is in the early stage, USGS geologists said in their report published last year. Finding underground hydrogen stores has historically been considered a problem or gone unreported, since companies were typically on the hunt for petroleum and lacked the tools to measure hydrogen.

Sara Ryker, USGS associate director for energy and minerals, described the report as “tantalizing” when it was released in January 2025.

“For decades, the conventional wisdom was that naturally occurring hydrogen did not accumulate in sufficient quantities to be used for energy purposes,” Ryker said in 2025. “This map is tantalizing because it shows that several parts of the U.S. could have a subsurface hydrogen resource after all.”

The USGS report sparked interest in recovering hydrogen from below ground rather than making hydrogen by splitting molecules such as water, said Todd Allen, University of Michigan College of Engineering associate dean for research.

While the report shows what federal geologists believe to be the best places for finding geologic reserves of hydrogen, there hasn’t been much test drilling to determine whether the geologists’ predictions are right, Allen said.

“To a great extent, it’s unknown,” he said. “I think the interest in the state of Michigan is that the USGS map said we ought to have a lot.”

It could be a big deal for Michigan if the geologists turn out to be right and the state has large quantities of hydrogen available to recover, he said.

Hydrogen fuel cells could power heavy vehicles, such as ships and trucks. Some clean energy advocates see it as a way to decarbonize heavy-duty transportation and shipping as well as some heavy industries like steelmaking that traditionally rely on coal to power furnaces.

Hydrogen fuel typically is created by separating molecules that contain hydrogen – taking the H₂ out of H₂O, for example.

“If we could bring hydrogen out of the ground, it would be much cheaper,” Allen said. “If people can recover geologic hydrogen at the same rate we do natural gas, it would be much, much cheaper (than other sources of hydrogen) and it would be much, much easier to bring it into commerce.”

Separating out that hydrogen requires a lot of electricity and sometimes is done using natural gas, which releases fossil fuels is costly and negates some of the climate benefits of hydrogen. Extracting hydrogen from the ground also could be a win for the climate, Allen said, because it wouldn’t require electricity.

During a speech in Detroit on Tuesday, Republican President Donald Trump referenced hydrogen, appearing to joke — as he has many times during previous campaign stops in Michigan — that he would “pass on” using hydrogen to power cars.

“I’m hearing it’s not testing so well,” Trump said. “It’s fine, except when there’s an explosion, you’re a goner.”

Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. Department of Energy funded regional hydrogen hubs to study and produce hydrogen fuel and develop a supply chain for its use. Michigan is part of one such hub, the Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen, known as MachH2, which was set to receive up to $1 billion in federal funding as of 2023.

The hub programs are on “standby,” Allen said. Most were in the planning stage when Trump took office and had not yet received much of their promised funds, according to Allen.

“To a great extent, I think the hubs are just stuck,” Allen said. “There’s not a lot of action. I think it’s because the administration is not on a path to provide the big funding.”

Geologic hydrogen may be more appealing to the Trump administration because it requires a familiar process of extracting resources from underground, much like fracking natural gas or drilling for oil, Allen said.

“It could be a (good) thing just in general, a good, useful way of powering modern society, but it could be that the federal government shifts their focus, too,” Allen said. “It’s an extension of the thing we know how to do.”

Whitmer's speech at the auto show Thursday touched on tariffs, Michigan's economy and some of her goals for her final year as the state's governor. She can't run for reelection this fall because of term limits.

She called on Trump's administration not to abandon the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, which is up for review this year.

""Instead, we should build on the best parts and make it even better,"" Whitmer said, according to her prepared remarks. ""The USMCA has some of the strictest auto rules of any free trade agreement in the world.

""It raised wages for workers in all three countries, and guaranteed that more parts were made in the U.S. Is it perfect? No. But without our allies, we do not stand a chance.""

The USMCA started in 2020, during Trump's first term in the White House. But in recent days, he's downplayed it. During his trip to Michigan on Tuesday, he labeled it ""irrelevant.""

Also, on Thursday, Whitmer called on the Legislature to get a new state budget to her desk by June 30.

""With so much uncertainty, we owe it to local governments, schools, and businesses leaders to enact a transparent, timely budget,"" Whitmer said. ""I’m confident we can get it done.""

Last year, lawmakers and Whitmer failed to get the budget approved until after the Oct. 1 constitutional deadline.

Solar for All would transform energy affordability for 12,500 households across Pennsylvania, offering a lifeline as energy costs reach unprecedented levels.
For homeowners able to bear upfront costs, solar comprises a strategic long-term investment.
But for most Philadelphians, especially renters, sustained federal and state incentives are essential in maximizing renewable energy accessibility, reducing energy burden, and supporting Philadelphia’s transition to a more equitable energy system.","As utility bills climb, more Philadelphia families are being forced to make impossible choices between keeping the lights on and covering other basic needs. In the short term, many Philadelphians depend on support from programs such as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). In the long term, economic incentives must encourage renewable investments, namely solar, to reduce grid dependency for residents most burdened by rising energy costs.

Philadelphia’s housing market presents both a challenge and an opportunity for solar adoption, since nearly half of Philadelphians rent their homes. As of 2014, the city’s average renter spends upwards of 42% of their monthly income on rent and utilities, a figure that has grown as energy rates have risen over the last decade. With limitations on property improvements, renters forgo investments that lower energy expenses. These constraints create cycles of “energy burden” where households spend an overwhelming share of income on utilities.

Solar can be a groundbreaking solution for mitigating energy burden, but it comes at an upfront investment cost. Amidst ongoing policy uncertainty and inconsistent federal support for renewables, short-term solutions like upgrading to more efficient appliances may be practical in the interim. Yet as electricity demand outpaces supply and utility rates soar, solar becomes increasingly attractive as the breakeven period for investment falls.

Pennsylvania’s heavy reliance on natural gas further pressures electricity price stability, while a recent pause in LIHEAP funding leaves low-income households facing impossible tradeoffs between heating and other essentials. Local utilities PECO and PGW have stepped in with limited assistance programs to prevent winter shutoffs. Nevertheless, relief programs only provide a temporary fix for the underlying energy inequity crisis.

Well-designed incentives could shift the trajectory. The EPA’s Solar for All program offered hope, allocating $156 million to expand solar access across Pennsylvania as part of a $7 billion national effort. However, the program was recently rescinded under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), a decision now facing legal backlash. Solar for All would transform energy affordability for 12,500 households across Pennsylvania, offering a lifeline as energy costs reach unprecedented levels.

Solar’s upfront cost barrier was temporarily mitigated when the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) renewed the federal solar income tax credit (ITC), offering a 30% tax reduction to offset installation costs. Now, the OBBBA revokes this benefit for systems installed after 2025.

Despite the abrupt ITC phaseout, two residential solar financing options remain through 2027. Similar in concept, leased solar and power purchase agreements (PPAs) present opportunities. With solar leases, homeowners pay a lower fixed monthly rate for system electricity use, whereas PPA customers only pay for energy produced, typically below the utility’s price per kilowatt-hour. Because systems are considered third-party owned under these financing methods, the solar contractor claims the 30% tax credit and both parties benefit when savings are passed to households through lower electric bills.

Consider the potential savings for a typical Philadelphia household. According to solar developer Palmetto Solar, installing a 5.74-kilowatt system for a small home (up to 2,000 square feet) costs approximately $16,644 before incentives. The net cost drops to $11,651 with the ITC, yielding a payback period of approximately 7.5 years. Over a 25-year period, a system of this size could offset nearly all electricity usage and generate savings of more than $50,000, illustrating the power of economic incentives for renewable investments.

In contrast, households that lease systems or enter PPAs avoid upfront costs entirely. The solar contractor retains ownership, claims the 30% ITC, and passes part of those savings to customers through reduced rates. While this model offers less long-term savings than ownership, it expands access for households unable to finance their own installations.

Still, solar remains largely inaccessible, particularly for low-income households facing the steepest energy burdens and non-homeowners with few viable clean energy options. If U.S. incentives resembled trends in Australia, a leader in per-capita solar adoption, barriers for marginalized groups would shrink considerably. Australia’s policies are pushing the expansion of solar access for multifamily buildings, apartment residents, landlords, and renters. Even though landlords seldom install solar, split-incentive agreements allow landlords to recover installation costs through slightly higher rents, while tenants benefit from lower electricity bills and potential net-metering credits. The result is a mutually beneficial pathway to cleaner, more affordable energy.

For homeowners able to bear upfront costs, solar comprises a strategic long-term investment. But for most Philadelphians, especially renters, sustained federal and state incentives are essential in maximizing renewable energy accessibility, reducing energy burden, and supporting Philadelphia’s transition to a more equitable energy system.",https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Philly-Solar-Photo-aspect-ratio-1280-225-1-1200x630-c-default.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 16:00:47.121551

On his first day in office, after declaring an “energy emergency,” Trump paused permitting for some wind projects and promised to boost fossil fuels. A few months later, the administration ordered an offshore wind project to stop construction; other stop-work orders followed.

In July, Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which phased out a longstanding tax credit for building clean energy projects. The EPA ended the Solar for All program, designed to bring solar power to low-income homes and reduce electric bills. After a memo from the Department of Interior that effectively paused permitting for wind and solar projects on public land, the DOI cancelled a massive solar project in Nevada that would have powered two million homes. The administration also pulled grants for R&D on new clean energy tech.

Some states and developers have fought back and won lawsuits, but the attacks keep coming. Revolution Wind, a large offshore wind farm that’s under construction off the coast of Rhode Island and nearly complete, was issued a stop-work order in August by the Trump administration; a preliminary injunction from a judge in September let the work continue, but a second stop-work order came again in December. This week, the developer got another preliminary injunction to continue construction.

Unsurprisingly, the policy uncertainty has hurt clean energy businesses. “We saw some smaller companies go under because financing became challenging,” says Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy at the Solar Energy Industries Association. Offshore wind developments are struggling to survive the administration’s repeated attacks.

By some estimates, as much as 117 gigawatts of solar and battery storage projects—enough to power nearly 100 million homes—are at risk of not coming online in the next couple of years because of new challenges in getting federal permits. But at the same time, many clean energy developers are fully booked with new projects.

The demand from data centers is “unabated,” says Jim Spencer, president and CEO of Exus Renewables North America. “As much as we can deliver, they’re buying it.” Last week, the company closed a $400 million credit facility to build out new solar and wind projects—$150 million more than it initially expected to get from banks.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/01/p-1-91474000-us-clean-energy-boom.jpg",N,,2026-01-15 13:01:23.137275

The system went into service in August 2025 and represents the latest step in SIA’s multi-decade effort to reduce its carbon footprint while strengthening Indiana’s clean energy economy.

The solar installation produces more than three times the energy currently consumed by the expansion, meaning the solar installation generates a net surplus of clean power. That surplus is fed back into the company’s operations, creating both long-term energy cost containment and measurable carbon reduction benefits.

The project is expected to offset more than 250 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, the equivalent of supplying the electricity needs of 43 homes. Over its 30-year operating life, the system will deliver millions of kilowatt-hours of clean electricity, helping Subaru advance its corporate sustainability goals while reducing operating costs of the expansion at its Lafayette facility.

Building on a legacy of environmental leadership

SIA has long been recognized for its leadership in environmental practices. It was the first U.S. auto assembly plant to achieve zero-landfill status and has consistently invested in technologies that reduce waste, conserve natural resources and lower greenhouse gas emissions.

The new solar project builds on that legacy, demonstrating how one of Indiana’s largest manufacturers is using renewable energy as both a cost-containment strategy and a core component of its environmental vision.

The appetite for “AI + Power” platforms is enormous, but the risks are real: no revenue yet, decade-long construction cycles and thin project margins.","When Rick Perry’s Fermi America rang the Nasdaq bell, Wall Street didn’t just see another initial public offering. It saw a multi billion-dollar bet that the next energy revolution will be built not around cars or climate — but around computation.

Fermi’s pitch is simple but audacious: an 11-GW “Hyper-Power Campus” in Amarillo, Texas, combining nuclear, natural gas and solar to feed hyperscale data centers. It’s a case study in the new race for “AI-grade” megawatts: power that’s clean enough for investors, cheap enough for operators and available every hour of every day.

The project lands as the U.S. Department of Energy quietly scales back wind and solar grant programs, initiated by the Interior Secretary’s Order 3437, which was issued to end “preferential treatment” for wind and solar energy in decision-making. Following that, the DOE announced the termination of 223 renewables projects in “blue states” with subsequent legal action reported by the Environmental Defense Fund last month.

Clearly, the administration’s “energy dominance” mantra, once about drilling rigs and liquefied natural gas, has evolved into something broader: control over the power supply chain that fuels America’s digital backbone.

However, while recent project announcements show natural-gas resources are having their time in the sun, the long-term solution for satisfying AI’s power hunger isn’t gas alone. The physics and economics of data centers’ power needs — specifically, the 99.999% uptime that they require — requires a more inclusive approach. Ultimately a hybrid portfolio of gas + renewables + storage will prove the most successful approach.

The new demand curve

AI and data centers are rewriting the power script. Analysts estimate that U.S. data-center electricity demand could triple by 2030, rivaling Japan’s total consumption. In markets such as the Electric Reliability Council of Texas and the PJM Interconnection, interconnection requests are flooding the queue faster than transmission can be built.

The problem isn’t politics — it’s physics, as mentioned above. AI workloads don’t tolerate downtime, and 24/7 machine learning and training cycles demand firm capacity. Solar and wind are essential but intermittent; nuclear is dependable but slow to scale. That leaves one fuel enjoying a quiet renaissance: natural gas.

Gas isn’t glamorous, but it’s the reliable backbone of America’s AI build-out. Combined-cycle plants can ramp fast, integrate carbon capture and co-locate near industrial or digital hubs. The economics are persuasive — dispatchable, proven and abundant.

Developers are taking note. From Oklahoma to Ohio, mothballed projects are being revived, and hybrid plants pairing gas with solar and storage are becoming the “premium package” for hyperscale clients seeking reliability with a cleaner profile. It’s not the narrative climate activists prefer — but it’s the one investors trust.

Policy headwinds and market reality

DOE’s re-evaluation of renewable funding reflects a pivot from aspiration to execution. The obstacles aren’t ideological — they’re practical: transmission bottlenecks, permitting delays and mismatched incentives. Projects once hailed as flagships are now assessed through a harder lens of cost, timing and deliverability.

That recalibration doesn’t end the energy transition; it accelerates its next phase. The administration’s “energy dominance” now includes electrons. The companies that can deliver firm, scalable, low-carbon power to AI and cloud loads will define the next oligarchy — one built not on oilfields, but on interconnections and economics. Undoubtedly, solar energy and battery storage are some of the most rapidly scalable and cost competitive ways to meet the increased electricity demand. Given the need for clean firm power, scaling other energy technologies, such as next-generation geothermal, may also be leveraged to meet demand.

The DOE’s recent use of its Section 403 authority to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission toward a rulemaking on large-load interconnections could reshape how America builds for the AI era. If successful, it would do for power demand what Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 once did for power supply: give independent developers a clear path to serve major users directly, without waiting for utility gatekeepers.

That single policy move could unlock a new generation of Fermis — merchant developers blending gas, renewables and storage into integrated, behind-the-meter systems that serve AI and industrial clients directly. It hints at an era of “IPP 2.0,” where private capital builds micro-grids at hyperscale.

For policymakers, the message is clear: America’s grid rules were written for predictable load growth. AI has changed the equation. The DOE–FERC initiative points toward a new architecture: faster interconnections, market access for large loads and private capital as the catalyst.

Capital meets concrete

Fermi’s initial public offering is the canary in the turbine hall. Investors no longer silo energy, infrastructure and technology — they see one ecosystem. The appetite for “AI + Power” platforms is enormous, but the risks are real: no revenue yet, decade-long construction cycles and thin project margins.

Still, private-equity and infrastructure funds are betting that whoever cracks the hybrid-power code will own the next-gen digital economy. Expect clusters of multi-fuel projects near major data-center hubs across Texas, Virginia and the Midwest — where policy flexibility meets physical necessity.

The AI boom has fused America’s energy and technology narratives into one. The next decade of “energy dominance” won’t be about exporting hydrocarbons — it will be about exporting compute, powered by reliable, low-carbon megawatts.

Natural gas may be having a moment, but the winning model will be hybrid: gas for firmness, renewables for optics and cost, and storage for stability. The companies that master that integration — and successfully navigate the DOE–FERC framework — will become the new power barons of the AI age.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/AQLJEdY9ompcziqU8ybHSo0Cx941nSt6JKgDnSUU7Fk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTYxODUwOTc5XzIuanBn.webp,N,,2026-01-15 13:00:46.043233

Millions of workers construct, operate, and maintain the nation’s built environment systems and facilities, from roads to pipes to power plants and beyond. Simply keeping up with needed expansions and repairs is a tall task, and today, new technologies and climate impacts are heightening demands, including the need to train and hire a deep bench of talent. Research around defining, measuring, and addressing all these jobs has been widespread in recent years, giving policymakers and practitioners an opportunity to equip more workers with the needed education and training to pursue careers across the built environment. Doing so can lead to better outcomes for workers, employers, and the economy as a whole.

This report investigates this opportunity to expand skills development across a variety of built environment careers—those focused on constructing, operating, and maintaining transportation, energy, water, broadband, buildings, and other related assets. Specifically, the report explores ways in which leaders can overcome the fragmentation—by infrastructure sector, geography, and more— of occupations and industries in this space through a skills-first approach, or one that helps identify and elevate skills-first hiring and training. In addition to offering additional context on this opportunity, the report summarizes key takeaways from a series of interviews Brookings conducted with employers, training providers, community-based organizations, labor groups, and other workforce development leaders on how to promote skills development with greater flexibility and coordination, especially at the state and local level. It describes how:

Workforce development leaders need to think more comprehensively about “infrastructure skills,” not just “green skills.”

Workforce development leaders need to blend credentialing with work experience and continued career growth.

Skills development needs greater scalability across the built environment and across different geographies.

Both upskilling and reskilling are essential to meet current and future built environment demands.

Experimentation with place-based and project-based opportunities is essential to drive longer-term change.

Larger national policy and funding uncertainties around the built environment and workforce development at the moment have obscured the actions that leaders can take on these issues. But many workforce development leaders across the country continue to blaze a path forward, revealing collaborative and replicable models around skills development in the built environment space.

Introduction

The country’s built environment faces pressures on multiple fronts. From aging roads to leaking water pipes to surging energy demands, many infrastructure systems are in desperate need of repair and investment. Daily wear and tear is one factor, but extreme and more frequent climate impacts are compounding these needs; floods, fires, freezes, and more are disrupting or destroying systems across the country. Ongoing concerns around greenhouse gas emissions and overall sustainability are mounting too, including across buildings, manufacturing facilities, and a broad collection of other facilities.

Meanwhile, the country’s workforce also faces widespread needs. Layoffs, hiring freezes, and other uncertainties are gripping the labor market amid broader economic concerns. Many workers cannot flexibly and affordably gain needed skills and training to secure jobs, let alone launch or grow in long-term careers. Both less experienced and more experienced workers are running into these hurdles, with a continued need to earn higher wages, gain more benefits, and secure quality jobs and job pathways. Employers, to be sure, are actively looking to find and grow talent as well. And rapid change—not just technologically, but also in terms of climate needs—continues to uproot many workers, employers, and other leaders trying to seize greater economic opportunity.

Together, these dual infrastructure and workforce needs are significant, but they also present an opportunity: equipping workers with durable and transferable skills to address the country’s built environment needs while powering long-lasting, opportunity-rich career pathways.

Previous Brookings research on the infrastructure workforce has explored the multiple branching pathways available in this space, in addition to the more competitive and equitable wages across a vast array of infrastructure industries. Since so many of these positions are in the skilled trades—such as electricians and plumbers, among others—they also tend to require less formal postsecondary education and emphasize work-based learning opportunities such as internships and apprenticeships. Moreover, with a rising number of retirements and other turnover concerns, there is an urgent need to hire, train, and retain a generation of talent.

However, despite this infrastructure opportunity, policymakers and practitioners—including workforce development leaders—face stiff headwinds to actually unlock it. Long-standing gaps in defining, measuring, and communicating this opportunity remain prevalent. Inflexible and traditional hiring and training practices, including an emphasis on certain degrees or other credentials, can prevent new talent from entering these jobs. And despite the passage of historic federal funding in recent years, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), many state and local leaders have not always implemented (or rethought how to use) this money to support workforce development. Meanwhile, the current federal policy environment has led to huge ongoing questions for capacity-constrained state and local leaders.

This report aims to identify, contextualize, and address the need for ongoing skills development across the built environment amid the current policy backdrop. It focuses on a skills-first approach to a broad variety of careers in this space, expanding beyond prevailing analyses and efforts around “green jobs.” Rather than defining or analyzing a specific set of jobs in isolation, the report explores local policy and programmatic levers that can strengthen hiring and training pathways for more workers in more places.

The report first examines why skills development across the built environment matters. It then discusses the types of skills and credentials (e.g., educational degrees, licenses, certifications) needed, as well as the different actors involved. Based on a series of interviews with state and local workforce development leaders, the report concludes by offering ways to support skills development over time and demonstrating the strong economic benefit for workers and employers across the U.S.

Why skills development matters across the built environment

Equipping workers with the essential education and training to address the country’s built environment needs is no easy task. The wide variety of humanmade and natural infrastructure systems in need of oversight—from transportation and energy facilities to rivers, forests, and other related green infrastructure assets—means that there are an enormous range of activities involved and workers required. Constructing, operating, maintaining, and governing these systems depend on laborers, technicians, electricians, and other trades workers, for instance, as well as financial analysts, human resources specialists, and other administrative and managerial workers. There is no single job or skillset that stands out in this space.

Increasing climate impacts and the transition to a cleaner and more resilient economy—or a “green economy”—have come to dominate much of the skills conversation across the built environment. Upgrading homes, installing electric vehicle charging stations, and improving transmission lines are among the various projects that workers may carry out. In turn, the real-time and projected importance of “green jobs”—broadly defined as jobs that carry out activities with an environmental benefit—has attracted interest and investment among policymakers and practitioners, including federal leaders, state and local governments, and other public and private actors (e.g., financial firms).

However, the broad scope of workers involved in activities that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to climate impacts, and preserve or restore natural resources leads to inconsistent definitions, measurement challenges, and practical limitations on managing and prioritizing certain workforce development efforts. For instance, researchers have often emphasized clean energy workforce needs, including past Brookings research, Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys, and the Department of Energy’s annual Energy and Employment Report, which estimates there are more than 8 million energy jobs nationally, including 2.3 million in energy efficiency alone. But shifts to clean energy only capture a share of all the built environment assets, activities, and workers in transition.

Seizing a broader built environment opportunity means looking beyond narrow or inconsistent categories of green jobs. The problem with classifying and counting green jobs is that outside of a few occupations (e.g., solar installers, wind turbine technicians), few workers fit clearly into a “green” or “non-green” category. As technologies, designs, and the nature of work keep changing across the country’s built environment, there is a wide spectrum of jobs impacted by the green transition. For example, while not all HVAC technicians may focus on installing energy-efficient heat pumps and other green activities, some increasingly do so; the same could be said for electricians involved in installing wiring for solar panels, auto workers manufacturing electric vehicles, and so on. The evolving nature of jobs—not just the appearance or disappearance of jobs—reflects the reality that workers, employers, training providers, and other leaders must navigate in real time, and over time.

That is why more researchers, policymakers, and practitioners are emphasizing skills across the built environment, including “green skills” —the knowledge and abilities to carry out tasks as part of a job that brings an environmental benefit. Similar to green jobs, no singular definition exists for green skills, although a growing body of literature and policy guidance has come out from international organizations such as the United Nations and World Bank, federal agencies such as the Department of Labor, groups such as Burning Glass Institute and Jobs For the Future, and a variety of local-serving associations such as C40 and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation.

Among these and many other institutions, a few consistent points around green skills stand out. First, green skills include a variety of technical and specialized skills—including science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, for instance—but also a variety of soft skills, including communication and management. Second, they involve varying degrees of integration, with some jobs adding them to existing knowledge and abilities and other jobs potentially changing more significantly over time. Lastly, they likely coincide with other digital transformations, including around artificial intelligence, data analytics, and other functions.

The uncertainties around what exact skills will become more prevalent—including when, where, and for whom—mean that related education and training efforts need to be adaptable in this changing environment too. Different projections and surveys are attempting to estimate the pace, location, and penetration of new types of skills across the labor market, but many workers, employers, training providers, and other actors are simply responding in real time to the best of their abilities. Educational institutions may adopt new curricula, employers may adopt new on-the-job trainings, and local governments may draft new workforce plans—but they do not always do so in close coordination. Ensuring there is an economically and socially equitable transition remains an ongoing exercise in many places, and the lack of proactive and intentional policies and programs may cap potential economic opportunities.

While workforce development leaders do not have a crystal ball to perfectly predict what jobs or skills will be needed over time, they can prepare a larger talent pool for a variety of roles across the built environment, ideally equipping them with flexible and interchangeable knowledge, abilities, and experience. That includes a focus on equipping workers with relevant “green credentials,” which span educational degrees, licenses, certifications, and other signals of knowledge and experience across the built environment. But it’s not about the paper or credential itself. Skills-first hiring (or skill-based hiring)—recruiting workers based on their skills and competences, not just their educational degree—is becoming increasingly important to reduce barriers for workers and employers alike. Ensuring workers have greater portability in the education and training they receive is critical amid the rapid, widespread changes unfolding across the built environment and labor market.

Expanding skills development and identifying the actors involved

Expanding skills development across the built environment involves promoting transferable and portable sets of skills and credentials.

On the skills front, built environment workers rely on a combination of technical and other foundational knowledge that includes familiarity and experience with plumbing, electrical work, and operating heavy machinery, for instance, but also communications, public safety, and security. As past Brookings research has explored, a wide range of occupations such as civil engineers, electricians, and pile-driver operators emphasize these types of skills—not just solar installers, wind turbine technicians, or other green-focused workers. STEM skills, again, are crucial for many of these workers, including those in the trades who tend to gain greater knowledge and competency with certain engineering concepts, mathematical principles, and tools and technologies (e.g., geographic information systems, computer-aided design software) through on-the-job training.

Credentials—green or otherwise—can serve as enablers (and barriers) to workers applying for jobs and growing their careers; they can be industry- and occupation-specific, geographically specific, and field-specific (in the case of STEM fields, for instance). Given the wide range of careers across the built environment, credentials vary from place to place and position to position; there is no centralized repository of all the potential education and training needed. Some credentials are widely recognized by employers, some take years and are very expensive for workers, and some take less time and are easier to access and benefit from. At the same time, the proliferation of non-degree credentials (e.g., specialized or short-term certificates) has led to an education and training marketplace that can be crowded and chaotic, with real questions about quality and whether employers recognize them.

Despite this fragmentation, some commonalities exist. Secondary and postsecondary education degrees (e.g., associate degrees, bachelor’s degrees) can involve coursework and curricula focused on architecture, design, engineering, and other content areas geared toward boosting built environment knowledge and familiarity. Examples are numerous, from community college programs in Oregon and Illinois on renewable energy management to undergraduate and graduate programs in Michigan and New York on sustainability and environmental policy. State-issued licenses for several climate-related occupations—from water treatment operators to environmental engineers—are also common and demonstrate a worker’s aptitude to pass an exam, gain needed work experience, and maintain their status. Professional, industry, and association certifications are frequently recognized across many positions as well, including building professionals with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, as well as broader positions such as certified construction managers (CCMs) and certified HVAC workers involved in air conditioning repair and installation. Completion of work-based learning opportunities, including registered apprenticeship programs, can signal valued competencies and experience to employers, such as the Building Trades’ Multi-Craft Core Curriculum (MC3) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers’ (IBEW) programs. Shorter-term, competency-based credentials—including online badges and other micro-credentials for individual classes, for instance—can also support continued learning and skills development.

Beyond considering the specific skills gained and credentials earned, though, it’s perhaps even more important to examine and evaluate how a variety of workforce development leaders need to be involved. Expanding skills development will require more proactive planning and coordination across multiple occupations, industries, and geographies supporting the built environment, led by:

Training providers, including secondary and postsecondary educational institutions, do not have consistent built environment or “green” curricula per se, and when they do offer related coursework, it can often be geared toward a specific occupation, field, or specialty in an individual region. This unique curriculum—versus a consistent curriculum—can limit the ability of students and prospective workers to earn and use flexible credentials as they ultimately move, change fields, and grow their careers. At a more practical level, a lack of qualified instructors, needed tools and equipment, and the cost and availability of some programs can also limit early exposure and education in the skilled trades.

Employers, especially those across the built environment, typically operate in isolation, cling to business-as-usual hiring and training practices, and focus on project development versus workforce development. For instance, many transportation departments, water utilities, and engineering and construction contractors rely on prevailing HR processes (e.g., rigid degree requirements) and word-of-mouth to bring on new hires and compete against each other to secure scarce talent. They also do not have the bandwidth (financially or otherwise) to actively engage with communities, and may not always coordinate with other training providers—even though doing so could help them more reliably and cost-effectively prepare workers. These shortfalls can limit the potential for expanded on-the-job training, career growth, and other critical learning opportunities for workers—to say nothing of the benefits that these employers can gain from having a bigger, more dependable pipeline of talent for their projects over time.

State and local government leaders, including workforce development boards, labor departments, and infrastructure-related agencies (e.g., housing and environmental agencies) face a variety of planning and programmatic needs to accelerate skills development across the built environment. Chief among them is a continued lack of technical, financial, and managerial capacity to expand (or even experiment with) new workforce development strategies—a constraint that is becoming more pronounced amid the pullback in federal workforce, climate, and infrastructure funding. State and local bodies, such as state energy offices, also remain chronically understaffed. But even in places that have more resources, there are still prevailing challenges around crafting comprehensive green workforce plans, implementing those plans, and measuring and evaluating outcomes as part of a larger, more cohesive workforce development ecosystem. In addition, it is crucial to note the role of state and local political leadership—as well as regulatory bodies—to address prevailing workforce development needs, requirements, and other priorities.

Community-based organizations, typically including local-serving nonprofit groups that provide various forms of assistance and support, act as vital conduits to expose, prepare, and help workers pursue careers across the built environment. But these organizations also face many constraints. Lower-income, disadvantaged workers benefit from the supportive (and wraparound) services that these organizations can provide, including child care and transportation, but resource limitations remain a constant amid escalating demands. Reaching workers in need can be time- and resource-intensive, and measuring and assessing the outcomes of workers remain ongoing needs in data collection, analysis, and programmatic oversight.

Labor groups, unions, and other worker advocacy organizations are crucial partners in educating and training workers across the built environment, in addition to advancing workers’ rights and improving workplace conditions. But these groups can encounter challenges diversifying their ranks and consistently promoting a more inclusive workplace, especially for women and people of color in some industries and occupations. Rethinking existing training approaches and worker representation is also an emerging concern as new technologies and the nature of work change rapidly across the country. Continued tensions—real or perceived—with some employers and among some workers also remain a challenge for these groups.

In this way, the point of expanding skills across the built environment is less about the single piece of paper (or digital badge) a worker may receive, and more about the flexible set of education and training pathways they can pursue and benefit from as they look to enter and grow their careers. Yet the fragmented set of workforce development actors across the built environment means there is no clear owner of all these pathways (and subsequent hiring processes and long-term career growth)—demanding more proactive planning and programmatic coordination.

Improving and coordinating skills development across the built environment

To get a better sense of how workforce development leaders can forge stronger, more coordinated education and training pathways, the Brookings team interviewed a cross-section of leaders involved in the built environment across the country. These interviews emphasized the perspectives of leaders at the state and local level—including training providers, employers, government agencies, community-based organizations, and labor groups—with the aim to gain actionable insights around: 1) a priority set of skills; and 2) a promising collection of education and training programs that can accelerate the development of these skills and may be potentially scalable across regions.

Not surprisingly, no single credential, skill, or programmatic solution emerged during these interviews, but they shed light on how and where promising education and training efforts have emerged, with an eye toward both real-time and longer-term workforce needs. Common ingredients in these efforts included a need to emphasize a broad suite of built environment priorities, improved coordination with employers (and industry more generally), and continued experimentation across different places and project types. Five key takeaways are summarized below:

Workforce development leaders need to think more comprehensively about ‘infrastructure skills,’ not just ‘green skills’

While many leaders recognized the urgency of climate impacts and the unknowns emerging in the green transition, they also voiced distrust and skepticism in the overemphasis on green jobs, green skills, and green credentials. The “green” tag associated with different education and training pathways can be polarizing at times, politically and otherwise. While some positions undeniably require specific types of climate-related knowledge and experience (e.g., solar installers), a “whole building” approach would likely make more sense for more workers, especially at the beginning of their careers—that is, having a broader emphasis on construction, engineering, and other fields commonly found across the built environment. To several leaders we interviewed, the green credentials that workers pursue are only “green” in as much as the specific projects they may ultimately oversee also happen to be green (e.g., clean energy upgrades).

Instead, acknowledging—and pursuing—a cross-sectoral approach (e.g., for transportation, energy, water, and so on) could allow for greater transferability in education and training across multiple built environment industries and occupations. Leaders noted how these could include cross-cutting “infrastructure skills,” which emphasize STEM-related knowledge and familiarity with certain tools and technologies, as noted earlier. Multiple career pathways are available to workers in this space, and leaders need to foster different tiers of skills—from basic employability skills needed to launch a career (as evident in YouthBuild and Job Corps programs, for instance) to more specialized skills and associated credentials over time. One occupational example that leaders cited for the latter is Environmental Protection Agency Section 608 certification, in which HVAC technicians can demonstrate their additional knowledge and experience as their careers evolve.

Notable place-based examples include the DC Infrastructure Academy and Austin Infrastructure Academy, which leaders said demonstrate the types of sector strategies and broader skills development needed across the built environment. Both examples integrate education and training opportunities at a regional scale by serving as a single destination where employers, educators, community-based organizations, and other actors can coordinate on community engagement, work-based learning, and more. These academies have linked together training with immediate and long-term hiring priorities, while also pooling available funding and providing supportive services.

Workforce development leaders need to blend credentialing with work experience and continued career growth

Leaders we interviewed described how credentials alone should matter less than ensuring workers demonstrate the necessary skills to do the job. Employers, in particular, stood out as a key actors in this respect, in which enhancing work-based learning opportunities should be a major priority given the emphasis on trades positions across the built environment. Apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships were common examples, but leaders stressed how employers also need to more generally assume a more proactive role of “blending” credentialing with work experience and other factors. Process-wide improvements in the pre-hiring process were raised, including “customized, job-specific training services” evident in efforts such as the Virginia Talent Accelerator Program, among other state- and local-led initiatives. Beyond credentialing, leaders emphasized how training process changes are essential.

Several employers, of course, have already implemented such changes, offering precedent for broader, industry-wide adoption. Buy-in from leadership, amplifying a clear mission, willingness to consider changes in the hiring process, and investing in staff (especially around community engagement) were among the changes described, especially among contractors in the construction industry. The splintering of roles and responsibilities across the built environment, including for different projects in different geographies, means that contractors vary widely in their emphasis on (and capacity around) skills development—which is why having a clearer, industry-wide policy framework is essential to guide action. The Green Workforce Connect program represents a prominent example of how employers, community-based organizations, training providers, and other leaders have been able to create a common platform of collaboration. The availability of open source curricula and other employer best practices via the Center for Energy Workforce Development (CEWD) has also helped. Leaders noted how different carrots and sticks—such as project labor agreements and building code changes—have the potential to shift employer action, but they also noted how compliance-driven efforts can be off-putting and confusing for employers.

Skills development needs greater scalability across the built environment—and across different geographies

Leaders we interviewed repeatedly stressed numerous challenges in skills development given the fragmentation across the built environment. Transportation departments, water utilities, energy agencies, engineering and construction firms, and other employers do not usually plan projects together, develop coordinated budgets for training, or address other shared hiring needs over time as a larger, unified sector. Meanwhile, educational degrees and licenses can be highly localized—not only because of state-specific regulations, but also because of occupational nuances and particular employer demands. Data on training needs, hiring challenges, and worker outcomes can vary widely from place to place—or be missing entirely in certain built environment fields. Beyond formal credentials, skills-first hiring is an area of ongoing need for workers, employers, and other actors when it comes to validating skills, coordinating across different industries, and relying on legacy screening and hiring processes.

However, having greater scalability and portability to skills (not just credentials) can help overcome some of these challenges. For example, leaders pointed to the need for more industry-driven and standardized curricula in educational institutions, as accreditation bodies such as the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) have done for more than 200 clean energy training programs nationally. Creating more objective and reliable measures around skills-based hiring can also help by clarifying the benefits of this hiring model and creating clearer policy frameworks, which states such as Massachusetts and Washington have done. Standardized data dashboards on different climate projects and economic impacts can establish more quantifiable and outcome-driven measures, which organizations such as the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) does through its state energy-efficiency scorecards.

Both upskilling and re-skilling are essential to meet current and future built environment demands

Supporting the short- and long-term mobility of workers across the built environment requires meeting workers where they are currently and want to be ultimately—not just leveraging their skills or credentials for a particular position or project. Doing so can also more assuredly help employers—including many infrastructure owners and operators—address ongoing maintenance and capital needs. That means developing a workforce, not just leveraging it, as leaders described in the interviews. Incentivizing employers (financially) to prioritize ongoing workforce development is one possible path to do so—as attempted in the rollout of IIJA and IRA funding—but these efforts need to extend well beyond this policy window.

In particular, leaders emphasized a combination of upskilling and re-skilling for less experienced and more experienced workers alike, including providing necessary supportive services for continued learning and transitions. Engaging with students and disconnected youth requires greater (and more frequent) visibility and exposure to skilled trades careers in particular, via pre-apprenticeships, apprenticeships, and other service- and workforce-based learning opportunities. For example, training resources from the Center for Energy Workforce Development (CEWD) has helped boost employer engagement on these issues, as has coaching and technical assistance efforts from organizations such as UnidosUS. Similarly, it is important to reach workers further in their careers who might be unemployed, underemployed, or simply looking to move into a different field. Organizations such as JobsFirstNYC, for instance, have spearheaded regional collaborations around green workforce development, aimed at expanding access for different workers and cultivating longer-term pathways for career growth.

Experimentation with place-based and project-based opportunities is essential to drive longer-term change

Adjusting how workers, employers, and other actors view credentials—and their approach to training—is a tall task across multiple industries and geographies. However, leaders described the importance of more frequent experimentation—grounded in particular places and projects—to build greater momentum and offer a clearer demonstration of how skills development could occur more seamlessly across the built environment. There needs to be an intentional focus on skills development, not just a coincidental focus. They described the co-determination that needs to occur between policymakers and practitioners at the state and local level to better gauge labor supply and demand, encourage engagement among employers and training providers, and integrate learning with project development and execution.

Examples abound across the country on how such intentional and proactive approaches have emerged in this space. At the state level, for instance, the Texas Climate Jobs Project represents a coalition of unions launched in 2021, and has partnered with different actors in different places to intentionally center worker access and training, from building decarbonization to larger energy projects focused on methane reduction. Policymakers in Maine have also launched ambitious, targeted efforts around efficient heat pump installation, combined with active engagement with the state’s community college system to train hundreds of new technicians. At a more local level, infrastructure investments from the IIJA and IRA coupled with technological shifts toward AI have also propelled new collaborations: an urban forestry accelerator in Phoenix, advanced manufacturing training centers in Reno, Nev., weatherization development programs in Minneapolis, and green infrastructure training efforts in Atlanta. The wide variety of examples emerging nationally shows the continued appetite to test new ideas and approaches, even amid other policy and economic uncertainties.

Despite funding and policy shifts, there remains a need for skilled talent across the built environment

Whether filling jobs or boosting skills, the demand for talent across the built environment is clear. Employers, training providers, and other leaders continue to voice their need for a durable and dependable pipeline of talent to address project needs across a host of different systems and facilities. The magnitude of this need—including the wide range of activities being carried out, the skills required, and the geographies represented—means that larger, system-wide approaches are essential to drive change. Fluctuations in funding and other policy shifts—especially around greener upgrades—have called into question some prevailing projects and workforce development efforts, but they have not fundamentally altered the underlying calculus: The country’s built environment requires a steady stream of skilled workers to predictably and reliably execute on needed improvements.

Fortunately, several models (and examples) have emerged in recent years, highlighting actionable steps that many state and local leaders have been able to pursue. Collaborative and scalable programs centered around work-based learning have taken hold; more flexible and accessible credentialing opportunities have appeared; and more consistent and outcomes-oriented data around skills development have helped guide action. These and other efforts continue to build the case—and demonstrate proof—of how careers across the built environment offer pathways to greater economic opportunity over time, cultivated by intentional planning, programmatic coordination, and ongoing experimentation.",https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/welder-welding-steel-roof-truss.jpg?quality=75,N,,2026-01-15 13:01:19.247471

However, under a different scenario based on existing government policies and excluding aspirations to achieve climate goals, the IEA predicted that global oil and gas demand could grow until 2050, a departure from previous expectations.

The vans were great, but failed to perform as desired in the market. Though designed for commercial operators, the RV industry discovered the BrightDrop platform was also a perfect platform for an electric motorhome. One of the big players in the RV space, Coachmen, announced one of the most innovative motorhomes to come out of an Indiana company in years, based on the BrightDrop. The RVEX was the first all-electric motorhome from one of the big companies, and now it’s gone without a replacement.

My time at the 2026 Florida RV SuperShow has come to an end. I have tons of stories to write for you in the coming days, but I won’t get to write a particular story that I was extremely excited about. I wasn’t invited to see the RVEX when it made its debut at the Indiana RV Dealer Open House last year, so I was looking forward to seeing the RVEX in person here in Tampa. But after walking the entire Tampa site perhaps three times, the RVEX remained elusive. In fact, it wasn’t there at all.

The reason is sad. Coachmen has decided to pull the plug on the RVEX project, at least for now. But, more than that, Coachmen is taking the entire project, and even the RVEX prototype itself, out of the spotlight. The public won’t get to see Coachmen’s vision for the future. Hence, the unit didn’t make it here to Tampa. That’s how hard it failed. Perhaps even wilder is just how quickly it all happened.

The BrightDrop Was The RV Industry’s Best Bet

Coachmen announced the RVEX on September 22, 2025. At the time, I wrote a piece titled “A Big RV Company Just Announced An Awesome All-Electric Camper Van That’s Almost Affordable” accompanied by the topshot above. The RVEX was a huge deal. Before September, the only company that was slinging BrightDrop-based vans was startup Grounded RVs, which also built BrightDrop-based camper vans for RV rental company RollAway. Coachmen is not a startup company, but one of the household names of RV mega-conglomerate Forest River. The RVEX signaled the big RV industry’s official entry into the all-electric motorhome space.

The motorhome was a pretty nice unit, too, with a fully featured interior that looked well-appointed and well-made for something from a big RV brand. It also had a few trick features, like a glass rear door that turned into a projector screen for campsite movies. Coachmen did an admirable job at hiding the RVEX’s work van origins!

Coachmen also planned to sell it for $150,000, which would have made it cheaper than a Grounded and lower priced than much of the gas-powered competition, which was amazing.

Why the BrightDrop mattered has to do with how the RV industry works. The RV manufacturers are usually secondary builders. They construct bodies on top of someone else’s chassis or van. Unfortunately, this means that the RV industry has been slow to electrify. If their chassis suppliers don’t have a compatible electrified platform, then the industry is stuck with what it has.

For years, this has meant that whenever someone wanted an all-electric camper van, they had to build an RV out of something like a Ford E-Transit or a Mercedes-Benz eSprinter, or convert a gas van to electric. Unfortunately, as the big firms like Winnebago found out through market research and talking to their customers, American RV buyers aren’t really interested in a camper van that goes only a touch over 100 miles before needing a charge, and they weren’t jazzed about a 200-mile van, either.

This is where the Chevrolet BrightDrop Zevo 600 came in. The 24-foot-long van sported Chevy’s Max Range 172 kWh 20-module battery, which enabled 270 miles of range. It also had AWD, 300 horsepower, and 390 lb-ft of torque. I won’t say that the BrightDrop was perfect. At the end of the day, the RVs that were built on it were awkward because the BrightDrop was designed to be a delivery van. However, the BrightDrop was the platform that came the closest to offering RV buyers the traditional motorhome experience, only fully electric. I genuinely thought that the BrightDrop was one of the coolest electrified things for the RV industry in years, and was waiting to see how companies would really go crazy with it.

Dead In Less Than A Month

Then, a day short of a month after Coachmen made its announcement, General Motors pulled the plug. The BrightDrop was dead. Grounded RVs, the company that was the first to the market with a BrightDrop motorhome, responded quickly. Here’s what Sam Shapiro, founder of Grounded RVs, said:

“No one in the world tried as hard as we did to build on all-electric vans. But at the end of the day what differentiates Grounded is everything above the chassis: our design, materials, technology, and integrated fleet management software. We’ve built on fully-electric and hybrid platforms like Ford, GM, and Harbinger, and now, with Grounded Gas, which we’ve long considered, we’re looking to a truly platform-agnostic future. Our stock of available Brightdrops is strong at the moment, but expansion to gas vehicles will move the business forward and allow Grounded to continue to lead toward an electrified and hybrid future.”

The sad thing is that Grounded RVs was started as an all-electric RV company, but I get this decision. The company first started building motorhomes using the Ford E-Transit before moving to the BrightDrop. Now, only a few years later, the company has to change platforms again.

At first, the expectation was that these companies would continue to build BrightDrop motorhomes until the stock of already-built BrightDrops dries up. That’s what Grounded plans to do. As RV News reported in October, that was an option that was actively being considered by Coachmen. While GM might have killed the BrightDrop, Coachmen figured that there were enough of them just sitting around that the company could build all-electric motorhomes for a year or two.

Then, Coachmen sort of went quiet, and the fate of the RVEX was unknown. That was until last week, when, in the run-up to the Florida show, Coachmen finally made a decision about the RVEX. As RV News reports, Coachmen will not be building the RVEX for a year or two. Instead, the whole project is shelved for 2026 and possibly beyond. How sad is it? Read this from RV News:

[Coachmen General Manager Zach] Eppers said dealers placed orders, and Coachmen was set to begin production in 2026 before GM discontinued manufacturing. Eppers said he is hopeful a similar chassis will be available in the future.

“The people who committed to us, both dealers and consumers, are still excited about RVEX,” Eppers said, “and we are still very interested in continuing this project. We just have not been able to find a chassis that offers those important features at a similar price point. If we cannot bring the range, cargo capacity and price together in a vehicle, then there is not as much excitement for it.”

Eppers said Coachmen has not given up on the concept. Some RVEX technologies and concepts will find their way into a new RV that Eppers said will be introduced in the fall. Coachmen team members who had worked on RVEX will move on to that and other Forest River projects.

At this time, Coachmen does not believe that there is a viable replacement for the BrightDrop, an opinion apparently also shared by Grounded. It’s not that other electric vans don’t exist; it’s just that none have quite the same space and capability as the BrightDrop does. So, the party is over just as it began. Apparently, Coachmen never got the chance to even make more than just the single RVEX prototype, and it has no idea what to do with the prototype. Maybe it’ll be sold to the public as a one-off or kept around Indiana for R&D use.

Some Good News

The good news is that the dream of an electrified RV from a big name isn’t dead, thanks to Thor Industries. The Entegra Embark motorhome (above) is not purely electric, and instead is a range-extended EV. I also got to tour it and think it’s the most innovative motorhome the big industry has built in decades. Don’t worry, I’ll write that story soon.

Still, if you’re someone who prefers all-electric over even EREVs, this sucks. It feels like the RV industry had a leap forward, just to get the rug pulled from under it. It’s even more depressing that the plan seems to be to wait and see if someone can build something like the BrightDrop again. All of this means that while millions of electric cars are multiplying all over the world, the American RV industry will still be behind. Well, hopefully it will work out next time.

Trenton, NJ — Workers from across New Jersey gathered in Trenton today to announce the formation of Climate Jobs New Jersey, a coalition of unions united to power New Jersey’s clean energy economy with union jobs and tackle the energy affordability crisis with a plan that works for every working family.

At the press conference, speakers unveiled the coalition’s priorities heading into the 2026 state legislative session. These include:

Launch a statewide solar and storage program to quickly deploy vast amounts of rooftop solar and battery storage so New Jersey can meet rising energy demand with in-state resources and do so in a way that creates new union jobs.

Take back control of our energy system by putting the state in charge of planning and purchasing energy, allowing New Jersey to actually plan for our energy needs by spurring in-state clean energy generation, and guaranteeing that workers benefit from every new project.

At the press conference, Cornell University’s Climate Jobs Institute unveiled a new report that offers a long-term roadmap and science-backed recommendations developed with input from New Jersey unions aimed at building a clean energy economy, creating good union jobs, advancing affordability and equity, and tackling the climate crisis.

“New Jersey has a long history of building and innovating, but when it comes to building our own energy, we have lost our way. We import far too much of our energy from out of state, which exacerbates high prices and sends jobs in the energy industry away. With this new agenda from Climate Jobs New Jersey, we can take control of our energy future and get back to building our own energy. This will create local union jobs, bring economic growth to our communities, and give us the clean energy we need to meet rising energy demands and confront the climate crisis,” said Charles Wowkanech, President of New Jersey AFL-CIO and President of Climate Jobs New Jersey.

“As demand for energy continues to grow, New Jersey faces some critical supply and demand challenges that won’t improve by ignoring them,” said LIUNA Vice President and Regional Manager and Climate Jobs New Jersey Secretary Michael Hellstrom. “Without smart and decisive action, our energy problems will only get worse. Climate Jobs New Jersey is an organization comprised of union trades workers who understand energy markets and infrastructure because they are the skilled, safe, and productive workforce who actually builds that energy infrastructure. We are interested in pursuing smart, practical, and science-backed solutions that benefit our residents and businesses by generating more clean, reliable, and affordable energy--in New Jersey and for New Jersey--while also creating good, family sustaining, middle class jobs.”

“When union labor leads, everyone succeeds. If New Jersey is serious about lowering energy bills and meeting skyrocketing demand, we must start building energy here, and we must start now,” said Greg Lalavee, Business Manager of Operating Engineers Local 825. “Through Climate Jobs New Jersey, we are laying out a simple plan: build energy here, store it here, and put New Jersey back in charge of its own energy future.”

“Thousands of IUPAT District Council 21 members are ready to get to work and build the facilities that create home-grown energy for families across the state,” said IUPAT District Council 21 Business Manager/Secretary-Treasurer Bernie Snyder. “Our members have the training and skills to build this necessary infrastructure safely and efficiently.""

“Members of the IUPAT have been on the forefront of green energy work all over the country, and are ready to get to work in New Jersey. Homegrown energy will be a boon to working families in the state, including our members,” said Paul Canning, General Vice President (Eastern Region) of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades.

“Our members are investing countless hours in clean energy training because we know this industry’s future is strong,” said Anthony Abrantes, Assistant Executive Secretary-Treasurer for the Eastern Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters. “Through state-of-the-art union training programs, we are building a clean energy economy that delivers more than temporary jobs—it creates lifelong, family-sustaining union careers. Now New Jersey must step up, invest in clean energy built here at home, and put union workers to work building our shared future.”

“Electricity bills are rising faster in New Jersey than just about anywhere else in the country. Much of our energy comes from out of state, which sends job opportunities away and leaves us tied to volatile prices. We need to take back our destiny and set New Jersey on a path to a secure and affordable clean energy future–and do it in a way that’s good for every working family,” said Shaun Sullivan, President of the New Jersey Pipe Trades and Business Manager of UA Local 475. “The men and women of the New Jersey Pipe Trades are fully trained and eager for opportunities to help produce clean energy for the state, and are proud to be part of this new coalition.”

“New Jersey's union workers have been building and maintaining energy infrastructure for generations. We are the best-equipped workforce to get clean energy built right, so that it benefits the economies and health of all New Jersey communities,” said Joe Checkley, President & Business Manager of IBEW Local 94. “Climate Jobs New Jersey is bringing together working people who know how to get the job done. Together, we can build a reliable clean energy industry that brings down costs for consumers and generates good union jobs.”

“With labor at the helm, we can build the clean energy and infrastructure the climate crisis demands while lowering energy costs and creating high-quality, family-sustaining careers. A cleaner, more resilient future will generate thousands of good jobs—and we must ensure they come with strong wages and benefits for New Jerseyans. This is what real climate action looks like for working people,” said Ana Maria Hill, Vice President and New Jersey State Director of 32BJ SEIU. “32BJ members see the climate crisis firsthand, which is why we’re helping building service workers cut energy use and create cleaner, healthier buildings.”

“The Climate Jobs Institute at Cornell University's ILR School was proud to work with and learn from New Jersey’s labor unions. Together, we have developed a bold, multi-sectoral, and science-backed plan to tackle the dual crises of climate change and inequality while creating high-quality union jobs and driving affordability for New Jersey residents in the face of historic energy price increases,” said Lara Skinner, Founding Executive Director of Cornell University’s Climate Jobs Institute. “Building a reliable, affordable, and abundant clean energy future for New Jersey will require massive investments in clean energy and infrastructure upgrades across the state. All of these investments have the potential to generate significant numbers of high-quality, family-sustaining, local union careers.”

In the U.S., electricity production is growing far faster than in most western peers, which is allowing utilities to deliver more power to the fast-growing and energy-intensive data centers and AI applications that are key drivers of the U.S. economy.

Overseas, the U.S. is set to cement its position as the largest and most influential exporter of crude oil and natural gas, which continue to underpin a vast majority of global energy systems and generate massive earnings for the U.S. Treasury.

The robust state of the U.S. energy sector makes good on U.S. President Donald Trump's ""energy dominance"" push, which looks set to gather even more momentum this year as further supportive energy policy measures are rolled out.

Below are the main metrics on electricity generation and fossil fuel production and exports to help track the state of the U.S. energy sector through 2026 and beyond.

Electric growth. Total U.S. electricity generation by utilities climbed by 3% in 2025 from the year before, which marks the second straight year that wholesale electricity output posted a 3% or better rise, data from Ember showed.

(click image to enlarge)

That electricity supply growth rate compares to an annual average of 0.3% during the previous five years, and so clearly reveals that utilities have stepped up generation efforts.

The lift in total utility generation resulted from a 5% annual increase in electricity output from clean power supplies, and a 1% rise in output from fossil fuel power plants.

The United States' 3% expansion rate in total utility supplies compares with just a 0.2% rise last year in total utility electricity generation in Europe, which remains gripped by an economic slowdown due in part to stubbornly high energy costs.

The U.S. growth rate matches the global average in 2025, but lags the 5% rise in utility electricity output posted by China.

In 2026, U.S. utilities are expected to lift electricity generation to new heights, thanks mainly to scheduled additions to solar and battery networks as well as the planned restart of the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan.

(click image to enlarge)

However, scrapped federal support for renewable energy projects will slow the pace of new solar and wind capacity additions and may drag on the electricity output growth rate over the medium term.

Oil, gas and coal. While clean power sources gained a record share of the U.S. electricity mix in 2025, fossil fuels remain the primary pillar of the U.S. energy system and account for around 83% of total U.S. energy supplies, according to the Energy Institute.

Record production of both crude oil and natural gas in 2025 has helped fossil fuels maintain that heavy share of the energy supply mix.

(click image to enlarge)

U.S. crude oil output averaged 13.6 MMbpd in 2025, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), while dry natural gas production averaged 107.4 Bft3d.

The output of coal also increased in 2025 - by around 5% from the year before - but total U.S. coal production remains well below the levels of a decade ago due to reduced use in the domestic power generation system.

Natural gas remains the primary power fuel in the U.S., and accounts for around 40% of electricity production and is also a major power and heating source for industry.

Rising natural gas prices - driven by rising power use as well as record demand from LNG exporters - are expected to lift extraction rates from gas wells in 2026, especially in low-cost basins in close proximity to liquefied natural gas export hubs.

Fossil exports. LNG was the star of the U.S. energy export arena in 2025, with a record 252 MMm3 shipped out, according to commodities intelligence firm Kpler.

Total LNG exports in 2025 jumped by 25% from the year before, and are poised for additional growth in 2026 as new liquefaction capacity comes online along the Texas and Louisiana coasts.

(click image to enlarge)

The EIA has estimated that total U.S. LNG exports could climb by 9% in 2026 to 1.3 Bft3d and will then rise to 1.7 Bft3d in 2027. The trajectory of U.S. crude oil exports in 2026 is less clear.

On the one hand, robust output combined with fairly flat domestic crude consumption suggests exporters will have ample supplies.

However, whether exporters will be able to ship out more than the 1.38 Bbbl they exported in 2025, according to Kpler, remains to be seen, as they will have to contend with higher supplies out of Venezuela following the U.S. ouster of Venezuelan President Maduro earlier this month.

U.S. exports of coal are also under pressure from declining global demand for the fuel and elevated competition from Indonesia, Australia, Colombia, Russia and South Africa, which all enjoy shorter trade routes to major importers.

That said, U.S. President Trump's strong support for the coal industry is expected to yield higher coal output and use by the power sector in 2026, so even if coal exports remain flat overall, coal output and use look primed for growth in 2026.

Alongside the expected continued growth in LNG exports, near-record output and exports of crude oil and record power sector output, the overall state of the U.S. energy sector looks set for another strong year in 2026.

The opinions expressed here are those of Gavin Maguire, a columnist for Reuters.

The shift has drawn support from business groups, including the US Chamber of Commerce, which has long criticized how the EPA weighs health benefits.","HealthDay News — The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may soon stop putting a dollar value on the health benefits of cleaner air.

The move, experts warn, could lead to weaker protections against some of the most dangerous pollutants.

Internal agency emails and documents reviewed by The New York Times show that, under President Donald Trump, the EPA plans to change how it evaluates the costs and benefits of clean-air rules.

For decades, the EPA has used health data such as premature deaths and asthma attacks avoided, to help justify limits on air pollution.

That could soon change.

Internal emails reveal that the EPA plans to stop assigning a dollar value to the health benefits of reducing 2 major pollutants: Fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, and ozone.

Instead, the agency would focus mainly on the cost to businesses of following these pollution rules.

Experts say the change could make it easier to repeal limits on pollution from coal plants, oil refineries, and other industrial sites, leading to dirtier air in many communities.

PM2.5 particles are so small they can enter the lungs and bloodstream. Long-term exposure has been linked to asthma, heart disease, lung disease, and early death.

Ozone, a key part of smog, forms when pollution from cars and factories reacts in sunlight. It can trigger breathing problems.

Under the Biden administration, the EPA tightened limits on PM2.5 that industries could emit. The agency estimated those rules could prevent up to 4500 premature deaths and 290,000 lost workdays in 2032 alone.

The EPA also estimated that for every $1 spent on reducing PM2.5, there could be as much as $77 in health benefits.

The Trump administration argues that those health estimates are too “uncertain.” Under the new approach, the EPA would still mention health effects but would no longer include them in cost-benefit calculations.

“EPA, like the agency always has, is still considering the impacts that PM2.5 and ozone emissions have on human health,” EPA spokeswoman Carolyn Holran told The Times in an email. “Not monetizing does not equal not considering or not valuing the human health impact.”

Others strongly disagree.

“The idea that EPA would not consider the public health benefits of its regulations is anathema to the very mission of EPA,” Richard Revesz, faculty director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University School of Law, told The Times.

“If you’re only considering the costs to industry and you’re ignoring the benefits, then you can’t justify any regulations that protect public health, which is the very reason that EPA was set up,” he added.

Internal emails show EPA leaders plan to include language in future clean-air rules stating that “historically, the EPA’s analytical practices often provided the public with false precision and confidence regarding the monetized impacts of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone.”

It goes on to say that “to rectify this error, the EPA is no longer monetizing benefits from PM2.5 and ozone.”

That language has already appeared in a regulatory impact analysis posted online earlier this week.

The shift has drawn support from business groups, including the US Chamber of Commerce, which has long criticized how the EPA weighs health benefits.

But legal experts warn the change could cause challenges in court and make pollution rollbacks harder to defend.

So if there’s lack of land manager presence and action on Idaho’s public lands, [Idaho’s delegation] need only to look in the mirror for much of the reason.” —Craig Gehrke, Idaho Capital Sun Picture This","The Trump administration is proposing to strip states and Tribes of their ability to block oil and gas pipelines and other infrastructure. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a proposed rule that would narrow the scope of the section of the Clean Water Act that allows states and Tribes to review federal permits for projects that have the potential to pollute waterways and to either approve, place conditions on, or reject those permits.

Currently, states and Tribes may consider both direct water quality impacts of the project’s proposed discharges and broader impacts of the project overall. States have used this authority to block projects that would have also increased air pollution or caused other environmental harms. For example, in 2017 the state of Washington used this authority to reject water quality permits for a coal export terminal which would have caused pollution of both water and air. The EPA’s proposal would restrict states and Tribes to evaluating only the impacts of a project’s proposed direct discharges into waters covered by the Clean Water Act. In addition to narrowing the scope of state and Tribal reviews, the proposal also reduces the number of waterways eligible for this review since the number of waters protected by the Clean Water Act was reduced significantly by a 2023 Supreme Court decision and follow-up efforts by the EPA.

“The list of environmental protections getting axed seems to grow longer every day,” Hawk Hammer, national communications and media director for American Rivers, told the New York Times. “The bigger picture here is that polluters are getting free run of our nation’s waterways and the last time that happened, rivers caught on fire.”

Quote of the day

[Idaho’s congressional delegation] sat stone faced, quiet and missing in action last year as the Trump administration slashed thousands of jobs and millions of budget dollars from the land management agencies—budgets already approved by Congress. So if there’s lack of land manager presence and action on Idaho’s public lands, [Idaho’s delegation] need only to look in the mirror for much of the reason.”

“With these permit renewals, once again, corporate interests are being placed above the health of Northwest Indiana communities,” said Lisa Vallee, organizing director for Just Transition Northwest Indiana.
The petition asks the EPA to reject the Midwest Plant permit renewal.
“This is a standard permit renewal which occurs every five years.
The organization gave Lake County failing grades in three categories: ozone pollution, 24-hour particle pollution and annual particle pollution.","Multiple Northwest Indiana environmental groups have filed petitions against air permit renewals for a region steel plant and oil refinery, saying they’re inadequate.

According to the Environmental Law and Policy Center, a Jan. 2 petition was filed for a permit renewal at BP’s Whiting refinery, and another petition was filed on Dec. 23, 2025, for a renewal at U.S. Steel’s Midwest Plant in Portage. The petitions, which were sent to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, claim that the permits don’t include basic provisions of the Clean Air Act, “including clear and enforceable monitoring, testing and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable requirements.”

The Indiana Department of Environmental Management issued the permits. IDEM did not respond to a request for comment.

“IDEM needs to do better and ensure that BP Whiting and U.S. Steel Midwest Plant are operating in a way that is not only economically lucrative but also protective of human health,” Kerri Gefeke, associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said in a news release. “IDEM can do that by simply ensuring that the permits it issues follow the law and include the necessary monitoring provisions to ensure that these plants — and similar facilities — are not polluting more than what’s allowable in their permits.”

The Environmental Law and Policy Center, Northern Lake County Environmental Partnership, Gary Advocates for Responsible Development and Just Transition Northwest Indiana were part of both filed petitions. Save the Dunes joined the BP petition.

“With these permit renewals, once again, corporate interests are being placed above the health of Northwest Indiana communities,” said Lisa Vallee, organizing director for Just Transition Northwest Indiana. “We have been carrying the weight of these decisions for decades, and our health outcomes prove it. With air quality among the worst in the nation, those of us who live in the region face higher rates of cancer, cardiovascular disease and asthma.”

According to the petition, the community groups believe that the U.S. Steel permit renewal has multiple issues, including failing to include requirements that ensure compliance with emission limits and federal regulations. The petition asks the EPA to reject the Midwest Plant permit renewal.

As part of the rejection, the petition asks the EPA to require IDEM revise the permit renewal to meet compliance with emission limits and federal regulations.

“IDEM should never have issued these permit renewals, which lack the basic protections of the Clean Air Act,” Vallee said. “The U.S. EPA should do what is right and object. Our communities deserve to be safeguarded, and we will continue to advocate for a better future for all Hoosiers.”

A spokesperson for U.S. Steel responded to the petition in a statement.

“U.S. Steel is pleased with the renewal of our operating permit for Midwest,” the statement said. “This is a standard permit renewal which occurs every five years. There are no increases in emissions limits or new equipment in the permit. We are proud of the more than 4,000 men and women who put safety and environmental compliance first, and we value the Northwest Indiana community where we live and work.”

In the BP petition, the groups say the refinery’s permit fails to include a particulate matter emissions limit that is required by Indiana’s federally-approved State Implementation Plan. The petition asks the EPA to require IDEM to revise the permit.

A BP spokesperson also responded to the petition in a statement.

“BP is committed to safe and compliant operations at the Whiting Refinery,” the statement said. “We will continue working every day to keep this commitment and to ensure the refinery remains an important part of Northwest Indiana for years to come.”

Gefeke, in a news release, said numerous studies have shown the area has some of the highest rates of air pollution nationwide, including high asthma and cancer rates.

The American Lung Association, in April 2025, announced that Hoosiers are breathing some of the nation’s most polluted air, according to Post-Tribune archives. The organization gave Lake County failing grades in three categories: ozone pollution, 24-hour particle pollution and annual particle pollution. Porter County only received a passing grade for annual particle pollution.

Ozone and particle pollution can cause premature death and other health effects, including asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes, preterm birth and impaired cognitive function, according to the American Lung Association. Particle pollution can also cause lung cancer, according to the organization.

The American Lung Association found that, in 2020, Indiana had a lung cancer rate of 72.5 per 100,000 people, with Lake County as one of the state’s counties with the highest cancer mortality rates. A 2016 report from the JAMA Network also found Gary as one of the five U.S. cities with the lowest life expectancy at one point.

“U.S. EPA should object to these permits because they’re inconsistent with the Clean Air Act and the region’s Hoosiers should not feel like they are living in a sacrifice zone,” Gefeke said.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/04/13/AAVFV24BUJEXBF4RX6IWJ6AUME.jpg?w=1024&h=670,N,,2026-01-15 12:01:11.652689

There are many factors that combine to affect clean energy manufacturers, at the regional, state, and federal levels, said He. They include government subsidies and tax incentives, policy tools that can have a significant impacts, especially in the early stages of project development, He said. Market forces like inflation can also pose challenges through higher capital costs, He added.

“We want to understand what works, what doesn’t, how, and under what conditions,” the professor said. “First, we’ll build a comprehensive data set that incorporates policies and outcomes, and then we’ll analyze causal relationships — in other words, what factors are driving what outcomes.”

The three-year study will weigh empirical research, geopolitical concerns, such as the effects of tariffs on trade partners, and historical data that demonstrate outcomes of government policies over time. Student assistants and early-career postdoctoral researchers are being recruited for the study, He says, and several papers are expected to share findings from the project.

The researchers will use GCAM — short for the Global Change Analysis Model, a computer model that links climate to energy systems, land use, and the economy — alongside other models to project the impacts of various trade policies.

He points to the recent rollback of the Inflation Reduction Act, which invested heavily in clean energy manufacturing, the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, and a focus on fossil fuels as examples of new federal policies that diverge from decarbonization. “In an ideal world, federal policies accelerate the market transition to clean energy, not slow it down. But I think the market will find its way when the prices are right,” He said.

In the meantime, climate change barrels forward.

“We need to accelerate the deployment of clean energy to achieve our climate goals,” He said.

“At the same time, we’re facing challenges related to geopolitics and economic slowdown. We need evidence to help stakeholders find a way to balance these complicated and sometimes competing issues. My hope is that this research can provide more evidence needed to inform policy debates and discussions around clean energy manufacturing.”

Prior to this, in February, the company announced commercial operations for the 100MW/200MWh Great Kiskadee Storage project in Hidalgo County, Texas.

With an initial anticipated commercial operation date (COD) in Q3 2024, the project received US$150 million in financing from First Citizens Bank, which also supported the 100MW/200MWh Angelo Storage project.

Apex, based in Virginia and established in 2009, started by acquiring wind projects and expanded its operations to include the development, construction, and management of solar, storage, distributed energy resources, and utility-scale wind projects. Currently, the company reports managing more than 2GW of clean energy.

When the SA Grid Solutions JV was formed, law firm McDermott, Will & Schute observed that the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA’s) tax incentives drew interest from SK Gas and SK Eternix. They aimed to enter the US market by partnering with Apex through the JV. Battery manufacturer SK On, part of the same group, is building lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cell production lines in the US.

Apex acknowledged the advantages of forming a JV with SK Gas and SK Eternix, which would inject substantial additional capital and enable Apex to expand its investments in clean energy projects.

To facilitate this, a team from McDermott, Will & Schute managed antitrust reviews, trade considerations for supply chain components, and other cross-border deal complexities.

McDermott’s IRA team collaborated with Apex’s commercial, legal, and tax teams to craft the JV.

Forward-Looking Statements This communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.
All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this communication, or incorporated by reference into this communication, are forward-looking statements.","HOUSTON, Jan. 15, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Talen Energy Corporation (“Talen,” “we,” or “our”) (NASDAQ: TLN), a leading independent power producer, announced it has signed definitive agreements to add approximately 2.6 gigawatts of natural gas generation capacity to Talen’s portfolio through the acquisition of the Waterford Energy Center (“Waterford”) and Darby Generating Station (“Darby”) in Ohio and the Lawrenceburg Power Plant (“Lawrenceburg”) in Indiana from Energy Capital Partners (“ECP”). The acquisition will substantially expand Talen’s presence in the western PJM market and add additional efficient baseload generation assets to its fleet.

The acquisition price is $3.45 billion and consists of approximately $2.55 billion in cash and approximately $900 million1 in Talen stock. The price reflects an attractive multiple of approximately 6.6x 2027E adjusted EBITDA. The transaction is expected to provide immediate and significant adjusted free cash flow per share accretion in excess of 15% annually through 2030E. Additionally, these assets are expected to achieve an approximately 85% unlevered free cash flow conversion rate before recognition of any tax benefits.

“This acquisition further diversifies Talen’s generation portfolio by adding both baseload capacity and strong cash flow contribution and enhances our presence in the western PJM market, which has significant data center tailwinds,” said Mac McFarland, Talen Chief Executive Officer. “The transaction is immediately cash flow accretive and maintains our balance sheet discipline. Following on the heels of our acquisition of Freedom and Guernsey in 2025, it is another great example of our ‘Talen flywheel’ strategy.”

“ECP invested in this portfolio to serve rapid load growth in the Ohio region with efficient, baseload natural gas assets; we continue to believe this is PJM's most exciting narrative,” said Andrew Gilbert, ECP Partner. “Talen has demonstrated that its platform of scale is uniquely positioned to serve PJM’s large customers and, with this transaction, will only be better positioned to do so. As a significant shareholder, ECP is excited to enhance our exposure to Ohio's growth via Talen’s successful flywheel strategy.”

“When this transaction is complete, Talen will have approximately doubled its expected annual generation output inside of two years, meaningfully diversified our fleet, and materially increased our free cash flow per share,” said Terry Nutt, Talen President. “We are also excited to welcome ECP as a significant Talen shareholder.”

Key Strategic and Acquisition Highlights

Expands and Diversifies Talen’s Fleet: The 1,218-megawatt Lawrenceburg and 869-megawatt Waterford facilities are highly efficient and modern CCGTs that add both baseload generation and cash flow diversification. The plants have an average heat rate of approximately 7,000 Btu/kWh and capacity factors greater than 80%. Their highly efficient dispatch profile results in significant energy margin, while the low cost and capital requirements provide strong cash flow conversion. The 480-megawatt Darby facility operates as a peaking unit and can provide attractive commercial flexibility. All three facilities have reliable access to low-cost gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations and continue the geographic and fuel diversification reflected by the previous Freedom and Guernsey acquisitions.

Enhances Platform for Data Center and Large-load Contracting: The addition of the facilities to Talen’s portfolio enhances Talen’s ability to offer reliable, scalable, grid-supported, and regionally diverse low-carbon capacity to hyperscale data centers and large commercial off-takers. The expansion of operations in Ohio allows Talen to serve a growing, top-tier data center market.

Unlocks Material Value Day One: The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to adjusted free cash flow per share by over 15% annually through 2030E.

Maintains Balance Sheet Strength: Talen expects robust pro forma cash flows to drive rapid deleveraging with the ability to achieve a net leverage target of 3.5x or lower by year-end 2026.

Stock Consideration: ECP has agreed to receive approximately $900 million of consideration in the form of Talen equity and will become a significant shareholder post close.

Additional Transaction Details

Talen expects to issue new debt to fund the cash portion of the purchase price.

The transaction is expected to close early in the second half of 2026 and is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976, and regulatory approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and other regulatory agencies.

OCIO partnerships can provide structured decisionmaking, documentation and oversight that strengthen board confidence and fiduciary responsibility.
For mission-driven organizations, the OCIO model offers stability, scalability and professional execution.
Despite advances in technology and governance, successful OCIO partnerships still rely on trusted collaboration, shared purpose, disciplined execution and human insight.
In an environment defined by complexity and accountability, that combination has become the hallmark of modern institutional investment management.","As investment oversight grows more complex, institutions are increasingly turning to the outsourced chief investment officer model to help strengthen governance, execution and efficiency across their portfolios. Once reserved for large endowments and foundations, OCIO services are becoming increasingly popular across the broader nonprofit and institutional landscape, offering the sophistication of an in-house investment office without expanding internal resources.

Nonprofit organizations are adopting the OCIO model at an accelerating pace, driven by funding volatility, lean staffing and rising fiduciary expectations. For many, discretionary management has become a practical necessity for achieving financial stability and advancing mission goals. OCIO partnerships can provide structured decisionmaking, documentation and oversight that strengthen board confidence and fiduciary responsibility. For mission-driven organizations, the OCIO model offers stability, scalability and professional execution.

The model’s success depends not only on delegation, but on how the relationship is structured and sustained. The most effective partnerships are built on trust, transparency and alignment of purpose, combining institutional rigor with adaptability.

Building Effective Partnerships

Transitioning from an advisory relationship to a discretionary investment partnership represents a significant organizational shift that requires clarity, communication and role definition.

Establishing clear governance boundaries at the outset is critical. Each party must understand where the OCIO holds discretion and where the committee or staff retains oversight. Establishing and documenting these parameters early in the OCIO engagement prevents confusion and keeps decisions aligned with policy and mission objectives.

A structured communication cadence reinforces transparency and alignment. Strong OCIO relationships feature timely updates, standardized agendas and pre-meeting briefings. Real-time communication related to key actions helps maintain confidence and continuity. This approach allows both sides to recalibrate expectations and build mutual trust. A formal feedback process, initiated by senior OCIO leadership, can also help ensure ongoing alignment and service refinement.

The OCIO should function not as an external vendor, but as an integrated extension of board, investment committee and staff, in alignment with the organization’s mission, culture and long-term goals.

Strengthening Governance and Strategic Alignment

Investment committees may struggle to balance short-term pressures with long-term strategies. A well-structured OCIO partnership can provide the discipline needed to bridge that gap.

Strong governance begins with clear process and accountability. A deliberate governance structure covering key aspects of fiduciary oversight and responsibility enables committees to operate strategically rather than reactively. Delegating implementation to the OCIO allows an organization’s leadership to refocus on priorities that directly support the mission.

Continuity is equally important. Committee membership changes frequently, and without documentation, institutional memory can erode. The OCIO can maintain that continuity through consistent reporting and context-rich communication, preserving alignment even as personnel evolve.

A well-governed OCIO partnership can enhance decision quality and oversight, creating a structure that supports fiduciary accountability and long-term impact.

Liquidity and Administrative Relief

For nonprofit organizations, another driver leading to increased adoption of an outsourced model is liquidity management. With inconsistent public funding and fluctuating donations, nonprofits must balance short-term obligations with long-term return objectives. OCIOs can design portfolios that integrate spending policies, cash-flow forecasting and reserve strategies, helping to ensure flexibility and discipline coexist.

Administrative efficiency is another catalyst. Many nonprofit finance offices lack capacity for trading, reconciliation or detailed performance monitoring. An OCIO can help alleviate these burdens by managing operations, including trade orders and subscription documents. An OCIO also can provide audit support and lead interactions with the custodian, all with the client’s interest in mind.

Enhancing Efficiency, Preserving Judgment

Advancements in data analytics, automation and artificial intelligence are transforming OCIO operations. Leading firms leverage these tools to streamline workflows, improve transparency and enhance responsiveness while maintaining human oversight at the core.

AI and automation can consolidate data, generate reporting and identify portfolio anomalies. Using such tools to create these efficiencies can reduce manual workload and improve accuracy, allowing investment teams to devote more time to analysis and client engagement.

However, technology must support, not replace, human judgment. Investment management remains inherently relational, requiring experience and contextual understanding. The most effective OCIOs integrate technology to inform decisions, not to make them, preserving the human insight that defines sound fiduciary management. The result is an evolved model, in which technology amplifies the adviser’s ability to deliver clarity, not automation.

Sustaining Long-Term Partnerships

A successful OCIO relationship is not transactional; it is a strategic alliance that grows over time. As the OCIO develops a nuanced understanding of the organization’s objectives, risk parameters and culture, its ability to provide proactive, customized solutions expands significantly.

Long-term success requires mutual accountability. Regular reviews, qualitative assessments and open dialogue create a feedback loop that promotes continuous improvement. Both sides share responsibility for refining objectives, evaluating results and adapting to changing circumstances.

Durable partnerships are built on trust, earned through consistent delivery, responsiveness and transparent communication. When the OCIO becomes embedded as an extension of the internal team, the relationship evolves from outsourcing to strategic integration, enabling the organization to pursue its mission with confidence.

The New Standard in Institutional Investment

The OCIO model has evolved from a niche offering to an institutional standard, reflecting a broader shift in how organizations approach investment management. Integration, accountability and agility now define the modern governance landscape.

For nonprofits and mission-driven institutions, OCIO partnerships deliver measurable advantages: streamlined operations, enhanced liquidity management, improved oversight and greater alignment between financial resources and mission outcomes.

Despite advances in technology and governance, successful OCIO partnerships still rely on trusted collaboration, shared purpose, disciplined execution and human insight. In an environment defined by complexity and accountability, that combination has become the hallmark of modern institutional investment management.

Trump administration to finalize 2026 biofuel quotas by early March.

EPA may adjust bio-based diesel targets slightly lower.

Moves reflect compromise between biofuel producers and oil refiners.

Jan 15 (Reuters) - The administration of President Donald Trump plans to finalize 2026 biofuel blending quotas by early March, keeping them close to its initial proposal while dropping a plan to penalize imports of renewable fuels and feedstocks, according to two sources familiar with the plans.

If finalized, the plan would mark a partial compromise between rival oil and farm industry groups by preserving increased blending targets sought by biofuel producers while dropping a proposal that U.S. refiners had warned would disrupt fuel markets and raise costs.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which oversees U.S. biofuel policy, has told industry stakeholders it aims to send the final proposal to the White House budget office for review later this month, with finalization expected roughly 30 days later after the White House conducts industry interviews.

The EPA in June proposed total biofuel blending volumes at 24.02 billion gallons in 2026 and 24.46 billion gallons in 2027, up from 22.33 billion gallons in 2025. The total included a target of 5.61 billion gallons for bio-based diesel, a significant jump from the 3.35 billion gallons in 2025.

The EPA is now considering a range of 5.2 to 5.6 billion gallons for bio-based diesel in 2026, the sources told Reuters.

The potential downward adjustment is partially related to the EPA's plan to ditch a proposal that would slash the value of renewable fuel credits given by the U.S. government for imported biofuels, an ""America First"" policy hailed as a victory by the soybean and biodiesel industries.

Big Oil, led by the influential American Petroleum Institute industry group, had argued that limiting credits for foreign supply could constrain availability and push fuel prices higher - an outcome the White House is eager to avoid as affordability remains a central political concern heading into mid-term elections this year.

Reuters previously reported that the EPA was considering delaying the proposal for at least a year.

The EPA told Reuters the agency is still reviewing comments on the proposed rule. ""As publicly stated in court filings, the agency aims to finalize 'in the first quarter of 2026,"" the agency said.

The EPA is also expected to decide whether to require larger refiners to make up for gallons exempted under the agency's small refinery waiver program, a determination that could significantly affect overall biofuel blending quotas.

The EPA in August cleared a backlog of more than 170 small refinery exemption requests dating back to 2016. They have issued additional exemptions since then.

The biofuel industry and its legislative allies have been urging the administration to require refiners to offset 100% of those exempted gallons, while the oil industry is resisting the obligations. The EPA has sought comment on various proposals, ranging from zero reallocation to 100%.

Reuters previously reported that the EPA is considering a plan for refiners to offset 50% of the those exempted gallons.

The trial demonstrated the effectiveness of managed charging in shifting EV load out of high-cost periods and reducing peak demand.","Active management can reduce on-peak EV charging by 59–93% compared to unmanaged charging, significantly mitigating grid congestion and improving load diversity.

That is the finding of a study conducted by global consultancy Brattle on behalf of EnergyHub, the result of a trial conducted in Washington State using EnergyHub’s EV managed charging solution.

The report, titled ‘Demonstrating the Full Value of Managed Electric Vehicle Charging’, sets out how managed charging strategies can provide value for EV drivers and avoid distribution system upgrades.

Increased electrification in the move away from fossil fuels is putting an increasing strain on electricity grids globally, as the infrastructure struggles with the additional load. While infrastructure upgrades will be an inevitable (and expensive) part of the energy transition, there are solutions to get around the constraint.

By increasing hosting capacity and deferring capital expenditures, active managed charging offers a scalable solution to accommodate growing EV adoption without overburdening existing infrastructure.

The study highlights that both active and passive managed charging strategies can reduce system costs, defer infrastructure upgrades, and improve customer satisfaction.

Active vs. passive managed charging: Key differences

The trial evaluated two distinct approaches to managed charging:

Observed performance: Shifting load and reducing peaks

According to the report, while effective in shifting load, passive strategies lack the precision of active management in optimising grid performance.

Active managed charging increases the hosting capacity of distribution grid assets by 1.3x to 3.2x, enabling utilities to defer upgrades by up to 10 years. This reduces distribution grid costs by about US$200 per EV annually, with potential savings reaching US$400 per EV per year.

The trial demonstrated the effectiveness of managed charging in shifting EV load out of high-cost periods and reducing peak demand.

‘Active management smooths EV load at the service transformer and feeder levels, reducing distribution grid congestion,’ the report notes.

Enhancing customer experience

Consumer engagement is a key element in managed charging, and a metric that is arguably hard to predict on a wide scale. However, the Brattle trial recorded an opt-out rate of just 3%. The report puts this down to EnergyHub’s solution, which prioritises customer convenience, balancing optimisation with driver satisfaction.

The report states that ‘100% of EVs that plugged in with sufficient time to charge reached their desired target state of charge by the end of the optimisation window’.

A similar trial that is ongoing in the UK, run by home charging solutions provider Ohme, also noted ‘very low’ dropout rates.

Business implications: Cost savings and infrastructure deferral

By deferring the need for infrastructure upgrades, the report found that active managed charging offers cost savings for utilities, relative to unmanaged charging or passing time-of-use strategies.

As EV adoption accelerates, utilities face mounting pressure to adapt their infrastructure to meet rising demand. Managed charging strategies provide a cost-effective pathway to address these challenges.

The report suggests that leveraging active management solutions will be key to balancing grid performance, cost efficiency, and customer experience; flexibility more generally, through demand and energy storage, is well-known to be a key part of the energy transition. With the potential to defer infrastructure upgrades by up to a decade and deliver significant cost savings, managed charging represents a critical opportunity for industry leaders to future-proof their operations in the face of rapid electrification.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt452efb5f3e725f7e/blt23f6236f1d608792/6968d4c98a6c8443b1f2596b/chuttersnap-xfaYAsMV1p8-unsplash.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-15 11:01:03.950673

She says she plans to introduce another bill that would create a two-year moratorium on data center development.
This comes after township supervisors declined to vote on a proposed ordinance that would create more restrictions over the planned data center.
He compared the spread of data centers to the rise of the oil and gas industry in the past decades.","HARRISBURG — Steve Hacker’s well ran dry in October 2024 for the first time since he moved to Chester County in 1983.

Hacker, now retired and working part-time at the local Colonial Theatre, says he went 39 days without running water in his house. He showered at his workplace or the local YMCA during that time. The well ran dry due to a drought, Hacker said, but he’s worried that it’s a sign of things to come.

Hacker’s township of East Vincent is considering plans to build a data center campus, which would house computer servers and equipment. These facilities require huge amounts of energy and millions of gallons of clean water annually to cool their servers.

“They want to pull millions of gallons [of water] out — I don’t see how that can work,” Hacker told Spotlight PA. “Who is responsible if all the wells in my town dry out? Who’s going to compensate us?”

Pennsylvania residents across the state, from Allegheny to Lackawanna Counties, have expressed concerns about planned data centers and their impacts on energy prices, water usage, and pollution. In a recent poll, 42% of Pennsylvanians said they do not want one built in or near their community. Yet many state and local lawmakers — even skeptics — have accepted the proliferation of data centers in Pennsylvania as a fact of life.

“I've had people tell me, ‘Well, just let's bar them. We'll prohibit them,’” state Sen. Gene Yaw (R., Lycoming) told Spotlight PA. “Then let's go to the library and burn all the books too while we're at it.”

Companies such as Amazon Web Services and Blackstone have announced tens of billions of dollars in private investments to build data centers across the state. Legislative supporters say the projects will create thousands of temporary construction jobs and hundreds of permanent ones, attract more workers to the state, and enable the U.S. to compete with China in technological development.

Even lawmakers who are concerned about the spread of data centers say that the number is likely to increase, and that the legislature should create regulatory bodies or economic incentives for developers to prioritize environmental safety.

Hacker wants to see elected officials push back against data centers but fears that most, from township supervisors to Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, are “gung-ho” on the prospect of private investment.

“They want to go full speed ahead. But I want them to slow down,” Hacker said. “That’s the number one thing I want from the state government: I want to slow down. I would want a moratorium on building these things.”

What’s on the table?

State lawmakers have offered a range of proposals regarding data centers, including making them easier to build and adding checks.

Some legislation focuses on speeding up the permitting process, which often requires government permission to excavate and dig under land, manage stormwater drainage, mitigate air pollution, and begin construction. Two such bills, both from Republicans, would tie speedier permitting to a commitment “to improved environmental outcomes.”

Other bills are aimed at ensuring that increased energy demand from data centers does not impact consumer energy costs and at creating a regulatory framework.

A bill from state Rep. Rob Matzie (D., Beaver) would allow the Public Utility Commission to regulate data centers, including implementing fees for building out transmission lines and deposits to begin construction.

Other proposals would amend an existing tax exemption to incentivize data centers to use clean energy when powering their campuses or mandate that developers request a meeting with local officials, including zoning and planning officials.

State Rep. Elizabeth Fiedler (D., Philadelphia) chairs her chamber’s Energy Committee, which would likely consider many of these proposals before they became law. Fiedler told Spotlight PA that Matzie’s oversight bill, and a proposal to mandate data centers report energy and water usage to the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, are among the measures she expects to review.

“Right now, there’s a real lack of regulation,” Fiedler told Spotlight PA. “So if we’re able to get any of these bills through … that would make a real difference.”

Pushback from lawmakers

Positions on data centers are not cleanly divided by party affiliation. Some of the most vocal legislative opponents represent districts where they will be located.

State Rep. Jamie Walsh (R., Luzerne) opposes a data center that is planned in his district, saying he’s seen “corporate bullying” on the part of developers.

“The Pennsylvania taxpayer, quite frankly, has had enough,” Walsh told Spotlight PA.

Walsh said that residents are concerned about water and electricity costs and closeness to residential housing. He said he’s not opposed to all data centers, but argued they need to respect the desires of the community.

“If a municipality feels that it can support a data center with water [usage], electricity isn’t going to shoot through the roof … and the community is OK with the zone it’s going in, then it should be left up to that community,” Walsh said.

Walsh intends to introduce legislation that would establish standards to ensure data center development in the state “occurs responsibly, transparently, and with real community involvement.” A memo seeking support for the proposal did not detail what those standards would look like, but Walsh told Spotlight PA there would be measures to protect consumers against AI deepfakes and prevent them from “footing the bill for these AI data centers.”

State Sen. Katie Muth (D., Montgomery) has also pushed back against data center development. Her district includes the planned data center that Hacker is concerned about.

Muth told Spotlight PA that the bills to regulate costs for ratepayers are the bare minimum.

Increased energy demand from data centers in other states connected to the same massive regional grid already affects costs in Pennsylvania, she said.

She has criticized the lack of attention being paid to emergency planning and the long-term health impacts on residents. If a battery fire or other emergency broke out on the planned campus in her district, for example, Muth wants developers to have a plan to stop it from spreading to a nearby nuclear power plant.

She says she plans to introduce another bill that would create a two-year moratorium on data center development. The hope, she says, is to give local officials enough time to properly investigate the plans for data centers.

“Who has control about the information of these projects is really key,” Muth said. “These decisions are being made in vacuums.”

Leadership on data centers

Party leaders largely support building more data centers, citing the potential to create jobs and bring private investment into the state.

State Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Indiana) said he wants to see the “responsible growth of data centers,” though he hasn’t been specific about what type of legislation he would support.

“To me, the biggest concern is data centers coming online without commensurate supply,” Pittman said at a news conference last November. “At the end of the day, these data centers are coming. It's the reality of technology. We've got to be prepared to match the supply [of energy.]”

Democrats who control the state House didn’t commit to backing specific data center legislation when asked by Spotlight PA. A spokesperson said lawmakers “must take a balanced, responsible approach to data centers” and the caucus is exploring legislative solutions that “provide reasonable oversight, protect energy and natural resources, and help keep utility costs affordable for consumers.”

Shapiro has thrown his support behind data centers, celebrating a planned $20 billion investment from Amazon Web Services for the buildout of two in eastern Pennsylvania last summer.

“I announced the largest private sector investment in the history of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania just a few months ago, right here in northeastern Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said last October. “A deal with AWS, Amazon, that's going to create 10,000 construction jobs, and it's also, at the same time going to create over 1,000 permanent jobs.”

Shapiro has also said he views AI development as inevitable. The question, he says, is whether the U.S. will be able to outpace China.

“I do not want China to beat America in this,” he said at a news conference last August. “There are just less than a handful of states in the entire country that are poised the way we are to be leaders on this data center development, leaders on AI development … and I believe Pennsylvania is poised to do that.”

When asked about resident concerns regarding data center deals, Shapiro said in October that “with any of these deals, you’ve got to work with the local community.”

In Chester County, the fight over data centers continues to play out.

Pennhurst Holdings LLC, the company that owns the land where the data center is slated to be built, is currently applying for conditional use permitting — wherein a local government can approve land use that is not explicitly permitted under its zoning code — from the township. This comes after township supervisors declined to vote on a proposed ordinance that would create more restrictions over the planned data center.

Matt McHugh, an attorney for the company, says that the hearings will address many of the public’s concerns over water and electricity usage, among other issues.

“Ultimately, the township can impose conditions on an approval if they so choose, to which we would be obligated to adhere to as part of moving forward with the development,” McHugh told Spotlight PA.

East Vincent Township’s supervisors have remained quiet on the issue. Messages from Spotlight PA to Township Manager Bob Zienkowski were not returned.

“We have to keep an open mind,” said Township Supervisor Craig A. Damon II. “The board cannot prejudice itself for or against a data center.”

And residents like Hacker have gotten involved, attending local zoning meetings and reaching out to local elected officials and state lawmakers.

But Hacker worries his efforts won’t make a difference. He compared the spread of data centers to the rise of the oil and gas industry in the past decades. The oil and gas wells drilled were later revealed to be correlated with negative health impacts, like increased risk of cancer.

“To let industry do whatever they want and deal with the consequences later, we should know better,” Hacker said. “I absolutely want our state legislators as a whole, right up to Shapiro, to listen to the people.”",https://www.spotlightpa.org/imgproxy/insecure/rt:fill/w:1200/h:900/g:sm/el:1/q:75/MjAyNi8wMS8wMW1wLWF6a2EteHAzNC1iMmUwLmpwZWc=.jpeg,N,,2026-01-15 14:00:33.840203

“The global car industry is a cornerstone of many national economies, directly employing more than 10 million people worldwide and supporting millions of additional jobs,” says Fatih Birol, the Executive Director of the IEA.
As such, the adoption of EVs will be one of the most crucial parts of the global energy transition.
“The global car industry is currently undergoing major changes that have significant implications for economies around the world and for the energy sector,” Fatih explains.","The IEA's new report, What Next for the Global Car Industry, is an eye opener.

The report evaluates the progress the transport sector is making when it comes to electrification, highlighting the encouraging signs and causes for concern alike.

It also calls attention to the ""profound changes"" that are taking place with regards to the geography of car sales and the adoption of EVs.

China powers ahead in the energy transition

The IEA reports that global sales of pure petrol and diesel vehicles have dropped by around 30% since their 2017 peak, thanks to policies, pressure and the cost of technology. Nowadays, the market is far more tilted towards clean energy than ever before.

In 2024, for instance, of the 80 million cars sold around the world, around 30% of them were electric or hybrid. This is expected to continue to rise in the near future, notwithstanding certain regional barriers.

Speaking of regions, the IEA's report regularly points to China as the current Mecca of EVs, with its dominance in EV manufacturing, infrastructure and resources making it the undisputed world leader in sustainable mobility.

The country now produces around 40% of the world’s cars, overtaking the EU as the top vehicle exporter in 2024. Its production rate has more than doubled its output since 2010. What's more, around 70% of all EVs sold globally originate from Chinese factories now.

China's pre-eminence in both EVs and renewable energy now make it a leading force in the field of global sustainability.

The electrification of the transport sector

In its report, the IEA notes that the restructuring of the automotive sector is as much a story about energy as it is about industry.

“The global car industry is a cornerstone of many national economies, directly employing more than 10 million people worldwide and supporting millions of additional jobs,” says Fatih Birol, the Executive Director of the IEA.

“The market for cars is one of the largest for a single product and cars are the single largest source of global oil demand today,"" he adds.

As such, the adoption of EVs will be one of the most crucial parts of the global energy transition. Electric vehicles consume electricity instead of liquid fuels and are far more energy-efficient, converting a greater share of power into motion.

The shift towards EVs also has major implications for steel, aluminium and battery supply chains, as well as for regional energy demand.

The sector already represents about 6% of global steel use and 17% of aluminium demand, with these figures expected to rise as lightweight materials become more important to energy efficiency.

Battery manufacturing, which is now the largest single driver of industrial energy use growth, is clustering near cheap and reliable electricity sources.

For instance, Shanghai alone is home to 26 battery plants, together representing more than 5% of global capacity.

The difference in capacity from region to region is beginning to sharpen too. While Europe and North America still dominate traditional engine manufacturing, Chinese firms now account for roughly 80% of capacity for battery-related production as EV components scale rapidly.

Costs, materials and the new economics of energy

The IEA’s data shows that EV production in China remains cheaper due to integrated energy supply chains and economies of scale.

Battery cell prices are more than 30% lower than in Europe and over 20% lower than in the US, amplifying cost advantages for energy-efficient manufacturing hubs.

“The global car industry is currently undergoing major changes that have significant implications for economies around the world and for the energy sector,” Fatih explains.

Tion Renewables GmbH (“Tion Renewables” or “Tion”) and clearvise AG (”clearvise”) today announced that the outsourcing agreement between the two companies has become fully effective as of the start of the new year 2026. The agreement was entered into between the companies on September 24, 2025 and supports clearvise’s strategic transformation into a dividend-focused and cost-efficient YieldCo. With the decision of the complete outsourcing, essential operational business activities and all employees had been transferred to Tion Renewables.

Tion Renewables, in parallel being clearvise’s largest minority shareholder, endorses this strategic shift, emphasizing dividends, cost control, and operational efficiency as essential for listed renewables platforms in the current stock market environment. By the end of 2025, clearvise managed an onshore wind and solar portfolio of ~489 MW, thereof 388 MW operational.

For Tion, with its renewables portfolio of some 430 MW in operation (end of 2025), integrating clearvise’s operational team and serving as long-term business services partner, makes sense before the background of Tion’s ambitious growth targets. The management of a combined renewable portfolio of almost 1 GW enables meaningful synergies in operations, faster digitalization and a more efficient deployment of a highly skilled expert team – benefitting both companies.

“This partnership is a win-win. As a shareholder we fully support clearvise’s YieldCo strategy,” said Ingmar Helmke, CEO of Tion Renewables. “At the same time, taking on the team and operational day-to-day responsibility as service provider fits perfectly with Tion’s ambition to scale into one of Europe’s leading independent green power and storage providers. Greater scale, shared expertise and accelerated digitalization will lift quality and efficiency across both portfolios.”

Petra-Leue Bahns, CEO of clearvise AG, commented, “Now clearvise’s strategic shift towards a dividend-focused YieldCo is completed. The outsourcing of our day-to-day operations under a long-term service agreement fully supports our YieldCo strategy by creating sustainable cost savings. Partnering with Tion enables seamless operations, as the whole clearvise team joined Tion and its unique knowledge and well-functioning processes remain available. In addition, the full outsourcing to Tion is allowing clearvise to benefit from greater scale, operational excellence and long-term efficiency improvements.”

This new chapter for Tion Renewables will also bring changes to the management:

Co-Founder Christoph Strasser will step away from his role as CIO of Tion Renewables and leave the company in the summer at his own request to take on new professional challenges. Co-Founder Dr. Martin Siddiqui has departed end of 2025.

Manuel Sieth (former clearvise CFO) became Tion’s CFO in October 2025 already and will assume the role of the CIO. Oliver Störkel (former Head of Asset Management at clearvise) will going forward lead Asset Management & Execution at Tion. Martin Lemmer, so far Investment Director DACH, will be promoted as Head of Investment Management.

With these developments, Tion Renewables enter the new year with greater scale, strengthened capabilities, and clear momentum for future growth.

So functionally, Illinois wetlands have been written out of the Clean Water Act.
So, the state would run their own wetlands protections program, but we don't have that currently.
We relied on the federal Clean Water Act.
Illinois lawmakers should take note that there's widespread and broad desire to protect Illinois wetlands.","More than 96% of Illinois wetlands are at risk of losing federal protections. The Environmental Protection Agency is in the process of redefining the Waters of the United States (WOTUS), and their proposed definition rolls back many safeguards that have been in place to protect waterways and wetlands across the country. Dozens of community organizations signed onto a formal objection to the Environmental Protection Agency, which was drafted by Prairie Rivers Network. WNIJ’s Jess Savage sat down with Director of Water Policy Robert Hirschfeld to learn more about why they wrote to the EPA about the ruling.

(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)

Robert Hirschfeld: We felt it was important that, for the historical record, groups from Illinois let EPA and the Trump administration know that we support strong Clean Water Act protections; strong protections for our water and our wetlands in Illinois.

I think the Trump administration has been very clear and consistent that they want to roll back water and air protections. They view those as impeding the industry's ability to pollute. And it is also important for the historical record, should lawsuits ever be filed over this redefinition.

Jess Savage: I'm curious; what would you say is important for Illinois residents to understand about the role wetlands play in their lives and at home?

RH: Wetlands are critical infrastructure. In Illinois, we already live with the loss of about 90% of our historic wetlands. Wetlands filter pollution. They keep runoff out of streams and rivers and lakes.

And wetlands are also extremely effective and valuable [for] flood reduction infrastructure. Some of the best research on wetlands shows that in Illinois alone, even just the wetlands that remain, they have a value somewhere around $750 million a year. $750 million annually in residential flood protection.

JS: What are the impacts you anticipate from this new WOTUS ruling?

RH: The impacts to Illinois are severe and dramatic. EPA’s own impact analysis shows that 94.6% of Illinois' wetlands are probably no longer going to be protected by the Federal Clean Water Act. So functionally, Illinois wetlands have been written out of the Clean Water Act.

Illinois does not have strong state wetlands protections, so Prairie Rivers Network, and many of our partners, we are trying to pass legislation where the state would step in where the federal government is stepping back. So, the state would run their own wetlands protections program, but we don't have that currently. We relied on the federal Clean Water Act.

JS: So, you at the Prairie Rivers Network drafted the formal comments, and 42 other community organizations signed on. What was it like to get that type of response?

RH: Well, on one hand, it's very heartening that all of these community organizations — including environmental groups, public health groups, labor, environmental justice and other community advocacy organizations — they all want to protect clean water, and they want to protect wetlands, and so the response was immediate and overwhelming in in their support of this.

What we are pushing for is strong, science-based protections for our water here in Illinois. And you know, frankly, the rule that's been proposed ignores the basic science of water and hydrology.

And so even though it was a disparate set of groups, both geographically and in terms of mission, I think we all share an interest in defending Illinois water quality and ecosystems and public health. Illinois lawmakers should take note that there's widespread and broad desire to protect Illinois wetlands.

JS: What are the next steps for you at the Prairie Rivers Network?",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4548eb2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+278/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc9%2F02%2F9cb62c544f729ce6964763a37494%2F250724-wnij-volostock-img-16.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 10:02:13.381238

In the first year of his second term, President Donald Trump worked across agencies to roll back practical and political momentum to address the climate crisis.

Experts say the array of administration policies supporting the fossil fuel industry could halve U.S. progress on reducing carbon emissions, and actions such as withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement are projected to erase at least 0.1°C (0.18°F) of international efforts to limit warming by 2100.

Rolling Back Climate Policy

Trump’s interagency effort to roll back critical climate policies began immediately. An executive order (EO) signed on the first day of Trump’s second term titled “Unleashing American Energy” ordered additional oil and gas exploration, accelerated permitting for such drilling, eliminated credits and regulations favoring electric vehicles, and revoked 12 climate- and energy-related EOs issued by the administration of President Joe Biden.

In March, the EPA indicated it would move to reconsider the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which states that greenhouse gases “threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations.” The Endangerment Finding underpins the federal government’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, power plants, oil and gas facilities, and factories.

On 29 July, the EPA formally proposed to rescind the finding, and the Department of Energy (DOE) published a report finding that carbon dioxide–induced warming “appears to be less damaging economically than commonly believed,” that U.S. policy actions have “undetectably small direct impacts on the global climate,” and that claims of increased frequency or intensity of storms are “not supported” by historical data.

In September, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conducted their own review, stating that “EPA’s 2009 finding that the human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases threaten human health and welfare was accurate” and is “beyond scientific dispute.” In a letter to the National Academies, House Oversight Chair James Comer (R-KY) dismissed the review as a “blatant partisan act to undermine the Trump Administration.”

In August, the American Meteorological Society published a report identifying “five foundational flaws” in the DOE report that each place the report “at odds with scientific principles and practices.”

In addition to reconsidering the Endangerment Finding, the Trump administration immediately began to dismantle the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27 billion lending program meant to spur private investment in clean energy. In March, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin terminated $20 billion of this funding. Numerous lawsuits followed, but in July, Trump rescinded all funding for the program.

In February, Congress repealed a Biden era rule implementing a federal tax on methane pollution, which would have been the United States’ first tax on greenhouse gases. In June, the administration also proposed to rescind all greenhouse gas emissions standards for coal-, oil-, and gas-fired power plants.

The One Big Beautiful Bill, the omnibus spending bill that became law on 4 July, removes or rapidly phases out most clean energy, electric vehicle, and clean manufacturing tax credits introduced by Biden’s key climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act. While reducing support for clean energy projects, the law also grants $40 billion in new subsidies and tax credits to the fossil fuel industry through 2035, according to a report from Oil Change International, an anti–fossil fuel advocacy group.

In total, the One Big Beautiful Bill is expected to cut the development of new clean-power-generating capacity by up to 59% through 2035, according to a report by the Rhodium Group. An analysis by Carbon Brief and Princeton University found the passage of the law will set the United States up to drop emissions to 3% below current levels by 2030 rather than the 40% mandated by the Paris Agreement.

In November, the EPA announced it would delay methane emissions reduction requirements set by the Biden administration, giving oil and gas companies until January 2027 to comply. In December, the White House and Department of Transportation announced a proposal to revoke vehicle fuel efficiency standards that were tightened in 2024. The administration is expected to finalize this proposal in 2026.

Boosting Fossil Fuels, Obstructing Renewables

Trump’s declaration of a “national energy emergency” gave federal agency heads authority to grant emergency approvals to expedite the completion of energy projects.

“We’re going to drill, baby, drill,” Trump said after being sworn in. That day, Trump issued an executive order (EO) to resume processing permit applications for new liquefied natural gas projects, which had been halted under Biden.

In an April EO seeking to revive the “beautiful clean coal industry,” the Trump administration directed agencies to identify possible new coal resources on federal lands. The order also laid out plans to identify and revise existing regulations and policies that might lead the country away from coal power or coal production. “It is the policy of the United States that coal is essential to our national and economic security,” the EO states.

Also in April, the Department of the Interior said it intended to fast-track approvals for coal, gas, oil, and mineral projects. The administration opened up millions of acres of federal land to oil and gas companies and additional millions of acres to potential coal mining projects. In September, the DOE announced it would invest $625 million to retrofit and modernize aging coal power plants, followed by an additional $100 million in federal funding for similar projects. In May, the administration ordered a coal power plant in Michigan to abandon its plans to shut down, citing a “shortage of electric energy” in the Midwest. In December, it also ordered two coal plants in Indiana, two in Colorado, and one in Washington to remain open.

Among the federal land opened to oil drilling is the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an iconic wilderness area in northern Alaska. In October, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced the federal government would open 1.56 million acres (631,000 hectares) of the refuge to oil and gas leasing, reversing a Biden moratorium on drilling activity there.

In November, the administration announced it planned to open almost 1.3 billion additional acres (526 million hectares) of U.S. coastal waters to new oil and gas drilling. The One Big Beautiful Bill mandated at least 36 oil and gas lease sales in federal waters.

“An offshore lease issued next year could keep pumping carbon into the atmosphere for the next 40 years,” Rebecca Loomis, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told The New York Times.

Renewable energy projects have mostly received the opposite treatment, as federal agencies made a concerted effort to halt existing solar and wind energy projects and slow the permitting and approval process for new ones. Trump took particular aim at wind energy: An EO on the first day of his term withdrew all new offshore wind energy lease opportunities and suggested the possibility of terminating or amending existing leases. A coalition of state attorneys sued the administration, saying Trump does not have the authority to unilaterally make such mandates. In December, a federal judge wrote that the EO violated federal law.

“This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said of the EO.

Solar projects have suffered, too. The Trump administration slowed development on a solar project in Nevada that, if built, would be one of the world’s largest. In October, the EPA canceled $7 billion in grants for a popular clean energy program, Solar for All, meant to help low- and moderate-income households install solar.

Oil and gas permitting, but not renewable energy permitting, continued during the 44-day government shutdown this fall, as the Trump administration approved more than 470 permits to drill on public land. After the January 2026 military action in Venezuela, President Trump announced the country “will be turning over” 30-50 million barrels of oil and that the federal government would maintain control over Venezuela’s oil industry.

Hindering Climate Science

As the Trump administration hindered clean energy projects and boosted fossil fuels, it also targeted climate science. In February, Trump prohibited federal scientists from traveling to take part in a planning meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Federal scientists were reportedly told to stop work on all IPCC-related activities, though some nonfederal U.S. scientists are still involved.

In April, the administration dismissed all scientists working on the United States’ own National Climate Assessment (NCA). In July, a spokeswoman for NASA told The New York Times that NASA would no longer host previous NCAs online. AGU and the American Meteorological Society have responded by creating a special collection on climate change to help catalyze and advance synthesis science to inform our understanding of risks and solutions for U.S. climate research and assessments. In December, the Trump administration asked a group of scientists known for their climate skepticism—the same group that authored the DOE report undermining the 2009 Endangerment Finding—to write the next installment of the NCA.

Additionally, many programs and offices collecting and analyzing climate data were shuttered this year because budgets were cut and staff were fired, creating a widening climate data void. In April, for example, the EPA failed for the first time to meet the obligations of a 1992 treaty setting greenhouse gas reporting requirements for wealthy countries. The Environmental Defense Fund released the data after filing a Freedom of Information Act request. The same month, political appointees told EPA staff that they planned to virtually eliminate the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which requires the country’s largest industrial sites to report their emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.

“The public has a right to know how much climate pollution is being emitted,” Vickie Patton, an attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund, told The New York Times. “The attack on the data, the attack on the science, is irresponsible.”

Pieces of signature energy reports from the Energy Information Administration, a data-tracking arm of the Department of Energy, were removed, while the publication of its International Energy Outlook for 2025 was scrapped.

NOAA, once identified as “one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry,” has come under intense scrutiny. Under the Trump administration, the agency ended support for key data products at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, retired its Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters data product (though the nonprofit Climate Central is bringing it back to life), suspended work on a massive dataset meant to predict extreme rainfall, and consolidated climate data hosted on Climate.gov on another NOAA domain. The administration also canceled its lease for NOAA’s Global Monitoring Laboratory in Hilo, Hawaii, an important site for scientists tracking carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Trump proposed cutting virtually all funding for climate research at NOAA, though Congress is considering spending bills that include much more modest cuts. Congress is also considering a bill that would ensure the uninterrupted storage of NOAA datasets indefinitely.

NASA’s climate programs suffered, too: This spring, the Trump administration began the process of shrinking the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which maintains critical climate data records. And over the summer, the administration directed NASA employees to draw up plans to end satellite missions designed to monitor carbon dioxide emissions. Acting Administrator Sean Duffy made clear the agency will deprioritize all climate science.

The Department of the Interior cut funding to a third of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Climate Adaptation Science Centers, which funds projects aimed to help people, wildlife, land, and water adapt to local effects of climate change. This includes mapping risks of wildfire and flooding, maintaining infrastructure such as storm drains, and assessing fish and wildlife populations for both hunting and conservation.

The Trump administration also axed funding for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a decades-old congressionally mandated interagency climate research program. And in November, a new organizational plan for the Energy Department no longer showed various offices that had overseen clean energy technology development.

More than 100 National Science Foundation (NSF) grants for climate-related science have been canceled as well. In December, the Trump administration announced that it would dismantle the NSF-funded National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), one of the world’s leading climate and Earth science laboratories.

The administration also systematically removed mentions of climate change and related language from agency websites and directed the Department of Energy not to use certain language, including the words “green” and “decarbonization.” The EPA also erased references linking human activities to climate change from sections of its website.

And while geoengineering has not been a priority of the Trump administration, Rep. Marjorie Tayler Greene (R-GA) introduced the Clear Skies Act in July, which would impose $100,000 fines and potential jail time for anyone conducting “weather modification” activities.

Stalling Global Progress

The Trump administration’s approach to climate and energy policy has reverberated globally. The administration’s decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement (to take effect in January 2026) will set global projected emissions back 0.1°C (0.18°F) by 2100, according to a United Nations report.

The same EO that withdraws the United States from the Paris Agreement also directs the administration to revoke contributions to international climate finance funds. This directive means the global climate finance goal agreed upon at COP29 (the 29th Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change) will be much more difficult to meet. In March, the administration also pulled the United States out of the Board of the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage, a U.N. climate damage fund created at COP28 dedicated to helping finance developing countries’ climate adaptation efforts. The same month, the United States withdrew from the Just Energy Transition Partnership, an international collaboration formed at COP26 meant to help developing countries implement clean energy.

The Trump administration did not attend COP30 in Belém, Brazil, a move that other leaders admonished. “Mr. Trump is against humankind,” said Colombian President Gustavo Petro. It was the first time in COP history that the United States did not send a delegation.

In January 2026, the White House issued an EO ordering the withdrawal of the United States from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, a 1992 treaty that set the legal framework for international negotiations on climate change. According to the terms of the treaty, the formal withdrawal will occur one year after the government submits paperwork to the U.N., after which the United States will be the only country not engaged in the global agreement. The EO also ordered the withdrawal of the United States from the IPCC.

At an International Energy Agency meeting held in London in April, Trump administration staff members opposed policies to regulate fossil fuels. In September, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright traveled to Italy to attend the world’s largest natural gas conference. While in Europe, Wright urged European governments to ditch methane regulations, called net-zero goals “a colossal train wreck,” and downplayed the risks of climate change. “It’s turned out that not only does climate change not look to be an urgent threat…but doing something about it has proven remarkably difficult,” Wright told reporters in Brussels.

The Trump administration also attempted to use economic levers to encourage other nations to walk back their climate goals. In July, for instance, the administration agreed to reduce some tariffs on the European Union (EU) if the EU purchased $750 billion in American oil and gas. In December, the Trump administration asked the EU to exempt US oil and gas companies that sell oil and gas to Europe from European methane regulations.

Next Steps

Despite criticism of the DOE report and widespread opposition to the reconsideration of the rule—even Tesla wants to preserve it—the EPA is expected to move forward with revoking the Endangerment Finding in early 2026. The decision is expected to face serious legal challenges, and the Trump administration faces an ongoing lawsuit from the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists over the controversial DOE report. Final repeals of federal vehicle fuel economy standards and power plant emissions limits are also expected in early 2026.

The future of climate programs like the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, Solar for All, electric vehicle infrastructure funds, and other climate-related grants likely lies in the courts, not the ballot box. Environmental groups and other stakeholders have filed multiple lawsuits challenging these actions, and they are still proceeding through the legal system. A coalition of states has even sued Trump and his administration over the president’s initial declaration of a “national energy emergency.”

PEER Demands Accounting from Interior Department Over “Freedom250” Use of Taxpayer Funds

Diversion of Funds Raises Serious Questions

Washington, DC — Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) today sent a letter to Department of the Interior (DOI) Secretary Doug Burgum demanding detailed disclosures regarding the creation, funding, and oversight of “Freedom250,” a separate entity that has reportedly received taxpayer funds appropriated by Congress for the America250 commemoration program.

Congress authorized and funded America250 as the official, bipartisan vehicle for commemorating the nation’s 250th anniversary. That authorization established specific structures, safeguards, and lines of accountability intended to ensure lawful use of public funds and meaningful congressional oversight.

PEER’s letter raises concerns that public money may have been redirected from America250 to Freedom250, an entity operating outside the framework Congress created. If confirmed, such a diversion would raise serious questions about compliance with appropriations law, transparency requirements, and DOI’s authority to redirect congressionally authorized funds.

In its letter, PEER calls on DOI to provide prompt, public answers to the following questions:

How at least $100 million in taxpayer funds redirected to Freedom250 are being spent, including budgets, funded activities, contractors or grantees, and who holds decision-making authority;

Whether Freedom250 is raising or accepting private funds in addition to public dollars, and if so, the sources and amounts of those funds, along with safeguards to prevent conflicts of interest or political influence; and

What role, if any, the National Park Foundation is playing in supporting Freedom250, including whether Foundation funds, staff time, or in-kind resources are being used and whether those activities are consistent with its statutory mission.

“Congress created America250 to ensure that public funds for this commemoration are spent lawfully and subject to oversight,” said Tim Whitehouse, executive director of PEER. “Routing those funds through a separate entity without clear authorization or transparency undermines Congress’s intent and the public’s right to know how its money is being used.”

PEER warned that allowing a parallel entity to carry out work similar to America250 risks weakening statutory safeguards and obscuring responsibility for decisions involving substantial public expenditures.

“The Department of the Interior can address these concerns by producing a full accounting of Freedom250’s budget, disclosing all fundraising activity, and clearly explaining the legal basis for its involvement,” Whitehouse said. “Transparency and accountability are not optional when taxpayer funds are at issue — they are legal obligations.”

The letter was copied to members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the House Committee on Natural Resources.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This news release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information ‎within the meaning of Canadian securities legislation (collectively, ""forward-looking ‎statements"") that relate to the Company's current expectations and views of future events.","TORONTO, Jan. 15, 2026 /PRNewswire/ - PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN) (Cboe CA: SUNN) (FSE: 103) (""PowerBank"" or the ""Company""), a leader in North American energy infrastructure development and asset ownership, is pleased to announce that it has executed a lease agreement on a 5 MW AC hybrid solar plus battery energy storage project known as the NY-Holland Glnwd project (the ""Project""), in New York.

The Project is expected to be eligible for incentives under the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (""NYSERDA"") NY-Sun and Retail Energy Storage Incentive Programs, along with federal Investment Tax Credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025.

The rapid growth of wind and solar power and the rising demand for electricity from data centers are making batteries a necessity. They store surplus renewable energy for when it's not windy or sunny, and maintain a balance between energy supply and demand. There has been a 90 percent drop in the cost of batteries over the last 15 years as new factories have come on line, resulting in significant growth in this sector globally.

The Company is in the process of initiating the preliminary screening analysis as part of the interconnection process. Assuming receipt of interconnection approval, the Company will work to complete the permitting process and secure the necessary financing for the construction of the Project.

Once completed, the Project will likely be operated as a hybrid community solar plus energy storage project. Community solar is a solar project with access to the local electricity grid. Once the project is connected and generating electricity, energy from the site feeds into the local power grid. Depending on the size and number of panels the project has, dozens or even hundreds of renters and homeowners can save money from the electricity that is generated by the project. By subscribing to a project, an electricity customer can earn credits on their electric bill every month from their portion of the solar that's generated by the project, accessing the benefits of solar and energy storage without installing any equipment at their location. This allows electricity customers to realize a reduced cost per kilowatt-hour from the power they consume versus standard utility rates.

PowerBank's proven expertise, with over 100 MW of completed projects and a development pipeline exceeding 1 GW, underpins the project's execution. Strategic partnerships and institutional-grade development capabilities position PowerBank to deliver reliable, high-impact renewable energy solutions.

The Project advances New York's ambitious Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act goal of 6 GW of solar capacity by 2025. As a national leader in community solar, New York accounts for nearly one-third of the United States' 6.2 GW of installed solar capacity, and PowerBank is honored to contribute to this transformative milestone.

There are several risks associated with the development of the Project. The development of any project is subject to receipt of a community solar contract, receipt of interconnection approval, receipt of required permits, the availability of third-party financing arrangements for the Company and the risks associated with the construction of a solar power project. In addition, governments may revise, reduce or eliminate incentives and policy support schemes for solar power, which could result in future Project no longer being economic. Please refer to ""Forward-Looking Statements"" for additional discussion of the assumptions and risk factors associated with the Project and statements made in this press release.

,American Energy,2026-01-15 13:33:50+00:00,POWER Magazine,Gas Turbine Supply Chain Bottlenecks Could Reshape the Generation Mix in 2030 and Beyond,Aaron Larson,,,,,https://www.powermag.com/gas-turbine-supply-chain-bottlenecks-could-reshape-the-generation-mix-in-2030-and-beyond/,"According to the EPRI experts, rotor forgings and hot-section blades have emerged as the primary bottlenecks, constrained by limited suppliers and highly technical manufacturing processes.
For advanced machines requiring single-crystal blades or exotic materials, the qualification process becomes even more complex, the EPRI experts noted.
Often, however, this only becomes evident after components enter service, making them difficult to trace, the EPRI experts explained.
Supply chain challenges, combined with long-term demand growth, are driving renewed interest in advanced nuclear and long-duration energy storage, the EPRI experts noted.
The turbine bottleneck, while painful in the near term, may ultimately accelerate the transition toward a more diversified and resilient power generation fleet.","The gas turbine industry is facing its most significant supply chain challenge in decades, with backlogs extending years into the future and utilities scrambling to secure dispatchable capacity. To better understand the scope of the problem and what options utilities have, POWER spoke with John Shingledecker, principal technical executive with EPRI, and Bobby Noble, senior program manager for Gas Turbine Research and Development (R&D) with EPRI and an American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Fellow.

According to the EPRI experts, rotor forgings and hot-section blades have emerged as the primary bottlenecks, constrained by limited suppliers and highly technical manufacturing processes. The situation has grown severe enough that some large frame turbines have been shipped without rotors or blades, with installation occurring later onsite to maintain construction schedules. Delays in new hot-section blade deliveries have also driven increased emphasis on component re-use, re-manufacturing, and repair programs, they said.

Vendor Qualification Challenges

Qualifying new vendors offers no quick fix, the researchers explained. The timeline for bringing a new supplier online is highly dependent on the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), supplier, and specific component involved. Large forgings present particular challenges, the researchers noted, because only a limited number of suppliers exist globally, many of whom already serve multiple OEMs. Adding a new supplier may not significantly ease constraints if they are already engaged across the industry.

For advanced machines requiring single-crystal blades or exotic materials, the qualification process becomes even more complex, the EPRI experts noted. While raw material availability is generally not the issue, materials costs are driving up prices. Competition for nickel superalloys and cobalt has intensified, particularly with the rise of lithium-ion batteries. Aerospace and energy were once the primary users of cobalt, but battery demand now exerts strong influence on pricing, they said.

A Different Demand Driver

Unlike the gas turbine boom of the late 2000s, which was driven primarily by low gas prices, today’s demand stems from multiple converging factors, according to Shingledecker and Noble. These include near-term needs from data centers, limited dispatchable power options due to increasing non-dispatchable resources on the grid, and long-term electricity growth from electrification. New coal generation is no longer a viable option for most utilities, and natural gas supplies are more abundant than previously thought during the first boom, providing added stability for gas-fired generation investment.

Data centers are driving particularly acute short-term demand for dispatchable power, the EPRI researchers said. While they are not typically competing for large-frame turbines, they do compete directly with utilities for small- and mid-sized turbines in the 30 MW to 100 MW range—prime peaker territory. This competition has opened opportunities for new market entrants.

Near-Term Options for Utilities

For utilities needing capacity by 2028 but facing backlogs extending to 2030, options remain limited but available. According to the EPRI experts, many utilities are extending the life of existing thermal assets, pursuing repowering projects, and implementing turbine uprates through technologies such as inlet fogging and advanced modifications. EPRI, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory, is exploring uprate scenarios with potential double-digit percentage increases in output, they said. Meanwhile, renewables paired with battery storage continue to be part of the capacity mix.

The capacity pressure is accelerating adoption of smaller, modular solutions, the researchers noted. Orders for turbines under 20 MW reached record highs in 2025, and reciprocating internal combustion engine (RICE)-based power plants are also gaining traction. Aeroderivative units offer flexibility and rapid deployment, though they face similar backlog pressures due to competition with the commercial aviation industry for components and manufacturing capacity.

Quality and Market Dynamics

When supply chains are stretched, quality problems sometimes emerge. Often, however, this only becomes evident after components enter service, making them difficult to trace, the EPRI experts explained. EPRI’s research, including process compensated resonance testing (PCRT), has proven instrumental in detecting quality issues early. Past differences between vendors have been identified through serial number structures, they said.

The competitive landscape is also evolving. While GE Vernova, Mitsubishi Power, and Siemens Energy remain dominant, some reshuffling is expected, according to Shingledecker and Noble. Doosan Enerbility recently entered the North American market, signaling new competition. However, with the overall market expanding due to growing demand, market share shifts may be less significant than the overall growth in opportunity.

Long-Term Implications

Predicting how long the backlog will persist remains difficult, the researchers acknowledged. Expanding factory capacity and onboarding new vendors is a long-term process, not a quick fix. The prolonged turbine unavailability could alter the generation mix for 2030 and beyond.

Supply chain challenges, combined with long-term demand growth, are driving renewed interest in advanced nuclear and long-duration energy storage, the EPRI experts noted. Utilities increasingly recognize the need for diverse generation portfolios to manage risks related to supply chains, fuel costs, and system flexibility, they said. The turbine bottleneck, while painful in the near term, may ultimately accelerate the transition toward a more diversified and resilient power generation fleet.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fig1-ge-gas-turbine.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 10:01:57.000217

It allows us to harness the energy of the sun and use it in our homes and businesses.

This article shines a light on the rapid growth of solar energy in Europe in recent years and its benefits for both consumers and the EU as a whole.

Solar technology at a glance

A range of solar technologies are available to harness the sun’s energy in different ways.

Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, comprised of individual solar cells, convert sunlight into electricity.

Solar thermal panels harness the sun’s heat and are primarily used to heat water and spaces in buildings, can provide steam for industry, or even air conditioning and cooling.

Concentrated solar power technology uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight and produce heat and steam to generate electricity.

Growth of solar energy in Europe

The growth of solar energy in Europe in recent years is a trajectory we can all be proud of.

Solar PV has become the most competitive source of electricity in many parts of the EU, thanks to massive decreases in its cost. Eurostat reports that 47.5% of the EU’s electricity consumption came from renewables in 2024, of which solar PV accounted for almost a quarter at 23.4%, and in June 2025, for the first time in history, the sun was the main source of the electricity we generated!

The EU’s solar PV capacity reached an estimated 406 GW in 2025. This is compared to 338 GW in 2024 and comfortably surpasses the objective of the EU Solar Energy strategy from 2022 that aimed at reaching 380 GW by 2025 (source: SolarPower Europe).

Meanwhile, 11 million rooftops in Europe are equipped with solar thermal and thermal storage. The total installed capacity of solar thermal in mainland Europe was 41 GW in 2023. (source: Solar Heat Europe).

What are the benefits of solar energy for households and businesses?

Solar photovoltaic and solar thermal panels can be installed on rooftops and even integrated into buildings, for instance as solar roof tiles or facades. In some EU countries, homeowners and tenants can install plug-in mini-solar panels on balcony railings, walls or terraces.

If more energy than needed is produced by solar PV panels at a given moment, it can be

stored in local batteries or in local thermal storage

shared with other consumers

injected to the electricity grid and sold

While not every building is suitable for installing solar panels, energy communities and energy sharing solutions mean that you can still enjoy the benefits of this clean and cheap energy source, even if it’s not possible to install them on your own building.

Solar thermal can be a great source of clean and affordable hot water and space heat not only for homes, but also industry. Examples of industries using solar thermal in the EU include the paper industry, agri-food, the flowers industry and the beverages industry.

What are the benefits of solar energy for the EU as a whole?

Solar energy has a significant role to play in the EU’s transition towards cleaner, more affordable and secure energy, and our journey to become the world’s first climate neutral continent by 2050. Listed as one of the key technologies in the Net Zero Industry Act, which is aiming at scaling up the manufacturing of clean technologies in the EU, solar PV and solar thermal are expected to grow further in the coming years.

As a cheap and abundant energy source that we can produce at home, solar contributes to reducing the price of our electricity, putting the EU at a competitive advantage and helping to drive economic growth and create jobs.

The EU has a strong manufacturing base for solar thermal, with 90% of our demand already met by EU production. The EU countries with the largest solar thermal installed capacity are Germany (13 285 MWth), followed by Greece (4 2024 MWth) and Italy (3 829 MWth), according to Solar Heat Europe.

An estimated 7.2 million people were employed in solar PV in 2024, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency’s Annual Review 2025. 10.6% of these jobs were located in the EU, providing employment for an estimated 764 400 people. Additionally, solar heating and cooling and concentrated solar power contributed 19 000 and 5 000 jobs respectively.

Furthermore, solar PV generation is often decentralised in nature, which can play a key role in strengthening our energy system’s resilience. Although solar is a variable energy source, meaning it cannot be produced 24/7, the energy produced can be stored and shared, allowing solar systems to supply electricity even at night or during grid disruptions.

A neon pink sign flashes these words—part of an installation by artist Alicia Eggert—at a DC museum just steps from the White House. Until a year ago, I often used an image of this art installation in my work presentations, to illustrate a particular point.

Among my responsibilities at the White House and then at the US Department of Transportation was working on the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the CHIPS and Science Act, as a means of tackling the climate crisis. This trifecta of legislative victories represented more climate progress than I could have imagined in ten years of prior advocacy at UCS. I used that presentation slide to help the public, universities, and state and local decision makers see that a brighter future was possible because of the ambitious investments being made by the federal government towards climate and clean energy goals.

Unfortunately, there is also a flip side to those words. In the year since I’ve returned to UCS, we’ve seen a different unimaginable future unfold, in which the Trump administration has worked to destroy all of that climate and clean energy progress; disrupt longstanding government programs and processes; and disregard the rule of law. The administration has clawed back funding that was agreed on by Congress and promised to scientific institutions, illegally fired federal employees, and gutted congressionally mandated programs. President Trump and his administration have rolled back policies protecting our health, safety, and environment; set new policies with no regard for data and evidence; silenced people’s voices on issues that affect them; given polluting industries free rein; denied climate science; and taken step after step towards authoritarianism. There is no recent precedent for all of this; even for those of us who read each page of the Heritage Foundation’s “Project 2025,” this present moment was unimaginable.

The scope, severity, and speed of attacks on science have been dizzying. But if the past year has taught us anything, it’s that we are not powerless to stop them. Across the country, scientists and science supporters have organized and fought back in response to the Trump administration’s actions, and UCS has embraced our role in leading the charge.

Early in the new term, UCS led an effort to unify the scientific community with a sign-on letter boasting signatories from 56 scientific societies representing more than 100,000 scientists. We took our defense of science to the courts, filing lawsuits focused on the administration’s illegal actions: against the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) for acting beyond their power to cut funding and fire federal employees; against administration officials for trying to base policy off of an unlawfully created report from a secretly convened group of climate contrarians; and challenging the Trump administration’s removal of public information from climate and environmental justice federal agency websites. After the first 100 days of the administration, UCS launched the “You Need Science. Science Needs You” campaign, connecting supporters to their elected officials to demand that funding for US science be preserved.

As the administration disbanded and weakened scientific advisory committees that provide analyses for important decisions about our health, UCS provided guidance for experts to launch their own independent committees, and supported many such efforts—which represent a huge contribution of time and expertise in the name of ensuring science reaches those who need it.

Throughout the year, we helped organize and turned out for mass mobilizations across the country, including the Stand up for Science rally, and sponsoring the most recent No Kings protest last October. I co-authored an editorial in Science magazine that provides a roadmap to resistance specifically for scientists—because I truly believe we were made for this moment. We armed our supporters, including our growing Science Network of experts, with a toolkit for engaging their elected officials during the August Congressional recess.

We’ve sent our experts to testify against dangerous policy proposals, brought widespread media attention to the communities facing the greatest risks to their health and safety because of the administration’s actions, and rallied the scientific community to fight together. And all year long, the scientific community published op-eds, attended Congressional meetings, and organized across the country: making it loud and clear that the anti-science actions of the Trump administration are unacceptable.

I’m heartened by the moral clarity and persistence of those around me who remain committed to science and its role in informing decisions that affect us all. Let’s be real: the consequences of standing up to this administration can be scary. Plenty of people have lost their jobs, their funding, their life’s work (and even their homes, loved ones, and lives) to its capricious cruelty. Because of that, we might not have anticipated such a strong response. It’s not easy to resist an authoritarian regime—or even a wannabe authoritarian regime.

But. We. Showed. Up. And we’re not going anywhere.

As we enter 2026, we’re going to build on our achievements and doggedly continue doing the work we know is right, and necessary. This includes making more progress on climate and clean energy at the state level, carrying on momentum from last year’s huge wins in California, Maine, and Illinois. We’ll keep shining a light on the administration’s attacks on science, for accountability and to publicize the human toll these policy decisions exact. We’ll be releasing more groundbreaking scientific research into quantifying the climate harms caused by massive tech companies and industrial agriculture, tracking the implications of two major international court decisions last year, and supporting existing cases against Big Oil with our expertise and advocacy. We’ll be calling out bad actors from Big Ag to the federal government. And most importantly, we’ll be doing this in partnership with the scientific community at large, offering many opportunities for scientists and science supporters to get involved and speak up for what matters.

We must set our eyes on a different kind of unimaginable future—one where our hard work in the trenches defending our progress and advancing our goals pays off. A future in which we fully realize a safer, healthier, and more equitable world because of our steadfast commitment to science for the people.

Hochberg,,,,,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2026-01-15/housing-affordability-small-business-administration-home-disaster-loan-program,"Nearly 70% of American adults polled recently said that the central promise of the American Dream — that hard work can earn a good life — is no longer true or never was.
At the center of this squeeze is housing — the cornerstone of the American Dream.
The program costs about $1 billion to operate, a relatively small portion of the Small Business Administration’s budget.
Would this one quick fix solve the housing crisis?
If done right, this would ease housing costs while serving nearly everyone’s interests.","Nearly 70% of American adults polled recently said that the central promise of the American Dream — that hard work can earn a good life — is no longer true or never was.

It’s easy to understand why. Decades of policy choices, rising costs and stagnant wages have eroded the path that once led from work to security. An affordability crisis is continuing to hammer working- and middle-class Americans, making it harder than ever for many just to get by. At the center of this squeeze is housing — the cornerstone of the American Dream.

Home prices are 50% higher today than they were only five years ago — and Americans’ paychecks have not grown to match. Young people, in particular, have been left out in the cold: The average age of first-time home buyers has climbed to 40, the highest on record.

A number of ideas have been floated to address this crisis, including a ban on large institutional investors scooping up private homes — an approach put forward by congressional Democrats multiple times in recent years and raised anew by President Trump earlier this month. Some of these ideas have merit; others do not. But nearly all would take years to implement.

What if there were already a program on the books that could help solve the problem right now?

At the Small Business Administration, where I once served as the deputy and acting administrator, a little-known initiative called the Home Disaster Loan program has been in operation since the 1960s, providing long-term home loans at a low, fixed interest rate for people whose homes or businesses have been damaged by natural disasters. These loans have served as a lifeline for Americans experiencing disasters, and versions of this program have been expanded during broader moments of crisis, including in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Americans today are in a crisis of affordability — so why not expand the program to reach them?

Congress could amend the Disaster Loan program and instantly drop mortgage rates by about 2.25 percentage points, to about 4%, for millions of Americans. For a roughly typical home buyer — seeking a $500,000 house, and making an 18% down payment — this simple change would cut the monthly mortgage payment to $1,950 from $2,450, saving about $6,000 a year.

Crucially, this would not impose a major burden on taxpayers. In 2024, the Home Disaster Loan program issued about 18,000 loans, with interest rates subsidized to allow homeowners and businesses to borrow at the same rate the government does. The program costs about $1 billion to operate, a relatively small portion of the Small Business Administration’s budget. And because taxpayers are on the hook only for the cost of defaults, even a major expansion of the program wouldn’t create a serious cost burden relative to the widespread benefits that would come from cooling off the housing market.

To help mitigate those costs, Congress should maintain the program’s current cap: The loans aren’t available for homes over $500,000. The agency already has strong underwriting standards that ensure that loans go to dependable borrowers, not the subprime candidates whom some past government lending supported. Loans should also be made available to the many current homeowners who would love to buy a new house, but who are inadvertently keeping the housing market frozen because they feel trapped in starter homes they bought at favorable rates.

Would this one quick fix solve the housing crisis? Of course not. But by lowering the financial barrier to homeownership for many, it could help take the pressure off the housing market in much the same way America did a century ago with the advent of the 30-year mortgage — a simple innovation that helped lift homeownership from under half of American families to nearly two-thirds. The policy change I am proposing could bring about a similar effect on a smaller scale: cooling prices, eliminating volatility by replacing constantly shifting interest rates with a friendly and stable option, and opening the door for more Americans to own their own home.

The president’s recent openness to cracking down on high home prices — an issue long popular with Democrats — suggests that there may be a political opening for Congress and the White House to get something done.

If done right, this would ease housing costs while serving nearly everyone’s interests. It serves traditional liberal values by helping raise the standard of living of working Americans. It serves traditional conservative values by bringing more stability and less transience to our communities. And at a time when our leaders have struggled to improve affordability, it offers a concrete step in the right direction — one that the president, who prides himself as a builder, may find attractive.

At a time when Americans are losing faith not only in the American Dream but also in the capacity and willingness of our leaders to defend it, expanding the Home Disaster Loan program can be a small part of the antidote: a simple, immediate, tangible, bipartisan action that can improve people’s lives and help restore that dream — today.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8d39b5b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+254/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa8%2F77%2F13acfda24b18b5e71e01a52268e6%2F57356464.JPG,N,,2026-01-15 10:02:03.677854

While far from exhaustive, here are some of the major assaults on climate and clean energy from the Trump administration that we’ve seen in the last year: 1.
Clawing back renewable energy funding and attacking clean energy projects The administration has illegally frozen and clawed back billions in funding for climate and cutting-edge clean energy investments, including Department of Energy (DOE) grants and the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.
DOE Secretary Chris Wright has repeatedly attacked clean energy, rolled back energy efficiency standards, overseen mass staff cuts at the agency, and renamed the world-renowned National Renewable Energy Laboratory to strike “renewable energy” from its name.","As we come up on the one-year mark of the second Trump administration, it’s painful to reflect on all that’s been lost on climate and clean energy progress for our nation and the grave consequences for people and the economy. As families across the nation struggle to pay their rising energy bills, the Trump administration’s efforts to gut clean energy projects and boost volatile, risky, and polluting fossil fuels are a threat to health and pocketbooks. And with the world on the brink of breaching 1.5°C of global warming, this administration’s actions to increase US heat-trapping emissions will have profound implications for years to come.

Fair warning, this blogpost covers some pretty grim ground. But stick with me, please. Documenting the harms and injustices perpetuated by this administration now, as they occur, ensures we bear witness and that the hard work that made prior progress possible is not erased. Let’s make sure we don’t forget the important details as we fight to build a better, brighter future beyond this dark time. A healthier, safer, and more equitable future is ours to create, as UCS President Gretchen Goldman says.

Annus horribilis for people in the United States

From Day One, it was clear that this deeply anti-science administration was intent on blatantly furthering a fossil fuel agenda—people’s health and welfare be damned. President Trump has assembled around him an extremely unqualified, obsequious cabinet and set of advisors, most of whom have no dedication to the public interest and are instead devoted to doing his every bidding.

This increasingly authoritarian regime has operated with impunity to tear up climate and clean energy policies, lie about the scientific realities of climate change and the facts on renewable energy, and ram through measures to boost fossil fuels and the profits of polluters. They have attacked the federal scientific enterprise built up over decades through taxpayer investments, fired or forced out agency experts, and cut funding for critical science. And a compliant Congress has enabled this destructive agenda, including by rubberstamping some of the President’s illegal actions and by failing to exercise its constitutional powers to check his tyrannical power grabs. The passage of the OBBBA, with its multiple provisions directly aimed at undermining clean energy—including wind, solar, batteries, grid infrastructure, and energy efficiency—at the President’s behest was a particularly egregious example of this.

The Sabin Center’s Climate Backtracker shows that, as of January 14, 2026, the Trump administration has taken nearly 300 actions to scale back or halt climate and clean energy progress. UCS’s six-month report on the Trump administration summarized many of the attacks on science and democracy as of July 2025. Many of these actions were previewed in the Project 2025 manifesto, but the magnitude of the harms, and the speed and intensity of the attacks, are shocking, and the impacts have been mounting.

Early destructive actions were taken by DOGE, spearheaded by Elon Musk, taking a hatchet to federal agencies tasked with protecting the public interest and advancing science and innovation. Subsequently, Director of the Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought, an architect of Project 2025, has taken a personal and vicious role in many of these attacks (see here and here, for example).

And unfortunately, the full weight of the impacts on people and our economy are only going to become clearer this year, as words and cuts are translated into lived realities for communities across the country. At the same time, many of the administration’s unlawful actions are being challenged in court, and it has lost many of these cases, putting some brakes on some of its worst excesses.

Before diving further into details, it’s important to note two key themes: The Trump administration’s destructive actions are a direct threat to our health, our economic well-being, and to our nation’s ability to build a thriving, fair, innovative economy. These actions demonstrate an utterly corrupt government hell-bent on prioritizing the interests of polluters and billionaires over the needs of ordinary people.

While far from exhaustive, here are some of the major assaults on climate and clean energy from the Trump administration that we’ve seen in the last year:

1. Attacking agencies and organizations engaged in life-saving climate science research, data collection and monitoring

This has included threats to dismantle NOAA and NSF-NCAR; disbanding the author team for the sixth National Climate Assessment; taking down the US Global Change Research Program’s website, which includes all previous National Climate Assessments; and halting US federal scientists’ engagement with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). NOAA, the nation’s foremost climate science agency, has faced reckless firing of staff, budget cuts, and slashed resources for climate research, satellite programs, data, and modeling.

Under Department of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s watch, the agency’s weather forecasting and climate monitoring capabilities are being undermined and many National Weather Service offices have been dangerously understaffed—undercutting critical resources that communities, first responders, farmers, mariners, businesses, and local decisionmakers rely on to protect lives, infrastructure, and economic activity. It’s crucial that the forthcoming Congressional appropriations process rejects the Trump administration’s budget proposals and restores healthy funding levels for federal science agencies.

2. Clawing back renewable energy funding and attacking clean energy projects

The administration has illegally frozen and clawed back billions in funding for climate and cutting-edge clean energy investments, including Department of Energy (DOE) grants and the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. These actions have been challenged in court, and just this week a court has ruled that the Trump administration’s cancellation of some grants based on which states grantees are in violates the law.

DOE Secretary Chris Wright has repeatedly attacked clean energy, rolled back energy efficiency standards, overseen mass staff cuts at the agency, and renamed the world-renowned National Renewable Energy Laboratory to strike “renewable energy” from its name.

In addition to the major harms to clean energy inflicted by the OBBBA, the administration has also repeatedly and arbitrarily intervened in the leasing and permitting of a huge range of renewable energy projects, including pausing offshore wind, onshore wind, and solar projects. Wind and solar developers have just sued the Department of the Interior and the Army Corps of Engineers for “pursuing a concerted and illegal strategy to choke the ability of private developers’ ability to build new and much-needed energy generation projects.” Numerous attacks have been lobbed at offshore wind projects—including projects that were nearly completed—most recently by citing bogus “national security” considerations. The administration just suffered a major setback in a case brought by Revolution Wind, a project of Ørsted, a Danish offshore wind developer. These attacks on renewable energy have been accompanied by a raft of disinformation spouted by the President and his administration, contrary to the facts about the tremendous economic and health benefits of renewable energy, including solar and wind.

3. Gutting pollution standards and boosting fossil fuels

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator Lee Zeldin has launched an all-out assault on regulations, guidance, and scientific research aimed at protecting public health and the environment. This has included weakening, rescinding, or delaying EPA regulations to limit heat-trapping pollution from power plants, vehicles and the oil and gas industry, as well as giving exemptions to polluters causing toxic air pollution from coal-fired power plants and other industrial sources.

The agency is also in the final stages of a process to overturn the science-based Endangerment Finding, a bedrock legal determination establishing the health-harming impacts of heat-trapping emissions. And in a major departure from precedent and long-standing best practice, EPA is also moving away from quantifying the public health impacts— including lives lost or saved—associated with agency rulemakings, debuting this egregious practice in a just-released rule for NOx pollution standards for new gas turbines. This alarming action is a complete capitulation to polluter interests and upends the agency’s mission to protect public health and the environment.

They’ve also taken unprecedented steps to cut the public out of the process of weighing in by eliminating the customary notice-and-comment period for regulations they arbitrarily designate ‘unlawful,’ and a sweeping executive order essentially allows agencies to wipe off whatever regulations they want to—as well as enforcement of those regulations in the time between.

The administration has also launched multiple direct attempts to boost coal, oil, and gas use under the guise of a spurious “national energy emergency.” DOE Secretary Chris Wright and Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum—both with deep fossil fuel industry ties—have aggressively embraced the president’s fossil fuel agenda. Burgum’s actions have included expanding oil and gas leases on public lands, rescinding requirements for environmental impact statements, and fast-tracking permits for fossil fuel energy, all while repeatedly interfering to stop deployment of renewables. The administration’s latest shocking move in this vein is its imperial and illegal grab for Venezuelan oil.

4. Attacking FEMA’s disaster response capabilities and investments in climate resilience

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has overseen the firing and forcing out of more than 20 percent of FEMA’s staff already, with further steep cuts to FEMA’s “Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery Employees” (CORE) expected imminently. At various points last year, Secretary Noem and President Trump went as far as calling for FEMA’s abolition! The agency has faced unending turmoil and dysfunction, with a series of unqualified acting chiefs quitting or being fired only to be replaced by yet another poor choice. This chaos led to major gaps in responding to disasters like the Texas flash flood last year. As the GAO points out, staffing shortages at FEMA have serious consequences for the agency’s ability to do its job to help communities hit by disasters.

The Trump administration also illegally cancelled FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program grants for states, which a coalition of twenty states took the administration to court over, and recently won their lawsuit. The Trump administration has taken actions that will leave communities less prepared and more at risk from worsening climate impacts, including rescinding the science-informed federal flood risk management standard, disbanding expert advisory councils, and politicizing and delaying disaster aid for states. My colleague Shana Udvardy has been carefully tracking the attacks on FEMA, including the recent last-minute cancellation of a recent FEMA Review Council meeting where they were supposed to release a report with recommendations, which has been under threat of interference from Secretary Noem.

5. Taking down or altering climate-related websites and datasets

This includes taking down the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) website and all the previous National Climate Assessments; taking down climate.gov, a free public portal for essential information on climate science and impacts (some of the information is now being curated at climate.us); removing climate science information from the EPA website; proposing to discontinue the GHG Reporting Program and datasets (like NOAA’s billion-dollar weather and climate-related disasters dataset, and its snow and ice data products); and failing to release the EPA’s Annual GHG Inventory for the United States (which the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) successfully retrieved via a FOIA filing).

6. Lying about the facts on climate science

The most egregious example of this is the sham DOE “climate” report, which weaponized disinformation and uncertainty to downplay the risks of climate change and was invoked by EPA as part of its motivation for proposing to overturn the Endangerment Finding. This mirrors a classic strategy of employing disinformation and deception long practiced by the fossil fuel industry, now dangerously being adopted by the US government.

The Environmental Defense Fund and UCS have filed a lawsuit against the administration citing its violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) in the secret, illegal preparation of this report by five handpicked climate contrarians forming the Climate Working Group (CWG). The court has held that the CWG was an advisory committee subject to FACA and had ordered the administration to release all records related to its work. Other examples of this strategy include zeroing out the social cost of carbon (widely used as a measure of the monetary costs of climate damages caused by an additional ton of carbon emissions), directly ignoring the steep and mounting costs of climate change driven by fossil fuel emissions.

7. Withdrawing from international climate agreements and organizations

The most notable examples include withdrawing the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Paris Agreement. The administration also single-handedly prevented the adoption of a major global agreement on reducing emissions from shipping, negotiated in the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Over 100 nations were on the verge of signing, but using bullying tactics—including direct threats to other nations—the administration succeeded in blocking and delaying this agreement.

Together, these actions underscore that this authoritarian, anti-science administration is determined to sacrifice people’s well-being and destabilize global cooperation. But forward-looking US states and the rest of the world recognize that devastating and costly climate impacts are mounting rapidly, and collective global action remains the only viable path to secure a livable future for our children and grandchildren. Withdrawal from global climate agreements and venues will only serve to further isolate the United States and diminish its standing in the world following a spate of deplorable actions that have already sent our nation’s credibility plummeting, jeopardized ties with some of our closest historical allies, and made the world far more unsafe.

As important as these individual attacks are, it’s crucial to also see the administration’s destructive strategy: They are trying to bury the evidence on climate change to advance a pro-fossil fuel agenda that delivers huge profits for a select few while the rest of us suffer the health and economic costs. And we can’t let them because the stakes are too high, for people today and for future generations. The stakes are especially dire for communities that have long been marginalized and discriminated against, those that bear the brunt of health-harming pollution and climate impacts and lack access to affordable clean energy and climate-resilient homes, here in the United States and around the world.

Looking back and fighting for a brighter future

Why look back on such a painful year? Because it’s a way to acknowledge and honor the people who were directly and harshly affected by the actions of this administration, including federal government scientists and frontline communities. Because remembering our shared history is how we build solidarity for the inevitable fights ahead. Because adversity teaches lessons. Because I believe the seeds of the destruction of this administration’s ill-conceived policies lie in their cruel overreach. Because we can take courage and inspiration from all the ways people across the nation showed up for our democracy, for science, for their communities.

This year has also brought extraordinary efforts to expose and fight back against the worst excesses of this unhinged administration. UCS has fought alongside many others by taking the Trump administration to court; advocating with members of Congress to stand up to the administration; filing technical comments with agencies; shining a light on the latest climate science and facts about clean energy; galvanizing the scientific community to get organized, join sign-on letters and call their elected representatives; uplifting the work of environmental justice experts; securing wins in states; joining nationwide demonstrations; and using our voice loudly in every venue we can to speak truth to power.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Blog-Thumbnail-Trump-at-desk-in-oval-office.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 08:57:53.843477

South Korean battery makers are pressing ahead with large-scale investments to build 14 battery plants with a combined capacity of about 580 gigawatt-hours across seven U.S. states.","Unease has deepened across South Korea’s battery industry after vehicle battery supply contracts worth trillions of won were canceled in the United States last month. Kim Jeong-gwan, the minister of trade, industry and energy, recently met with executives from LG Energy Solution, SK On and Samsung SDI and urged them to seriously consider whether the industry’s current three-company structure remains sustainable. After petrochemicals and steel, warning lights are now flashing over secondary batteries, a pillar of South Korea’s future growth strategy.

The industry is under mounting pressure as battery demand weakens following cuts to electric vehicle subsidies in the United States and Europe, while competition from Chinese manufacturers intensifies. Europe’s reduction of EV subsidies in 2023 triggered a sharp drop in battery demand. South Korean firms saw their share of the European market fall to 48.8 percent in 2024 from 63.5 percent in 2022. By contrast, Chinese companies focused on cost-competitive lithium iron phosphate batteries increased their market share to 47.8 percent from 34 percent over the same period. Last year, South Korean battery makers were also overtaken by Chinese rivals in global market share outside China.

Conditions in the U.S. market, where order cancellations continue, are even more challenging. The shock from the Trump administration’s decision to scrap electric vehicle tax credits has rippled through the battery sector. South Korean battery makers are pressing ahead with large-scale investments to build 14 battery plants with a combined capacity of about 580 gigawatt-hours across seven U.S. states. However, cancellations by U.S. automakers now threaten their ability to fully benefit from battery production tax credits worth up to $45 per kilowatt-hour.

Batteries are a future industry with the potential to reshape the industrial paradigm. South Korean companies are struggling with high electricity costs and limited access to raw materials. Chinese firms, by contrast, have secured inputs at low cost and built massive production facilities backed by government subsidies that far exceed those available to South Korean competitors. At a time when major corporations are investing heavily for long-term growth, and when the United States and China are pouring vast public funds into advanced industries, it is unrealistic to expect voluntary restructuring under a “self-help first, government support later” principle that withholds policy backing until companies submit restructuring plans.

Private-sector self-rescue efforts are unavoidable. These include shifting production lines toward energy storage systems, where demand is rising alongside the artificial intelligence boom, or toward cost-competitive lithium iron phosphate batteries, as well as pursuing mergers and acquisitions. At the same time, government incentives must accompany these efforts to steer autonomous industrial restructuring. Possible measures include introducing advanced industry production tax credits or direct refunds for investment tax credits, as practiced in the United States and China, or extending the special electricity rate discount for energy storage systems that is set to expire this year. The government should also work to create new sources of demand, such as batteries for military drones and robotics. Regulations under the Fair Trade Act that hinder voluntary corporate restructuring should also be reviewed. Shifting responsibility entirely onto the private sector risks missing a critical window for action.",https://image.donga.com/mdonga_ad/donga800-500.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 08:00:20.974509

Relying on allies for help In addition to trying to boost domestic production, the Trump administration has sought to secure some of these crucial elements through allies.
The Biden administration sought to increase demand for critical minerals domestically by pushing for more electric vehicle and windmill production.
But the Trump administration largely eliminated the incentives for those products and instead chose to focus on increasing critical minerals production directly.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A bipartisan group of lawmakers have proposed creating a new agency with $2.5 billion to spur production of rare earths and the other critical minerals, while the Trump administration has already taken aggressive actions to break China’s grip on the market for these materials that are crucial to high-tech products, including cellphones, electric vehicles, jet fighters and missiles.

It’s too early to tell how the bill, if passed, could align with the White House’s policy, but whatever the approach, the U.S. is in a crunch to drastically reduce its reliance on China, after Beijing used its dominance of the critical minerals market to gain leverage in the trade war with Washington. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year truce in October, by which Beijing would continue to export critical minerals while the U.S. would ease its export controls of U.S. technology on China.

The Pentagon has shelled out nearly $5 billion over the past year to help ensure its access to the materials after the trade war laid bare just how beholden the U.S. is to China, which processes more than 90% of the world’s critical minerals. To break Beijing’s chokehold, the U.S. government is taking equity stakes in a handful of critical mineral companies and in some cases guaranteeing the price of some commodities using an approach that seems more likely to come out of China’s playbook instead of a Republican administration.

The bill that Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., introduced Thursday would favor a more market-based approach by setting up the independent body charged with building a stockpile of critical minerals and related products, stabilizing prices, and encouraging domestic and allied production to help ensure stable supply not only for the military but also the broader economy and manufacturers.

Shaheen called the legislation “a historic investment” to make the U.S. economy more resilient against China’s dominance that she said has left the U.S. vulnerable to economic coercion. Young said creating the new reserve is “a much-needed, aggressive step to protect our national and economic security.”

Rep. Rob Wittman, R.-Va., introduced the House version of the bill.

New sense of urgency

When Trump imposed widespread tariffs last spring, Beijing fought back not only with tit-for-tat tariffs but severe restrictions on the export of critical minerals, forcing Washington to back down and eventually agree to the truce when the leaders met in South Korea.

On Monday, in his speech at SpaceX, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revealed that the Pentagon has in the past five months alone “deployed over $4.5 billion in capital commitments” to close six critical minerals deals that will “help free the United States from market manipulation.”

One of the deals involves a $150 million of preferred equity by the Pentagon in Atlantic Alumina Co. to save the country’s last alumina refinery and build its first large-scale gallium production facility in Louisiana.

Last year, the Pentagon announced it would buy $400 million of preferred stock in MP Materials, which owns the country’s only operational rare earths mine at Mountain Pass, California, and entered into a $1.4-billion joint partnership with ReElement Technologies Corp. to build up a domestic supply chain for rare earth magnets.

On Wednesday, Trump announced in a proclamation that the U.S. is “too reliant” on foreign-sourced critical minerals and directed his administration to negotiate better deals. He said possible remedies would include minimum import prices for certain critical minerals.

“Reshoring manufacturing that’s critical to our national and economic security is a top priority for the Trump administration,” said Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson.

The drastic move by the U.S. government to take equity stakes has prompted some analysts to observe that Washington is pivoting to some form of state capitalism to compete with Beijing.

“Despite the dangers of political interference, the strategic logic is compelling,” wrote Elly Rostoum, a senior fellow at the Washington-based research institute Center for European Policy Analysis. She suggested that the new model could be “a prudent way for the U.S. to ensure strategic autonomy and industrial sovereignty.”

Companies across the industry are welcoming the intervention from Trump’s administration.

“He is playing three-dimensional chess on critical minerals like no previous president has done. It’s about time too, given the military and strategic vulnerability we face by having to import so many of these fundamental building blocks of technology and national defense,” NioCorp’s Chief Communications Officer Jim Sims said. That company is trying to finish raising the money it needs to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.

Relying on allies for help

In addition to trying to boost domestic production, the Trump administration has sought to secure some of these crucial elements through allies. In October, Trump signed an $8.5 billion agreement with Australia to invest in mining there, and the president is now aggressively trying to take over Greenland in the hope of being able to one day extract rare earths from there.

On Monday, finance ministers from the G7 nations huddled in Washington over their vulnerability in the critical mineral supply chains.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has led several rounds of trade negotiations with Beijing, urged attendees to increase their supply chain resiliency and thanked them for their willingness to work together “toward decisive action and lasting solutions,” according to a Treasury statement.

The bill introduced on Thursday by Shaheen and Young would encourage production with both domestic and allied producers.

Past efforts to bolster rare earths production

Congress in the past several years has pushed for legislation to protect the U.S. military and civilian industry from Beijing’s chokehold. The issue became a pressing concern every time China turned to its proven tactics of either restricting the supply or turned to dumping extra critical minerals on the market to depress prices and drive any potential competitors out of business.

The Biden administration sought to increase demand for critical minerals domestically by pushing for more electric vehicle and windmill production. But the Trump administration largely eliminated the incentives for those products and instead chose to focus on increasing critical minerals production directly.

Most of those past efforts were on a much more limited scale than what the government has done in the past year, and they were largely abandoned after China relented and eased access to critical minerals.

The Principal Investigators and Co-Recipients of the winning proposals are:

Artificial Intelligence: Kristen Grauman, Ph.D., Professor, Department of Computer Science, The University of Texas at Austin

Dr. Grauman has been awarded the 2026 Hill Prize in Artificial Intelligence for pioneering research on video understanding models that help people acquire physical and procedural skills. Her work addresses the complex challenge of teaching AI to interpret human activity from first‑person video—a key step toward intelligent systems that can actively support people in everyday life. With the prize funding, Dr. Grauman and her interdisciplinary team will develop new methods for AI to perceive human movement, reason across time, and deliver personalized feedback. Their innovations will power AI coaching systems on smart glasses, assisting users in contexts such as physical therapy, sports training, and household repairs. This project lays the foundation for AI that goes beyond observation to instruction, offering a transformative approach to skill development and accessibility.

Biological Sciences: Susan M. Rosenberg, Ph.D., Ben F. Love Chair in Cancer Research and Professor of Molecular & Human Genetics, Biochemistry & Molecular Pharmacology, and Molecular Virology & Microbiology, Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine

Dr. Rosenberg’s proposal was chosen for the 2026 Hill Prize in Biological Sciences for her groundbreaking strategy to combat antibiotic resistance by targeting the evolutionary process itself. Antibiotic resistance is a global health crisis, causing millions of deaths and making once-routine infections life-threatening. Conventional strategies focus on developing new antibiotics, but bacteria evolve resistance faster than new drugs can be developed – leaving current approaches increasingly unsustainable. Dr. Rosenberg’s team is pursuing a novel solution: discovering drugs that inhibit the bacterial stress responses that drive mutation and survival during antibiotic treatment. These “evolution-slowing” drugs reduce the emergence of resistant strains and improve infection clearance. Early studies identified two promising compounds, including one already FDA-approved. Her team will utilize the prize funding to screen a 14,000-compound drug library to identify additional candidates, study their mechanisms and test their ability to boost antibiotic effectiveness in animal models. The long-term goal is to move successful candidates into clinical trials, beginning with veterans suffering from recurrent infections. This work has the potential to extend the utility of existing antibiotics and transform the way bacterial infections are treated worldwide.

Dr. Halas, Dr. Nordlander and Dr. Robatjazi’s proposal was selected for the 2026 Hill Prize in Engineering to advance light-driven technologies for sustainable ammonia synthesis. Ammonia is essential for global agriculture as fertilizer and is emerging as a promising hydrogen carrier and fuel for maritime and land transport. Today, its production relies on the fossil-fuel-intensive Haber–Bosch process, which consumes vast energy resources and generates significant greenhouse gas emissions. Building on their groundbreaking work in antenna-reactor photocatalysts — nanoscale systems that capture light and use photon energy to drive chemical reactions — the team will design and demonstrate highly specific catalysts and prototype photoreactors that enable ammonia synthesis under mild conditions, without external heating or emissions. This approach dramatically lowers activation barriers for industrial reactions, opening the door to decentralized, point-of-use applications with electrically switchable control not possible in conventional thermal processes. With support from the Hill Prize, the team will improve light-driven catalysts for converting nitrogen into ammonia, refine prototype reactors for practical deployment and partner with industry collaborators to advance larger-scale applications. By completing the nitrogen cycle with light‑based ammonia synthesis, this innovation has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and expand access to clean fertilizer and energy solutions worldwide — driving a more sustainable future.

Medicine: Raghu Kalluri, M.D., Ph.D., Professor, Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center

Dr. Kalluri was chosen for the 2026 Hill Prize in Medicine for developing eye drops to treat age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and other posterior eye diseases. AMD is the leading cause of vision loss globally, and current treatments rely on direct injection of anti-VEGF drugs into the eye. Dr. Kalluri engineered exosomes to treat AMD and formulated them as eye drops, demonstrating their ability to fully penetrate the eye and reach the retina. This non-invasive delivery system is designed to replace standard intravitreal injections, which are costly and carry risks including infection and retinal damage. Dr. Kalluri and his team engineered the exosomes to carry VEGF-targeting siRNA (iEVVEGF), which was effectively delivered to the damaged retina, achieving vascular repair in preclinical models. The eye drop treatment showed equivalent or superior effectiveness to current FDA-approved therapies at a fraction of the dosage and cost. The team has also built a scalable, GMP-grade manufacturing pipeline for clinical translation. Dr. Kalluri will utilize prize funding to accelerate IND-enabling studies and support testing for additional ocular conditions. Dr. Kalluri’s innovation has the potential to disrupt standard ophthalmic care by providing a safe, affordable, and self-administered alternative to intraocular injections.

Co-Recipient: Matthew Stone, Managing Director, Teysha Technologies

Dr. Wooley and Mr. Stone’s proposal was chosen for the 2026 Hill Prize in Physical Sciences for innovative research that transforms agricultural waste into safe, degradable plastics and chemicals. Their work directly addresses the global challenge of replacing toxic, petroleum-derived materials – such as bisphenol A (BPA) – with sustainable alternatives. Dr. Wooley and her team have developed patent-pending chemistry that converts sugars and natural phenolic compounds into BPA analogs designed to safely degrade after use. These new materials match or exceed the performance of traditional plastics while eliminating long-term environmental and health risks. The team will use the prize funding to scale production, optimize chemical processes and purchase critical equipment to accelerate translation from lab to market. In collaboration with Teysha Technologies, founded by Mr. Stone, they aim to develop commercially viable alternatives to conventional plastics. The Hill Prize will accelerate the development of these next-generation polymers that are safer for people and the planet.

Dr. Matsui’s proposal was chosen for the 2026 Hill Prize in Public Health for identifying climate change-related environmental exposures – specifically extreme heat and air pollution – as key contributors to adverse maternal and birth outcomes and associated disparities. The U.S. continues to see rising rates of preterm birth, infant mortality and pregnancy complications, with Texas experiencing particularly sharp increases. Despite this public health crisis, there are currently no effective primary prevention strategies. Dr. Matsui and her multidisciplinary team will use the prize funding to generate high-resolution, actionable data that links the timing and types of heat and air pollution exposure to specific maternal and infant health risks. Her team has already secured statewide birth data and will combine it with fine-scale environmental data to uncover how these exposures contribute to racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities. The outcome aims to establish a foundation for testing prevention strategies – ranging from individual-level interventions to policy changes – that could significantly reduce poor pregnancy outcomes and close health equity gaps.

Mr. Swogger, Dr. Bosnyak and Mr. Krupp’s proposal was chosen for the 2026 Hill Prize in Technology for addressing critical environmental and safety concerns related to tire performance and chemical toxicity. A key ingredient in nearly all tires – 6PPD – has been linked to aquatic toxicity and potential human health risks, yet it remains essential for preventing ozone-related cracking in rubber compounds. Mr. Swogger and his team will use the prize funding to advance the development and commercialization of MOLECULAR REBAR® (MR), a patented carbon nanotube technology that replaces 6PPD without compromising tire durability or safety. Working with leading industry partners, the team will formulate and test full-size prototype tires using this safer alternative. The new compounds will maintain crack resistance, improve performance and significantly reduce the environmental impact of tire wear. Additionally, the team will use these new compounds during tire trials to validate previous findings that the use of MR reduces the most breathable and hazardous particles (PM2.5, PM10) generated during tire wear- improving the safety profile of tire wear particles. This breakthrough paves the way for a new generation of eco-conscious, high-performance tires, addressing both regulatory pressure and sustainability goals across the global tire industry.

Bill would create Strategic Resilience Reserve for minerals

Seven-person board would govern stockpile's operations

Minerals would be stored in warehouses around US

Measure could spark Western price structure for minerals

Bill seeks to counter Chinese dominance of key minerals

Jan 15 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers on Thursday introduced a bill to create a $2.5 billion stockpile of critical minerals, a move aimed at stabilizing market prices and encouraging domestic mining and refining.

The bill marks Washington's latest attempt to offset what policymakers view as Chinese manipulation of prices for lithium, nickel, rare earths and other critical minerals - vital for items from electric vehicles to high-tech weaponry - that has stymied American mining companies for years.

A China-generated glut of lithium, for example, led North Carolina-based Albemarle (ALB.N), opens new tab to pause U.S. expansion plans in 2024. The Pentagon became the largest shareholder in Nevada-based rare earths company MP Materials (MP.N), opens new tab in July amid intensifying Chinese competition.

The 68-page bill says China has moved to ""weaponize its influence over prices and volumes in the contest for access to critical minerals.""

BILL AIMS TO 'INSULATE U.S. FROM FOREIGN THREATS'

China has rejected assertions that it manipulates the market for critical minerals, saying in November it is committed to ""upholding the security and stability of global production and supply chains.""

To become law, the measure must pass the House of Representatives and the Senate and be signed by President Donald Trump.

The bill would create a Strategic Resilience Reserve with a seven-person board, modeled on the Federal Reserve's governance structure, which would oversee the fund.

Members, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, would be tasked with buying minerals considered critical by U.S. agencies and stockpiling them at warehouses across the country. The board would need the technical expertise to ensure the minerals are stored properly. Certain lithium derivatives, for example, emit hydrogen when exposed to water.

The bill prioritizes recycled material, but minerals extracted from mines would be eligible. Allied countries would be able to join the reserve if they contributed at least $100 million.

Minerals could be sold for private-industry or defense purposes. Any profit would be used to buy more minerals and keep the stockpile active in perpetuity.

""Providing targeted investments and stockpiling key inputs will help insulate the U.S. from foreign threats and will provide a significant - and cost effective - boost to the U.S. economy,"" said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Senator Todd Young, an Indiana Republican, co-sponsored the legislation. Representative Rob Wittman, a Virginia Republican, introduced the same measure in the House.

The reserve's board would have flexibility over how to buy minerals, according to Senate aides. It could, for example, agree to pay twice the existing market price for rare earths - a market dominated by China - if such purchases supported U.S. mines.

Many niche-but-essential minerals on which Beijing has imposed export controls are not traded or lightly traded, sparking a push for minerals prices not tied to Chinese production.

""It's certainly possible this reserve could create a Western price for certain critical minerals,"" a Senate aide said.

Group of Seven finance ministers this week discussed floors for minerals prices. Trump on Wednesday said U.S. over-reliance on other nations for critical minerals is a national security threat.

Australia is also developing its own critical minerals reserve.

Meeting that challenge will require discipline, market-driven solutions and a firm commitment to policies that strengthen, not restrict, the state’s energy supply.

Missouri consumes far more electricity than it produces. As demand increases from advanced manufacturing, agricultural processing and new technologies, and as older power plants retire, expanding in-state generation is no longer optional. It is essential to maintaining economic competitiveness and grid reliability.

That is why proposals to impose moratoriums on utility-scale solar are deeply misguided. A moratorium does not stop demand, it limits supply. When government restricts supply, prices rise. Blocking the lowest-cost and fastest-to-build source of new generation forces Missouri to rely more heavily on expensive, out-of-state power and volatile wholesale markets, directly increasing electricity costs for ratepayers.

The consequences extend well beyond utility bills.

Companies considering investments in Missouri look closely at energy availability and price stability. Advanced manufacturers and agricultural processors cannot expand, or even operate, without dependable, affordable electricity. Artificially constraining generation through a solar moratorium creates an energy shortage by government decree, putting Missouri at a competitive disadvantage to neighboring states that are expanding supply and welcoming investment.

Solar development has already proven its value in Missouri. More than $1.1 billion has been invested, generating $3.7 million in state and local tax revenue that supports schools, public safety and infrastructure, without raising taxes. In rural communities, these projects provide stable, long-term revenue at a time when family farms face increasing economic pressure.

Equally important, solar respects private property rights. Farmers and landowners who voluntarily choose to host projects are exercising their right to use their land productively, strengthen their operations, and diversify income. A blanket moratorium replaces individual choice with government control, undermining the principles of property rights and free enterprise that Missouri conservatives have long defended.

Solar energy is not a government mandate or a political statement; it is a practical tool. It is affordable, reliable, and can be brought online quickly to meet rising demand. Expanding solar strengthens grid resilience, keeps energy dollars in Missouri and reduces dependence on outside suppliers.

Missouri’s success has always been driven by innovation, private investment and respect for property rights, not by government-imposed scarcity. As lawmakers consider the state’s energy future, they should reject moratoriums and embrace market-based solutions that lower costs, protect landowner rights, and ensure Missouri has the power it needs to grow.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Panels2-scaled-e1768426687144-2048x1229.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 13:00:50.199252

House Republicans appear to be united over the eminent domain ban, despite the differences from the Senate.","A bill that would prohibit the acquisition of land via eminent domain for carbon sequestration pipelines in Iowa advanced Wednesday from a House committee.

House Study Bill 507 is one of several expected bills related to property rights and carbon sequestration pipelines expected in the 2026 session.

Opponents of the bill said it would kill the proposed Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline which, according to lobbyists for the company, already has more than 1,400 easements with willing landowners for the pipeline.

Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, sponsored the bill and said it protects Iowans’ “fundamental right” to private property.

“Eminent domain should be incredibly rare and must meet the constitutional requirement of a public use,” Holt said.

Proponents of the bill said it is a simple bill, unlike the bill that Gov. Kim Reynolds vetoed last year that would have restricted the use of eminent domain by CO2 pipeline operators.

A group of Republican lawmakers have been vocal in their opposition to the carbon sequestration project, which was granted the right of eminent domain by the state utilities commission in 2024. The House passed a similar bill in 2025 to ban the use of eminent domain by carbon capture pipelines, but the Senate did not take up the bill.

Rep. Ross Wilburn, D-Ames, expressed hesitancy advancing the bill Tuesday during a subcommittee meeting on the proposed legislation, because of the Senate’s inaction on the similar bill last year and the governor’s veto.

Wilburn reiterated his concern Wednesday, noting that Reynolds was “silent” on the issue of eminent domain and property rights during her Tuesday Condition of the State address.

“So when I say nothing has changed, the political conditions around this have not changed,” Wilburn, who was one of two no votes on the bill, said.

Holt responded that neither the House nor the Senate can control what the governor does, nor can the two chambers control one another.

“What we do is, we do what is right and we move forward and who knows what dynamics might change,” Holt said.

In addition to bringing tax credits associated with the ultra-low carbon ethanol market, lobbyists for Summit argued in the subcommittee Tuesday the pipeline project would also be an economic opportunity for Iowa due to tax credits for enhanced oil recovery that were recently made available in the federal “big beautiful” law.

Ethanol producers would have access to 45Z tax credits for producing the low carbon fuel by sequestering carbon dioxide into the pipeline. The carbon sequestration pipeline would be eligible for 45Q tax credits as it transports the carbon to underground storage and now, as that carbon is strategically pumped underground to increase the efficiency of oil wells.

Holt said the Summit project is not a public use project, but “an economic development project.”

Holt said public use refers to infrastructure projects like roads, schools or essential energy projects that are “convenient and necessary.”

“The use of government power to seize property for a private economic development project is not constitutional,” Holt said.

Senate leadership has also indicated it plans to file a bill that would address the property rights issue by allowing pipeline operators to deviate from their state-approved routes in order to find willing landowners.

House Republicans appear to be united over the eminent domain ban, despite the differences from the Senate. The only other dissenting vote on the bill in committee Wednesday came from Rep. Rick Olson, D-Des Moines.

House Speaker Pat Grassley said in a Wednesday taping of “Iowa Press” that the House’s narrow eminent domain bill was rolled out early on to show that “it still is something that we really care about.”

Grassley said the fact that the Senate is working on its own bill is a “positive sign towards finding some level of resolution.”

“For the last several years, it’s just been bill after bill from the House’s perspective, heading over to the Senate,” Grassley said. “Regardless if we agree with one another, I think it’s a positive step forward … that there’s actual movement on both sides.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-83/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_0145-1024x6831768435481.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=EOdvzc_J,N,,2026-01-15 11:03:45.090519

[1] The OBBBA impacted baseline federal health spending projections since CBO’s January 2025 Budget and Economic Outlook.","Republicans won in 2024 in part by vowing to lower the cost of living through restraining federal spending, and ending policies that drive up prices.

Reconciliation is a powerful policy tool for realizing those goals and delivering results for the American people. As House Budget Committee Chairman Jody Arrington put it, “You do the right thing, and the people will reward you for it.”

Republicans have also shown discipline by allowing the pandemic-era expansion of Obamacare subsidies to expire, even amid vocal pressure from some in the conference to extend the policy. That decision avoided locking in a massive new $488 billion entitlement.

Republicans should build on that victory with a second reconciliation bill that focuses on where Congress can move the needle most: health care and welfare. Health care programs are the biggest drivers of federal spending growth, while federal welfare programs have proven disturbingly vulnerable to waste and fraud.

The primary goal for reconciliation 2.0 must be spending cuts. The first package made real progress on growth and affordability, but increased deficits significantly. A second bill that fails to deliver large, durable deficit reduction is worse than doing nothing.

What follows is a menu of health care, welfare, and related tax changes that would reduce spending and deficits, and show that Republicans are serious about restraining federal spending, reining in welfare abuse, and improving health care affordability by removing government-created distortions. Figures are 10-year deficit-reduction estimates, relative to the current-law baseline. Estimates of budgetary savings, therefore, do not necessarily indicate reductions in federal spending.

Obamacare

Repeal the Affordable Care Act

Obamacare doubles or triples premiums for most enrollees, reduces plan choice, and creates incentives to restrict access to care for the sick. Repealing the ACA would reduce federal spending, restore the freedom of individuals to make their own health insurance and health care decisions, reduce premiums for most individuals by 50 percent or more, force insurers to compete on and improve quality, reduce federal deficits and debt, reduce political conflict, and devolve authority over government assistance for the sick to the states, as the US Constitution provides.

Make Obamacare relief universal and permanent

When Obamacare restricted access to affordable coverage, Presidents Obama and Trump provided relief by removing barriers to Obamacare-exempt plans. The Congressional Budget Office found such plans offer comprehensive coverage at premiums about 60 percent lower than the cheapest Obamacare options. Making both types of relief universal and permanent would expand affordable insurance without expanding Obamacare. In addition, doing so would move on-budget many of the implicit taxes and subsidies that Obamacare currently places off-budget.

Reduce Obamacare Spending by Reducing Benchmarks

Obamacare uses the premium for a “benchmark” health insurance plan—currently, the second-lowest-cost silver plan available to an individual—to calibrate an eligible individual’s premium subsidy. Anything that reduces the benchmark—e.g., capping benchmarks at 125 percent of the national average for second-lowest-cost silver plans, or designating lower-cost bronze or catastrophic plans as the benchmark—would reduce spending on Obamacare premium subsidies.

Require Minimum Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments toward premiums

Benchmark-plan premiums are often so high that they yield subsidies that completely insulate enrollees from having to pay any of the premium for certain plans. Reducing Obamacare subsidies in a manner that requires all enrollees to pay at least something toward their premiums would reduce federal spending both directly (by reducing premium subsidy amounts) and indirectly (by reducing the ability of fraudsters to secure subsidies for “phantom” enrollees).

Medicaid

Consolidate Medicaid and CHIP into One Zero-Growth Block Grant ($4.4 trillion)[1]

Congress should consolidate Medicaid and CHIP into a single, fixed block grant set at $342 billion for FY 2026 with a zero percent annual growth rate. This would eliminate the existing matching-grant system that encourages states to overspend, ignore fraud, and shift costs to federal taxpayers.

Repeal Excess Funding for Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion ($604 billion)[2]

Obamacare gives states seven times more money when they spend on able-bodied adults versus vulnerable Medicaid enrollees (disabled adults, pregnant women, and children). Reducing Obamacare‘s 90 percent “enhanced” matching rate to each state’s standard matching rate (FMAP) would save taxpayer money and end this perverse incentive.

Reduce Medicaid Subsidies to Wealthy States ($667 billion)[3]

Federal law specifies a minimum amount of federal dollars that wealthy states receive for each dollar they spend on Medicaid. If Congress retains Medicaid’s perverse matching-grant system, legislators should eliminate that “floor,” which would require high-income states to pay for a larger share of their Medicaid programs. This change would reduce federal spending and encourage fiscal discipline in the wealthiest states with the most expensive programs (California, New York, Massachusetts, etc.).

End Medicaid Financing Scams ($386 billion)[4]

States use various financing scams—e.g., provider taxes, intergovernmental transfers, and certified public expenses—to capture federal Medicaid dollars without sacrificing anything to fund their programs as federal law envisions. These shell games are a form of legal Medicaid fraud and encourage states to turn a blind eye to other frauds. The only way to eliminate Medicaid financing scams is to eliminate Medicaid’s matching-grant system, such as by adopting block grants. Until then, Congress should at least try to eliminate states’ ability to game the matching-grant system.

Medicare

Cut Medicare spending, cap spending growth, and convert Medicare into a cash-transfer program

Medicare encourages waste, fraud, and excessive prices because politicians, bureaucrats, and enrollees do not spend government money as carefully as their own. Congress should cut baseline Medicare spending and convert Medicare into a Social Security–style cash-transfer program that sends risk and income-adjusted “Medicare checks” directly to enrollees. These changes are compatible with any level of baseline spending reduction. Research suggests roughly one-third of Medicare spending provides no health benefit, which implies that Congress could cut spending by that amount without harming enrollee health. These changes are also compatible with any limitation on the growth of total Medicare spending. Medicare spending currently grows faster than GDP. Congress should limit program growth to a sustainable measure, such as chained CPI.

Other Medicare Savings Options:

The foregoing proposals would deliver durable savings by directly reducing baseline Medicare spending and spending growth, while weakening the health care industry’s incentives to lobby for reversing those cuts. By contrast, the following proposals rely on technocratic formulae and bureaucratic mechanisms that the industry can readily game, making the resulting savings uncertain and politically fragile. Even though eliminating deficits requires far deeper cuts than these, Congress should pursue every effort to reduce Medicare spending.

Increase Medicare premiums for high-income enrollees ($1.2 trillion)[5]

Medicare currently subsidizes wealthy seniors who do not need assistance. High-income enrollees already pay higher premiums than other enrollees. But these requirements only apply to about 8 percent of enrollees, and taxpayers still subsidize up to 65 percent of those enrollees’ physician spending. Congress should expand means-testing to more high-income enrollees and for those it already affects.

Cut “benchmark” subsidies to Medicare Advantage plans ($615 billion)[6]

The formula for calculating Medicare Advantage subsidies to private health insurance companies begins with setting a “benchmark” subsidy level. Research suggests the benchmarks Medicare Advantage uses result in wasteful spending. Reducing those benchmarks would reduce excessive subsidies and encourage Medicare enrollees to choose more efficient private plans.

Cut “risk adjustment” subsidies to Medicare Advantage plans ($1.32 trillion)[7]

The additional “risk adjustment” subsidies that compensate private insurance companies for high-cost Medicare Advantage enrollees are also excessive. Medicare Advantage pays more for each additional patient diagnosis that private health insurance companies submit. “Fee-for-diagnosis” payment creates incentives for insurance companies to submit unnecessary diagnoses. MedPAC estimates that the cumulative effect of “baseline” and “risk adjustment” subsidies is that Medicare Advantage costs taxpayers 20 percent more per enrollee than traditional Medicare, or $84 billion per year. Projections indicate that a 20 percent across-the-board cut in risk-adjustment subsidies would reduce 10-year Medicare Advantage spending by more than $1 trillion below baseline.

Expand enrollee cost-sharing in traditional Medicare ($195 billion)[8]

Traditional Medicare provides more comprehensive coverage than enrollees would likely choose on their own, making them less price-sensitive when consuming medical care. This leads enrollees and providers to waste taxpayer resources on low-value medical care. Increasing enrollee cost-sharing would reduce wasteful Medicare spending by making enrollees more price-conscious.

Reduce Medicare subsidies for hospital “bad debt” ($60 billion)

Medicare reimburses hospitals for some unpaid beneficiary cost-sharing, which encourages excessive prices and shifts expenses to taxpayers that patients could cover themselves. Reducing these subsidies would reduce those perverse incentives and reduce Medicare spending relative to the baseline.

Reduce Medicare subsidies for graduate medical education (GME) ($110 billion)

Medicare currently issues two separate types of GME subsidies. The Congressional Budget Office projects that total spending on GME subsidies will grow at an annual rate of 7 percent over the next decade. Consolidating the two types of subsidies into a single grant program and limiting spending growth to one percentage point below inflation would increase incentives for hospitals to be cost-conscious and reduce Medicare spending by roughly $11 billion per year.

Reduce excessive Medicare prices for hospital outpatient services ($180 billion)[9]

For the same services, Medicare sets and pays higher prices to hospital outpatient departments than to lower-cost physician offices. These distortions encourage hospitals to acquire physician practices. Reducing these excessive Medicare-set hospital prices—which some call “site-neutral payment”—could reduce Medicare spending relative to baseline by $180 billion over the next decade.

Reduce excessive Medicare prices for “340B” drugs ($85 billion)[10]

Medicare sets and pays much higher prices for pharmaceuticals than necessary. Projections suggest that cutting the Medicare prices for so-called “340B” drugs by 27 percent would reduce Medicare spending over the next decade by $85 billion below baseline.

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

Devolve SNAP Funding to the States ($404.34 billion with a ten-year phaseout, or $628.90 billion with a five-year phaseout[11]

Waste, fraud, and abuse are ongoing problems in SNAP because the program is funded almost entirely by the federal government. Consequently, states have little incentive to constrain costs, reduce improper payments, or improve participant outcomes to minimize dependency. Congress should gradually devolve the federal government’s share of SNAP’s total costs to the states, empowering them to assume full responsibility for their nutrition assistance programs. This would give states the authority and the accountability to design programs that best meet their constituents’ needs, and a direct financial stake in ensuring they manage their programs effectively.

Eliminate Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE) ($100 billion)

States can use BBCE to make households categorically eligible for SNAP if they receive certain non-cash TANF benefits, including minimal services such as pamphlets or hotline referrals, even if they fail to meet the program’s statutory income and countable asset requirements. Eliminating BBCE would help enforce SNAP’s statutory eligibility standards and close a loophole that states have used to draw federal taxpayer dollars to pay for benefits for those the program wasn’t originally designed to help.

Rescind the 2021 Thrifty Food Plan Reevaluation ($274 billion)

The OBBBA did not rescind the USDA’s 2021 Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) reevaluation, which violated a 45-year precedent by increasing TFP’s cost beyond inflation, increasing benefits by 23 percent without congressional approval. Undoing this unlawful, partisan expansion will save billions of taxpayer dollars and reinforce Congress’s role as the primary decision-maker over SNAP’s size and scope.

Health Care Tax Changes

End the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance (higher revenues: up to $6 trillion)[12]

The tax exclusion promotes excessive health coverage, excessive prices, wasteful health care spending, and huge gaps in coverage. Ending the exclusion would provide trillions of dollars in new revenue that Congress could apply to deficit reduction and/or use to lower marginal tax rates. Ending the exclusion would further reduce excessive medical prices and eliminate the implicit tax penalties that compel workers to let employers control $1 trillion of their earnings each year in the form of health insurance benefits. Workers would lose a portion of that $1 trillion to taxes, and labor markets would return the remainder to workers largely in the form of higher cash wages. Short of full elimination, Congress could cap the exclusion.

Enact tax-free Universal Health Accounts (UHAs)

An alternative approach could let workers control nearly all of that $1 trillion in earnings and restore workers’ freedom to make their own health decisions. Universal health accounts (UHAs) would convert the exclusion and all other existing health-related tax preferences into a single tax exclusion for deposits into worker-owned, tax-free UHAs. Congress could set UHA deposit limits at levels that would achieve revenue- and deficit-neutrality or deficit reduction. Finally, Congress would let patients use UHA funds to purchase any health insurance plan from any source, tax-free. UHAs would make health care more universal—better, more affordable, more equitable, and more secure.

Other Tax Changes

Repeal the Earned Income Tax Credit (budget savings: $800 billion; higher revenues: $7.9 billion)[13]

The Earned Income Tax Credit is a “refundable” tax credit for low-income workers intended to encourage labor force participation and reduce poverty. The non-refundable portion of the credit will reduce recipients’ tax liabilities (and federal revenues) by $7.9 billion over the 2026-2035 period. The refundable portion is cash that the federal government sends to eligible individuals. Over the same period, the refundable portion of the credit will trigger $800 billion in federal spending. In practice, the credit is highly complex, generates large improper payment rates, creates work disincentives as benefits phase out, and causes other economic distortions that may outweigh the benefits.

Repeal the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (higher revenues: $194.8 billion)

The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit subsidizes developers and investors to finance housing for low-income households. The program is costly, administratively complex, and prone to corruption, with most of the subsidy captured by investors and intermediaries rather than meaningfully lowering housing costs or expanding housing supply for low-income residents.

Repeal the New Markets Tax Credit (higher revenues: $14.4 billion)

The New Markets Tax Credit was intended to spur private investment in low-income communities by offering tax credits to investors. After 25 years and more than $76 billion in authorized credits, the evidence suggests that most subsidized projects would have occurred anyway, the benefits largely accrue to investors and financial intermediaries, and the program’s complexity makes it an inefficient tool for economic development.

Repeal the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit (higher revenues: $6.5 billion)

The Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit subsidizes investments in historic buildings. By subsidizing the preservation of smaller, old buildings over larger-occupancy new construction, the credit suppresses housing supply and raises housing prices, undermining affordability goals while distorting real estate investment decisions.

An Overdue Course Correction Congress Should Make Now

Republicans used the first reconciliation bill to advance minor welfare restraints to require work and strengthen program integrity after years of unchecked expansion. These changes targeted assistance toward the most vulnerable and discourage open-ended dependence.

Health care and welfare cuts offer Congress its best opportunity to do more—quickly, meaningfully, and through reconciliation. The proposals in this document would reduce federal spending and deficits, strengthen work incentives, reduce fraud, and make health care more affordable by correcting government-created distortions.

We construct an adjusted baseline based on CBO health spending projections, incorporating estimates of OBBBA’s Medicaid spending reductions (-$910 billion over 10 years). We then calculate savings from our block grant proposal by assuming that Congress holds Medicaid and CHIP spending flat at $342 billion between 2026 and 2035, reducing spending relative to our adjusted baseline by $4.4 trillion over ten years.

[4] Pre-OBBBA, CBO estimated that eliminating the provider tax “safe-harbor” threshold would save $612 billion over 10 years. OBBBA limited provider taxes, saving an estimated $226 billion. We take the difference between the two figures and estimate that fully eliminating the provider tax scam could generate $386 billion in savings. This is likely a significant undercount of possible savings, given the breadth of Medicaid financing scams.

House Bill 1002, a House Republican priority proposal, would reshape utility providers’ low-income customer assistance programs, block service shut-offs to such customers on dangerously hot days, put all ratepayers on predictable billing plans and refashion ratemaking into three-year plans outfitted with performance-based incentives.

“The goal … is to prioritize affordability for Hoosier ratepayers and ensure our utilities are maintaining transparent, cost-effective practices,” the bill’s author, Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler, R-Noblesville, said in a statement after Tuesday’s committee meeting.

“Any potential changes to the bill will align with those goals,” she continued.

Only testimony was taken in in the House’s utilities committee on Tuesday, with amendments and a vote expected next week.

Advocates like Delaney Barber Kwon of Indiana Conservation Voters thanked Shonkwiler for her work but suggested “further clarification in order for intent to match implementation.”

The legislation would require electricity suppliers under Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission jurisdiction that don’t already offer low-income customer help programs to do so by July. The companies would fund those offerings to at least half the amount they recovered from ratepayers under their IURC-approved energy efficiency programs in the most recent year.

Luke Wilson, the chief policy officer of the Indiana Office of Energy Development, estimated that could direct up to $30 million annually to low-income Hoosier households.

“That is a cost shift that is already in bills,” he added, “so ratepayers are not feeling additional impact.”

The provision encountered mixed testimony.

Danielle McGrath, president of the Indiana Energy Association, said lawmakers shouldn’t use that funding mechanism because the revenue varies by utility and by year, while Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, said it’s “more than adequate funding.”

Committee Chair Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, noted the money has to come from somewhere, lest the bill be caught up in the finance-focused House Ways and Means Committee.

Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, and others pushed for greater regulator oversight of the program requirements instead of leaving it largely up to the utilities themselves.

The legislation would require providers to notify customers of assistance programs on their websites. Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis, asked that the text also go directly on bills to better reach elderly ratepayers.

“My daughter is my parents’ IT support, so I appreciate your point,” Shonkwiler joked.

Another provision intended to ease the burden on low-income Hoosiers would mimic current policy banning winter electricity service shut-offs — from Dec. 1 to March 15 — to the summertime. A key difference, however, is the pause would be triggered by federal extreme heat warnings instead of taking effect across the hottest months of the year.

Pierce and customer advocates argued a months-based approach would be simpler to administer and benefit customers more.

“We need to be really careful (that) we just don’t pile up four months of debt on these people, and now they’re looking at trying to get reconnected, and the price is so high they can’t do it,” Soliday replied.

Debt fears also arose in detailed discussion over so-called budget billing plans, which promote predictability for customers by holding monthly bill amounts steady despite changes in usage. But when utilities settle up, shocked customers may find themselves on the hook for large sums.

“Families think they’re being on a program to help stabilize their finances, and they feel like they’re being preyed upon,” said Rep. Alex Burton, D-Evansville.

Pryor suggested a name change.

“I think part of what’s confusing the people is they hear ‘budget billing,’ and they think … there is a savings,” she said. “So, maybe, the word ‘budget’ needs to be changed to something that’s more reflective of what it really is.”

“It is confusing,” Soliday agreed. “… It doesn’t save you money. It saves you from spikes, is what it does. And some folks can endure spikes, and (for) others, it’s really painful.”

House Bill 1002 would require that every customer be put on such plans, but be given the ability to opt out. Utilities would settle up with participants at least twice a year, in an effort to avoid the sticker shock of a once-annual true-up.

Several witnesses recommended removing “at least” from the legislation to ensure true-ups don’t occur so often they erode the predictability budget billing is supposed to bring. Other suggestions included limiting implementation to just low-income customers, adding more detail on when the debt is due and pushing the effective day back from July.

Bill explores longer rate cycles, incentives

The measure would also switch up Indiana’s traditional ratemaking process by requiring utilities to pursue IURC approval of multi-year rate plans. The first year would be done “in the same manner” as now, while the second and third years would be based on projections.

Although Soliday said the intent was to make utilities file the same detailed information as is currently required, some warned the language may not be explicit enough.

Joe Rompala, representing the Indiana Industrial Energy Consumers, also testified there’s no mechanism to settle the difference between the projected data and what actually transpires.

“This helps ensure that customers are only paying for assets which have actually been put into service, and which are actually being used to serve them when rates go into effect,” Rompala said. “This upholds a longstanding legal principle which helps shield ratepayers from excessive investment, which generates no direct benefits to them.”

Pierce and several witnesses objected to language specifying that the multi-year rate plans operate “independently” of trackers — requiring that regulators consider them “separately.”

Trackers allow utilities to increase rates based on certain expenses they have.

Sam Carpenter, the executive director of the Hoosier Environmental Council, feared that could “undermine some of the cost-containment goals.” He asked for lawmakers to clarify the “interaction” between those mechanisms.

Soliday previously said some trackers may “disappear” if multi-year ratemaking is adopted, telling the committee, “I’ve had some (utilities) say to me, they may just drop (the Transmission, Distribution, Storage Improvement Charge) completely, because it works into the plan.”

The multi-year rate plans would be paired with new performance metrics and incentives tied to customer affordability and service restoration.

Several witnesses suggested incentivizing additional priorities, like reducing peak load demand or promoting environmental sustainability. Others asked that the incentives be tailored to specific utilities or said the proposed incentive range is too small to drive utility decision-making.

It’s unclear which chunks of the bill could get the biggest revisions.

“I appreciate everyone who testified in the committee today and expect any amendments put forth to reflect the valuable insights and feedback we continue to receive from experts, stakeholders and residential ratepayers,” Shonkwiler said.",http://indianaeconomicdigest.net/Images/Images/164493.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 11:03:50.918677

Funding for home energy efficiency upgrades, which are designed to lower household energy bills, was also eliminated by the current administration, the report says.","This month marks a year since President Donald Trump began his second term, and climate activists are highlighting how his policy changes have affected Georgia and its economy.

A new report from Climate Power, a nonprofit whose mission is to educate Americans about clean energy investments and fossil fuel pollution, said there has been an increase in household energy costs and decreases in clean energy jobs and investments as result of a number of actions taken by Trump.

“In just one year, Trump spiked energy bills from his all-out war on clean energy, decimated pollution protections, and placed us further at risk by playing politics with disaster aid and cutting our ability to predict and respond to extreme weather,” the report from Climate Power reads.

The report references studies and analysis from several outside sources such as the U.S. Energy Information Administration, as well as some in-house analysis from the Climate Power research team, painting a detailed picture of how much has changed since Trump took office in January of last year.

From September 2024 to September 2025, household electricity costs increased by more than 12% in Georgia, according to the U.S. EIA. On top of that, energy bills in the state are projected to increase by $110 by 2030 and $270 by 2035 due to clean energy cuts, according to Energy Innovation.

In addition, funding for home energy efficiency upgrades, which are designed to lower household energy bills, was also eliminated by the current administration, Climate Power said.

Trump’s clean energy cuts led to seven cancelled or delayed battery, solar and clean technology projects, resulting in the loss of more than 3,000 jobs and $4.4 billion in investment in the state, according to data cited in Climate Power’s report.

The Climate Power report attributes a range of policy actions to rising costs, lost jobs and environmental harm.

A key measure includes the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which gives tax breaks for pollutant-heavy fossil fuels while cutting clean energy programs, effectively raising household energy bills, according to the report.

“Trump’s cuts to federal clean energy tax investments are expected to reduce the build-out of new clean power generating capacity by 53% to 59% from 2025 through 2035,” the report reads. “Already, the U.S. has lost tens of thousands of megawatts of capacity that could have powered millions of homes, including: 658 MW of battery capacity, 149 MW of solar capacity and 24,152 MW of wind capacity.”

In tandem with moving away from clean energy investments, over 30 pollution protections have been gutted, resulting in the loss of an estimated $275 billion in annual societal savings from higher health care costs from poorer air and water quality, according to the report. It also links an estimated 30,000 additional premature deaths each year to increased air and water pollution, according to the report.

Funding for home energy efficiency upgrades, which are designed to lower household energy bills, was also eliminated by the current administration, the report says.

An estimated three-quarters of people who lost their homes in the fire didn’t have enough homeowners' insurance to cover rebuilding costs.
Before the Marshall Fire, they thought their homeowners' insurance was sufficient.","On May 20, 2024, tornado sirens blared throughout the small Eastern Plains town of Yuma as hail the size of baseballs thrashed trees and homes.

""Mother nature was brutal,"" said Keven Means.

The storm lasted less than an hour, but by the time it was over, residents were wading through ice-choked streets and the town of 3,400 was reeling.

Means, who was born and raised in Yuma, is a local contractor and has been working nonstop repairing homes since the storm. He estimates that 99% of roofs were destroyed, even the ones with the most hail-resistant building materials.

Yuma has experienced its fair share of hailstorms over the years, but this latest one exacerbated one issue in particular — the shaky state of homeowners' insurance.

“When our insurance renewed this year, it went up about $2,000,” said Megan Hansen, who lives in Yuma.

“There's a lot of insurance that won't cover this area,” said Julie Jamison. “We have to either stay with what we've got or there's a lot of people that can't afford the insurance.”

Stories like those from Yuma and the Marshall Fire have caught the attention of the Colorado legislature and Gov. Jared Polis. But they are wrestling with how best to get involved in the insurance marketplace, whether through regulation, incentives, or a little bit of both.

“We are in the most challenging property insurance market that we've seen in a generation,” said Carole Walker, an insurance industry lobbyist and head of the Rocky Mountain Insurance Association.

“So what we’ve really seen play out in Colorado is, unfortunately, a lot of pressure on the insurance marketplace here, which puts pressure on those individual homeowners,” she said.

Yuma’s experience is an extreme example of impacts being felt by homeowners across the state.

In the last five years, the average premium in the state has gone up 65%, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Colorado is now one of the top ten most expensive states in the country for homeowners' insurance.

Climate experts say that is partly a result of more frequent and damaging weather driven by a warming planet.

Dual catastrophe state

Florida is well-known for its hurricanes and floods — California for its earthquakes, mudslides and wildfires. But Colorado is no slouch in the natural disaster arena either. It’s what’s known in the insurance industry as a “dual-catastrophe” state dealing with both wildfires and hail. And Coloradans' love of nature contributes to the challenge.

Almost half of the state's population lives in what’s called the wildland urban interface — areas where homes and businesses butt up against forests and open spaces — making them vulnerable to wildfires. On top of that, the Front Range and Eastern Plains experience frequent hailstorms, some parts have earned the unenviable nickname “Hail Alley.”

Since 1980, Colorado has had more than 76 weather-related disasters — including fires, storms, hail and floods — that each caused more than $1 billion in damages. And it's getting worse — most of those disasters occurred in the past decade.

Climate change isn’t the only reason billion-dollar disasters are happening more frequently. More people live in Colorado now, and the cost of replacing buildings and property after disasters just keeps increasing.

Each disaster adds up for insurers — who pass those costs on to their policyholders. According to state figures, hail damage to homes is the biggest driver of those costs. On average, 60% to 70% of the amount of premium that people pay across the state is from hail risk, even in places that don’t get hail.

Escalating rates are something that state lawmakers, like Boulder Senator, Democrat Judy Amabile, have started really worrying about.

“When we talk about the cost of housing, we have to talk about insurance as part of that,” Amabile said. “That is absolutely becoming a significant part of somebody's monthly cost to own the home or to rent, because those costs are going to get passed through one way or another.”

Since 2007, rates in Colorado have gone up 233%, according to the Insurance Information Institute, and the rates are higher in Colorado than in states like California and North Carolina.

“It's a major crisis in Colorado and a number of other states, in that insurance costs for homeowners has gone up far above the rate of inflation,” said Gov. Jared Polis.

In addition to costs, Polis is worried about availability.

“We also have many homeowners who have a lot less choices, even some down to one choice, and to insure with less competition also means higher rates,” Polis said. “So it's become a major problem.”

Currently, Polis and Colorado’s Insurance Commissioner Michael Conway said they don’t think companies will wholesale leave the state.

“I'm concerned that some insurance companies may make choices not to write in certain parts of the state, not to provide coverage in certain parts of the state, and that will drive up the affordability challenges in those parts of the state,” said Conway.

That is already happening, as pockets of Colorado become insurance deserts.

Insurance agent Steve Hakes said companies are scaling back in certain zip codes.

“This one's actually Allstate,” Hakes said, pointing to a spreadsheet of zip codes in Boulder County. “You've got three columns of zip codes that are simply ineligible to be written in any of those particular areas.”

The FAIR plan

In 2023, state lawmakers, with broad bipartisan support, created state-backed coverage for properties at extreme risk of disaster that were rejected by three different insurance companies. It was an effort to stabilize the housing market, and the program officially launched in April.

The FAIR plan is more expensive than traditional insurance policies, and the payouts are also limited, capped at $750,000. If a home is worth more than that and it burns down, the Fair Plan would not cover all the losses.

The idea isn’t unique to Colorado. States like California and Washington first started offering plans like this in the late 1960s, and there are now FAIR plans in more than 30 states.

As of this December, eight months after the program’s launch, Colorado’s Fair Plan had sold about 140 insurance policies.

“When we started with the fair plan, our hope was that no one would ever need it,” said Amabile, who sponsored the legislation. “But we are already seeing that people do need it. And I would expect that number will grow dramatically in the next few months as people hear about the Fair Plan and as more insurance companies start to turn people down.”

Underinsurance

Despite the benefits, the FAIR Plan does raise the risk of underinsurance — and that’s a problem some homeowners with private insurance have faced for years.

The issue was front and center after the Marshall Fire in Boulder County, the state’s most destructive wildfire. An estimated three-quarters of people who lost their homes in the fire didn’t have enough homeowners' insurance to cover rebuilding costs.

That's exactly what happened to Manu Sobti, his wife Amita and their two children. They live in Superior, a suburb of Boulder, and moved into their house a decade prior. Before the Marshall Fire, they thought their homeowners' insurance was sufficient.

Manu remembers the day of the fire clearly. It was in late December 2021 that he and his family were on a beach vacation in Mexico, enjoying their kids’ winter break, when they started hearing that their subdivision was on fire.

“The early morning, we had breakfast, and suddenly the calls and texts start coming in that, ‘hey, man, where are you guys?’”

Manu and his family watched the whole thing unfold from the Ring camera at their house.

“Being that far away was definitely helpless. You couldn’t do anything.”

It turns out losing their home was just the beginning of a long and arduous saga. They decided to rebuild in the same location and stay in the community that they grew to love.

But as they re-built, they soon realized how underinsured they were. Manu said they ended up spending $1 million more than what their insurance paid — half for the rebuild, and half to replace all the items that burned in the home.

Manu said his insurance company treated him fairly, the company paid what he was owed under his policy, but it just didn’t come close to covering everything he lost.

“The concept of insurance is there. You feel safe. At least this covers you a bit, but it's still a big financial liability to be able to build back.”

The couple decided to build what’s called a passive house — a home that is more energy efficient and fire-resistant. While it costs more to build a passive house, Sobti said even if he hadn’t rebuilt his home that way, he would still be significantly underinsured.

Underinsurance is common. One study found that more than half of homeowners in California and Colorado are underinsured. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as not updating a policy after a big renovation; failing to include expensive items like jewelry or artwork in an insurance plan; and not adding supplemental coverage, known as extended replacement cost, into a policy in case rebuilding costs end up higher than expected.

After the Marshall Fire, lawmakers passed a bill to address underinsurance. It requires the state to create an annual report on estimated rebuilding costs and requires insurers to be more upfront about those costs in their policies. Insurance companies are also required to offer more comprehensive supplemental insurance options.

Policy solutions

Sufficient insurance is only one part of the puzzle — lawmakers are also trying to make insurance more affordable. One way to do that is through mitigation.

Gov. Polis had a proposal last legislative session to set up a grant program to help people buy hail-resistant roofs, often known in the industry as class 4 shingles.

“At the end of the day, the more hail-proof roofs we have, especially in the Eastern Front Range, Aurora, East Denver, the lower rates are going to be for everybody,” Polis said.

The bill would have set up a fund, paid for by a one percent fee on every homeowner's insurance policy. That money would have paid for two things: grants for hail-resistant roofs and money for insurers to help offset their losses in wildfire-prone areas.

The proposal didn’t garner enough support from state Republicans or Democrats. The big sticking point was the fee on homeowners to fund the program, amid concerns that it took too much money out of people’s pocketbooks.

The Polis administration plans to reprise this bill this session and potentially look at other ways to fund it. Democratic House Speaker Julie McCluskie of Dillon will be a main sponsor and said it’s a top priority made extra challenging by the lack of money in the state budget.

“We've just seen our revenues drop dramatically, and that means that these very important programs that we're trying to get off the ground, we've got to find funding and resources for them in other ways, and we're committed to doing that.”

Polis’ proposal for a roof enhancement program is an example of mitigation — the idea that people must be proactive to try to limit damage to their homes — and help reduce insurance claims.

“When we're talking about bringing down insurance premiums, I think what we really have to be talking about is how do we reduce the risk?” said Walker. Part of the effort is finding ways to get people to do the mitigation work.

“You need to do the mitigation. Your neighbor needs to do it, and then it needs to be at scale. Because we know for wildfire, fire doesn't care. It doesn't know any boundaries. So I think the commitment we need as a state is how can we put these mitigation programs in place?”

In 2025, Colorado passed a law requiring insurance companies to be more transparent about how they calculate rates in wildfire-prone areas. Companies are now required to explain different ways homeowners can mitigate to lower their wildfire risk, and potentially their rates.

Some communities in Colorado are already at the forefront of mitigation. Wildfire Partners, a Boulder County-run mitigation program, started a little more than a decade ago. Since then, it’s performed more than 4,000 home assessments. The county sends specialists to homes to work up a laundry list of actions to take, from creating a 5-foot buffer around the house to cleaning debris off the roof.

“Every year we have more and more interest from our residents as wildfire risk increases and people see on the news in Los Angeles or other fires from across the country. They recognize that with climate change and our new era of climate-driven wildfires, they need to take action,” said Wildfire Partners program manager Jim Webster.

Boulder’s program also offers a certificate to homeowners who have completed all of the necessary mitigation work — and that can be really important to insurance companies.

It ended up being critical for Nick Schneider and his wife Erica Ellingson, who live in a scenic valley just outside of the town of Lyons, surrounded by hills and prairie grass. They have a wooden house with cedar siding and knew they needed to take action to protect their property, but like a lot of people, they kept putting it off.

“I will admit it, I was the foot-dragger. I just didn't want to hear that we were going to have to, you know, pave the whole area around the house, cut down favorite trees or anything like that,” said Schneider.

But that all changed in December 2023 when their insurance company reached out.

“We got the letter from our insurance company that said: We will not renew your insurance because of the risk of wildfire. And so, of course, we panicked,” said Ellingson.

The couple turned to Wildfire Partners for help and put in long hours removing brush and grasses around the house and fortifying their wooden decks. They tackled the yard, but were still able to keep some of their favorite trees and have a beautiful garden.

They were also able to keep their insurance. Boulder County certified its work, and the insurance company renewed its policy.

That mitigation couldn't have come at a better time. Just a few months after mitigating, in July 2024, a wildfire known as the Stone Canyon Fire ripped right through their neighborhood.

“It was very surreal when I looked out the window, and I saw the trees on fire so close to the house. I couldn't believe it for a moment,” said Ellingson.

The wildfire approached the home from all sides, but the flames receded as they hit the defensible barrier.

The fire ended up taking five homes, but not Nick and Erica’s, and not any of the other nearby homes that Wildfire Partners certified as mitigated.

“If we hadn't gotten that kick in the pants from our insurance company, we wouldn't have dealt with [it] in time,” said Schneider.

Implementing large-scale mitigation programs and getting a lot of homeowners to do it, however, is not an easy task. It costs money, takes time (approximately 100 hours, according to Webster) and effort. In 2022, voters in Boulder County approved a tax to help fund the program, something that would be politically untenable in some parts of the state.

So far, the state said it has no immediate plans to mandate mitigation work or require insurance companies to offer a discount for doing it. But this is Polis’ last session — so it’ll likely be up to the next governor to decide if this is the direction Colorado should go.

Ellingson said their experience taught them that programs to make homes safer really work.

“For certain, our house would have been lost in that fire,” she said.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2026/01/DISASTER-INSURANCE-RATES-COURTESY-RMPBS-05.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 10:02:33.172157

Candy Cardwell, whose home is among those closest to the Smitty’s Supply plant, was packing up her life in Roseland when reached by phone Wednesday.","A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inspection of the Smitty’s Supply Inc. petroleum packaging plant in Tangipahoa Parish discovered hundreds of other chemical spills and hazards in areas unaffected by the August explosion and fire.

EPA officials detailed their findings in an inspection report that formed the basis of a consent order that requires the company to address violations inspectors documented during an Oct. 7 visit to the Roseland facility. The agency made the report public Tuesday, stating in a news release that inspectors found an estimated 250 damaged containers, 200 chemical spills and more than 300 containers of unlabeled or unidentified substances.

Clay Garside, a New Orleans environmental law attorney, said the findings depict a “horror show” unlike any he has seen. He is representing the advocacy group Louisiana Environmental Action Network in a lawsuit against Smitty’s Supply to ensure the company fully addresses the impact of the disaster.

“I’ve seen some pretty bad stuff but nothing this egregious,” Garside said.

Smitty’s Supply did not respond to a request for comment. It has filed its own lawsuit against the companies that made and maintained the tanks that exploded.

The EPA conducted the inspection a month and a half after the Aug. 22 Smitty’s Supply disaster sent millions of gallons of hazardous materials onto neighboring properties and pouring into waterways, including the Tangipahoa River.

The report includes alleged violations discovered in two undamaged warehouses that are the apparent focus of a related environmental crimes investigation, though the agency has said little about that case. The EPA Criminal Investigative Division, with assistance from the FBI, served a search warrant at the facility Nov. 18 that paused recovery operations near Warehouse 6 and Warehouse 10 for two days, according to information from other EPA records.

Records reveal federal criminal search warrant served at Smitty’s Supply

The October inspection was led by the EPA’s compliance division, which gathers evidence for the agency’s more common civil enforcement proceedings such as the administrative consent order.

According to its report, EPA inspectors found evidence of active and old chemical spills, many from unlabeled containers that were haphazardly stored. The containers included large 275-gallon totes, 55-gallon drums and 5-gallon buckets. Hundreds were found damaged, corroded, bulging, crushed, leaking, punctured, fallen or at risk of falling from high stacks or shelves.

Many containers had no labels except for rudimentary hand-written notes with vague warnings such as “Danger,” “Waste,” “Bad,” “Expired,” and in one instance “Do Not Touch must do Labs.” Some labeled with “Corrosive” placards had their tops cut open with oily liquids, trash and debris inside.

In one area of the facility called the Truck Stop, inspectors found a collection of drums with “Radioactive” placards, with yellow police crime scene tape wrapped around the barrels.

Oily liquids were found in open drums, buckets and other containers — many without lids or with pieces of cardboard serving as makeshift covers. Some open drums sat outside with unidentified oily liquids, trash and random discarded items inside. Others were in patches of grass with no containment area to prevent spills from escaping.

Many containers had spilled or were actively spilling chemicals at the time of the inspection, the records said. Some unlabeled containers were surrounded by weeds and visibly deteriorating, and others were surrounded by barren patches of soil saturated with an unknown oily material.

Some totes, which are large, plastic containers with metal support cages, appeared damaged, corroded or bulging with pressure. In one section of pavement used as an outdoor storage area, many unlabeled totes and drums were precariously stacked on top of others without the support of pallets and dangerously leaning over. Some stacks were leaning, and others had fallen over with puddles of chemicals on the ground nearby. None of the containers were labeled, except for one with the word “Bad” written on it.

In one warehouse, a 55-gallon drum of oil was roped off with red caution tape bearing the word “Danger.” The drum was sitting on a crushed wooden pallet next to sealed pallets of brake fluid.

Also inside of that warehouse was evidence of other spilled chemicals on the floor underneath totes and bulging containers. One tote contained an industrial form of concentrated hydrogen peroxide, a volatile chemical that can cause skin burns and explode under certain conditions.

Inspectors were unable to fully examine one storage area because its access points were blocked by a grease spill approximately 3 inches thick and spanning about 100 square feet, according to the EPA report.

In some cases, inspectors said Smitty’s Supply employees made half-hearted attempts to clean spilled chemicals by covering them with cardboard. Other spills were left untouched, forming puddles on the floors of warehouses and on the ground outdoors.

Animal tracks were found on the floor inside one of the warehouses, indicating wildlife had access to the space. The animal appeared to track an unknown white substance across the floor.

Bottled and packaged chemical products on shelves were leaking and in danger of tipping over.

Some incompatible products were hazardously stored together in the same area with one pallet of corrosive chemicals placed next to a pallet of flammable chemicals.

Sealed drums labeled “corrosive” had an unknown liquid leaking onto them, and totes of other corrosive chemicals were actively leaking onto the floor at the time of the inspection with no evidence of cleanup attempts.

Other findings included:

Concrete containment walls surrounding large permanent tanks had cracks with unknown liquids seeping through, some flowing offsite. There was no evidence of repairs, though someone had painted arrows on one wall to mark a crack.

A tote of sulfonic acid had a leaking spigot dripping its contents onto the floor of the facility’s grease plant. A worker had stuffed a rag in the spigot to try to plug the leak.

Grease tanks had pipes and valves caked with an accumulation of leaking contents.

Containers of open unidentified substances were stored at the top of a staircase.

Old lead-acid vehicle batteries were strewn randomly across the property. In one workshop, a collection of old batteries was leaking next to a pair of unlabeled compressed gas cylinders.

The report totals 230 pages, most showing photographic evidence of the findings.

Many of the containers looked old and weathered and as if they hadn’t been moved in years, while others looked as if they had been moved more recently possibly as part of the recovery operations following the Aug. 22 disaster, according to the photos in the report.

Although Smitty’s Supply voluntarily agreed to the EPA’s consent order, the company has neither admitted to or denied the allegations in the inspection report. The order doesn’t prevent the EPA from enforcing other allegations including any criminal allegations that might be under investigation.

Candy Cardwell, whose home is among those closest to the Smitty’s Supply plant, was packing up her life in Roseland when reached by phone Wednesday. Unable to go outside without becoming physically ill, Cardwell said she is moving to California this week.

“I never thought in a million years something like this would happen,” Cardwell said, adding that she hasn’t been able to sell her house.

The EPA’s inspection findings show a company with little regard for human life, she said.

“The owners have taken every opportunity in front of them and exploited it … to the extent that I question their ethical and moral standards,” Cardwell said. “And I think this has gone on for a long time.

“I think that the company has taken every shortcut, trying to maximize profits and putting their employees at risk and the residents in surrounding areas at risk with no qualms about what they were gonna destroy.”

STEM workforce.
The Capitol Hill visit highlighted how faculty advocacy can connect classroom and research experiences at Elon University to national conversations about innovation, economic growth, and workforce development.","In January 2026, Associate Professor of Mathematics Hwayeon Ryu traveled to Washington, D.C. to participate in #MathSciOnTheHill, a national advocacy event organized by the American Mathematical Society and 17 partner mathematical societies. The event brought together more than 290 mathematicians from across the United States to meet with members of Congress and their staff and to advocate for policies that strengthen STEM education and the U.S. STEM workforce through sustained federal investment.

Participants were organized into advocacy teams based on geographic location. Ryu and her team (of North Carolina 4th Congressional District) met with the offices of U.S. Senators Ted Budd and Thom Tillis through their legislative assistants and held an in-person meeting with U.S. Representative Valerie Foushee of North Carolina’s 4th Congressional District. In each meeting, Ryu participated in the discussions focused on STEM education and continued federal funding, through the National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Energy (DoE), and National Institutes of Health (NIH), to sustain and strengthen the U.S. STEM workforce.

The conversations emphasized that mathematics is foundational to nearly every STEM field, including artificial intelligence, biotechnology, cybersecurity, climate modeling and advanced manufacturing. While often operating behind the scenes, mathematical sciences provide the analytical framework that enables innovation across STEM fields. Federal support, such as NSF, ensures that students receive high-quality training in quantitative reasoning, data analysis, and interdisciplinary problem-solving—skills that are increasingly critical in a rapidly evolving economy.

As a faculty member at a primarily undergraduate institution, Ryu highlighted how her NSF-supported research directly benefits students from various STEM majors at Elon University. NSF funding allows faculty to engage undergraduates in authentic research experiences that integrate teaching and scholarship. Through these projects, students gain hands-on experience working with real data, computational models, and collaborative research teams. Many of her former and current students have gone on to graduate programs in STEM, federally funded research positions, or STEM careers in industry and healthcare, contributing directly to the national workforce pipeline.

The meetings also underscored the important role that primarily undergraduate institutions play in educating a diverse STEM workforce, including first-generation students and those from rural or underserved communities. Investments in NSF programs that support undergraduate research help expand access to STEM pathways and ensure that talent from a wide range of backgrounds is represented in the nation’s scientific workforce.

By participating in #MathSciOnTheHill, Ryu helped amplify a collective message from the mathematical sciences community: continued federal investment in mathematics education and research is a strategic investment in the strength, adaptability, and competitiveness of the U.S. STEM workforce.

The Kansas City Council will consider a change to the city’s zoning code at its meeting Thursday.","The green glass building at 1601 McGee towers over the Crossroads. It has sat empty since 2019, when the Kansas City Star closed its printing press there, and was once the Royals’ preference for a downtown ballpark.

Now the building is a data center. And it’s one of the first in the nation to receive a clean energy loan. Kansas City-based Patmos is undergoing a $1 billion retrofit of the 400,000-square-foot structure, which will also include office, event and conference space.

The company says retrofitting an existing building makes it cheaper, faster and more environmentally friendly to build. But critics say that doesn’t go far enough, and they argue AI data centers of all sizes need to be more regulated. The Kansas City Council is considering a change to its zoning law that would add more restrictions to data center developments.

Patmos received a $100 million commercial property assessed clean energy, or C-PACE, loan provided by PACE Loan Group, a private funding source. That’s the largest C-PACE loan granted in Missouri and one of the first in the country for a data center.

The loan will be used as financing to optimize the company’s HVAC system, which cools the data center load. That change should reduce the amount of electricity the center consumes over the 20 years of the loan agreement.

Josh Campbell, the executive director of Missouri Energy Initiative and administrator of Show Me PACE, said he thinks incentives like the clean energy loans could encourage data centers that are already planning to come to the state to be more energy efficient.

“My hope is that PACE loans can put that on their balance sheet, in their business plan, that they want to be more energy efficient,” Campbell said. “If this financing tool makes them look at it, then that's great.”

How a data center gets a clean energy loan

Joe Morgan, the chief operating officer at Patmos, said the data center is working to be a good neighbor to its Crossroads community. That includes making the decision not to put ventilation on the east side of the building so it wouldn’t impact the restaurants neighboring Patmos on Oak Street.

“It was important as part of this project that we pay our fair share and come in and not be a tax to the community by offsetting our stuff,” Morgan said.

C-PACE loans can only be used for parts of the project that save energy in some form. In Missouri, the loans are a public-private partnership through which the Show Me PACE board and staff approve projects requested by a property owner. Then, a private lending group loans the money, which is paid back over time through an additional line item on the developer’s property tax bill.

Campbell said he believes the loans will become more common for smaller data centers as that market grows.

Massive, hyperscale data centers like the ones by Google and Meta in Kansas City’s Northland likely won’t qualify for PACE loans. But Campbell said he hopes the financing tool will encourage other developers to use the loan to make their projects more energy efficient.

“What we're doing is trying to make sure that energy conservation is part of the conversation when any project is developed,” Campbell said. “That property will last longer, stay there better, produce more because their costs are lower, and they'll do so with a lower energy demand than they would have likely without PACE.”

More regulation for data centers

The rapid boom of data centers is putting a strain on the environment. The International Energy Agency predicts that electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to double by 2030, and climate pollution from the power plants that run them could more than double by 2025.

Communities across the country where data centers are built often complain about noise and the strain on utilities. And more than 230 environmental groups have written to Congress to ask for a nationwide moratorium on data centers that power AI.

There aren’t many other regulations or restrictions on data centers in Missouri. In fact, most data centers don’t have to pay sales tax on construction materials, machinery or equipment. Patmos did not receive financial incentives from Kansas City, but did get a sales tax break from the state.

Missouri’s and Kansas’ public service commissions recently approved a tariff on energy bills to large data centers that use more than 75 megawatts of peak load energy per month.

Though the utility tariffs include protections for residential rate payers, the staff report from the Missouri Public Service Commission notes that the large users still add to the overall system, which could increase costs.

Morgan said Patmos is committed to creating a mixed-use space that redevelops an existing building. The data center takes up a small part of the building, he said, and the rest will be dedicated to event and coworking spaces. Three companies have already begun to lease space in the building.

Morgan said the company is working with its engineering team to “ensure air, noise, and water demands are appropriately accounted for in our plans.” Patmos hasn’t conducted any environmental impact studies to see how the center will affect air and noise pollution or water demands.

Patmos also plans to use 12 diesel generators to power the center during peak energy times or when there’s a blackout. Morgan said they will be in a basement and shouldn’t have a large effect on noise in the neighborhood.

Ashley Sadowski serves on the Show Me PACE Clean Energy and Development Board and lives in Kansas City. She said PACE loans can be helpful to ensure that energy efficient measures are taken on big projects and to relieve the cost pressures that could affect other rate payers. But the loans can’t be prescriptive or make something like a data center completely environmentally friendly.

Environmental impact studies aren’t part of the review for PACE loans, and Show Me PACE can’t make demands from developers or factor in water usage or savings like the lending bodies can in other states.

Sadowski wants to see more regulation on data centers and thinks the city and other financial incentive bodies should tighten their restrictions before allowing them to be built.

“It is unclear how its (Patmos’) energy and water needs will impact others who are connected to the downtown district energy system,” Sadowski said. “I am glad to see the KC Star building utilized, but the Crossroads is an important neighborhood for our city, and we need to make sure surrounding residents and businesses are not harmed by this development.”

The city council will weigh in

More regulation could be coming. The Kansas City Council will consider a change to the city’s zoning code at its meeting Thursday. The change would limit where data centers could be located in the city and would require a review to ensure there’s adequate utility service for the projects when the council considers applications.

Morgan submitted a public testimony on behalf of Patmos in support of the zoning change.

“It's good for the community that they create some of these rules to make sure that they're good stewards of the citizens’ property,” Morgan said.

Some city council members also expressed interest in changing the city’s code to have more defined rules on the water and energy use of data centers.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a5b187a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+195/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe2%2F77%2F7aa1553f4f2b93823c38734b806c%2Fstar-building.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 10:02:09.198363

The proposed rule would revise a 2023 rule by former President Joe Biden’s administration on Section 401 of the Clean Water Act that gave states and tribes authority to protect waterways in their reviews of projects like pipelines and power plants requiring federal permits.

Biden’s rule replaced a rule from President Donald Trump’s first administration that limited the ability of states and tribes to block or force changes in the projects.

Jess Kramer, the EPA assistant administrator for water, told reporters the 2023 revision was “fundamentally flawed and it’s inefficient and ineffective.” Kramer said Biden’s revision led to lengthy certification timelines. The proposed rule, Kramer said, will lead to predictable permitting that would “unleash American energy dominance” and support emerging artificial intelligence infrastructure.

The 2023 rule had been praised by conservationists and environmental justice groups concerned about pollution effects on waterways and communities depending on them.

“Trump wants to allow fossil fuel companies to pollute our air and water with impunity, regardless of the consequences for our health or safety,” Cathy Collentine, a Sierra Club official, said in a release about the proposal.

Kramer said the proposed rule will ensure that Section 401 is “not weaponized by states to shut down projects for political purposes.” It would set timelines and standardize approaches that states and tribes use in water quality certifications that are required before the federal government issues project permits, the EPA said.

It was the latest move by Trump’s environmental agency to roll back Biden-era environmental rules while supporting development of energy including fossil fuels.

But it also demonstrated two hard truths about offshore wind and the wider push towards clean power.
First, the days when offshore wind got cheaper every year are over.
We are a very long way from the hopeful days of 2022 when offshore wind was still tumbling in price.
Something has to be built because several nuclear power stations will soon close, and a third of the gas power plant fleet is nearing the end of its life.","The government has defied gloomy price expectations for its latest auction for offshore wind capacity. The worry a few months ago was that bill payers would be forced to pay more than £100 a megawatt hour (MWh) via contracts that give developers guaranteed prices for their electricity output. In the event, winning projects landed at roughly £91/MWh.

Cue some forgivable crowing from Ed Miliband, the energy secretary. “A monumental step towards clean power by 2030,” he declared. Officials pointed to calculations by the energy consultants Aurora and Baringa that £94/MWh would have been a “cost-neutral” outcome for consumers even though today’s wholesale price, usually set by gas generation, is about £81/MWh (the analysts’ reasoning is that using less gas lowers the wholesale price, offsetting the cost of the subsidies for new windfarms).

But let’s not get carried away. Yes, this auction was Europe’s “biggest ever” in commissioning 8.4GW of capacity in one go – and it again proved the virtue of competitive tension in the bidding process. But it also demonstrated two hard truths about offshore wind and the wider push towards clean power.

First, the days when offshore wind got cheaper every year are over. The last auction at the end of 2024 bagged capacity at £82/MWh but those contracts were for 15 years. Miliband’s switch to 20-year contracts this time probably knocked £5/MWh off headline numbers, so a like-for-like comparison might score this year’s outcome at closer to £96/MWh. That equates to inflation of 17%. We are a very long way from the hopeful days of 2022 when offshore wind was still tumbling in price. Higher borrowing rates and tighter supply chains have changed the arithmetic.

The second point flows from the first: the rollout of offshore wind at these prices will not knock squillions off the price of electricity. Any downward pressure on bills cannot be enormous when we’re talking about the difference between £91 and a theoretically neutral price of £94. Yes, more renewables offer protection against spikes in the price of gas. But, remember, Wednesday’s inflation-linked prices are being locked in for 20 years in a system that already produces some of the highest electricity prices in the developed world.

Onshore wind and solar, where auction results are due in fortnight, should come in cheaper. But offshore, with its greater generating capacities, is the renewables workhorse. The consensus among energy analysts is that “whole system” savings from a renewables- and nuclear-heavy system will only start to appear sometime about 2040.

None of which should be read as an argument against offshore wind. Something has to be built because several nuclear power stations will soon close, and a third of the gas power plant fleet is nearing the end of its life. As Miliband pointed out, new gas plants aren’t cheap either, given bottlenecks in the supply of turbines – call it £147MW/h for building and operating one, says the energy department.

Instead, this auction has really demonstrated that we are deep in the world of trade-offs in energy transition. There are no more easy 2022-style pickings. Is it, for example, vital to hit Miliband’s target for clean power, defined as 95% generation from low-carbon sources, by 2030? Of course not. The deadline was always artificial.

As it is, the government is probably on course for 85%-90% after Wednesday’s auction. Why bother with the last bit if, as seems to be the case, the law of diminishing returns is setting in? Electricity also needs to be cheaper (or, at least, not even more expensive) to encourage the take-up of electric vehicles, heat pumps and so on.

Instead, the most pressing questions in energy-land are different. Is it possible to take a chunk out of the towering £80bn bill for rewiring the electricity grid? If 90% low-carbon is deemed enough, possibly, as retail energy suppliers have argued. Will new transmission cables arrive before the new windfarms are built? That is critical to keep a lid on “constraint” payments that run on to billions of pounds.

And what is the government’s plan for gas? It barely talks about the backup system for cold, windless winter days that will be retained. That is despite the scariest report out of the energy department in recent months being the one that warned of an “emerging risk” of running out of gas supplies by 2030 if an important piece of kit, such as a pipeline from Norway or an LNG terminal, were out of action.

Encouragingly, there are hints of greater pragmatism. Chris Stark, the head of “mission control” unit in the energy department, said the 2030 target for offshore wind is “on track” but it is “not essential” to hit it given the strong result in the latest auction; there is scope to be “choosy” on projects in future. Good.

For the next step, Miliband could say out loud what everybody already knows: the 2030 generation deadline can be ditched because 90% clean power is fine and bigger energy challenges lie elsewhere.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae194759ab246c9f9d80ac7ec6209888b31dd133/150_0_4639_3710/master/4639.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d68997253d3d0b4614a919d8f4110388",N,,2026-01-15 06:59:51.296393

Policy shifts are rapid, trade relations are uncertain, and investment decisions are increasingly shaped by the convergence of sustainability, fiscal incentives, and industrial policy.

Governments are deploying grants, subsidies, and targeted credits to secure critical industries, advance decarbonization, and retain investment at home.

The International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook projects global growth at 3.1% for 2026, a modest downgrade despite the recent wave of US tariffs and geopolitical tensions.

The IMF cautioned that this resilience may be temporary, as tariff rates remain high and inflationary pressures persist. Yet the broader message is clear: The world economy is adapting and changing, looking for more regional, strategically hedged networks.

Protectionism and Incentives

Across major economies, fiscal and trade policies are increasingly focusing on industrial competitiveness.

In the US, industrial and fiscal policy now move in lockstep. The Inflation Reduction Act and the massive 2025 tax-and-spending package offer production-linked credits, accelerated depreciation, and investment deductions for energy, semiconductors, and advanced manufacturing. Many credits are refundable or transferable, effectively operating as grants and improving liquidity.

These fiscal tools are supported by evolving import tariffs on steel, electric vehicles, and clean-tech components. This combination attracts global capital but adds uncertainty.

Tariff schedules and the 2025 tax-and-spending law provisions have changed several times, complicating project timelines and modeling. The US remains a major destination for industrial investment, yet multinational enterprises must factor in policy revisions and short implementation cycles.

In the EU, high energy and labor costs, plus a dense regulatory framework, continue to pressure competitiveness. One of the EU’s strategies is to turn decarbonization into an economic advantage. The Clean Industrial Deal and competitiveness compass aim to channel funding toward green manufacturing, circular-economy projects, and digitalization.

The Clean Industrial State Aid Framework, expected this year, will expand member countries’ ability to grant tax credits, accelerated depreciation, and direct funding for low-carbon projects. Additional programs such as the Innovation Fund, Important Projects of Common European Interest initiatives, and Horizon Europe complement this approach.

Meanwhile, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and EU Emissions Trading System seek to equalize carbon costs between EU producers and importers.

But simplification efforts under the omnibus legislative packages are bringing mixed results. Constant regulatory updates on key regulations such as the corporate sustainability reporting directive, corporate sustainability due diligence directive, and carbon border adjustment mechanism are creating uncertainty and this is only the beginning of a scheduled regulatory simplification wave.

Integrated data and full understanding of the supply chain is necessary to manage this complexity and access available funding streams.

Fiscal incentives, protectionist measures, and sustainability goals are now intertwined across these regions.

Pillar Two

The OECD Pillar Two framework was designed to end the global “race to the bottom” in corporate taxation by establishing a 15% minimum effective tax rate for large multinational groups. By late 2025, over 50 jurisdictions had implemented the Pillar Two rules or a domestic top-up tax of 15%.

The US didn’t implement the Pillar Two rules as it maintains that its net CFC tested income (formerly known as (GILTI), regime achieves similar goals. In the first week of January, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Inclusive Framework members reached agreement on a side-by-side approach, allowing the US system to operate alongside Pillar Two through dedicated safe harbors and creating the potential for other jurisdictions with eligible regimes to seek similar treatment.

Rather than delivering a fully uniform minimum tax framework, the side-by-side and ultimate parent entity safe harbors are expected to result in a more differentiated pattern of implementation over time. While many jurisdictions apply Pillar Two from fiscal year 2024, others will apply the rules from fiscal year 2025 or later, and further divergence may emerge depending on whether countries legislate for, or seek eligibility under, the new safe harbors.

Multinational groups are therefore likely to face a patchwork of outcomes that interact differently with domestic tax systems and incentive regimes.

A central question is how grants, tax credits, and other incentives are treated under this evolving framework. As part of its side-by-side package the OECD issued new administrative guidance on tax incentives, confirming that certain refundable or marketable tax credits recognized as income may retain their value under Pillar Two, subject to conditions.

The package also introduces a substance-based tax incentive safe harbor for selected expenditure-based and production-based incentives linked to real economic activity, while income-based incentives such as tax holidays or patent boxes still may depress effective tax rates and trigger top-up tax obligations.

At the same time, the guidance tightens integrity conditions by excluding incentives granted under discretionary governmental arrangements from beneficial treatment, in order to prevent incentives from being used to return tax in a way that would undermine the global minimum tax.

Further guidance is expected this year to address cases where incentives formally meet the definition of qualifying tax incentives but in practice offset the impact of Pillar Two.

Administrative guidance adopted in the first week of January further clarifies the treatment of government-granted tax benefits, including a limited grace period, generally covering fiscal years 2024 and 2025, for certain deferred tax expenses arising from arrangements in place before November 2021. The guidance also reinforces integrity safeguards to prevent the creation of new deferred tax assets designed to undermine the 15% effective tax rate.

For some time already, countries have been adjusting their tax frameworks in anticipation of these rules, converting deductions into grants, shortening refund periods, or making research and development credits refundable. For example, a renewable energy project supported through a refundable credit recognized as income is more likely to preserve its value under Pillar Two than one relying on a long tax holiday.

This allows governments to maintain competitive, investment-focused incentive regimes while operating within the constraints of the global minimum tax.

Adapting to Uncertainty

The current environment is turbulent. Existing geopolitical global dynamics complicate long-term investment planning. Incentives that appear beneficial today may lose value if their treatment evolves, and tariff changes can alter cost structures overnight. The IMF has noted that the private sector has responded with agility by front-loading imports, diversifying sourcing, and rerouting trade flows, but volatility remains a defining feature.

To navigate this environment, companies should invest in data traceability and scenario modeling. Mapping supply chains, origins, and combined nomenclature codes helps firms quantify tariff exposure, carbon costs, and compliance requirements under EU regulations.

AI-driven analytics are increasingly used to model the combined impact of tariffs, incentives, and minimum tax rules, providing corporate boards with timely insights into regulatory and fiscal risk.

Effective governance is equally important. Tax, trade and customs, treasury, sustainability, and government affairs teams should collaborate from the start of project planning to ensure that investment structures are both compliant and optimized. Waiting until projects are underway often means missed opportunities or higher exposure to policy changes.

A massive natural battery Hydropower is one of the oldest forms of electricity generation — and it’s how Duke Energy, then called the Catawba Power Company, got its start in the early 1900s.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, only two states, Virginia and California, have more pumped storage capacity.
In 2022, the company offered four pathways to limit its pollution; all included the expansion, dubbed Bad Creek II, by 2034.
“It seems like a really bad deal” But in October, when Duke submitted its 2026 carbon proposal, Bad Creek II was barely mentioned.","North Carolina’s predominant utility is backing away from a long-held plan to double the size of its largest pumped storage hydropower plant — just as data centers and other voracious energy users threaten to stretch power supplies to their limit.

The reversal was tucked away in Duke Energy’s latest long-term blueprint, which was filed in October and will be evaluated and finalized by regulators this year. Clean energy advocates had expected to fight that blueprint on familiar fronts — from its inclusion of new gas-fired power plants to its complete lack of near-term wind energy — but they were surprised by the backpedaling on the Bad Creek storage facility, located just over the border in South Carolina.

“Duke put this forward as something they were going to do, and everybody agreed,” said David Neal, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. ​“To take out the one thing that everybody agreed on, without any announcement, without any fanfare,” he said, ​“is just baffling to me.”

Pumped hydro is a uniquely useful form of carbon-free electricity. It’s available on demand and can dispatch power over a much longer period than a lithium-ion battery can. It’s also rare: Construction of new pumped hydro facilities in the U.S. has stagnated for decades.

Duke’s original Bad Creek expansion plan would have catapulted the company to become the nation’s leader in pumped hydro. Now, advocates fear its about-face will undermine the state’s zero-carbon law by opening the door for a fleet of new gas plants instead.

A massive natural battery

Hydropower is one of the oldest forms of electricity generation — and it’s how Duke Energy, then called the Catawba Power Company, got its start in the early 1900s. A trio of entrepreneurs, led by James B. Duke, built a series of dams and lakes along the Catawba River, fostering the growth of mills and other industries that helped diversify the region’s economy.

Today, traditional hydropower makes up a tiny fraction of Duke-owned power capacity, with nearly 1.3 gigawatts spread across 25 different sites in the Carolinas. There’s no push to change that number, as conservation groups focus on removing the thousands of other dams in North Carolina that provide little to no upside to outweigh the ecological damage they cause.

Pumped storage hydropower — like that at Bad Creek — is a related but different beast. Two bodies of water at different elevations are connected with reversible turbines, producing or storing electricity, depending on what the grid needs.

“Let’s say it’s a spring day, a sunny day, a lot of solar on the grid, but not a lot of demand. You just bring that water uphill,” to store in the upper reservoir, Neal explained. ​“When you’re in a peak period, you run the water back downhill to generate electricity. It’s a very efficient, clean way of having storage.”

Duke launched its first pumped storage project in 1975 after building a dam between what is now Lake Jocassee and Lake Keowee below it. On the South Carolina side of the Blue Ridge Mountains, the four reversible turbines are slated to operate for at least another two decades.

The Bad Creek complex followed in 1991. The upper reservoir sits at an elevation of 2,310 feet, and Lake Jocassee, more than 1,000 feet below, serves as the lower reservoir. They’re linked by an underground concrete tunnel and a four-turbine powerhouse, capable of supplying enough electricity to power 1 million homes.

Totaling over 2.4 gigawatts, the Jocassee and Bad Creek plants function as massive batteries, and are the largest source of energy storage anywhere on Duke’s six-state electric system. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, only two states, Virginia and California, have more pumped storage capacity.

Duke recently upgraded the existing Bad Creek facility, increasing its capacity to nearly 1.7 gigawatts. But the utility has also long envisioned drilling a new tunnel and adding another four-turbine powerhouse at the site, adding another roughly 1.8 gigawatts. Doing so would help the company zero out its carbon emissions by midcentury, as required by state law.

In 2022, the company offered four pathways to limit its pollution; all included the expansion, dubbed Bad Creek II, by 2034. The additional Bad Creek capacity was also cemented in a compromise Duke struck with stakeholders to help get its last carbon-reduction plan approved. Regulators on the North Carolina Utilities Commission blessed the deal, directing the company to pursue ​“all reasonable development activities” to put Bad Creek II in place.

“It seems like a really bad deal”

But in October, when Duke submitted its 2026 carbon proposal, Bad Creek II was barely mentioned. Among 10 different pathways the company charted toward climate neutrality, only one included the new pumped storage capacity.

Earlier in 2025, Duke had quietly removed Bad Creek II from an engineering study that evaluated the impact of new power plants on the transmission system. The removal means that the soonest Bad Creek II could come online is now 2040 — six years later than previously envisioned — but the company doesn’t recommend even that late date or pinpoint a new one.

“Notwithstanding the delayed development timeline,” Duke said in its plan, the utility remains ​“committed to exploring the potential for additional [pumped storage hydro] capacity at the Bad Creek II site.”

The backtracking has alarmed clean energy advocates, who point out how well pumped storage complements other sources of renewable energy. Duke’s own modeling shows that adding Bad Creek II would enable more solar, onshore wind, and batteries, while eliminating the need for over 2 gigawatts of new gas plants.

“That all seems like a really good deal, and if we could do that sooner, as Duke had committed to in the last plan, and as the commission ordered it to do,” Neal said, ​“we’d be on such a clear path to complying with state law and having a much more diverse portfolio.”

Duke acknowledged that Bad Creek II would lead to lower overall costs than its preferred plan through 2050. Viewed in that light, Neal said, ​“it seems like a really bad deal for customers for Duke to be turning its back on this project.”

In its proposal, Duke offered no specifics on the long-term cost impacts of Bad Creek II, but did say that removing it from the grid impact study showed savings of approximately $358 million in ​“network upgrade costs.” By punting on the project, the company also put off spending tens of millions of dollars on developments.

Asked for more justification, beyond those up-front savings, for Duke’s bid to delay the project, spokesperson Bill Norton said via email: ​“More work is needed to assess whether Bad Creek II will be part of a least-cost plan for customers.”

As to whether the company might shelve the project entirely, Norton said that it ​“remains a potential resource in the future.” He added that Duke plans to spend enough money to qualify the expansion for time-limited 30% federal tax credits and that the potential for additional turbines is included in Duke’s relicensing application to federal regulators.

“While there is no specific timeline today for a second powerhouse,” Norton said, ​“our continued licensing work preserves the option for the future, and we will continue to engage our regulators on this decision.”

As the commission evaluates Duke’s long-term plans, advocates will be pushing for a green light on the Bad Creek expansion — especially as an alternative to the other, more speculative sources of firm power that the utility is banking on, like small modular reactors.

In contrast to that form of nuclear power, pumped hydro is ​“not a nascent technology,” said Justin Somelofske, senior regulatory counsel at the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association. That’s why in past hearings over the utility’s plans, he noted, ​“it was the one resource that was not in controversy and not contested.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/duke-energy-bad-creek.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=cbb250b0a81637a189448734db34afd9,N,,2026-01-15 03:59:56.949700

Boosting Tesla’s Full Self-Driving software to 10 million monthly active subscriptions before 2035.","The EV maker announced Wednesday that going forward, its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software will only be available as a monthly subscription—not a onetime payment. Tesla CEO Elon Musk broke the news on X, the social media platform he owns, noting that the shift will happen on February 14. “FSD will only be available as a monthly subscription thereafter,” Musk wrote, offering no details about how that change would affect the software’s pricing.

While the price of access to Full Self-Driving (FSD) mode has fluctuated over time, the current purchase price for the software is $8,000, or $99 paid as a monthly subscription. Tesla once charged as much as $15,000 for the technology, which promises to “intelligently and accurately complete driving maneuvers for you,” including steering, making lane changes, and parking. The feature requires “active driver supervision” and doesn’t “make the vehicle autonomous,” Tesla disclaims on the Full Self-Driving website.

Tesla’s decision to flip to a subscription model for its self-driving software may not land well with some Tesla buyers, but it doesn’t come as a total surprise. In November, Tesla’s shareholders approved an eye-watering pay package for Musk that consolidates even more power at the company with the mercurial billionaire, with the promise of a payout that could be worth $1 trillion. One of the pay package milestones Musk must hit to unlock the biggest executive payout in history? Boosting Tesla’s Full Self-Driving software to 10 million monthly active subscriptions before 2035.

Much of Tesla’s future revolves around the future of its self-driving tech, but Musk has broken many promises about the software along the way. In California, the company is facing legal woes over deceptive marketing practices that suggested Tesla’s technology was autonomous, even as it required close supervision from a human driver at the wheel—hence the software’s current nomenclature: “Full Self-Driving (Supervised).” Musk has also asserted that Tesla’s vehicles would be “appreciating assets,” thanks to the self-driving software—a claim not borne out by Tesla’s recent tanking used-vehicle prices.

Tesla’s competition heats up

Depending on where you look, Tesla’s competition is either out ahead or catching up fast. Earlier this month, Chinese company BYD bumped Tesla from its top slot as the world’s best-selling electric vehicle maker. Tesla reported that it delivered 1.64 million EVs last year, a 9% dip from the year prior. In the last quarter of 2025, Tesla missed sales expectations, tallying 418,227 sales—a decline connected to Trump’s decision to kill the hefty U.S. tax credits designed to give Americans a break on qualifying EVs.

Tesla, like Musk, has a lot of irons in the fire. The company is also investing aggressively into the robotaxi business, even as its self-driving tech faces scrutiny from federal regulators for reckless behavior. Tesla has a lot of catching up to do on that count, with Alphabet’s Waymo leading the push into autonomous taxi service across major U.S. cities like Austin, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2026/01/p-1-91474691-tesla-full-self-driving-paywall.jpg",N,,2026-01-15 11:01:10.983113

Copper demand continued to grow in 2025, driven by energy-transition requirements originating in the transportation sector, as well as emerging demand from data centers. The market enters into a deficit in 2026. Copper supply faces acute long-term pressure, as a boom in copper-intensive data centers coincides with mine disruptions and slow permitting.

A tight copper market in 2026 signals higher price risk and potential supply-chain constraints for electrification projects. The proliferation of EVs, the expansion of grids and the manufacturing of batteries could face cost inflation or delays.

Japan power – Average baseload power price for 2026 will fall to ¥11.4 per kilowatt-hour

Japan’s power prices are set to trend downward over the next five years as flat demand meets supply growth. BNEF expects Japan’s power prices to average ¥11.4 per kilowatt-hour in the coming year, a 5.1% drop from 2025. Japan’s declining average power prices may relieve industrial cost pressures but will challenge merchant generators.

However, structural shifts – such as aging fossil fuel generators being displaced by nuclear and renewable generation, along with hotter, prolonged summers – could still create sharp peaks and stress the power system.

EU carbon – Carbon price hits €87 per ton

Prices in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System will rise 16% in 2026 to €87 per ton. This is primarily due to a 21% drop in allowance supply – the result of a downward revision on free allocation benchmarks, the phase-in of the levy for the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and shipping allowance cancellations. A tighter allowance market will raise compliance costs for heavy industry and power producers, increasing the incentive for fuel switching, efficiency measures and early decarbonization.

LNG supply – 29 million metric tons of new capacity to come online in 2026

The global LNG market is headed for a glut in supply, with new production capacity slated to commission from the US, Qatar, Australia, Mexico and Africa in 2026. About 8 million tons of export capacity is expected online from the major Qatari North Field Expansion project, and the Golden Pass LNG project in Texas adds two out of three production trains in 2026 – at 5.2 million tons capacity each.

The level of supply entering the market will depend on the commissioning timelines and ramp-up schedules set by the operators. Much of this new capacity is not directly tied to long-term LNG contracts and could find its way into the spot market, putting downward pressure on prices –already reflected in the forward curves for the European gas benchmark price and the Asian spot LNG price marker in coming years.

Renewable fuels – 1.07 billion gallons per year of new renewable fuels production capacity announced for China

China’s 15th five-year plan, to be announced in March, is widely expected to introduce a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending target. As the market evolves from pilot programs to mandated consumption levels, the volume of announced production capacity targeted to come online in 2026 has hit a high over 1 billion gallons per year, almost half of all global additions announced in the year ahead.

China’s move toward a national SAF mandate positions it to dominate global renewable-fuel manufacturing capacity. This could shift supply chains, lower SAF costs globally, and intensify competitive pressure on Western producers.

Petrochemicals – 15.6 million metric tons per year of new ethylene production nameplate capacity

China’s rapid capacity expansion has cut into its imports, redirecting them to Europe and squeezing the region’s older and smaller assets that were already struggling with high costs and thin margins. The strain has triggered a wave of closures, the latest being Exxon Mobil Corp.’s 800,000 metric tons per year ethylene plant in Fife, Scotland. A massive wave of new Chinese-led ethylene supply will deepen global oversupply, pressure margins and accelerate closures in Europe. Petrochemical producers outside China face heightened competitiveness challenges.

Weather – +0.5°C temperature anomaly in summer

The US National Center for Environmental Prediction’s Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CSFv2) forecast puts the Niño 3.4 temperature anomaly at +0.5°C for June–August 2026. That suggests that La Niña may linger into early next year before easing toward neutral or even El Niño territory.

If this shift happens earlier than forecast, expectations for a cold La Niña winter could fade. That would reduce US heating degree days and leave natural gas supplies more comfortable by the end of winter.

US power – Power demand from data centers to reach 48.3GW

The rapid expansion of the US data center fleet will lead to a 7.7GW jump in average power demand from the sector in 2026.

Analysis of key power market regions like PJM Interconnection and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (Ercot) indicates that grid tipping points are already emerging, as planned power supply fails to keep pace with accelerating data-center growth.

Data centers are now a system-wide driver of grid stress. Major markets may face capacity shortfalls unless generation and transmission expansions accelerate, increasing reliability and pricing risk.

US gas – $3.90/MMBtu marginal supply cost for Haynesville, Texas, dry gas

The US needs to unlock more gas supply to feed a growing number of LNG export terminals along the Gulf Coast and support data centers’ rising power demand. The Haynesville shale basin is expected to be a key driver of US natural gas supply growth in the medium term, given its proximity to LNG terminals and pipeline constraints limiting growth in other regions. BNEF’s latest breakeven cost estimates place the Texas-side of Haynesville as the marginal gas producing region. US Henry Hub gas price futures for 2026, as of Dec. 15, were trading at an average of $3.86/MMBtu – just below BNEF’s marginal gas production cost estimate. Maintaining supply growth to meet rising demand may require higher US gas prices or further improvements in well productivity, drilling and completion costs.

Wright has said he expects most coal plants will stay online to service the energy demands of A.I.
Nuclear plants take years to plan and build, and rarely finish ahead of schedule.","Energy-hungry data centers have been a lifeline for ailing U.S. coal plants, analysts say.

U.S. data centers are predicted to consume up to 106 gigawatts of power by 2035, up from just 35 gigawatts in 2024, according to BloombergNEF. Power utilities are citing the spread of data centers as a rationale to keep coal plants online — plants that have, for decades, been losing ground to solar, wind, and natural gas.

Chris Womack, head of power utility Southern Company, said at a recent industry conference, “We’re going to extend coal plants as long as we can because we need those resources on the grid.”

Since the beginning last year, at least 15 coal plants have had their planned retirements delayed, some indefinitely, according to a recent DeSmog analysis of Energy Department data. These include a plant in Michigan that Secretary of Energy Chris Wright ordered to remain open, citing an “emergency” energy shortage.

Wright has said he expects most coal plants will stay online to service the energy demands of A.I. Coal, he said in September, “will be essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and winning the A.I. race.”

Wright has also looked to nuclear as a way to meet demand from data centers. Globally, nuclear is gaining steam. Fifteen nuclear reactors are slated to go online worldwide this year, up from just two in 2025, according to BNEF. Another 50 reactors are due to be switched on before 2030.

But analysts say U.S. nuclear may struggle to compete with other forms of electricity. Nuclear plants take years to plan and build, and rarely finish ahead of schedule. So while A.I. could give nuclear a boost, said BNEF analyst Chris Gadomski, “Unless the nuclear industry responds quickly, this opportunity may be lost to fossil fuels and renewables.”

Kathy Hochul announced Tuesday in her State of the State address.

Hochul’s speech was short on details regarding her nuclear aspirations. The state’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act requires New York to achieve a 100% zero-emission electricity system by 2040. And last month, the New York State Energy Planning Board adopted a new state energy plan that cast nuclear energy as key to New York’s reliability and decarbonization goals.

The plan, which offers “broad” guidance rather than binding targets, also highlighted some of the challenges facing nuclear. It described nuclear projects’ “long lead times and uncertain costs,” and noted the likely need for changes to zero emission credit programs and wholesale markets to balance concerns over capacity, reliability and ratepayer impacts.

A policy book released alongside Hochul’s speech says the governor plans to direct state agencies to “establish a clear pathway for additional advanced nuclear generation to support grid reliability.” A nuclear reliability “backbone” will be developed through a new Department of Public Service process “to consider, review, and facilitate a cost-effective pathway to 4 gigawatts of new nuclear energy.”

If successful, the buildout would bring New York’s total nuclear fleet to more than 8 GW. The state currently has three plants with four operating reactors totaling 3.4 GW of capacity, all owned by Constellation Energy. Nuclear power supplies about 21% of New York’s electricity.

“Go big or go home,” the democratic governor said during her address, adding that the state seeks to build more nuclear generation “than has been built anywhere in the United States in the last 30 years.”

In 2024, Georgia Power completed an expansion of Plant Vogtle in Georgia, including the first two new nuclear reactors built in the U.S. in decades. The reactors came online years late and cost more than double the original estimate of $14 billion, and continue to roil energy politics in Georgia.

Utilities and large energy users have increasingly explored small modular reactors as a potential alternative to the large, traditional reactors like those deployed at Vogtle, but none are operating in the U.S. currently and the technology is nascent.

Doreen Harris, president and CEO of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, praised the governor’s plan for creating a “nuclear reliability backbone.”

“This effort will provide firm, clean power that will compliment over 50 GW of incremental renewable energy resources and reduce NY’s reliance on fossil fuel generation,” Harris wrote on LinkedIn. “By creating a stable foundation of always-on energy, the Backbone will allow renewable resources to operate more efficiently and flexibly.”

Hochul also said New York will “launch a nuclear workforce development program” to ensure the state is ready to build the new plants.

There have been a spate of nuclear projects announced around the U.S. recently, as utilities and large consumers look for ways to meet rising electricity demand. Much of the need centers around the development of data centers to serve artificial intelligence.

Meta announced Friday that it has struck deals with Oklo, Vistra and TerraPower to supply up to 6.6 GW of nuclear power to its data centers by 2035.

President Trump has said he wants the U.S. to deploy 300 GW of net new nuclear capacity by 2050 and have 10 large reactors under construction by 2030. In October, Westinghouse Electric, Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management announced they’d entered into a strategic partnership with the U.S. government to deploy $80 billion in new nuclear reactors.

NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy on Tuesday said they were renewing their commitment to deploying nuclear reactors on the Moon and in orbit.

Back on Earth, New York’s grid operator anticipates electricity demand could increase by 50% to 90% over the next two decades, driven by the electrification of heating and transportation and the development of energy intensive projects and industry such as data centers.

“Data centers are vital for an innovative future,” Hochul said in her Tuesday address. “But they guzzle up tremendous amounts of energy and leave ratepayers footing the bill. So if they want to build in New York, they’ll have to pay their fair share for the power they use and ultimately generate their own power independently.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/tet_ubyIFCLo-RhmHY9Jiyo2Q12nd_JC_mvbzIQbBhc/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9ob2N1bC5wbmc=.webp,N,,2026-01-15 06:59:57.293573

I think it is noteworthy that North/Northeast and East Portland have held the president's gavel under this new form of government, and I look forward to seeing the gains we can make for East Portland with their Councilor at the helm.

It has been an honor to serve as the Portland City Council's first President, and I am proud of the work my office accomplished during that time. We built a new Council-led government from the ground up, and did so while fending off unwarranted and unprecedented attacks from the federal administration. We passed critical policies, often unanimously, drafted with crucial input guided by Portlanders' testimony and our own diverse experiences. And we began to establish norms for how we work with the Administrative and Executive branches of our City. I look forward to sharing what I have learned and providing counsel to Council President Dunphy as he carries forward the torch, and seeing the innovative ways he adds to the creation of this work.

The process to elect this year's leadership was incredibly challenging. I have always said that democracy is messy, and designed to be so – but this particular discussion was beyond messy, and I have heard from many of you that we failed to build confidence from Portlanders in this Council's ability to do the people's business. That is not what our city deserves or should expect.

I am thankful we were able to reach a resolution, and I believe the call to action is clear – we have to do the people's business. We have to put politics and personality aside.

Now, I'm stepping into a new pair of shoes: full-time City Councilor for District 2. Moving forward, my values will remain unchanged. As Councilor, I will continue to emphasize the importance of responsive, effective government, bringing a resolution to make E-Council, our system for tracking policy, more transparent and accessible to the public.

I will also continue fighting for Portland families, working to make Portland affordable, and protecting our basic rights and freedoms. Some of my priorities for this year include:

Restoring and reopening the Columbia Pool, as it plays a vital role in District 2 for working families

Bringing forward an ordinance with co-sponsors Council President Dunphy and Councilor Tiffany Koyama-Lane, updating City Code to provide greater access for families, caregivers, and all community members to single-use restrooms across the city

Continuing work with the Portland Housing Bureau to increase our family-sized housing stock in Portland, ensuring we don't rely so heavily on one-bedrooms and studios

Weighing in on the Economic Opportunities Analysis to balance sustainability and habitat protection with space for high-wage jobs, and digging into how we can use Portland Clean Energy Fund (PCEF) to catalyze high-wage, sustainable jobs in our region

Supporting revitalization efforts for the Albina neighborhood

Building on the Protect Portland Initiative to safeguard immigrant communities, people of color, and others who are being targeted by the Trump administration

We have an immense opportunity before us now to score big wins for our city and to rally around a unified vision for Portland's future.

I am ready to do my part in this work. I am ready for us to move forward, together.",https://www.portland.gov/themes/custom/cloudy/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-15 11:02:00.339554

Today, a coalition of 34 organizations filed a rulemaking petition urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBCS) to deem anaerobic digesters that are located at industrial livestock operations or use livestock manure ineligible for grants and loans under the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). At the same time, Earthjustice filed a lawsuit on behalf of petitioner Friends of the Earth, challenging the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s violation of the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for illegally withholding public records that detail the agency’s decisions to fund manure digesters using REAP dollars.

REAP exists to help farmers and rural small businesses lower energy costs and foster stronger communities, not prop up factory farms,” said Molly Armus, Animal Agriculture Policy Program Manager at Friends of the Earth. “If USDA wants to save taxpayer dollars, it should stop wasting its funds on inefficient, costly digesters and instead invest in projects that truly benefit rural communities.”

The petition urges RBCS to disqualify manure digesters from REAP funding because these projects undermine the very goals the program was created to advance. REAP was created to help farmers and rural small businesses cut energy costs and strengthen local economies; yet hundreds of millions of tax dollars have been funneled into expensive, polluting manure digesters. Manure digesters, which are meant to capture methane emissions and generate energy from large amounts of animal waste, overwhelmingly benefit industrial-scale livestock operations, fuel consolidation in rural areas, and contribute to air and water pollution that threatens nearby residents.

The petition also notes that over the last five years, new manure digesters received average loan guarantees of $18.7 million, almost three times more than the average loan guarantees for solar projects, all while delivering far less energy per taxpayer dollar than the solar projects. As farmers and rural communities confront worker losses, reduced project funding, and declining markets, it is critical that federal funding supports projects that do not deepen these harms.

“Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from industrial livestock operations is critical, but manure digesters are a false solution,” said Kara Goad, Senior Associate Attorney at Earthjustice. “Manure digesters do not offer cost-effective emissions reductions or energy generation, and supporting them keeps limited funds from going to practices that reduce emissions, support small farms, and mitigate air and water pollution.”

Petitioners include: Socially Responsible Agriculture Project, Animal Legal Defense Fund, Buffalo River Watershed Alliance, Campaign for Family Farms and the Environment, Cape Fear River Watch, Center for Food Safety, CleanAIRE NC, Climate Action California, Environmental Justice Community Action Network, Farm Aid, Farm Forward, Food & Water Watch, Friends of Toppenish Creek, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, Kansas Rural Center, Kissimmee Waterkeeper, Michiganders for a Just Farming System, Milwaukee Riverkeeper, North Carolina Environmental Justice Network, National Family Farm Coalition, Nebraska Communities United, Northeast Organic Dairy Producers Alliance, Organic Farming Research Foundation, Potomac Riverkeeper, RE Sources, RedTailed Hawk Collective, Rural Empowerment Association for Community Help, Shenandoah Riverkeeper, Southern Coalition for Social Justice, Sustain Rural Wisconsin Network, Upper Potomac Riverkeeper, and Waterkeeper Alliance.

Meanwhile, the lawsuit filed today challenges USDA’s unlawful use of the “deliberative process” exemption under FOIA to withhold 25 spreadsheets that show how the agency evaluated digester funding applications. These records reflect final decisions, not internal deliberations, and are critical for the public to understand why USDA uses its limited REAP funds to support these harmful and ineffective projects.

The petition outlines how funding for digesters is hurting – not helping – farmers and our environment, including:

Benefits go to the biggest polluters. Subsidies for anaerobic digesters primarily benefit the largest industrial animal operations, giving them another subsidized competitive advantage over smaller farms and accelerating the loss of independent farms and rural economic vitality.

Environmental harms. The petition documents numerous environmental harms associated with digesters, including spills and overflows releasing hundreds of thousands of gallons of waste into waterways as well as increased ammonia and nitrate pollution from the leftover byproduct, digestate. Methane leaks and herd expansion linked to manure digesters also make their impact on greenhouse gases dubious.

High costs and poor returns. Digesters often cost between $2–12 million, require enormous taxpayer subsidies, and rarely recoup their costs. They’re also inefficient, with the digesters that received loan guarantees generating 4.5 times less energy per dollar than solar loan guarantee recipients. Specifically, the digesters that received loan guarantees generate an average of 8,047 BTUs annually per REAP dollar, while the solar projects that received loan guarantees generate an average of 36,728 BTUs annually per REAP dollar. Data further shows that many digesters shut down prematurely, making them a risky investment of public dollars.

Better alternatives to build resiliency exist. REAP is consistently oversubscribed, so by making digesters ineligible, more funding could support projects like solar panels for small farms or energy-efficient refrigeration for rural grocery stores. These are the types of projects that lower costs and deliver lasting community benefits.

“There is no way to make factory farm gas sustainable,” said Sherri Dugger, Executive Director at Socially Responsible Agriculture Project. “Rather than using already limited REAP funds to subsidize these toxic operations, USDA should support the independent farmers, small business owners, and rural residents who are working to build healthier outcomes in their home communities.”

“These enormously expensive digesters serve as a subsidy for factory farms, incentivizing them to get bigger to produce more waste as they push small and mid-sized farms out,” said Ben Lilliston, Director of Rural Strategies and Climate Change at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. “Digesters are an increasingly risky investment, when more stable and cost effective options for renewable energy are in high demand from farmers.”

“This petition is important to the people of south central Washington where farmers are struggling to survive after three straight years of drought,” said Jean Mendoza, Executive Director of Friends of Toppenish Creek. “The REAP program should endeavor to disperse funds as equitably as possible with a goal of maximizing environmental benefits for all farmers. REAP funding should not be siphoned off to benefit a segment that actively and brazenly pollutes the land.”

“The use of anaerobic digesters exacerbates the already heavy burden imposed by factory farming on communities and the environment,” said Patience Burke, Pure Farms, Pure Waters National Campaign Manager at Waterkeeper Alliance. “This petition removes the veil and is a powerful illustration of how factory farm biogas is not a clean source of energy. Limited REAP funding should be available to truly renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, and not used in a way that perpetuates the abysmal manure management practices of factory farming.”

“It is important that the government takes steps to ensure that applicants selected for this funding are using the best available technology for the protection of the public’s health,” said Sherri White-Williamson, Executive Director of Environmental Justice Community Action Network.

“For too long, USDA has allowed factory farms and their Big Ag backers to syphon limited conservation funds toward expensive, ineffective, and dirty factory farm biogas projects,” said Tyler Lobdell, Senior Attorney at Food & Water Watch. “USDA must cut them off. It’s time these federal dollars were put back in the pockets of sustainable farmers who need them most.”

“REAP should help build the Michigan we all want to see by supporting truly clean energy, not subsidizing polluting manure digesters on factory farms.” said Val Schey with Michiganders for a Just Farming System. “Ending REAP funding for digesters would ensure the program works for Michigan’s rural communities, not against them.”

“In North Carolina, communities are living next to some of the nation’s largest hog operations, many of them owned by international corporations,” said Anne Harvey David, Chief Counsel for Environmental Justice at Southern Coalition for Social Justice. “That reality is a far cry from the small family farms REAP was meant to serve.”

“Factory farm gas is being sold as climate progress, but in reality, it locks in the very pollution and consolidation that rural communities are struggling to escape,” said Andrew deCoriolis, Executive Director of Farm Forward. “Taxpayer dollars spent on digesters prop up industrial animal operations while worsening air and water pollution. USDA should redirect these funds to farmers and ranchers who are producing food in ways that actually protect the climate, public health, and rural livelihoods.”

“Factory farm biogas production further enriches industrial animal agriculture and biogas developers at the expense of rural communities,” said Christine Ball-Blakely, Senior Staff Attorney at the Animal Legal Defense Fund. “REAP funds exist to help rural communities, not the industries that harm them.”

Laying off thousands of Federal environmental, pollution, and renewable energy researchers, lawyers, and administrators.
If they win, the casualties will be good-paying jobs, small and large renewable energy businesses, cleaner air, and climate action.
In short, the war on solar is real, and the general public doesn’t care.","With the Federal Government renaming and redefining the mission of the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) to the “National Laboratory of the Rockies,” it’s time for the solar, wind, and renewable energy industries to declare the quiet part out loud: The U.S. government is waging a financial and regulatory war against the development and deployment of renewable energy.

You might think that a “war on solar” is aggressive language. But this war is far from a secret. The President, his cabinet, and many conservative lawmakers publicly attack renewables as “the green new scam” and spread misinformation about its cost and reliability. Sadly, their aggressive actions speak even louder than their words.

Not only has the Trump administration redefined NREL, but they’ve also taken numerous actions to defund and aggressively regulate the development and deployment of renewable energy, including:

Leading the repeal of the IRA’s clean energy subsidies.

Using presidential executive orders to add hurdles to renewable energy development and favor more expensive fossil fuels.

Cancelling approved permits for renewable energy and transmission projects that are already under construction.

Clawing back hundreds of millions in grants for community solar and grants for low-income people.

Proposing that fossil fuel pollution isn’t harmful to our health.

Laying off thousands of Federal environmental, pollution, and renewable energy researchers, lawyers, and administrators.

In short, the Trump administration has weaponized the government to do everything in its power—no pun intended—to slow down renewable energy’s growth. There is no longer a level playing field or an “all-the-above” U.S. energy strategy. For this administration, U.S. “energy dominance” refers mainly to fossil fuels and expensive nuclear power.

If they win, the casualties will be good-paying jobs, small and large renewable energy businesses, cleaner air, and climate action. America will also become less competitive with China. Worst of all for everyone, electricity prices are going to continue to rise.

But here’s the good news: I know that we can and will win this war. Why? Follow the money: Despite all these challenges, solar and energy storage are still the cheapest to and fastest way to build new capacity for the grid. Nuclear, gas, and coal can’t compete for speed or cost.

But economics and technology can’t win this war alone. For renewables to truly win, we need to win the hearts and minds of local and national policymakers and consumers.

Like any war, we need strong public support. The public—especially voters—must be aware and care that solar, wind, battery, and other new energy and “electrotech” companies are unfairly being attacked.

Likewise, the same people must understand that these industries are directly affecting their lives by:

Decreasing electricity bills.

Supporting self-reliance and energy independence.

Inexpensively powering new AI data centers.

Creating new jobs today and for the future.

Helping farmers preserve their land and earn extra income.

Contributing local tax revenue where we build projects.

Earning a return for energy investors.

Helping America innovate and compete against China and other global tech competitors.

Decreasing pollution and its health, environmental, and financial costs.

And did I mention decreasing electricity bills? That’s worth repeating.

Beyond lawsuits and lobbying, the way to defend our valuable industries is through consistent, positive, accurate, creative communications that flood social media, influencers, and front-page headlines. This will generate social media conflicts, but that conflict will inspire conversations that will eventually neutralize anti-renewable energy propaganda.

This war of words playbook isn’t new. It’s pretty much a copy of the oil and gas industry’s tactics. What could be new is that the renewable energy industry finally steps up to fund and deploy our own clean energy messaging and lobbying dollars with the same media weapons.

If we don’t act now and make consumers and policymakers care about the benefits of solar, storage, and other renewables, we run the risk of being unfairly blamed or used as a scapegoat for the most important topic in everyone’s minds right now – energy affordability. While the facts are clear that solar and storage are the cheapest forms of new energy additions onto the existing grid, the misinformation campaign that the other side is waging is louder and being heard over ours. Energy economics will always win in the long run, but the long run will take some time, and I am concerned about the consistent black eye that the industry will receive in between now and then.

So far, our industry response has been muted or preaching to the solar choir. We must be more aggressive. It’s up to every renewable energy company to engage our workers, the media, family, and friends. When they casually ask how we’re doing, we must take the opportunity to say that there’s an aggressive and pointless government war against solar businesses and solar jobs. We must explain how this war is directly affecting their health, their children’s future, and their electric bills.

2026 can be renewable energy’s year to fight back. A word-of-mouth grass-roots effort can be cost-effective for the entire industry if we continually volunteer our attention, voices, and social media accounts.

This is a moment for everyone who believes in clean energy, innovation, and truth to step up. If you’re interested in organizing, contributing funds or time to a fresh fight-back campaign, join this campaign list. Let’s come together and share our ideas, dollars, and mindshare to beat this thing. By donating to support a broad public-education campaign, you can help stop misinformation in its tracks and make sure voters and communities hear the facts—not the fearmongering.

In short, the war on solar is real, and the general public doesn’t care. If we’re not pushing back on X, TikTok, and the news, we lose.

Congress is rushing to beat a Jan. 30 deadline to pass the annual appropriations bills to avoid another government shutdown.

Top lawmakers on the Senate and House appropriations committees released a two-bill package Sunday that contains funding for the Departments of State, Treasury and other related agencies.

The House voted 341 to 79 to pass the package, kicking it over to the Senate.

The Senate, meanwhile, is moving through procedural votes on a three-bill package that includes funding for the Departments of Commerce, Justice and Interior, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency. The House approved the package last week in a vote that was overwhelmingly bipartisan.

If both pieces of legislation make it to President Trump's desk, Congress will have four more appropriations bills to pass to fully fund the government through the end of the fiscal year.

But the Senate has a weeklong recess next week and the House is scheduled to be out the week after — creating a quick turnaround on the final bills, including a controversial measure to fund the Department of Homeland Security.

Plans were dropped to include the Homeland Security Department appropriations in the package unveiled this week after an ICE officer fatally shot a Minnesota woman. Democrats have threatened to withhold their support for this funding if it does not include ICE reforms.

""It's a politically very sensitive topic,"" GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said Tuesday. ""That's why we decided not to push ahead with a Homeland bill this week.""

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said it's ""one of the major issues that the appropriators are confronting right now.""

Cole said negotiations on the other remaining bills are ""very close"" to wrapping up and he expected passage in both chambers.

""Then we've just got to strategize how to get Homeland, if we can,"" he said. ""But most of the government should be up and functional.""

If a deal can't be reached on Homeland Security, Cole said lawmakers would likely pass another temporary measure, which would maintain funding for the agency at its current level.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/08/1fe9b272-8c58-4164-ae7e-4c7c721f6a4c/thumbnail/1200x630g2/5bace918166d731eb22dd91665528dff/gettyimages-2254819076.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 23:58:41.989333

The proposed wealth tax, however, does not tolerate different answers arrived at in good faith.
A nonresident spouse’s wealth is included in the covered taxpayer’s net worth for wealth tax purposes.
Any wealth tax imposes significant economic costs, and the impact of a state-level tax of 5 percent is likely to be particularly severe.","Introduction

The 2026 Billionaire TaxA tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities. Act,[1] a California ballot initiative, would ostensibly impose a one-time tax of 5 percent on the net worth of the state’s billionaires. Due, however, to aggressive design choices and possible drafting errors, the actual rate on taxpayers’ net worth could be dramatically higher.

One particularly momentous policy choice has the potential to strip the founders of some of the world’s largest companies of their controlling interests and force them to sell off a significant portion of their shares. This could send stock prices plummeting to the detriment of tech employees and investors of all stripes, including ordinary workers whose 401(k)s would take a beating if Silicon Valley founders had to offload their shares in a hurry.

The poorly drafted initiative creates many scenarios in which tax liability would be vastly more than 5 percent of net worth, but this analysis focuses on six of them:

Valuation can be based on voting interests in a company when they exceed actual economic stakes.

Assessment rules for privately held businesses can substantially overvalue them.

Draconian underpayment penalties for taxpayers and potentially ruinous penalties for their appraisers encourage substantial overstatement of the value of privately held businesses to avoid a dispute with tax authorities.

Presumptive drafting errors on anti-avoidance rules result in taxing significantly more than the amount of the transfers.

Provisions regarding spousal assets and indebtedness to relatives would tax a nonresident spouse’s assets and, in the event of a divorce, would tax the California resident on formerly held assets that had been obligated to the ex-spouse in a divorce settlement.

Deferral regimes have eligibility limitations and impose additional costs, and run the risk of taxing wealth that might no longer exist.

Each of these features makes an already unprecedented tax even more destructive. If the initiative passes, California must brace for an exodus of founders and investors fleeing not just extraordinarily high tax burdens, but also the potential loss of the companies they created. A loss of jobs, startups, investment capital, and economic growth would be among the consequences of a large wave of departures, and of the tax burden on those who remain or whom state officials deem not to have escaped the clutches of the tax.

Valuation by Voting Rights Can Break Up Controlling Interests

The proposed wealth taxA wealth tax is imposed on an individual’s net wealth, or the market value of their total owned assets minus liabilities. A wealth tax can be narrowly or widely defined, and depending on the definition of wealth, the base for a wealth tax can vary. has distinct valuation methods for different asset classes and ownership structures. Publicly traded assets are valued based on the assets’ market trading value, but there are different rules for assets that are not publicly traded.

Under the initiative, “For any interests that confer voting or other direct control rights, the percentage of the business entity owned by the taxpayer shall be presumed to be not less than the taxpayer’s percentage of the overall voting or other direct control rights.”[2]

Founders often hold private Class B or other super-voting shares with transfer restrictions preventing them from being sold to the public, but which confer voting control over a publicly traded company. Together, for instance, Larry Page and Sergey Brin own about 11.3 percent of Alphabet (Google) but control 52.3 percent of voting rights. Similarly, Mark Zuckerberg owns about 13.6 percent of Meta but has 61.0 percent voting control.[3]

It is possible that the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB), charged with administering the new tax, would determine that these shares are publicly tradable because they have an ascertainable value and can be converted into tradeable Class A shares under a dual-class structure. In that case, they would be taxed by their market value.

Of considerable concern for founders, though, is the very real possibility that they would not be considered publicly traded assets, in which case the proposed wealth tax would apply to founders’ and early investors’ share of voting rights, even if they are not at all representative of their actual economic stake in the company. This could force founders to convert their Class B shares to Class A and sell them as common stock, surrendering their controlling stakes and liquidating large portions of their investment.[4]

Two billionaires represent opposite extremes: Tony Xu, the founder of DoorDash, owns 2.6 percent of his company but controls 57.6 percent of the vote, yielding wealth tax liability of $2.62 billion on an ownership interest worth $2.41 billion. Since selling his shares incurs capital gains taxA capital gains tax is levied on the profit made from selling an asset and is often in addition to corporate income taxes, frequently resulting in double taxation. These taxes create a bias against saving, leading to a lower level of national income by encouraging present consumption over investment. , moreover, and the entire value of these shares is capital gains for him, his total tax liability for his DoorDash shares would be $4.17 billion—173 percent of their value. The tax would bankrupt him absent an FTB determination to set aside this valuation. (Xu’s valuation is so clearly incorrect that he would almost certainly prevail on this point. Others may have less success.)

Conversely, Jensen Huang of NVIDIA is the rare founder without preferred voting shares. His 3.8 percent stake in NVIDIA gives him 3.8 percent of the vote, yielding wealth tax liability of $8.5 billion on an ownership interest worth $170 billion.

Most founders are somewhere in between, but their voting share is typically much larger than their ownership share. They would be required to sell off significant stakes in their companies to pay the tax in 2027. Those sell-offs might reduce the price they can get for the shares even though the taxable valuation would be fixed at December 31, 2026, levels, before the share liquidation. The consequences of founders relinquishing control and dumping vast holdings, moreover, would be significant—in some cases, potentially catastrophic—for employers and investors as well.

Founders could challenge the voting rights assumption, arguing that substituting their economic stake plus some control premium is necessary to avoid a substantial overstatement of liability,[5] but since drafters gave priority to voting rights with a clear understanding that they often dramatically outstrip actual ownership stakes, the FTB and the courts might be loath to permit alternative valuations in all but the most extreme cases. Furthermore, as discussed later, proposing an alternative through the submission of a certified appraisal carries its own risks.

The only other possible “out” for such founders would be the use of Optional Deferral Accounts (ODAs), discussed later, but this would also put founders under substantial constraints and would retain the inflated tax liability generated by voting interests.

The following table shows voting and ownership shares for six tech founders, with estimates of their wealth tax liability and their total liability (net of capital gains tax on the distributions made to satisfy wealth tax liability), and how that liability compares to the total value of their holdings.

Table 1. Corporate Founders Lose Controlling Interests and Face Extremely High Rates Under Wealth Tax

Note: Total Tax includes federal and California capital gains tax on liquidating assets to remit wealth tax owed. Market cap and other corporate financial data are as of January 13, 2026. Value and tax share of value are based on the estimated share of ownership in the founder’s company, excluding any other investments. Estimates assume that super-voting shares are not publicly traded assets for the purpose of the proposed wealth tax. In some cases, taxpayers may be able to pursue alternative valuation methods.

Brin and Page already cut ties with California, reportedly leaving before the January 1, 2026, residency date indicated in the initiative.[6] Since the measure’s retroactive “snapshot” assessment date is sure to draw a legal challenge, many other founders—incentivized not only by personal financial considerations but also by the desire to retain voting control over the companies they founded—may do the same should the initiative gain steam, and particularly if it is approved by the voters in November.

Assessment Rules for Private Businesses Can Substantially Overvalue Them

Private business interests are notoriously difficult to value. The initiative’s valuation rules make a challenging proposition worse by requiring systematic overstatements of business value.

Fair market value for non-public businesses is presumed to be equal to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) book value plus 7.5 times average annual profits, multiplied by the taxpayer’s percentage interest in the company.[7] Many closely held businesses do not use GAAP accounting. Beyond that initial hurdle, this approach uses an accounting concept (book profit) without regard to features that drive market pricing, including risks, cyclicality, capital intensity, regulatory exposure, and, most importantly in the case of closely held firms, illiquidity. All these factors would ordinarily translate into valuation discounts compared to a publicly traded company with similar profits, but the rules of the proposed wealth tax ignore this distinction.

The initiative also establishes a floor that can overvalue struggling businesses. If a business is posting losses, its book profits are treated as $0, not a negative value, meaning that losses do not reduce the value of the business for tax purposes.[8] Other valuation floors can lock in outdated valuations that may not reflect a company’s present-day reality.

For instance, the measure holds that a business’s value cannot be less than the valuation reflected in any funding round or equity sale within the past two years unless the taxpayer can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence—a high standard—that the valuation would significantly overstate the entity’s value.[9] But a company’s value can decline in two years, and valuations in equity rounds often involve preferred terms that are not available to all owners and which would overvalue the company as a whole when used as a valuation floor.

Additionally, the initiative denies ordinary discounts for minority interests and lack of marketability, even though any realistic valuation would take these factors into account. A stake in an illiquid company is not worth as much as a similar fully liquid stake, and the ownership stake cannot be sold at a price that disregards that discount—assuming it can be sold at all.

If a taxpayer has a profit interest in a business entity, moreover, their ownership share is presumed to be at least the maximum interest in the company’s profits they may earn subject to certain conditions being met, even if those conditions have not yet been—and may never be—met.[10] This provision taxes interests the taxpayer does not actually possess.

Other provisions stipulating that fair market value excludes forced-sale pricing and treating insurance coverage as a valuation minimum can also artificially inflate business value,[11] overstating what the taxpayer’s share of the company is worth on the open market. And forced-sale pricing could be exactly what taxpayers get if they liquidate some or all of their holdings to pay the wealth tax.

Draconian Penalties Incentivize Overstatement of Liability

Some prior wealth tax proposals have charged tax authorities with valuing billionaires’ assets, including the value of their closely held (non-traded) businesses. The California initiative relieves the state of that burden and instead charges the taxpayers themselves with determining their net worth and remitting the appropriate tax on it.

For traded assets, like shares in a publicly traded company, these valuations are straightforward. For a privately held business, however, valuation is innately difficult. Particularly for startups, valuation may be speculative and uncertain, even given the valuation rules provided in the initiative. Good faith estimates could vary substantially.

The proposed wealth tax, however, does not tolerate different answers arrived at in good faith. If the FTB settles on a different valuation than the one certified by the taxpayer, then a penalty applies to any resulting underpayment: 20 percent for an understatement of tax liability that exceeds the greater of $1 million or 20 percent of the tax shown on the taxpayer’s return, and 40 percent for an understatement of liability that exceeds the greater of $10 million or 40 percent.[12] These are large amounts, to be sure, but the range of valuations one might reasonably attach to a promising tech startup pre-IPO, for instance, could easily vary by that much.

Certified appraisals could also be used when arguing for an alternative valuation for Class B shares, contending that using voting rights rather than economic stake substantially overstates the value of these holdings. It would be up to the appraiser to determine what premium to attach to their super-voting privileges, and should the FTB disagree with that determination, this could yield substantial penalties.[13]

Notably, penalties for underpayment do not end with the taxpayer. If a substantial underpayment is attributable to a certified appraisal, then the FTB is permitted to impose penalties on the appraiser at 2 or 4 percent of the understatement of tax. For an appraiser, such a penalty could be ruinous, and the result—besides any costly insurance—would be to incentivize appraisers to be more solicitous to the state, padding appraisals (particularly on hard-to-appraise businesses) to avoid serious financial penalty.

Imagine, for instance, a private business the FTB concludes is worth $6 billion. If the appraiser thought it was worth $5 billion, they could personally owe $1 million in penalties, in addition to the $10 million in penalties imposed on the taxpayer.

Poorly Drafted Anti-Avoidance Rules Can Over-Tax Transfers

The initiative’s drafters included anti-avoidance rules that, among other things, disregard transfers intended to reduce wealth tax liability. Under the proposal, for instance, a billionaire cannot transfer wealth or incur a debt to their children to reduce liability, cannot escape wealth taxation by transferring property to a trust, and cannot work around limits on such transfers by selling assets for less than market value. The way these provisions are written, however, will dramatically overstate taxable net worth in at least two ways.

First, the language captures the entire value of any trust to which assets are transferred in 2026, not just the value of that transfer. Under the proposal, “net worth shall for all purposes include the value of property held by any trust (other than a grantor trust or tax-exempt trust) to which the individual transfers property in 2026, and seventy-five percent of the value of such property transferred in 2025.”[14]

Perhaps the intention was to tax the full value of transfers made in 2026 and 75 percent of the value of transfers made in 2025 (the extreme retroactivity of the latter provision will certainly be challenged), but as written, the initiative incorporates 75 percent of the value of transfers made in 2025 but the full value of property held by any trust to which property was transferred in 2026. This would expose the entire trust to taxation as if it were the taxpayer’s wealth.

Curiously, a provision providing for proportional allocations if multiple people contributed to the same trust suggests that the 2026 treatment is not a drafting error, even though its implications are hard to comprehend as intentional policy and are inconsistent with the “ordinary” treatment of transfers made in 2025.[15]

Second, net worth includes “the value of any property the individual transferred . . . for less than fair market value after October 15, 2025,” provided that property’s value exceeds $1 million. This is intended to address a scenario under which a covered taxpayer “sells” an asset to a friend or family member for a trivial or deeply discounted amount, but in a way that is not a consideration-free transfer that would be disregarded under other anti-avoidance rules. As written, however, the amount added back to net worth is the entire value of the transfer, not the difference between the sale price and fair market value. If the FTB reviews a billionaire’s sale of an asset and concludes that it was underpriced, intentionally or otherwise, this provision could require that tax be paid as if the asset was never sold and was still in the possession of the taxpayer.

Elsewhere in the proposal, drafters are at pains to establish that the fair market value of an asset “shall not be . . . [t]he price that a forced sale of the property would produce,”[16] but in practice, the need to obtain liquidity to pay the tax could force taxpayers to sell assets at prices well below their ordinary market value. If a taxpayer began selling assets in 2026 in anticipation of 2027 tax liability, and did so at a discount, they could theoretically be taxed on both the forgone asset and the income it brought in. The FTB may choose not to take such an aggressive posture, but the language creates meaningful risk.

Marriage and Divorce Can Both Lead to Over-Taxation

The wealth tax’s aggressive residency rules can establish a billionaire as a California resident for wealth tax purposes even if they are not domiciled in California and are a resident in another state for income tax purposes. Consequently, it is possible for one spouse to have wealth tax residency and the other not to, even if they do not live apart by ordinary definitions. A nonresident spouse’s wealth is included in the covered taxpayer’s net worth for wealth tax purposes.

Additionally, whether one or both spouses are California residents, the tax is imposed at a household level, so a couple with a combined net worth of $1 billion or more is subject to the tax, whereas two unmarried individuals with just under $1 billion apiece would not be taxed.

These peculiarities might lead a sufficiently tax-motivated couple to revisit their marriage vows: until they are parted by death or taxes. A timely divorce could yield substantial tax savings, especially if a nonresident billionaire spouse’s wealth is swept into the tax. Whether California would acknowledge the divorce or treat it as an avoidance strategy and disregard it is unclear.

An even thornier issue arises if a billionaire couple divorces in 2026 without tax savings in mind. Debts to related persons are added back to net worth if incurred after October 15, 2025,[17] and a related person is defined as “any person that is related to the taxpayer . . . as of January 1, 2026.”[18] If a divorce resulted in a division of assets, any indebtedness to the taxpayer’s ex-spouse would be treated as if no such debt was incurred, with those assets still subject to tax.

Taxpayers could avoid this trap by finalizing divorce terms and paying out by year’s end,[19] but in some cases, they may be constrained by liquidity issues, exacerbated by the tax bill coming due.

Deferral Regimes Raise Costs and Introduce Risk

Taxpayers subject to the proposed wealth tax have the option of remitting the entire amount with their tax payment for 2026 (by April 2027) or paying it in five annual installments, subject to a 7.5 percent annual deferral charge on the remaining unpaid balance. With deferral charges, the effective rate becomes 5.75 percent of asset value as of December 31, 2026.

Investments can, of course, lose value. Businesses can fail. If an illiquid taxpayer whose wealth is tied up in their business elects to pay over five years and their net worth declines sharply during that period, then they are still liable based on their net worth as measured at the end of 2026. They could owe substantial tax on wealth that no longer exists.

Certain liquidity-constrained taxpayers would be eligible for Optional Deferral Accounts (ODA), under which tax would be owed every time income from non-traded assets was realized or any withdrawal or transfer was made, until the tax indebtedness was paid in full. Functionally, the state becomes a co-investor in the assets. If these assets appreciate in value over time, California can tax the additional accumulated wealth even if the taxpayer has long since left the state. But unlike with the five-year deferral option, if the assets decline in value, California is also a partner in that reduction in value.

These accounts are only available to those with wealth tax liability in excess of the combined value of their publicly traded assets.[20] Because capital gains tax would have to be paid on publicly traded assets sold to satisfy wealth tax liability, it would be possible for a taxpayer to have publicly traded assets worth more than their wealth tax liability but still be insufficiently liquid to cover actual liability—and be ineligible for an ODA.

Some of the language surrounding ODAs is ambiguous. However, eligibility for an ODA is a threshold question of whether publicly traded assets exceed liability, but once a taxpayer is eligible to maintain an ODA, they can only attach assets to the account “to the extent that the amount of additional tax that would be owed . . . (without the use of an ODA) would exceed the sum of the combined value of all the taxpayers’ [publicly traded] assets.”[21] This suggests that any taxpayer using an ODA must first liquidate all traded assets and use them to satisfy whatever portion of wealth tax liability they can, attaching assets to the ODA for the residual amount owed.

Founders with Class B super-voting shares may be able to place those shares in an ODA to avoid the need to divest control of the company, but only after selling off all other tradable assets other than personally owned real property. Their remaining liability would still be based on the expansive asset valuation based on voting rights rather than actual ownership, and they would owe 5 percent on any material distributions until tax liability was fully satisfied. Entering into an ODA also subjects taxpayers to California personal jurisdiction indefinitely and binds them to whatever contractual terms and regulatory requirements the state devises for assets attached to the deferral account, which may prove restrictive.

Conclusion

The California Billionaire Wealth Tax ballot initiative, through a mix of intentionally aggressive policy design and potentially inadvertent drafting choices, would impose liability far in excess of 5 percent of net worth for many taxpayers.

Any wealth tax imposes significant economic costs, and the impact of a state-level tax of 5 percent is likely to be particularly severe. But 5 percent is a profound understatement. The initiative systematically overvalues assets, exacerbating the proposed tax’s economic harm and enhancing the case for outmigration to avoid such an aggressive, economically destructive tax.

The initiative’s drafters sought to forestall an exodus by selecting a January 1, 2026, date for determining residency, but that provision is highly susceptible to legal challenge. Given the many ways that tax liability can far outstrip the advertised 5 percent rate, many billionaires may wish to test the validity of that residency standard if the tax appears poised for passage, depriving the state of jobs, investment, and existing tax revenue from some of the key players in California’s economy.

However, some flat roofs may be better suited to smaller solar canopies that act as elevated shade structures on shared rooftops.

Rooftop canopies come with a whole different set of structural requirements to attach to buildings than ground-mounted carports and canopies. Instead of poured concrete columns for the foundations, solar canopies are typically attached to the parapet walls or structural beams on a roof.

Brooklyn SolarWorks, a PV contractor based in Brooklyn, New York, saw potential for solar canopies in a city where rooftop gathering spaces far outnumber grass lawns. New York City fire codes require a clear 6-ft path both front-to-back and side-to-side on residential buildings for firefighter access; and roof obstructions like hatches and vent pipes minimized sizing potential for roof-mounted solar projects.

“We knew if [a canopy] was 9-ft high it should meet the fire code requirements,” said Gaelen McKee, president and co-founder of Brooklyn SolarWorks. “We engaged with a design studio and an engineer, and we finally got this concept, and we brought it to a fabricator and made a prototype.”

The company iterated on that first solar canopy, making it lighter and faster to install, but still able to withstand the elements on New York City rooftops. Brooklyn SolarWorks was manufacturing aluminum canopy structures for its own projects, but other contractors around the country also wanted to build these arrays. So, Brooklyn SolarWorks started distributing them under the name Brooklyn Solar Canopy Co.

“It finally flipped so that we’re actually selling more canopies third-party than we are using ourselves,” McKee said.

Brooklyn Solar Canopy produces four different types of canopies and carports. Its A-Frame and Post-Truss structures can be installed on the ground or roof.

The A-Frame uses pairs of triangular supports attached at the top to trusses, and guiding rails hold the solar panels. Post-Truss uses upright columns for foundations, and supporting trusses run along the exterior and between column rows, with module-guiding rails atop.

Canopy components can be hoisted or, if there is enough space in the stairwell, carried by hand to the roof.

Installing a solar canopy requires reviewing building blueprints to determine what size rafters are under the roof surface, how far they’re spaced apart and their material. Base tracks on columns are positioned parallel to the top of a masonry/parapet wall or other roof surface so lag bolts can be driven perpendicularly into the rafters, which are often wooden. Attachment points should be spread across different rafters for proper load distribution.

“So, all the point loading is not on the masonry wall, but right inside of it, on the wood,” McKee said. “We will sometimes mount those structures to the actual parapet walls themselves, but because it’s New York, because its building stock is 150 to 200 years old, a lot of that brick is fairly degraded. You’re in a better position to fasten to the wood, just because the brick can be pretty crumbly and uneven.”

In new construction projects where fresh concrete is poured, the canopy can be bolted directly into the concrete wall. Solar States, a residential and commercial PV contractor based in Philadelphia, has made solar canopy projects a regular part of its output, and many of those elevated arrays have been installed on new or recently built homes.

Many Philadelphians add shade structures to town- or rowhouses with roof access — locally known as “roof decks.” Solar States wanted solar canopies as an option for Philly roof decks, but the city initially considered them an “unknown use.” They weren’t traditional rooftop solar or a canopy. They were considered an auxiliary structure and required individual zoning variance with each project.

“If you look around Philadelphia, there’s tons of people that go to Home Depot and buy a backyard patio or pergola and just throw it up on the roof. That’s not permitted,” said Jared Pashko, director of sales and marketing at Solar States. “We need to do everything permitted, and in order to get it permitted, it needs to be structurally stamped.”

The company successfully advocated for a piece of legislation that codified solar canopies for rooftop construction within the city. Every city will have individual quirks for this type of solar project.

When building solar canopies in Philadelphia, Solar States isn’t covering the entire roof. These 5- to 8-kW arrays often occupy about one-third of the space, due to obstructions like stairwell enclosures on roofs.

There’s more material involved in building a solar canopy than a traditional rooftop solar project, but Pashko said the costs are comparable to having a non-PV shade structure built on a roof — except these ones are creating more living space in a home while increasing its property value and saving on energy costs.

“I think that being able to offer that to homeowners is great. Separately, for solar contractors, it opened up a new market segment for us,” he said. “We’re able to install high-profit-margin projects that customers are asking for where there’s not a lot of competition, and that’s a really great thing. It gives us more resources at our disposal to deploy solar and transition to a sustainable economy.”",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/solar-states-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 22:58:10.375203

In March, residential customers will experience another approximately $11 decrease – meaning their bills will be $44 lower when compared to January

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., Jan. 14, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Duke Energy Florida announced that the storm cost recovery charge – the result of costs associated with the company's approximately $1.1 billion response to hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton – will be removed from customers' bills a month earlier than originally scheduled.

What this means

Because the full amount for all three storms was recovered ahead of schedule, beginning in February (instead of March):

Residential customers can expect an approximately $33 reduction on their monthly bills, when compared to January, for every 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity they use.

Commercial and industrial customers' monthly bills will be lowered between 9.6% and 15.8%, also when compared to January, though the specific impact will vary depending on several factors.

Our view

""We understand all of our customers have been affected by the rising costs of living, many may be facing financial challenges, and some are even having to decide which bills they can afford to pay every month,"" said Melissa Seixas, Duke Energy Florida state president. ""It was important to us that our customers get this significant rate relief as soon as possible while we continue to deliver the safe, reliable power they expect and deserve.""

More savings coming soon

In March, residential customers will experience another approximately $11 decrease (per 1,000 kWh) on their monthly bills, reflecting a seasonal decrease that Duke Energy Florida institutes annually (March-November) to help customers save money during times when energy use is typically higher.

This means, when compared to January, their March bills will be approximately $44 lower – again, per 1,000 kWh.

Even more savings

Recently, the company also:

Made efficiency improvements at many of its natural gas plants (see here), saving customers $340 million in fuel costs

This translates to $10 savings on customers' monthly bills

Completed three new solar energy sites (see here and here), saving customers another $750 million from displaced fuel costs

Passed on $65 million in Inflation Reduction Act tax credits to customers

This saves residential customers at least $2.50 per 1,000 kWh

Help is available

While Duke Energy Florida is focused on keeping its own costs in check, the company is committed to connecting customers with practical ways to save energy and manage their bills, including flexible payment plans. For more information, please visit duke-energy.com/SeasonalSavings.

It offers a 30% investment tax credit for recycling infrastructure, including advanced recycling facilities.
Advanced recycling stands out as a transformative, converting materials that traditional recycling rejects into valuable components.
While SB 54 does not directly regulate advanced recycling, its ambitious requirements make advanced recycling an attractive compliance tool.","The recycling industry, traditionally seen as stable, is in an era of innovation and growth. A class of advanced recycling technologies is emerging to address plastics that conventional recycling methods cannot process, converting materials like mixed film and multilayer packaging into reusable chemical ingredients. While some of the core processes have been around for decades, what’s new is how these technologies are being refined, scaled, and integrated into circular-economy strategies. Modern applications are quickly gaining momentum as brands pursue circularity, states enforce waste-reduction measures, and artificial intelligence-driven efficiencies enhance processing. What started as a promising concept is quickly becoming one of the most closely followed growth stories in the materials sector.

To provide context for this growth, it is notable that Precedence Research recently projected that the advanced recycling market would reach US$7.26 billion by 2035, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.16%.1 Meanwhile, Future Markets, Inc. projected market revenues to exceed US$15 billion by 2040, with CAGRs exceeding 25%.2 Evaluating the broader chemical recycling-service market, Knowledgeable Sourcing Intelligence projected a US$196.2 billion valuation by 2035 based on market growth at a CAGR of 25.8%.3

However, despite these optimistic projections, the industry must contend with opposition from traditional recyclers and environmentalists, as well as with a complicated, ever-changing, and frequently uncertain regulatory landscape characterized by changing definitions, fluctuating state and federal regulations, and continuous discussions about classification and oversight. Successfully managing compliance and innovation depends on effectively navigating this framework. Key challenges to be faced in 2026 are outlined below.

The Clean Air Act: How Should Advanced Recycling Operations Be Regulated?

How advanced recycling operations are regulated under the Clean Air Act (CAA) depends on the technology employed. Currently, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates facilities that combust nonhazardous waste in a starved-air primary chamber and afterburner—such as those using pyrolysis, gasification, or other thermochemical conversion technologies—as solid waste incinerators. These facilities must meet the strict Other Solid Waste Incineration (OSWI) standards outlined in Section 129 of the CAA. This includes adhering to Maximum Achievable Control Technology emission limits for nine specific pollutants, conducting performance tests, continuous emissions monitoring, maintaining operating limits, keeping records, submitting reports, and often obtaining Title V permits.

While facilities complying with the OSWI standards face significant compliance costs and operational challenges, in contrast, facilities that utilize non-combustion-based decomposition methods (such as solvolysis or enzymolysis) or physical purification techniques (like dissolution) are subject to less stringent, category-specific emission standards under the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.

Notably, this regulatory framework could undergo changes in the near future. Under the Trump administration, the EPA has signaled possible revisions to how pyrolysis and similar units are regulated under the CAA.4 Specifically, in 2021, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) to gather feedback on whether to continue classifying pyrolysis units under OSWI rules. Possible outcomes of the ANPRM include maintaining the current standards, streamlining permitting and monitoring requirements, or establishing a new category for advanced recycling with customized standards. A decision not to regulate thermochemical conversion technologies as solid waste incinerators could dramatically reduce compliance costs and accelerate innovation for thermochemical technologies. However, it remains unclear if the EPA will take such action. Environmental groups are opposed, arguing that pyrolysis and gasification units combust waste and emit pollutants similar to traditional incinerators, and that removing pyrolysis units from OSWI classification or creating a separate category with customized standards will weaken air protections.

RCRA: Is Advanced Recycling Waste Disposal or Manufacturing?

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) sets the federal framework for managing both hazardous and non-hazardous waste. RCRA applies when the material being processed qualifies as “solid waste” under 40 C.F.R. § 261.2 and, if so, whether it is classified as hazardous. A material is considered solid waste if it is discarded—whether abandoned, recycled in certain ways, or inherently waste-like. It becomes hazardous waste if it exhibits hazardous characteristics or appears on the EPA’s hazardous waste lists.

Because advanced recycling typically uses waste plastics as feedstock to produce new materials, these operations often fall within RCRA’s scope. However, states that administer their own waste programs have significant discretion to define what constitutes “waste” and determine whether specific processes are regulated as waste management activities.

If a state concludes that advanced recycling turns discarded plastics into feedstock for new products without creating major disposal concerns, it may classify these operations as manufacturing rather than waste management. This classification can significantly reduce the applicability of RCRA requirements.

Opponents argue that this approach weakens environmental protections by removing stringent waste management standards and creates inconsistencies compared to other recycling operations. According to the opponents, while converting old plastics into new plastic products can reasonably be considered recycling, advanced recycling operations that convert plastic waste into fuels or energy rather than new plastic products is not recycling. They contend that labeling these processes as “recycling” is inconsistent with standards applied to other materials and warn that applying a different standard to plastics risks undermining recycling integrity and environmental protections. Industry advocates counter that converting plastics into fuels or energy should still count as recycling because it recovers value from hard-to-recycle plastics that would otherwise be landfilled or incinerated without energy recovery. Despite these concerns, since 2017, 25 states have taken this approach to encourage innovation and cut landfill use. They now treat advanced recycling as manufacturing instead of waste disposal. This shift offers big advantages. Facilities labeled as manufacturers often face fewer hazardous waste rules under RCRA. For example, if a recycler converts plastic waste into valuable feedstock—such as a solvolysis plant breaking down PET bottles into monomers—the plastic may not meet the definition of “solid waste” under RCRA Subtitle C. That could exempt the material from RCRA waste management requirements.

A manufacturing designation can also help operators argue that their entire process counts as a single Manufacturing Process Unit. This allows them to manage certain hazardous wastes without triggering strict permitting and tracking rules. It may also help recyclers avoid being classified as a Treatment, Storage, or Disposal Facility, or TSDF, which carries heavy compliance burdens.

Not all states agree. Some explicitly regulate advanced recycling as solid waste management. One state has even banned certain advanced recycling facilities. For this reason, location plays a critical role in determining whether an operation will succeed.

Toxic Substances Control Act: Are Chemical Products Derived From Advanced Plastics Recycling “New Chemicals Substances”?

Like the Clean Air Act and RCRA, advanced recyclers face uncertainty under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The big question is whether chemicals made from recycled plastics are classified as “new chemical substances.” If they do, they must undergo rigorous pre-market review. If not, they’re treated like existing regulated products.

Under TSCA, any chemical not listed on the EPA Inventory is considered new. Before it can be sold, the company must file a Pre-Manufacture Notice (PMN). EPA then reviews the chemical for safety. If data is lacking or risks appear serious, EPA issues a Section 5(e) order. That order can restrict or stop production until more information is provided. Later, EPA often formalizes these limits through Significant New Use Rules (SNURs), which require companies to notify EPA before using the chemical in new ways.

In August 2022, the EPA issued a Section 5(e) Consent Order to a major fuel producer for five PMN substances made from plastic waste. A community group challenged the order in court, citing cancer risks from contaminants. By mid-2023, EPA proposed SNURs for 18 similar substances. These SNURs targeted feedstocks with PFAS, heavy metals, dioxins, BPA, and other toxins. The rules would have required prior notice before using these plastics in advanced recycling or downstream manufacturing, or in fuel applications. However, due to ongoing litigation, the EPA withdrew both the Section 5(e) Consent Order and the proposed SNURs. That move left the industry in limbo. Future SNURs could reshape compliance obligations for recyclers, refiners, and manufacturers.

The Trump administration has indicated it plans to require impurity testing for new chemicals from waste plastics on a case-by-case basis. So far, that has not happened. Many PMNs remain pending. Companies do not know what rules will apply. Manufacturers, importers, and businesses in biotech, advanced materials, and consumer products need to stay alert. EPA’s next steps could change the game.

The Clean Water Act

The Clean Water Act (CWA) governs pollutant discharges into US waters, and advanced recycling facilities, particularly those using chemical processes, are subject to its requirements. Operations that discharge process water or wastewater must obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, which sets limits on pollutants and requires monitoring and reporting. Facilities also need to manage stormwater runoff from feedstock storage and chemical handling to prevent contamination during rain events or spills.

Environmental groups are calling for stronger water protections, arguing that current CWA standards do not adequately address chemical contaminants associated with advanced recycling processes, including PFAS, heavy metals, and dioxins. They urge the EPA to update effluent guidelines and to require comprehensive monitoring and reporting for wastewater and stormwater discharges. Advocates also emphasize the need for advanced treatment technologies to ensure hazardous substances are removed before water is released into the environment. In their view, exemptions or relaxed standards would undermine public health and environmental integrity, making robust oversight essential. Additional concerns include stormwater runoff from feedstock storage, accidental spills, and thermal pollution from process water—issues critics believe demand stringent monitoring, treatment standards, and transparent reporting to prevent contamination of surface and groundwater.

How Might Federal Legislative Proposals Impact Advanced Recycling

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are pushing initiatives to boost recycling and clarify rules for advanced recycling. One proposal, the Accelerating a Circular Economy for Plastics and Recycling Innovation Act, would set national standards for plastics recycling. It calls for plastic packaging to include at least 30% recycled content by 2030 and defines advanced recycling as a manufacturing process, not waste disposal. If passed, this would standardize definitions and reduce regulatory uncertainty.

Another bill, the Cultivating Investment in Recycling and Circular Local Economies (CIRCLE) Act, takes a financial approach. It offers a 30% investment tax credit for recycling infrastructure, including advanced recycling facilities. This could lower capital costs and speed up adoption of advanced recycling technologies, making them more competitive.

Together, these legislative changes—harmonized federal standards and new financial incentives—could open doors for growth and reshape compliance strategies, investment plans, and market positioning.

Extended Producer Responsibility: How Extended Producer Responsibility Laws Are Affecting Advanced Recycling

States are taking bold steps on waste management, with Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) laws leading the way. By late 2025, California, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington had rolled out EPR programs for packaging. These laws make producers responsible for post-consumer packaging and link costs to recyclability and environmental impact, thereby pushing investment into technology that tackles hard-to-recycle plastics. Advanced recycling is emerging as a game-changing solution. It turns materials traditional recycling rejects into valuable components, helping producers hit sustainability targets, and cut fees under certain regulations.

Advanced recycling stands out as a transformative, converting materials that traditional recycling rejects into valuable components. This not only helps producers achieve sustainability goals but also reduces fees under certain environmental regulations.

California’s SB 54, the Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act, exemplifies this trend. By 2032, all regulated packaging must be recyclable or compostable, plastic use must decline by 25%, and recycling rates must reach 65%. While SB 54 does not directly regulate advanced recycling, its ambitious requirements make advanced recycling an attractive compliance tool. Proposed regulations would allow producers to leverage advanced recycling to meet reduction and recyclability goals without completely redesigning packaging. Still, companies must navigate federal rules under RCRA and TSCA, since chemical recycling feedstocks can trigger hazardous waste or new substance reviews.

To succeed, businesses need a proactive strategy—partnering on advanced recycling, tracking lifecycle impacts, and staying on top of regulations.

Conclusion

Advanced recycling has huge growth potential. But in 2026, success depends on agility.

That move came after the city’s first large scale response tied to an electric vehicle. The Chattanooga Fire Department says a fire broke out at an apartment complex in the early morning hours of Nov. 22, 2024. Fire officials ruled the fire an accident and traced it to an electric vehicle charging in the parking garage.

After that fire, the condominium complex moved to stop electric vehicle charging.

Some residents later sued, arguing the complex overreached.

We are now hearing from a former HOA president who says the conversation around electric vehicles started years earlier.

“At some point during the four years I was president of the HOA, we had a handful, very small handful, and there's still a small handful of EV owners, they requested the ability to plug into some existing electrical outlets in the garage,” said Buck Tasker, a One North Shore resident and former HOA president.

Tasker says those electric vehicle owners were allowed to charge in the garage at the time.

A lawsuit filed against the current HOA board says that changed in July 2025.

Tasker says discussions about electric vehicles and how to handle them happened while he served as HOA president, but intensified after the 2024 fire at a nearby garage on Frazier Avenue.

The fire at 417 Frazier Avenue in 2024 burned for more than an hour and destroyed or damaged dozens of vehicles.

Tasker says the board noticed power issues in the aftermath of that fire.

“Some of those EV chargers were tripping those breakers and causing the fire alarm to go off because they were drawing too much power,” Tasker said. “The building has no infrastructure for EV charging when it was built in 2008.”

Attorney Herbert Thornbury lives at 417 Frazier Avenue, where the 2024 fire happened. He is not involved in the current lawsuit, but says the fire left a lasting impact.

“This fire just raged for how long, hour and 20 minutes. They couldn’t put it out,” Thornbury said.

He says four of his vehicles were lost, and nearly 20 cars in total were destroyed or heavily damaged.

“19 cars down here, they were all totaled, smoke damage,” Thornbury said.

Thornbury says it is difficult to predict how the lawsuit will play out.

“The litigation is incredibly complicated, you can imagine, you know, to get an expert to figure out where the fire started,” he said. He added, “I don't think that the lawsuit's going anywhere.”

There is good news from Carbon Brief this week. It reports that the use of coal to generate electricity fell in both China and India in 2025 — the first time that has happened simultaneously in both countries in more than fifty years. It says electricity generation from coal in India fell by 3% year-on-year (57 TWh) and in China by 1.6% (58TWh).

The decrease in coal-powered thermal generation coincides with an increase in renewable energy last year. That increase was more than enough to meet rising demand for electricity in both countries. “Both countries now have the preconditions in place for peaking coal fired power, if China is able to sustain clean energy growth and India meets its renewable energy targets,” Carbon Brief says.

“These shifts have international implications, as the power sectors of these two countries drove 93 percent of the rise in global carbon dioxide emissions from 2015 to 2024. Challenges remain, but the decline in coal power output in both countries “marks an historic moment, which could help lead to a peak in global emissions,” according to Carbon Brief.

Maybe. The energy mix in any country is the result of a number of factors. Hydropower goes up when reservoirs are full but declines when water levels decline. Weather is a major factor, as colder temperatures increase the need to heat buildings, while hotter temperatures drive up the demand for cooling.

In China, demand for electricity increased by 5% in 2025, but it was more than offset by the increase in renewables, particularly solar. But there are recent policy changes in China that could impact its ability to supply the super cheap solar panels that have transformed how electricity is used in much of Africa and in Pakistan.

Policy Changes

According to The Energy Mix, last year China removed a policy that gave solar panel manufacturers a guaranteed rate of return. Export incentives have also been reduced or eliminated. Those regulatory changes have caused many observers, including the International Energy Agency, to predict there will be less solar power to be installed in 2026, even if the decrease is modest. But once the industry adapts to the new regulatory environment, the IEA expects solar installations to tick upwards again in 2027.

While an increase in the availability of renewable energy in China and India has suppressed the demand for coal power, locking in future declines in coal generation will depend on meeting a series of challenges. First, power grids will need to be operated more flexibly to accommodate the increasing amount of renewable energy available. That means updating old power market structures that were built to serve coal-fired generating stations in China and India.

Both countries have continued to add new coal-fired power capacity. If the number of coal-powered generating stations under construction and permitted are completed, they would increase coal power capacity by 28% in China and 23% in India.

The necessary result of bringing more coal power online will be a decrease in the utilization rates of those facilities, which will drive up the cost of operating them and lead to higher costs for grid supplied electricity. In the longer term, new coal capacity would have to be slowed substantially while retirements are accelerated in order to make space for further expansion of clean energy in the power systems of the two countries.

Carbon Brief says power generation in China and India were responsible for more than 90% of the increase in global CO2 emissions from all sources between 2015 and 2024, with 78% attributable to China and 16% to India. Therefore, reducing emissions from their electricity generating sectors is the key to lowering global emissions.

US Emissions Rise

In marked contrasts to the good news from China and India, the latest report from the Rhodium Group claims that greenhouse gas emissions in the US rose 2.4% last year. “The increase in emissions was driven primarily by the buildings and power sectors. Colder winter temperatures drove higher space heating demand in buildings, pushing up direct emissions from fuel use in buildings by 6.8 percent. Higher natural gas prices and growing power demand boosted coal electricity generation, resulting in a 3.8 percent rise in power sector emissions,” the report said.

“The increase in 2025 emissions was driven by increases of 6.8 percent in the buildings sector and 3.8 percent in the power sector. Transportation remained the highest-emitting sector, though emissions rose only slightly by 0.1 percent from 2024 levels. Emissions rose more modestly in the industrial and oil & gas sectors.”

Data centers, cryptocurrency mining operations, and other large load customers drove electricity demand up by 2.4%, with most of the increase occurring in Texas, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Ohio Valley regions. Electricity to charge battery-powered vehicles was also a factor in the increased demand.

The main driver of higher coal use, the Rhodium Group says, was higher natural gas prices, which were up 58% at Henry Hub in 2025 compared to the very low prices recorded in 2024. An increase in the export of liquefied natural gas drove up methane prices substantially, as the current administration’s all out attempt to make the US great again leaves more and more people in America worse off financially.

Simple Economics

A first year business school student would know that when supplies go down, prices go up, but apparently the Moron of Mar-A-Loco was absent that week — or that year, as the case may be. Because of the wrong-headed policies of the US administration, fewer coal-fired generating stations were retired last year than in 2024. Through November, only 2.5 GW of conventional steam coal capacity was retired, compared with 4.5 GW in 2024 and an average of nearly 9 GW a year since 2020.

The fastest growing power generation source in 2025 was solar, which surged by 34%, the report said. That is the highest growth rate since 2017 and pushed the grid share of zero-emitting sources up by one percentage point to 42%, despite only a modest increase in wind and flat nuclear and hydroelectric generation. Natural gas remained the single largest source of electricity, though it fell by nearly three percentage points to 40% of the grid mix.

The US Emissions Picture Has Changed

In this year’s report, the Rhodium Group has lowered its projections for future decreases in US emissions since 2005 from 38 to 56% by 2035 to 26 to 35%. “This slowdown is largely due to changes to energy tax credits made by the 119th Congress in the 2025 budget reconciliation bill and the repeal of climate regulations by the Trump administration,” it said in its latest report.

“Apart from some modest contributions to increased coal generation from Department of Energy orders to keep a few plants running, we aren’t yet seeing the direct effects of these policy changes in US emissions. That could change in the coming year or two, particularly if data center electricity demand continues to surge and the grid responds with more output from existing fossil generators instead of new, clean resources. The growth in electric vehicles, which has in part helped keep a lid on transportation sector emissions, may also stall in the absence of federal tax credits and regulatory policies.”

Bury The Data

“Beyond policy changes that will result in higher emissions, the Trump administration has also moved to stop collecting and reporting a multitude of data on GHG emissions and climate change. Two of these data products in particular — the EPA’s annual GHG inventory and its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program for major emitting facilities — are integral inputs to our work,” the Rhodium report says.

“Typically, we would expect EPA to give the US its final GHG report card for 2025 in spring 2027. However, EPA only released the 2023 inventory earlier this year when compelled by a Freedom of Information Act request, and most of the work had already been completed under the Biden administration. Given the Trump administration’s hostility to collecting and reporting data related to climate change, we may not receive any further inventories under this administration.” [Emphasis added.]

“The loss of this data means we are heading into murkier waters when it comes to understanding the second-largest emitter of GHGs in the world. While US emissions rose, 2025 was the second or third hottest year on record across the globe. Because emissions and their impacts persist even when the government does not count them, we will continue to adapt to this new landscape in order to inform critical US energy and climate policy debates.”

Yet over 70 million mostly white Americans who style themselves as devoted Christians voted to put this fat buffoon in office.

Making America Irrelevant

Whether America will ever be great again will depend on people coming to the senses. Based on the observable evidence, that is not likely to happen anytime soon. People in positions of power delight in pushing others down because they view equality as a form of punishment.

Until we fix that misconception, America will never be more than an afterthought, an historical anomaly like Carthage or Rome — entities that enjoyed a period in the sun and then became irrelevant. The blather and bluster emanating from the White Man’s House today is reminiscent of this soliloquy from the Shakespeare play Macbeth.

Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,

Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,

To the last syllable of recorded time;

And all our yesterdays have lighted fools

The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!

Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player,

This marks a significant shift from longstanding EPA practice, which typically compared regulatory compliance costs with estimated economic benefits associated with improved health outcomes. The agency detailed its rationale within the power plant rule, noting that declining emissions and evolving science have made impact estimates less precise.

The move has drawn attention because cost-benefit analyses play a central role in shaping federal environmental regulations. Industry groups have previously criticized the EPA’s methods for calculating health benefits, arguing they overstated gains and underestimated uncertainty.

The policy shift is part of a broader set of environmental actions taken under the Trump administration. In recent weeks, the administration has withdrawn the United States from several international climate-focused organizations and signaled plans to revise federal authority over greenhouse gas regulations.

The EPA’s new approach may face legal scrutiny. Courts have historically required agencies to weigh both costs and benefits when issuing regulations. Any challenges would likely focus on whether the revised framework meets established administrative standards.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01142026-EPA-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 20:59:27.616461

Opportunities of On-Site Power Traditional industrial development models have assumed that utilities could reliably deliver new or upgraded service within a project’s construction window.
On-site generation can accelerate project readiness and reduce operational risk, but it remains a capital asset subject to regulatory, legal, and operational considerations.
Manufacturing and industrial operations once accepted occasional outages as part of doing business, but today they cannot.
For owners and developers, on-site generation offers a direct way to secure the power needed to keep projects on schedule.","Advanced manufacturers, large campus developers, and economic development agencies increasingly face delays between an approved site plan and a production-ready facility because they lack timely and dependable access to adequate electric power. After nearly two decades of flat electricity demand, the United States has entered a new era of accelerated load growth driven by reshored manufacturing, process electrification, and growing power needs driven by data centers and artificial intelligence applications that now compete directly with industrial users for capacity. Utilities are working to expand transmission and distribution systems, but long interconnection queues, equipment backlogs, and multiyear planning cycles are extending timelines well beyond what project finance structures or market windows can support.

For manufacturers and industrial operators, this is now an investment decision. Waiting for grid access stalls investments, delays revenue generation, and prolongs operational uncertainty. On-site power generation removes that constraint by providing immediate, controllable electricity that keeps projects moving, protects critical processes, and decouples growth from external bottlenecks.

Increasingly, the difference between stalled and scaled growth comes down to a power infrastructure decision.

Realities of Grid Strain

Utility forecasts and market projections show a sharp rise in national peak demand as grid operators replace aging generation and accommodate unprecedented load growth driven by data center campuses. This tightening supply-demand balance means many manufacturers now face extended, uncertain interconnection timelines — often stretching five to 10 years — along with unpredictable long-term energy costs and heightened exposure to reliability risks tied to grid congestion and aging infrastructure.

While data centers illustrate the extremes of this demand landscape, manufacturing plants, chemical facilities, and industrial parks face similar exposure. Reshoring initiatives, automation investments, and accelerated project schedules make it increasingly impractical to wait for transmission and distribution expansion before beginning operations.

Opportunities of On-Site Power

Traditional industrial development models have assumed that utilities could reliably deliver new or upgraded service within a project’s construction window. Today, multiyear equipment lead times and crowded interconnection queues challenge that expectation.

On-site generation breaks the interconnection and equipment bottleneck. Modular combined heat and power (CHP) systems, fuel cells, and solar-plus-storage solutions can be designed, permitted, and commissioned in months rather than years, potentially delivering power on a timeline years faster than waiting for grid upgrades. The result is a direct path from groundbreaking to production while maintaining control and managing development risk.

CHP systems typically deliver energy savings of 30 percent to 40 percent when thermal loads are integrated. Industrial solar installations frequently reach payback in under five years, strengthening the business case for hybrid or fully on-site solutions.

Protecting Operations Against Disruption

Modern manufacturing tolerates little downtime. A single loss of power can cost millions in lost output, damage sensitive equipment, or trigger contract penalties and regulatory issues. On-site generation capable of islanded operation — meaning it can operate independently from the grid — provides resilience by sustaining operations during outages. When paired with battery storage, these systems also mitigate short-duration voltage sags, frequency instability, and other power-quality disturbances that could otherwise disrupt production processes.

Additionally, many manufacturers that invest in on-site generation can participate in grid support programs. Providing demand response, frequency regulation, or backup capacity can qualify facilities for revenue opportunities or utility incentives. Flexible on-site assets give facility owners more control over energy spend while contributing to broader grid reliability.

What On-Site Power Entails

Developing an effective on-site generation strategy begins with a master plan, a long-range framework that aligns generation investments with expansion, resilience, modernization, and sustainability objectives. This planning effort requires detailed electrical load studies for current operations and future scenarios, including seasonal peaks and expansion phases. It also requires comprehensive site analysis to determine optimal locations for generation assets based on major loads, land availability, and fuel access. The plan must include defined contingency and resilience strategies outlining how the facility will operate during grid events, as well as environmental and permitting assessments covering air quality, noise, and stakeholder engagement requirements.

A well-structured master plan allows owners to evaluate capital costs, operations and maintenance requirements, federal tax credits, utility incentives, and potential financing models such as power purchase agreements or energy-as-a-service structures that reduce upfront investment and shift technical risk to specialized partners.

On-site generation can accelerate project readiness and reduce operational risk, but it remains a capital asset subject to regulatory, legal, and operational considerations. Solutions must meet interconnection rules, air permitting requirements, and utility standby power policies. Early engagement with regulators and utilities helps eliminate development bottlenecks and clarifies technical expectations. Aggregated distributed generation or microgrid configurations can further increase flexibility and strengthen negotiating leverage for large industrial parks.

Master Planning and Forecasting for On-Site Power

New on-site generation may require upgrades to existing electrical distribution systems, process steam networks, or cooling infrastructure. Facilities built decades ago often have electrical equipment sized for lower loads than modern production demands, prompting upgrades to transformers, switchgear, or circuit protection. Thermal networks may need reconfiguration to fully capture and distribute waste heat from CHP systems.

Such infrastructure upgrades can be the largest cost driver after generation equipment itself. Evaluating them early during master planning allows owners to sequence investments, negotiate realistic lead times with suppliers, and synchronize upgrades with broader modernization initiatives.

Road maps should outline phased investment and define key decision milestones such as site selection, procurement, permitting, and commissioning. Road maps should also establish go-live targets and key performance metrics. Regular updates help align the plan with evolving market conditions, operational needs, and project constraints. On large campuses, phased deployment aligns generation additions with facility expansion, spreads capital requirements, and allows early-phase assets to generate returns while later phases advance.

The Path Forward

Power availability can no longer be assumed and grid reliability is no longer guaranteed. Manufacturing and industrial operations once accepted occasional outages as part of doing business, but today they cannot. The shift toward mission-critical production environments requires a new approach to energy resilience.

Advanced manufacturing depends on precision, speed, and control. Yet interconnection backlogs, equipment bottlenecks, and accelerating load growth increasingly threaten those requirements. On-site generation provides a practical alternative — the ability to secure reliable, high-quality power on a schedule defined by the project rather than the grid.

For owners and developers, on-site generation offers a direct way to secure the power needed to keep projects on schedule. The choice directly influences a facility’s schedule, operational reliability, and long-term growth.",https://cdn9.areadevelopment.com/article_images/id3093_on-site-energy1000.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 11:03:19.302583

His first such job was in a Times Square hotel with Jewish owners, a Pakistani manager, and a Nigerian bellman.
Against the intense glow of neon lights, Hiatt found himself considering morality, sacrifice, and his own values and their impacts.
In 2007, the couple’s big city adventure ended for the best possible reason: the arrival of their baby boy.
He started as a contract operator on the docks and in the finished tank farm where the jet fuel, gas and diesel were stored.","For James Hiatt, the 43 year old founder and director of For a Better Bayou, a nonprofit seeking to foster alternatives to the fossil fuel economy in Southwestern Louisiana, the oil and gas industry isn’t just in his blood; it’s in his nostrils.

“My dad worked at Conoco, now Phillips 66. He’d come home in his Nomex [fire retardant garments] smelling like the refinery after 12-hour shifts,” Hiatt said. “He missed a lot of family stuff. I told myself I was never going to work in the refinery.”

Instead, he got married at 19 and moved in 2002 with his wife to New York City, a young couple with a plan: she’d teach school while earning a master’s degree, and he’d pursue rock star dreams and get a day job to help pay the bills.

His first such job was in a Times Square hotel with Jewish owners, a Pakistani manager, and a Nigerian bellman. His previous worldview — conservative, Christian, conformist — was exploded by the diversity. The owner, a Holocaust survivor, had a number tattooed on his arm by the Nazis; the bellman fasted for the entire month of Ramadan while hauling luggage up three or four flights without a sip of water. Against the intense glow of neon lights, Hiatt found himself considering morality, sacrifice, and his own values and their impacts.

“I started recycling. I stopped buying things made by exploited foreign labor just because they were cheaper. The belief structure I’d been given told me that everybody’s burning in hell unless you save them, unless you convince them to believe the way you believe. And that didn’t work for me anymore,” he said.

In 2007, the couple’s big city adventure ended for the best possible reason: the arrival of their baby boy. Returning home to raise him (and later two daughters) among family (who were mostly working in refineries), Hiatt soon got a job at Citgo, a Venezuelan oil company in Lake Charles. He started as a contract operator on the docks and in the finished tank farm where the jet fuel, gas and diesel were stored. When a better paying opportunity came his way in the refinery’s lab, he went for it.

His wallet fattened, but it came at a price. “Like my dad, I was really grouchy working those 12-hour shifts. My poor wife and kids. You know, you only sleep a couple hours, and you’re up to try to do something, and then you’re in a bad mood,” he said.

Those “bad moods” eventually led Hiatt to a 12-step program. Now ten years sober, his personal transformation feeds his professional commitments: if individuals can be released from the grip of self-obliterating addictions, societies can, too. And he set to work to help make it so, first as a campaigner in a nonprofit focused on halting the liquid natural gas (LNG) expansion in the area, and since 2023, at the helm of For A Better Bayou, which more broadly seeks to protect the health, livelihoods, and cultural heritage of Southwest Louisiana amid expanding industrial pollution and accelerating climate impacts. Funding comes from individual donations and through foundation support.

The focus is on opposing harmful fossil fuel infrastructure, while supporting fisherfolk and frontline communities, nurturing community empowerment, advancing coastal restoration and climate resilience efforts, and building pathways toward a just economic transition rooted in local knowledge and stewardship. Hiatt shoulders that work with one paid staff member.

When not meeting with local residents and workers, their days, and not uncommonly evenings and weekends, are spent documenting environmental harms, reviewing permits and regulatory filings, engaging with local, state, and federal agencies, and building coalitions with partner organizations to advance community-led solutions.

“I tell folks, pick whatever lights you up, whatever pisses you off. Is it the LNG buildouts, the data centers, carbon capture? Pick one, and let’s work on that,” he explained.

Hiatt’s ties with big oil weren’t severed in a golden moment of epiphany and grace. He was pushed out — fired in the midst of workplace drama that his union successfully resolved on his behalf, resulting in a payout he used for tuition to retool. He earned a psychology degree while hustling in the gig economy for Grub Hub and Door Dash.

“I was aiming to be a social worker because I love the ability to help people (myself included) stretch beyond the patterns and behaviors we can’t always see that cause the issues — like the externalized costs that are never, ever attributed to these refineries.”",https://bluedotliving.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/the-shift-superfund-site-gate.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 21:00:18.922198

It would be the largest territory the United States ever added, if the United States were to acquire it.
But that has not deterred Mr. Trump and his team so far.
Daniel Immerwahr, a historian at Northwestern University, said Mr. Trump seemed more interested than any other recent president in expanding American borders.
“I love maps,” Mr. Trump said, according to an interview he gave for the book.","In the 19th century, the young United States grew in leaps and bounds.

First there was the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, in which Thomas Jefferson bought from the French a chunk of what is now America’s Midwest, West and South.

Next was the Mexican Cession, in 1848. As part of a peace deal after the Mexican-American war, Mexico handed over territory including what is now California, Nevada and other states.

And then there was the Alaska Purchase, from the Russians, in 1867, which at the time was derided as an icebox and too expensive.

But if President Trump gets his way and, as he has insisted, takes over Greenland “whether they like it or not,” it would be bigger than any of those, according to the National Archives, the U.S. census and the C.I.A. World Factbook. At 836,000 square miles, Greenland is bigger than France, Britain, Spain, Italy and Germany — combined. It would be the largest territory the United States ever added, if the United States were to acquire it.

Mr. Trump has based his fixation on Greenland, which has been part of the Danish Kingdom for more than 300 years, on reasons of “national security,” citing threats from Russia and China. But he made a past remark about Greenland’s size, and scholars say the territorial grandeur itself is at least part of what appeals to him.

“Trump’s a real estate guy,” David Silbey, a historian at Cornell University, said in an email, “and the idea of grabbing that much land seems to me his particular guiding force: THE MOST LAND EVER.”

He added that Mr. Trump “likes to pick on targets that are too weak to fight back, which certainly describes Denmark,” he added.

This week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is meeting to discuss the future of Greenland with Danish and Greenlandic officials, both of whom say that the island, the world’s largest, is not for sale.

But that has not deterred Mr. Trump and his team so far.

In an interview last week with The New York Times, Mr. Trump said the best way for the United States to handle Greenland would be to own it because ownership is “psychologically needed for success.”

Mr. Trump has dismissed the importance of a longstanding American-Danish defense pact that already guarantees the U.S. broad military access in Greenland. During World War II and the Cold War, the United States had thousands of troops and more than a dozen bases on the island; now it has just one.

Daniel Immerwahr, a historian at Northwestern University, said Mr. Trump seemed more interested than any other recent president in expanding American borders. He cited Mr. Trump’s insistence on taking back the Panama Canal, his repeated comments that Canada could become America’s 51st state, his talk last year of taking over Gaza and his fixation on Greenland.

“It’s clear that Trump is bent on territorial annexation in a way that presidents in past decades have not been,” Dr. Immerwahr said. “Trump’s annexationist ambition echoes those of presidents in the distant past — Polk, Teddy Roosevelt — but no one in the post-1945 period.”

Greenland’s size was indeed part of Mr. Trump’s thinking, according to “The Divider,” a book about the first Trump administration written by Peter Baker, a White House correspondent for The Times, and Susan Glasser, a staff writer for The New Yorker.

“I love maps,” Mr. Trump said, according to an interview he gave for the book. “And I always said: ‘Look at the size of this. It’s massive. That should be part of the United States.’’’

American officials floated the idea of buying Greenland in 1867 and 1946, but it never materialized.

Greenlanders find the whole idea insulting. Even if the United States were to offer each of Greenland’s 57,000 residents a million dollars, Greenlanders wouldn’t take it, said Aqqaluk Lynge, a former member of Greenland’s Parliament.

“We don’t sell our souls,” he said.

The resources were first announced in a with Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH-9) and leaders from the United Steelworkers and United Auto Workers.

A recording of the briefing can be found on the BlueGreen Alliance YouTube Channel.

“Today, I was proud to join leaders from the BlueGreen Alliance, United Auto Workers, and United Steelworkers to draw attention to the cancellation of $11 billion in Department of Energy projects across the country, including over $100 million of cancellations for companies in the Northwest Ohio district I represent alone,” said Rep. Kaptur. “These awards were authorized by Congress, and the funds were appropriated. Then the Department of Energy approved them, announced them, and signed contracts with the recipients. But under the Trump administration, they have now been revoked! These project terminations are a matter of real consequence for hardworking American families across our nation, for our global competitiveness, and for the communities I represent across Northwest Ohio.”

During 2025, several administrative and congressional actions cut federal funding to advanced manufacturing projects and the clean tech industry. Notably, in July, Trump signed the GOP budget bill repealing nearly $550 billion in funding that would have supported good union jobs, clean energy, and manufacturing investments.

“More than 410,000 workers are currently building clean vehicles and components in this country,” said David Green, Director, United Auto Workers Region 2B. “In recent months, we’ve seen a number of these workers laid off, including over a thousand employees at GM’s Factory Zero and another thousand plus employees at Ultium Cells in the Lordstown area.

“To see those workers bear the brunt of short-sighted corporate and political wavering is infuriating.”

In addition to that repealed funding, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has canceled hundreds of contracted awards worth $11 billion for domestic manufacturing, innovation, and decarbonization projects, including over $100 million in awarded federal investments in Ohio’s 9th district. The new data dashboard unveiled today tracks where these canceled or at-risk projects are located across the country, the lost DOE funding, details any community benefits plans attached to the awards, and tallies associated private investment and potential job loss.

“These projects weren’t just about technology—they were about people,” said Roy Houseman, Legislative Director and Assistant to the President, United Steelworkers (USW). “The Inflation Reduction Act was passed in 2022 with the support of USW and other unions to create jobs and strengthen U.S. competitiveness. By late 2024, it had already helped create 150,000 jobs, with projections of 13.7 million jobs and $1.9 trillion in economic growth. The DOE cuts undermine that progress.”

“Canceling projects for political reasons unrelated to their merit doesn’t just halt funding it kills jobs, undermines U.S. competitiveness, and erodes trust in public-private partnerships,” said Jason Walsh, Executive Director, BlueGreen Alliance. “Congress must defend its constitutional authority, restore funding for canceled projects, and recommit to a long-term industrial strategy. DOE should reverse course and partner with industry to keep America in the driver’s seat of the clean energy economy. Anything less risks locking the United States into dependence on foreign supply chains.”",,N,,2026-01-15 01:58:44.465448

In Monday’s court arguments, representatives for Revolution Wind said the 704-megawatt wind farm was 87% complete.
Meanwhile, Massachusetts wind farm Vineyard Wind is also mostly complete and operational.
The high cost of building an offshore wind farm is offset by its ability to generate inexpensive electricity.
And state officials have warned that without this wind energy on the grid, the lack of available energy will only force prices higher.","There is a glimmer of hope for the long embattled offshore wind industry.

One project in Massachusetts has been sending power back to the grid for months, even as the Trump administration suspended offshore wind farm construction in December. And this week, another nearly complete project off the coast of Connecticut and Rhode Island got the green light from a federal judge to continue building.

Monday’s ruling allowing Revolution Wind to resume construction was the first in a series of court cases that businesses and states are bringing over the course of this week, challenging the administration’s December suspension of all five offshore wind projects currently under construction in the Atlantic Ocean.

It’s a big win for power-starved New England, whose regional grid operator says it needs the electrons generated by these wind projects to maintain electricity reliability in the region for years to come.

President Donald Trump, however, continues to double down on his distaste for offshore wind.

“My goal is to not let any windmill be built; they’re losers,” Trump said on Friday, during a meeting with oil CEOs. “We don’t approve, and I told my people, we will not approve windmills.”

The Interior Department did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on Monday’s ruling.

Trump’s stance has resulted in the administration blocking projects that are nearly finished. In Monday’s court arguments, representatives for Revolution Wind said the 704-megawatt wind farm was 87% complete. Construction had already been stopped once before by the administration, in August.

Meanwhile, Massachusetts wind farm Vineyard Wind is also mostly complete and operational. That project has been allowed to send power to the grid even amid Trump’s suspension, a spokesperson for regional grid operator ISO-New England told CNN in an email.

Offshore wind has long been sought by New England and mid-Atlantic states, which rely mostly on natural gas for electricity and heating — and are lacking other ready energy infrastructure. At Monday’s court hearing, representatives for Revolution Wind said their wind farm was the only project of such size ready to come online and start providing power to New England’s grid soon. It’s ultimately expected to generate enough electricity to power upwards of 350,000 homes. When complete, the slightly smaller Vineyard Wind project is expected to power around 200,000 homes.

The largest wind farm impacted by the December order is a sprawling Virginia project that could eventually be the largest in the nation. Set to be completed by the end of this year, it would supply electricity to the region with the world’s largest cluster of power-hungry data centers.

Residential customers in the mid-Atlantic region, including Virginia, desperately need more energy to service the skyrocketing demand from data centers — and many are seeing spiking energy bills while they wait for new power to be brought online. In a notable move, that region’s grid operator PJM Interconnection joined a lawsuit on behalf of the Virginia project, calling its 2.7 gigawatts an “integral component” of electricity generation in the region.

“Extended delay of construction and operation of the CVOW [Virginia] project will cause irreparable harm to the 67 million Americans served by PJM,” PJM wrote in a legal brief.

The Revolution and Vineyard wind farms are “particularly important” to meeting New England’s winter energy needs, energy experts and the regional grid operator ISO-NE say. In a December statement, ISO-NE said the projects were important to maintaining “system reliability in the winter when offshore wind output is highest and other forms of fuel supply are constrained.”

“Canceling or delaying these projects will increase costs and risks to reliability in our region,” the regional grid operator added in a statement.

New England’s winter energy woes are driven both by temperature and the fact that this region is the last stop on the nation’s natural gas pipeline system. Competing needs for electricity and home heating can send energy prices for consumers surging.

“The colder it gets on a given day, the more demands that are placed on the gas pipeline system, not just to generate electric power, but to heat people’s homes,” said Francis Pullaro, president of RENEW Northeast, a clean energy industry association based in New England. “If there’s less demand for something, you’ll lower the price.”

There’s another way offshore wind will have downward pressure on prices, Pullaro said. The regional grid operator typically directs the cheapest units to run first, which means wind — which carries no cost for fuel — will be called on more, as more facilities get up and running.

Wind and solar “have very little marginal cost; they essentially bid zero,” Pullaro said. “The more wind you have on the system, and when it’s running at these peak times, it essentially means you’re not having to turn on that peaker gas or oil unit, because it’s just not needed.”

Pullaro’s organization commissioned a recent study that found that having 3.5 gigawatts of offshore wind on New England’s grid last winter would have resulted in New England utility Eversource’s residential customers saving between $15.83 - $32.13 total in electric bills over the course of a three-month winter period.

However, if Revolution and Vineyard wind are both built, they will add less than half of that amount of wind energy to the grid, and there’s no publicly available data yet to show how offshore wind has impacted electricity prices in the region this winter.

Trump administration officials have frequently claimed that offshore wind is the most expensive form of energy. On Monday, Interior Sec. Doug Burgum repeated that, calling the form of energy “some of the most expensive projects ever conceived.”

Offshore wind projects do have high initial costs, in large part because the limited supply chains and high inflation rates that have dogged the US economy affect construction. But, once built, projects like Vineyard are in such demand that they will begin operation with the electricity they generate already spoken for — and paid for. The high cost of building an offshore wind farm is offset by its ability to generate inexpensive electricity.

And state officials have warned that without this wind energy on the grid, the lack of available energy will only force prices higher. Without Revolution Wind, consumers in Connecticut could pay a lot more for energy during times of high demand — as much as $200 million annually starting next year, the Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection estimated in a recent report.

This week, massive wind turbine blades, towers and other components could be seen sitting at the Connecticut State Pier in New London — waiting to be taken out to sea and constructed.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/01-ap25356646674574.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-14 19:58:53.605985

There is a disconnect between rapid deployment and workforce development in the energy market, says Francesco La Camera, Director General, IRENA. He stresses that governments need to align trade, industrial and labor policies to support domestic capacity and skills development, while strengthening international cooperation to help countries lagging in the energy transition. Such efforts, he says, are critical to meeting the goal of tripling renewable power capacity by 2030 and ensuring broader socio-economic benefits.

Green jobs are highly beneficial for both the environment and society as a whole, says Rodrigo Osorio, Director General, Energy Agency of Puebla. “To be considered green, a job must meet high standards that are required to enhance the life conditions of workers,” he says. “Employees with green jobs must have their voice heard at work, equality must be ensured, everyone must receive a fair income for what they do and the conditions at work must be safe and dignifying. It is imperative to push the social agenda together with the environment to be able to move forward without leaving anyone behind.”

The joint Renewable Energy and Jobs – Annual Review 2025 report found that jobs in the sector increased by 2.3% from 2023, bringing total employment to 16.6 million worldwide. The report points to geopolitical and geoeconomic tensions, along with increasing automation across supply chains, as factors shaping labor dynamics in the energy transition.

Beyond employment totals, the report places a strong emphasis on inclusion and equity. It argues that a just transition requires deliberate action to address the underrepresentation of women and people with disabilities in the renewable energy workforce. According to the study, existing barriers continue to limit participation despite growing labor demand across technologies.

Disability inclusion must be embedded in renewable energy policies from design to implementation, says Gilbert Houngbo, Director General, ILO. He calls for accessible training systems, inclusive hiring practices, and workplaces that accommodate diverse needs, noting that inclusion is essential for resilient labor markets and sustainable development.

The analysis highlights persistent regional imbalances. China maintained its position as the dominant player in renewable energy employment, reflecting its large-scale, integrated manufacturing and deployment capacity. In 2024, China accounted for an estimated 7.3 million renewable energy jobs, representing 44% of the global total.

Employment levels in other major markets showed more modest changes. The European Union held steady at 1.8 million jobs, unchanged from the previous year. Brazil reported 1.4 million renewable energy jobs, while India and the United States saw limited growth, reaching about 1.3 million and 1.1 million jobs, respectively.

Jan 14 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge will rule on Thursday on whether to allow Norwegian offshore wind developer Equinor to resume construction of the Empire Wind project off the coast of New York in a lawsuit over the Trump administration's suspension of the industry.

U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington had declined to issue an immediate ruling at a hearing on Wednesday, two days after the same court ruled Danish offshore wind developer Orsted (ORSTED.CO), opens new tab could restart work on its nearly completed Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island.

The telephonic hearing will take place at 11 a.m. (1600 GMT) local time, according to the court.

The court decisions in these cases hold high stakes for companies and their shareholders because they could allow multi-billion-dollar projects to be completed, but the underlying lawsuits and the administration's aversion to offshore wind will continue to create uncertainty.

FIVE PROJECTS PAUSED

Equinor's request for an injunction, which would allow work to continue while the lawsuit proceeds, is the latest in a string of legal challenges to U.S. President Donald Trump's all-of-government opposition to the offshore wind sector.

Trump's Interior Department last month paused activity on five offshore wind leases, citing new classified information on risks to national security from radar interference.

During the hour-long hearing, Empire Wind attorney Ann Navaro said the pause created an ""existential risk"" for the company, and that it could lose access to construction vessels it needs to complete the $5.5 billion project.

U.S. Department of Justice attorney Stanley Woodward, arguing for the administration, said national security concerns justified the halt and argued the ""parade of horribles"" Empire Wind said would result from the pause was ""speculative.""

Nichols questioned whether the government's national security concerns would apply during construction of the project as opposed to during operations. Empire Wind said the project is not slated to start operations until October.

The judge, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, also raised the possibility of temporarily halting the pause before ruling on the merits of the case in an expedited proceeding.

Equinor (EQNR.OL), opens new tab has spent $4 billion on its project, and said in court papers that it faces likely termination if it cannot proceed by January 16.

Empire Wind is located 20 miles (32 km) off the coast of Long Island and is about 60% complete. It is expected to produce electricity to power about 500,000 homes.

Offshore wind developers, including Equinor, have faced repeated disruptions under Trump, who says wind turbines are ugly, expensive and inefficient. Empire Wind was halted previously by the administration for a month last year.

The affordability crisis is widespread, and energy costs in particular have become a fast-growing problem.
One factor is rising energy demand.
But PJM, our region’s grid manager, has moved slowly, effectively blocking nearly 2,000 energy projects from connecting to the grid.
And we must act quickly if we’re going to avoid the worst of the looming energy crisis.","Pennsylvania is welcoming the new year with an old problem: while temperatures have hovered around single digits in some counties, energy costs are too high for many people to afford.

The impact is huge: 1 in 5 Pennsylvanians had trouble paying their utility bills last year, and shutoffs are up 38%. Every day, my neighbors in South Philly stop by our district office asking for help keeping their heat on. The alternatives are turning on their oven, skipping medication to afford to pay their bills, or simply doing without heat in the freezing cold.

Warmth in the winter is not a luxury; everyone should be able to live comfortably through the coldest months. But so many people are working so much – multiple jobs, overnight shifts, on weekends – and still can’t get ahead. For poor and working people, the struggle to keep up with a mountain of bills is nothing new; between utilities, groceries, student debt, medical debt and housing, the bills have kept growing and wages have failed to keep up. The affordability crisis is widespread, and energy costs in particular have become a fast-growing problem.

So why is this happening? And more importantly, what can we do to keep costs down and the heat on for everyone?

One factor is rising energy demand. Due to immense growth in digital technologies – artificial intelligence, cloud devices, crypto mining – demand is outpacing supply. In response, Big Tech corporations are rapidly building out data centers. Increased air conditioning use due to climate change and the electrification of fossil fuel-based industries also contributes to the strain on the grid.

Second, not enough generation is coming online quickly enough to meet this increased demand. We know wind and solar projects are the cheapest and fastest energy sources to build. But PJM, our region’s grid manager, has moved slowly, effectively blocking nearly 2,000 energy projects from connecting to the grid. 90% of those projects are clean energy sources that could lower costs for ratepayers. And last year, President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans gutted the Inflation Reduction Act, which offered the surest path to jumpstarting clean energy investments in the U.S. As a result, shovel-ready renewable energy projects have been scrapped, and programs that saved consumers money on their energy bills, like Solar for All, were illegally halted.

All of this together feels like a challenge nearly too big to tackle. We have no choice but to try to do just that if we’re going to avoid the worst predictions of energy shortages. Blackouts and brownouts will cost people their livelihoods and, in some cases, their lives as temperatures soar (or plummet) and they are unable to turn on their air conditioning (or heat). People will die.

We know that generating more clean power is both the fastest and cheapest way to get more energy on the grid.

That can be done through legislation to install more solar on large warehouse roofs, open the door to new geothermal and nuclear investments, and promote battery storage to make these energy sources even more reliable 24/7. And we must find a way to make our membership in PJM work better for Pennsylvanians: According to a new report, the average Pennsylvania household would save $505 a year if PJM connected more clean energy to the grid.

Hardworking parents and families shouldn’t have to foot the bill for data center development driven by major corporations, especially during a nationwide affordability crisis. That’s why we’re advancing my colleague Rep. Rob Matzie’s bill, House Bill 1834, which ensures that costs from data centers, like upgrades to transmission and distribution infrastructure, won’t be passed on to ratepayers. Hardworking parents and seniors are already having a hard time paying the bills; they shouldn’t be expected to pay even more.

As chair of the House Energy Committee, I’m also interested in ways we can directly reduce costs by improving the efficiency of the grid (including by adopting demand response measures, advanced transmission technologies; and virtual power plants, which would allow customers to enroll power cells like sustainable batteries and EV chargers into a program that supplies energy to the grid during peak demand) and by updating energy efficiency standards so we all use less energy in the first place.

Our neighbors are counting on these reforms. And we must act quickly if we’re going to avoid the worst of the looming energy crisis. That crisis will be felt by working people and families as overdue bills pile up, blackouts and brownouts become a reality, and people risk their lives in the cold.

It’s incumbent upon us, as lawmakers, to lead with a new vision for the future – one where everyone has heat, power, and time to spend with their loved ones. In the richest country in the history of the world, we can do better. And in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, we must.",https://cdn.cityandstatepa.com/media/img/cd/2026/01/14/GettyImages_2201915274_headline/open-graph.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 19:58:56.857952

The partners will use $3 million in REPI funds, along with $4.3 million in partner contributions, to treat 2,000 acres of National Forest System land and nonfederal lands near the U.S. Air Force Academy and Cheyenne Mountain Space Force Station.

The REPI program preserves military missions by avoiding land use conflicts near military installations, addressing environmental restrictions that limit military activities and increasing military installation resilience.

The partners include the Forest Service, Air Force Civil Engineer Center, U.S. Army, Colorado Springs Fire Department, Colorado State Forest Service, Colorado Springs Utilities, Palmer Land Conservancy and the Pikes Peak Area Council of Governments.

$3 million REPI-funded projects

Old Stage Road: Treatments began in August 2025 and will continue throughout 2026 along the Old Stage Road (National Forest System Road [NSFR] 368) and Gold Camp Road (NFSR 370) in partnership with the Colorado Springs Fire Department.

East boundary: Scheduled to begin in coordination with the U.S. Air Force Academy in 2026 and continue throughout 2027, this project will protect the U.S. Air Force Academy. The Forest Service will establish resilient landscapes by removing unhealthy trees and reducing dangerous fuel sources, as well as creating strategic firebreaks and control lines near the military installation.

$4.3 million partner-funded projects

The additional funding in partner contributions will support additional treatments on approximately 1,000 acres at other locations near the military installations.

As part of these projects, residents living within or near the Colorado Springs wildland urban interface can expect to see removal, chipping or mastication of small to intermediate-sized vegetation, mostly along roadway corridors. The work will be completed using various small and large machines, including masticators, harvesters, forwarders, skidders, brush hogs, mowers and chippers, as well as chainsaws, brush saws and nonmotorized hand tools.

The partners will collaborate to implement multiple projects using REPI and partner funding, capitalizing on partnerships, and leveraging the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service’s National Active Forest Management Strategy and the key priorities outlined under President Trump’s Executive Order: Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production.

The War Department’s REPI program was established in 2002 as part of the fiscal year 2003 National Defense Authorization Act by supporting cost-sharing agreements between the military services, other federal agencies, state and local governments and private organizations.

Illinois continues to deliver a strong environment for private investment in EV infrastructure by expanding access to reliable, convenient charging for drivers.

“Whether you’re headed out on a long-range road trip, taking the kids to school, or on the job site, EV ownership should be easy, affordable, and reliable. Here in Illinois, we’ve put shoulder to the wheel to get the EV industry off the ground, and we’ve seen significant investments in our state as a result,” said Governor JB Pritzker. “Over the next few years, Illinois’ EV ecosystem will continue to grow — creating more quality jobs, building out more charging infrastructure, and making EVs an even more accessible and affordable option for our families.”

IONNA is a joint venture founded by eight global automakers, deploying EV fast charging infrastructure nationwide. IONNA’s charging stations are accessible to all-electric vehicles with NACS or CCS connectors. Among the new charging sites in Illinois, IONNA is powering 10 charging bays — electrified by ComEd — at Wally’s in Pontiac, creating access to local retail operations for Illinois EV drivers.

“Our goal at IONNA is simple: provide easy and stress-free EV charging for our drivers,” said IONNA CEO Seth Cutler. “By bringing fast, reliable charging to familiar stops like Wally’s in Pontiac, we’re giving Illinois drivers the confidence to travel farther, stop comfortably, and enjoy the journey — whether they’re commuting, running errands, or taking a road trip.”

“Wally’s — the Home of the Great American Road Trip — is proud to partner with IONNA to bring EV charging to Pontiac, strengthening the Midwest travel corridor while delivering the convenience, comfort, and reliability our guests expect,” said Wally’s Co-Founder and CEO Michael Rubenstein.

“The new and improved EV infrastructure at Wally's is another step forward for our community — supporting cleaner transportation, encouraging innovation, and making it easier for residents and visitors alike to choose sustainable options,” said Pontiac Mayor Kelly A. Eckhoff. “New station will attract road travelers, encourage longer stops, and brings more dollars to our local economy, while also preparing Pontiac for the future of transportation.”

“ComEd is committed to helping northern Illinois customers and communities unlock the sustainability and cost saving benefits of EVs,” said ComEd President and CEO Gil Quiniones. “Working closely with the state of Illinois, EV companies and communities across the region, we have helped facilitate the expansion of a widespread network of charging stations to serve the region, strengthened by the most reliable grid in the country.”

The State of Illinois has fought to ensure federal resources are delivered as promised, securing the release of critical funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) grants. So far, a total of $148 million has been allocated to IDOT to deliver the NEVI program in Illinois. To date, IDOT has awarded $43.8 million in NEVI grants for 62 projects throughout the state, which will facilitate the construction of 349 new charging ports.

As federal EV tax credits are no longer available, Illinois continues to operate its own state EV rebate program. Illinois’ EV rebate program — which delivers a check to eligible purchasers — includes $4,000 for low-income Illinoisans, $2,000 for others purchasing an EV, and $1,500 for electric motorcycles. By doubling down in the face of federal roadblocks, Illinois is encouraging sustained growth in the EV sector.

Illinois EV Growth

This combination of public leadership and private investment is helping drive rapid EV growth statewide:

Illinois’ commitment to expanding EV infrastructure benefits Illinois’ local economies and EV and component manufacturers alike. As the state’s EV market grows through strategic investments and competitive incentives, more well-paying jobs are created for Illinois’ unmatched workforce. In May, Governor Pritzker announced EV manufacturer Rivian’s $120 million investment in a new supplier park, which will support hundreds of new jobs and suppliers.

Alongside the charging site in Pontiac, other IONNA rechargeries across Illinois include:

Six other IONNA charging sites in Springfield, Chicago, North Aurora, St. Charles, Arlington Heights, and Des Plaines are either contracted or scheduled to go live.

The FCC is also in the middle of a congressional oversight hearing

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) now faces Supreme Court scrutiny over its power to issue fines, stemming from the agency’s decision to penalize the major carriers for location sharing.

In 2024, the FCC fined AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon nearly $200 million for illegally sharing access to customers’ location information without consent. All three carriers sought review from the U.S. Court of Appeals, arguing the FCC’s procedure violated their Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.

The Fifth Circuit agreed with AT&T that the FCC violated the constitution, whereas the Second Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit (which reviewed Verizon’s and T-Mobile’s cases, respectively) sided with the FCC.

The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments for both the AT&T and Verizon cases, which in turn could impact the ruling against T-Mobile. A T-Mo spokesperson told Fierce in August it’s “currently reviewing the court’s action.”

No matter how the hearing shakes out, the FCC won’t lose its enforcement role, said New Street Research Policy Analyst Blair Levin in a note today. If the Court upholds the Fifth Circuit’s decision, the FCC would not be able to impose monetary penalties on defendants without a jury trial.

The carriers chose to pay the fines and then appeal them in the circuit courts. Interestingly, had they declined to pay, the Department of Justice could have brought a collection suit which would have resulted in a jury trial, Levin said.

The Commission “will retain authority to investigate, develop factual records, issue subpoenas and other actions necessary to investigate potential rule violations,” he said, as well as the ability to negotiate settlements based on its investigative findings.

Companies would also have a bigger say against FCC decisions. “All companies that are the target of FCC investigations will be in a stronger negotiating position,” Levin added.

FCC in hot water with Congress

The Supreme Court hearing looms as the FCC testifies before Congress on agency oversight.

Today’s congressional hearing comes as FCC Chair Brendan Carr boasts a massive telecom deregulatory initiative while increasing scrutiny over diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), mergers and broadcast media.

Concerns about the FCC’s oversight further arose after Carr in December commented that the FCC ""is not an independent agency, formally speaking."" The word “independent” is no longer included in the FCC’s online mission statement.

In his opening remarks, Rep, Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) welcomed today’s hearing as “an opportunity to discuss the many important issues before the FCC.” He praised the agency’s deregulatory agenda but urged the FCC to be mindful of issues such as Universal Service Fund (USF) reform, spectrum policy and “modernizing outdated media ownership rules.”

On the other hand, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) slammed Carr for overstepping the FCC’s bounds.

“Over the last year, Chairman Carr has grossly distorted the power and purpose of the FCC,” Pallone stated. “He has weaponized the agency to benefit Trump and punish anyone who challenges him. He has rubber-stamped shady deals between media conglomerates when those deals have included monetary and political benefits for the President.”",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud4/media/image/esmmmc_starr_image_of_a_gavel_in_the_U.S._Supreme_Court._11a156fa-9da6-4410-a516-ce8ad075b458.png?VersionId=oTsSZBO.ReTGaAh.4.0dMSNb4.xD_gL.,N,,2026-01-14 17:59:22.747691

Manufacturing construction spending in the U.S. has gone down after peaking in 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

The latest report from E2 shows that in 2025, companies canceled over $32 billion worth of clean energy manufacturing projects due to reduced government incentives and funding cuts, as well as tariff policies.

But, at the same time, some industry giants have significantly increased investment in the U.S. Last year, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. announced a $100 billion investment with three new fabs, two advanced packaging facilities and an R&D center. Midyear, Micron revealed plans for a $200 billion investment in Idaho, New York, and Virginia with semiconductor manufacturing plants and an R&D center.

These investments partly stem from the new federal policies that aim to incentivize domestic production by making imports and hiring foreign workers more expensive. Other factors include funding from the CHIPS Act as well as state or local tax credits for job creation.

The announcements are a combination of building new facilities and expanding existing plants. Here are some of the biggest projects set to break ground or begin operations in 2026.

Micron

Product: Memory chips

Overall investment: $200 billion

Locations: Idaho, New York and Virginia

Timeline: Construction of the New York fab began in January

Micron’s memory manufacturing facility in New York broke ground earlier this month, and production at its Idaho site is expected to begin next year.

The company is investing $200 billion across multiple facilities, with plans to spend $150 billion on fabs and $50 billion on R&D. The project includes two fabs in Idaho, four fabs in New York and the expansion of its existing manufacturing fab in Virginia.

The project, which aims to produce 40% of the company’s dynamic random access memory in the U.S., is estimated to create 90,000 direct and indirect jobs.

The announcement was made in partnership with the U.S. Department of Commerce with $6.4 billion in funding through the CHIPS and Science Act.

Samsung Electronics

Product: Semiconductors

Investment: $17 billion

Location: Texas

Timeline: Expected to be operational in 2026

Samsung’s “initial minimum investment” for a semiconductor manufacturing plant in Taylor, Texas, is said to be the largest foreign investment in the state.

Construction was halted last year due to reduced demand and resumed in mid-2025. The factory is expected to be operational in 2026, and the company estimates the project will create 1,800 jobs within a decade.

Earlier, Samsung had planned $44 billion worth of investment in Texas, for which it was granted $6.4 billion in funding under the CHIPS Act. As the company reduced the investment to $37 billion, funding was cut to $4.7 billion.

The project is a part of a broader multibillion-dollar expansion in the region, where the company said it has invested over $47 billion since the 1970s.

Stellantis

Product: Vehicles

Investment: $13 billion

Locations: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio

Timeline: Indiana facility begins production in 2026, others by the end of the decade

Stellantis is investing $13 billion across the U.S. to expand production by 50% over the next four years.

In Indiana, the company will produce a new four-cylinder engine beginning in 2026. In Illinois, there are plans to reopen a facility and begin production of two new Jeep vehicles in 2027.

The pace of change has been unusually rapid, with policy direction driven largely by executive action, emerging national security priorities, tariff expansion, shifting enforcement patterns, and supply chain pressures that require companies to rethink how they structure cross-border trade.

Over the last year, there have been fundamental changes with regard to tariffs, export controls, sanctions, and US outbound investment regulations. These changes are altering risk profiles and challenging long-standing assumptions. Businesses are navigating these developments against a backdrop of global conflict, geopolitical realignment, domestic policy reversals, evolving due diligence expectations, and increasingly complex international commercial relationships.

The US approach remains highly dynamic: transactional in tone, industry-specific in impact, and shaped by shifting policy levers used to advance national and economic security objectives. Looking ahead to 2026, companies should expect continued movement in tariffs, growing export control restrictions, and trade enforcement investigations, with long-term implications for supply chains, investment strategy, compliance planning, and commercial contracting.

This Insight highlights key themes and takeaways from 2025, organized around three core areas: (1) trade and investment policy trends, (2) export controls and sanctions developments, and (3) tariff expansion and litigation outlook.

TRADE AND INVESTMENT POLICY: STRUCTURAL SHIFTS WITH OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES

A Markedly Different Policy Environment

The US administration entered this term with more focused preparation, clearer objectives, and a more expansive policy agenda than in 2017. The result is an assertive approach to trade and investment, focused less on multilateral engagement and more on maximizing US leverage and domestic economic outcomes. Businesses are seeking to understand the implications of this shift, particularly as policy is now centered on a more mercantilist, transactional framework that elevates economic nationalism and hard-power trade tools over soft-power diplomacy.

Tariffs have been a primary driver of this new posture. Many increases exceeded expectations in both scale and scope, particularly for China, with rates in some categories rising far beyond the levels the market anticipated earlier in the year. These changes contributed to significant planning challenges and reshaped sourcing strategies, pricing models, and investment decisions for companies across sectors, although in many cases implementation of the tariff increases were postponed or exemptions were created, muting the overall effect.

Governance by Executive Action

The Trump administration relies heavily on executive orders and emergency authorities to implement trade and investment measures, ranging from tariff imposition to sanctions expansion and investment controls. This approach reflects both a broad view of presidential authority and a willingness to test the limits of that authority through litigation up to the Supreme Court, if necessary. This emphasis on executive authority and an accommodative majority in Congress has diminished the role of the legislature and increased legal and operational uncertainty for businesses planning around public policy timelines.

Effects on Multinational Corporations

Macroeconomic, policy, and geopolitical dynamics combined to create new layers of commercial complexity. Some of the most significant business impacts include the following:

Persistent supply chain disruption: Ongoing global conflicts, dynamic imposition of tariffs, and expansion of export controls continue to affect sourcing, transportation flows, logistics planning, and long-term manufacturing footprints.

Tariff-driven cost pressure: Tariffs remain difficult to predict, and exemption pathways have been unevenly implemented, increasing cost and slowing decision-making. Companies face pressure to realign sourcing, but many hesitate without greater clarity.

Fragmented ESG and DEI legal environment: Conflicting state, national, and international environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) requirements are producing overlapping (and sometimes contradictory) legal obligations, particularly in disclosures, sustainability strategy, and climate transition planning.

Immigration-related workforce challenges: Talent mobility has become more difficult amid tightened controls on visas and student access, heightened enforcement activity, and changing compliance expectations.

Sector-specific effects: Deregulation and policy support for oil, gas, coal, artificial intelligence, and digital assets stand in contrast to increasing pressure on renewable energy, life sciences, and automotive/retail supply chains.

New Challenges for Corporate Planning and Compliance

Legal and compliance teams are operating in an environment where policy shifts can materially alter contract rights, pricing models, investment strategies, and disclosure requirements.

Organizations face pressure to remain current on rapidly shifting executive actions, assess enforcement risk in evolving regulatory regimes, and align public disclosures with material tariff and trade risks. Many are also confronting conflicting obligations across jurisdictions and increasingly renegotiating supply contracts to account for cost volatility and tariff exposure.

These pressures mean risk management now requires deeper integration of trade policy forecasting with commercial planning and capital allocation models, and greater emphasis on scenario analysis, contract flexibility, and proactive stakeholder communication.

EXPORT CONTROLS, SANCTIONS, AND NATIONAL SECURITY REVIEWS: A MORE AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT LANDSCAPE

Shift in National Security Priorities

The US administration’s 2025 priorities reflect heightened focus on trade and customs fraud, sanctions violations, drug cartel-related activity, and countering China. These priorities are shaping enforcement activity and driving new due diligence requirements, particularly in higher-risk markets and regions.

Export Controls: Broader Jurisdiction and Enhanced Risk

Export controls are increasingly used as an economic policy tool in addition to their traditional national security function. Recent developments include (1) expanded export controls targeting semiconductors, AI, and other sensitive technologies, and China-related supply chains; and (2) broadening of the Entity List to include affiliates of listed entities, which significantly increases due diligence burdens.

Although implementation of the Affiliates Rule is suspended for one year as part of a bilateral economic agreement with China, companies should use this period to prepare for expanded compliance requirements and documentation expectations once the suspension period ends.

Sanctions: Evolving Tools and New Applications

This year also saw meaningful changes to sanctions programs, including the below:

Designation of major drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, increasing exposure risk for companies with operations or counterparties in Mexico and Latin America. These designations expanded investigative tools and authorities available to investigators, including material-support-to-terrorism charges and enhanced intelligence access.

Use of FinCEN special measures as a sanctions-like tool to restrict funds transfers involving financial institutions linked to illicit opioid trafficking.

New sanctions programs and novel uses of existing programs targeting perceived adversaries of the US administration under corruption and counter-narcotics programs. The administration reinstated sanctions on the International Criminal Court.

Additionally, 2025 saw the termination of the Syria and West Bank sanctions programs along with a heightened focus on Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, and Russia. While it has been slow to impose additional sanctions on Russia, the current administration did announce in the last quarter sanctions on two major oil and gas companies to put additional pressure on Russia to engage in peace negotiations over Ukraine.

Outbound Investment and Supply Chain Restrictions

Regulators continue to sharpen focus on outbound investment flows affecting sensitive technology sectors in China in an effort to curtail US investments facilitating the development of sensitive technologies and furthering China’s Military-Civil Fusion strategy.

Requirements now include notification obligations and, in some areas, prohibitions on US investment in Chinese companies operating in certain sectors and industries.

This trend is reinforced by Foreign Entity of Concern rules under the Inflation Reduction Act, limiting tax credit eligibility for renewable energy components with certain Chinese ties, as well as ongoing developments under the ICTS supply chain program. The National Defense Authorization Act passed in the last quarter did include provisions addressing both outbound investment in and the procurement of biopharmaceutical inputs from countries of concern.

Operational Challenges

Across the cross-border transaction landscape, businesses face sharply increased expectations around due diligence and reduced predictability in licensing and review timelines. These pressures are prompting companies to reassess compliance resources, documentation practices, and internal review protocols to identify and mitigate gaps that could elevate enforcement or transactional risk.

Compounding these challenges is a significant backlog on export classification and licensing applications before US government regulators. Much of this backlog has been exacerbated by staffing reductions, agency turnover, and disruptions caused by the recent government shutdown. Taken together, these factors delay processing times, increase uncertainty around timing and outcomes, and require companies to build greater flexibility into commercial planning, supply chain decisions, and investment strategy.

Companies are reevaluating their compliance frameworks, particularly around counterparty screening, recordkeeping, training, and reporting procedures, as the enforcement environment continues to evolve.

TARIFFS AND TRADE REMEDIES: NEW STRUCTURES, HIGHER RATES, LITIGATION RISK

Tariff Expansion Continues

Tariff activity accelerated significantly in 2025, reshaping import economics and altering long-term strategic planning for US and multinational companies. Tariffs are being deployed as a tool for both economic leverage and national security objectives, affecting a wide range of goods and industries. Key areas of focus include the following:

Section 232 (national security) tariffs affecting imports of steel, aluminum, vehicles and parts, copper, timber, trucks, and lumber and timber, with ongoing investigations concerning semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, and more

Section 301 tariffs targeting acts and practices of identified trading partners, primarily China, related to identified unfair trading practices

Section 201 safeguards relating to solar cells and modules (expiring February 2026)

International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) tariffs imposed under emergency authorities, including broad reciprocal rates and trafficking-related tariffs targeting Canada, Mexico, and China

Secondary tariffs on Venezuelan and Russian oil, currently imposed only on India

Elimination of de minimis entry thresholds for low-value goods

These measures, layered on top of standard customs duties, have led importers to assess classification, valuation, country of origin, and eligibility under trade agreements with greater precision.

Ongoing bilateral negotiations with major trading partners are creating tariff variability based on region and product category, offering targeted relief but also increasing planning uncertainty.

Litigation and Policy Horizon for 2026

Importers closely await the Supreme Court’s decision on IEEPA-based tariff authority, argued on November 5, 2025. A ruling is expected in early 2026, although the timing may shift. The outcome could reshape tariff structures, refund potential, and future presidential authority, all of which is driving increased interest in protective refund claims and importer-specific litigation.

Meanwhile, pending trade investigations under Section 232 could trigger new tariffs on critical industries, and the first joint review under USMCA will occur in July 2026, potentially opening the door to major renegotiation.

Practical Impacts for Businesses

Importers should expect

continued tariff cost volatility,

increased complexity in supply chain contracting,

valuation and classification challenges,

expanded due diligence requirements, and

intensified scrutiny in corporate transactions, investor reporting, and insurance underwriting.

Companies should also prepare for potential refund scenarios under certain tariff programs, particularly if litigation outcomes or negotiations alter duty obligations retroactively.

LOOKING AHEAD

The United States continues to redefine its role in global trade and investment. Increased and novel use of trade policy tools such as emergency tariffs, outbound investment controls, and sanctions tied to cartel activity, are now fundamental. Export controls are broadening in scope and purpose, sanctions programs are expanding into new areas, and the implementation of outbound investment restrictions are changing how businesses implement their commercial and operational strategies.

For companies, the result is a more complex and risky regulatory environment that demands proactive planning and resilient operating models. To address this, companies are

evaluating and strengthening trade compliance infrastructure,

increasing their visibility into multi-tier supply chains,

reassessing sourcing and logistics footprints,

integrating tariff, export control, and sanctions forecasting into budgeting,

updating contractual protections to reduce the risk of indirect violations and specifically allocate risk and responsibility for tariffs, and

aligning public disclosures with evolving risk profiles.

Building agility into trade strategy will be critical in 2026. The companies best positioned to thrive in this environment will be those that embed trade intelligence into cross-functional decision-making—connecting policy tracking to procurement, pricing, capital investment, manufacturing, and technology strategy.

Bill Ford downplayed the incident as “6 seconds out of an hour tour.” “I was embarrassed because we’re the host,” Ford said.
“In some ways, it's just in character for him to be that way, and obviously my sympathies are with the worker and not the president.” Sabula is a member of the UAW.
“The leadership of the automotive sector by rights ought to be in America, and it ought to be right here,” Buttigieg said.","As Trump was exiting the plant Tuesday, a worker could be heard on video obtained by TMZ calling the president a “pedophile protector,” an apparent reference to the records of convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Trump could be seen shouting an expletive and extending his middle finger in response, Automotive News reported.

The Washington Post identified Trump’s heckler as TJ Sabula, who said Ford had suspended him while it investigates the incident. Bill Ford downplayed the incident as “6 seconds out of an hour tour.”

“I was embarrassed because we’re the host,” Ford said. “I understand that gets a lot of social media play, and that’s the world we live in. But it was a very small part of the day.”

A White House spokesperson said in a statement to TMZ: “A lunatic was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage, and the President gave an appropriate and unambiguous response.""

In his keynote conversation with Michigan State University President Kevin Guskiewicz on Wednesday at Huntington Place convention center, Buttigieg said Trump has been a union buster and presided over the loss of manufacturing jobs across America.

“And then when somebody sees someone as powerful as him come into their workplace, (Trump) gives them the old f- you,” said Buttigieg, who served in the Biden administration. “In some ways, it's just in character for him to be that way, and obviously my sympathies are with the worker and not the president.”

Sabula is a member of the UAW. Laura Dickerson, UAW vice president and Ford department director, said in a statement that the union will protect its workers' free speech rights on the job.

""The UAW will ensure that our member receives the full protection of all negotiated contract language safeguarding his job and his rights as a union member,"" Dickerson said in a statement. ""Workers should never be subjected to vulgar language or behavior by anyone — including the President of the United States.""

Sabula is already the beneficiary of multiple GoFundMe campaigns launched on his behalf, which as of mid-afternoon Wednesday total more than $600,000.

One campaign, opened by Sean Williams, who is based in South Carolina, according to his GoFundMe profile, calls Sabula a ""patriot,"" and had raised $374,003 and with nearly 17,000 donations as of Wednesday afternoon. The other, organized by Diandra Gourlay of Highland Park, had raised $227,509 with more than 9,000 donations.

“This is a worker who spoke his mind to the most powerful person in the country, and he is well within his rights to do that as an American,” Buttigieg said to reporters.

In 2020, President Joe Biden was in a testy exchange with a pro-gun autoworker during a plant tour in Detroit over Biden's plan to reinstate an assault weapons ban. Biden told the worker he was ""full of s---"" after the worker confronted him and accused him of working to end Second Amendment rights.

Buttigieg’s conversation with Guskiewicz was punctuated by the occasional rumble of the Detroit People Mover traveling through the Huntington Place station near the convention center. Buttigieg used the opportunity to speak on how innovation in the transit space is necessary to reduce the risk of automotive crashes.

Approximately 40,000 people die preventable deaths each year while driving in the U.S., Buttigieg said.

“Getting from an airport to a city center in this country is an embarrassment compared to what it is in most places. We could do something about it, using technology and public investment to better integrate transit with roadways,” Buttigieg said. He also voiced support for autonomous vehicles, calling them safer than the average American driver.

Waymo, a Google-affiliated autonomous vehicle company, came to Detroit in November to begin testing fully autonomous ride-hailing services across the city.

“The leadership of the automotive sector by rights ought to be in America, and it ought to be right here,” Buttigieg said.

To keep it that way, he called for a bigger push of investment in electric vehicles, criticizing the “whiplash” between the policies of the two recent federal administrations.

“There is no question about whether this technology will be the future of the sector,” Buttigieg said. “There is a big question about whether America will lead that. I see the innovation, the determination, the dedication of U.S. automakers and their teams, their workers and their leaders to make sure that is so.”

There is some speculation about Buttigieg's interest in the 2028 presidential election. He plans to travel to Cleveland on Thursday for an appearance and plans to participate in a town hall in La Crosse, Wis., on Friday.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/447592617.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 16:59:44.130860

American energy producers are at the helm of a “demand decade,” supporting access to reliable and efficient energy resources worldwide, API President and CEO Mike Sommers highlighted as he talked about the scale and global significance of U.S. energy production.

As the world’s top producer of oil and natural gas and the leading LNG exporter, the United States is integral to ensuring energy security while driving lower emissions. Sommers stressed the efficiency and environmental standards that differentiates U.S. energy on the global stage:

“No other country has matched America’s ability to produce more energy with fewer emissions. It’s the result of a system built on certainty, stability, and clear rules—where companies can invest, innovate, and deliver energy at scale with confidence.”

Demand Is Rising and Energy Realism Is Taking Hold

Speakers rejected the notion that oil and natural gas demand is peaking. Instead, global and domestic demand reached record highs in 2025, driven by broad economic and human needs. Coined the “demand decade,” API estimated that U.S. electricity demand will surge by 35-50 percent between 2024 and 2040. Many speakers argued that AI is not the only factor driving energy demand, rather demand is multifaceted.

Kevin Book of ClearView Energy Partners summarized the economic importance of this growth plainly:

“Energy is the essential input that drives the entire economy… Not everyone is a driller, everyone is a driver.”

Looking ahead to the midterm elections, Sommers highlighted a national shift in public and political attitudes toward energy:

“As we head into this midterm election year, we are looking at a national shift. Americans are embracing energy realism.”

This is evident in blue-states walking back ambitious climate targets across the country. States that initially pushed ambitious climate mandates are now adjusting as cost and reliability gaps become clear. California has expanded drilling and encouraged refineries to stay open, while New York is reconsidering parts of its 2019 climate law due to rising energy costs and potential grid shortfalls, just to name two. These examples show policymakers and consumers are increasingly demanded abundant, affordable and reliable energy.

Infrastructure Is the Limiting Factor

Despite record production, speakers emphasized that insufficient infrastructure remains a central constraint on affordability and reliability. Expanding pipelines, power generation, and transmission capacity are critical to meet rising demand through effective permitting reform.

Toby Z. Rice, President & CEO of EQT discussed the urgent need to build quickly:

“To win the AI race, this country needs a tremendous amount of infrastructure. If you want access to this power, you’ve got to build it… Our number one priority is keeping the lights on and keeping bills low. We are dead set serious about that, and building infrastructure is the key.”

Speakers agreed that expanding infrastructure and addressing regulatory bottlenecks are essential. Outdated permitting rules are a major bottleneck, with environmental reviews now taking nearly four years on average – double the time they took in the 1970s. Projects face additional delays due to litigation, creating uncertainty and deferring investment in critical infrastructure.

Without clear policies and timely permitting, affordability, reliability, and U.S. energy leadership are at risk.

Regulatory Complexity

Beyond physical infrastructure, regulatory complexity is a major barrier to meeting rising energy demand. Panelists emphasized that permitting reform and clear rules are closely connected—without regulatory certainty, even approved projects face delays, higher costs, and operational challenges.

President and CEO of Cheniere Energy Jack Fusco highlighted the scale of oversight facing developers:

“Regulatory overreach. We deal with 54 agencies. We need clarity and coordination…We need help making sure we can do our jobs and do them well and not stuck publishing reports.”

These delays have real consequences for consumers and the broader economy. As sectors like data centers and AI drive unprecedented electricity demand, slow decision-making and overlapping regulations strain the energy system and prevent buildout.

Addressing regulatory complexity is essential not only for operational efficiency, but for keeping energy affordable, reliable, and competitive in the “demand decade.” Chairman, President and CEO Maryann Mannen of Marathon Petroleum underscored this importance for future U.S. dominance:

“Permitting reform, policy clarity, putting rules in place that are supportive of ensuring we’ve got U.S. energy independence is really critical.”

U.S. Energy Leadership and Global Competitiveness

Panelists reinforced the critical role of American energy in both domestic and global markets. Sommers noted the nation’s leadership, stating:

“U.S. oil and natural gas companies now play an outsized role in meeting global energy demand, reducing the influence of hostile regimes and providing the vital products that have lifted billions out of poverty and enable people all over the world to thrive.”

For example in 2025 the U.S. exported a record 11 million metric tons of LNG, marking a 24 percent year-over-year increase. With monthly and annual production hitting all-time highs, the U.S. is reinforcing its position as the world’ benchmark for stable and abundant energy. This unprecedented production provides balance to international markets, reduces global price volatility, and ensures Americans have access to dependable energy at home.

Panelists said U.S. energy leadership keeps energy affordable at home and competitive abroad, with American production widely seen as the global benchmark. As Sommers put it, U.S. energy is the “envy of the world,” but sustaining that leadership will require continued investment and infrastructure to meet growing global demand.

This leadership is particularly important as U.S. and global markets grapple with a potential reopening of Venezuela oil markets.",https://www.energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/eid_favicon_new.png,N,,2026-01-14 16:59:48.713714

Nuclear energy stores immense amounts of energy directly in its fuel.
Nuclear energy is also a strategic national asset.
Countries that lead in advanced nuclear technology will control supply chains, safety standards, and long-term geopolitical influence.
When it comes to powering the next century of economic growth and national defense, advanced nuclear is not optional: it is essential.","Northern PSC Commissioner Chris Brown says nuclear energy is the future of large-scale power generation. Serious nations know it.

America’s economy is entering a new phase: one that requires enormous amounts of reliable electricity. Artificial intelligence, data centers, advanced manufacturing, military installations, and modern infrastructure all depend on power that is available every hour of every day, no matter the weather.

That reality matters deeply in Mississippi, where families, businesses, hospitals, and military facilities cannot afford rolling outages or skyrocketing power bills. If the United States wants to remain economically competitive and nationally secure, we must be honest about what works, and accelerate investment in advanced nuclear energy.

Much of today’s energy debate focuses on the falling cost of renewable power, especially solar. That progress is real and useful. But it often ignores a critical distinction: cheap power on paper is not the same as dependable power in the real world.

Solar energy can be inexpensive when the sun is shining. But electricity demand does not stop at night, during storms, or during prolonged cloudy periods. To deliver round-the-clock power, solar must be paired with massive battery systems. Those batteries are expensive, wear out over time, and must be replaced regularly. Once those costs are included, the price of “dispatchable” solar power rises sharply.

Once you require dispatchable, 24/7 power, the economics flip.

Cost per kWh (firm power):

• Advanced Nuclear: $0.06–$0.10

• Solar + 4h batteries: $0.09–$0.13 (still not fully reliable)

• Solar + 24h batteries: $0.20–$0.35

• Hardened solar (multi-day): $0.40–$0.80+

Dispatchable solar costs 2–8× more per kWh.

When measured fairly, comparing only power that is available on demand, the difference becomes clear. Advanced nuclear energy can produce electricity for roughly six to ten cents per kilowatt-hour, with plants operating more than 90 percent of the time and lasting for decades. By contrast, solar paired with enough storage to provide continuous power often costs two to four times more, and systems designed to handle multi-day outages can cost even more.

This is not a political issue. It is a matter of physics and engineering. Nuclear energy stores immense amounts of energy directly in its fuel. Solar energy must be generated when conditions allow and stored externally in batteries that require large amounts of land, minerals, and ongoing replacement.

Reliability matters more than ever as electricity demand grows. Data centers, manufacturing plants, military installations, and critical infrastructure cannot simply power down when conditions are unfavorable. A grid built primarily on intermittent generation like solar and wind becomes more fragile, not more resilient, without firm power sources to anchor it.

Advanced nuclear reactors are designed for exactly this challenge. Modern designs rely on passive safety systems, simplified construction, smaller footprints, and decades of operational experience. Unlike other technologies, nuclear power becomes more economical as it runs longer, without requiring massive new infrastructure, and only small amounts of additional fuel.

Nuclear energy is also a strategic national asset. Countries that lead in advanced nuclear technology will control supply chains, safety standards, and long-term geopolitical influence. Russia and China understand this clearly and are investing heavily to dominate the next generation of nuclear power. The United States cannot afford to fall behind, or worse, outsource its energy future while competitors lock in theirs.

Nuclear energy is the future of large-scale power generation. Serious nations know it. Rather than continuing to funnel billions of dollars into subsidized solar projects that depend on weather and constant backup, America should focus on technologies that deliver reliable power, strengthen national security, protect ratepayers, and secure long-term leadership. When it comes to powering the next century of economic growth and national defense, advanced nuclear is not optional: it is essential.",https://magnoliatribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-14-133930.png,N,,2026-01-14 19:00:19.541521

Registrations between January and June came in at just 9,000 vehicles, down from more than 26,000 in the same period in 2024.
DesRosiers Automotive Consultants, an auto industry data firm, confirmed that Tesla’s Canadian sales fell by more than 60%, but also noted a partial recovery later in the year.
Zero-emission vehicle sales across Canada fell between 32% and 43% through the first three quarters of the year, according to Automotive News.
By the fourth quarter, imports of tariff-free European Model Y vehicles helped stabilize sales, but the damage was already done.","Tesla’s once-dominant position in Canada took a dramatic hit in 2025, as a perfect storm of policy changes, trade tensions, and market shifts sent sales tumbling to their lowest level in years.

New registration data compiled from multiple industry sources shows Tesla delivered between 18,300 and 20,000 vehicles in Canada for the full year, down significantly from the roughly 55,000 units in 2024.

That works out to a 63–67% year-over-year decline, making Canada one of Tesla’s weakest major markets globally in 2025.

The damage was most severe in the first half of the year. Registrations between January and June came in at just 9,000 vehicles, down from more than 26,000 in the same period in 2024. Quebec was hit especially hard after the province paused its EV rebate program at the end of 2024 for several months, causing Tesla sales in the province to plunge nearly 85% in Q1 alone.

DesRosiers Automotive Consultants, an auto industry data firm, confirmed that Tesla’s Canadian sales fell by more than 60%, but also noted a partial recovery later in the year. That rebound came after Tesla began importing Model Y vehicles from Giga Berlin, which allowed the company to avoid U.S.-related tariffs that were applied to American-built vehicles entering Canada.

That shift was crucial. U.S.–Canada trade measures imposed in 2025 made Teslas built in Fremont (Tesla has never imported vehicles from Giga Texas into Canada) far more expensive, just as federal and provincial EV incentives were being reduced or eliminated.

The broader EV sector also struggled in 2025, but not nearly to the same degree. Zero-emission vehicle sales across Canada fell between 32% and 43% through the first three quarters of the year, according to Automotive News. Meanwhile, overall new-vehicle sales actually grew about 2%, reaching roughly 1.9 million units.

Globally, Tesla also faced a difficult year. The company delivered 1,636,129 vehicles in 2025, down about 9% from 2024. While Tesla does not publish country-level sales figures, this data shows Canada’s decline was far steeper than Tesla’s worldwide average, highlighting how uniquely difficult 2025 was for the brand north of the border.

By the fourth quarter, imports of tariff-free European Model Y vehicles helped stabilize sales, but the damage was already done. With incentives gone and trade barriers still in place, Tesla now enters 2026 facing a very different Canadian market than the one that powered its record-breaking 2024.",https://driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/modely-snow.png,N,,2026-01-14 16:01:06.340741

The UK needs vast amounts of new electricity generation to meet the demands of new data centres, housing and industry, and offshore wind will play a critical role in meeting that need cost-effectively.”

Andrew Elmes, Supply Chain Vice-Chair of the Offshore Wind Industry Council and Head of Government Affairs (UK and Ireland) for Siemens Energy said:

""Thanks to the record volume of winning projects in this auction round, over the coming years we would hope to see billions of pounds of supply chain investment flow into all corners of the UK to deliver these offshore wind farms. As the bulk of offshore wind infrastructure is out at sea, the scale up of associated jobs and businesses will be in coastal areas across Scotland, England and Wales and should support local economic revitalisation, as we have already seen in regions such as the Humber and East Anglia.

""The UK is world-leading in many aspects of offshore wind development, notably the manufacturing and installation of cutting-edge turbine technology, the cables which transmit electricity to shore, foundations to anchor floating turbines to the seabed, as well as operating and maintaining the assets out at sea.

Those who live in manufactured homes also tend to have less income than those in site-built varieties, making these needlessly high energy costs even harder to handle.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development last updated standards for manufactured homes in 1994.
This fact shows that better-built manufactured homes can benefit the industry and consumers alike, say affordability advocates, far better than the bill that’s now before the Senate.
​“However, the lower purchase price on a home for a family is eroded if they’re unable to make monthly payments due to high and rising energy costs.”","The U.S. House just voted to cancel efficiency standards for new manufactured homes — a move that could hit especially hard in the Southeast, where such housing is common and energy insecurity is high.

The measure would rescind 2022 criteria for insulation, air sealing, and other energy-saving features in prefabricated, or mobile, homes, restoring weaker standards more than 30 years old. The legislation comes as utility bills are rising fast nationwide — and if it is passed by the Senate and signed into law, it could cost households in double-wide houses hundreds more per year in increased electricity costs.

“The very first energy bill that the House of Representatives passed this year would increase energy costs on some of the households and families in the United States that are most struggling to make ends meet,” said Mark Kresowik, senior policy director with the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. ​“This will have more harmful impacts in the Southeast than anywhere else in the country.”

Of the 4.7 million prefab homes delivered nationwide in recent decades, more than half are in just 10 southern states. Texas leads the country, with nearly 600,000 units, and North Carolina is second, with over 330,000, according to the U.S. Census.

Manufactured homes are exempt from state and local energy codes, and older models are notoriously energy inefficient, with thin insulation, drafty windows and doors, and often outdated modes of heating and cooling. Those who live in manufactured homes also tend to have less income than those in site-built varieties, making these needlessly high energy costs even harder to handle.

“Utility costs can be in the several hundred dollars for folks in a manufactured house,” said Claire Williamson, senior energy policy advocate at the North Carolina Justice Center, which advocates for low-income families. She added that “$300, $400, even $500 a month in peak costs is not trivial.”

The prefabricated homes exacerbate energy insecurity in the Southeast, which is the most energy-burdened region in the country: One in three households in the region struggles to pay their utility bills, according to the Southeast Energy Efficiency Alliance.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development last updated standards for manufactured homes in 1994. In 2007, a bipartisan law directed the Department of Energy to issue more protective rules. In 2022, the Biden administration finally did so, but the new criteria were paused last summer by the Trump administration.

The Manufactured Housing Institute, the trade group for prefabricated home builders, has long fought against the stricter standards, which it argues are too costly, confusing, and bureaucratic.

The bipartisan bill that passed the House last week largely gives the builders what they want, restoring the 1994 standards and preventing the Department of Energy from ever issuing stronger rules.

The 2022 rules were expected to cost an average of $4,222 per double-wide home up front but pay for themselves in the form of lower energy bills in less than five years. For single-wide units, the additional up-front costs were pegged at $660, which households would recoup within one year.

“This is so clearly about the homebuilder special interests,” Williamson said, ​“and has nothing to do with ensuring better, more affordable housing for people.”

About half of all factory-made homes are already built to efficiency standards that are much stricter than those rescinded by the House, said Grant Beck, vice president of strategic partnerships at Next Step Network, a Kentucky-based nonprofit that supports ownership of prefab homes.

This fact shows that better-built manufactured homes can benefit the industry and consumers alike, say affordability advocates, far better than the bill that’s now before the Senate.

“We understand that we’re in an affordability crisis, particularly with relation to housing and first-time home buyers trying to enter the market,” Beck said. ​“However, the lower purchase price on a home for a family is eroded if they’re unable to make monthly payments due to high and rising energy costs.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Mobile-home-park-TX_GettyImages-539746440.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=f4c0e7c67f8bfe36bb0bcc978df18ff2,N,,2026-01-14 22:58:14.480322

Researchers found that only 5% would choose an electric vehicle as their next car, which is lower than national averages. The findings, published in Scientific Reports, shed light on how cost concerns, limited exposure and misconceptions keep EVs from gaining traction in rural areas.

The study helps researchers understand why EV penetration is as low as it is, and provides clues about what to do about it (provide better information and visibly improve charging infrastructure, said Parth Vaishnav, U-M assistant professor of environment and sustainability.

“The shift to EVs is essential to ensure that the U.S. car industry remains globally competitive: The rest of the world is shifting decisively to EV’s, particularly the high-growth markets of the Global South,” he said.

It is also essential to reduce climate change. Both automakers and environmentalists should want EVs to command a healthy market share in the U.S.; this is particularly crucial for Michigan, where the auto industry is a linchpin of prosperity, Parth said.

Perception vs. reality

The U-M team found that many rural drivers significantly underestimate how well EVs could fit their lives. For example:

Nearly half of respondents said a home Level 2 charger wouldn’t meet their needs, yet three-quarters could easily cover their daily driving with one.

Thirty percent believe there’s no public charger nearby, even though about half actually live within five miles of a fast charger.

More than one-third said they prefer gas-powered cars for cost reasons—but two-thirds of those drivers could afford an electric model within their reported budget range.

Why the gap matters

Previous studies have examined general barriers to EV adoption, such as range anxiety and limited charging access, but few have focused on rural drivers. This research digs deeper, combining survey results with real-world data on charging stations and EV listings across Michigan.

Researchers analyzed three key ownership factors:

Ability to charge at home (typically overnight using a Level 2 outlet)

Access to convenient public chargers

Availability of new and used EVs within personal budgets

They also assessed how people’s perceptions align—or clash—with reality. The findings reveal that over half of rural respondents are pessimistic about what EV ownership would require. Meanwhile, misinformation fuels hesitation. Crucially, this is a predictor of interest in new or used EVs.

Beyond infrastructure: The information challenge

While improving rural charging networks remains crucial, the study suggests that information may be just as important. Researchers found that:

Fifty-five percent of those who doubt they can charge at home cited driving “too much in a day” as the reason, despite most logging miles well within current EV capabilities.

Concerns about safety, maintenance and resale value persist, often rooted in a lack of trustworthy information.

The findings highlight that boosting rural EV adoption will require not only infrastructure, but also clear communication about what electric cars can already deliver today and throughout the EVs lifetime.

A road map to rural adoption

Taken together, U-M’s research suggests that the path to higher EV adoption in rural America may be smoother than many think—if drivers get the trustworthy information about their concerns.

“More than half of Michigan’s rural residents are more pessimistic than they need to be,” said Anna Stefanopoulou, U-M professor of mechanical engineering. “Drivers need to see in their dashboard reliable information about the battery state of health, which tells them how far they can go in our freezing winters and how long they can rely on their EV before the battery starts degrading. With this information, the used EVs that have a lower cost might start to look a lot more practical.”

Current global efforts for a battery certificate, which includes an indicator of battery sustainability based on the emissions and the energy associated with the production and eventual disposal of this particular battery, might also help consumer confidence.",https://news.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/mc-image-cache/2026/01/gaps-between-perception-and-reality-might-be-putting-the-brakes-on-electric-vehicle-sales-in-rural-michigan-sabrina-tomkins.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 16:00:52.880820

According to IRENA’s figures, the total renewable energy workforce grew 2.3% to 16.6 million in 2024, against a record 15% increase in the total renewable power capacity in 2024 to 4,443GW.

The growth in solar jobs reflected this pattern, with the 32% growth in solar capacity in 2024 far outstripping the increase in jobs in the sector.

IRENA said the relatively slower growth in jobs in 2024 indicated that the energy transition had entered a “new phase”, in which automation and economies of scale meant comparatively less human labour was needed to build each new unit of capacity.

Another factor IRENA said was the scale of deployment, with decentralised rooftop solar being more labour-intensive than utility-scale projects. The emergence of artificial intelligence in the coming years will also have “far-reaching impacts”, though how this will impact job losses or gains “remains to be seen”, the agency said.

IRENA director-general, Francesco La Camera, said: “Renewable energy deployment is booming, but the human side of the story is as important as the technological side. Governments must put people at the centre of their energy and climate objectives through trade and industrial policies that drive investments, build domestic capacity, and develop a skilled workforce along the supply chain.

The change means that beginning in February, rather than March, Duke customers in Florida will see an approximately $33 reduction to their monthly bills compared to January per 1,000 kilowatt-hours used.

Commercial and industrial customers’ bills will drop anywhere from 9.6% to 15.8% when compared to January, the amount of which depends on several factors, the company said.

“We understand all of our customers have been affected by the rising costs of living, many may be facing financial challenges, and some are even having to decide which bills they can afford to pay every month,” Duke Energy Florida State President Melissa Seixas said. “It was important to us that our customers get this significant rate relief as soon as possible while we continue to deliver the safe, reliable power they expect and deserve.”

More savings are on the way in March, too. Residential customers can expect to see an approximately $11 decrease per 1,000 kilowatt-hours used per month as a result of seasonal decreases Duke institutes annually from March through November to help customers save money during times when electricity use is higher due to higher temperatures.

That means in March, residential customers will enjoy a combined savings of $44 per 1,000 kilowatt-hours used on their bills compared to January.

The latest round of savings come after Duke Energy Florida made efficiency improvements at many of its natural gas plants, saving customers $340 million in fuel costs, translating to a savings on average of about $10 on customers’ monthly bills.

Westwood Energy Secondaries Fund II raised a collective $300 million, with the main fund raising $174 million and two co-investment vehicles raising $106 million and $20 million respectively, Westwood president of real assets Greg Reid told Secondaries Investor.

The raise exceeded its $150 million target, and the fund has already called about $200 million.

Fund II marks a significant step up from its $34 million predecessor, which also had a $14 million co-invest vehicle. However, Reid noted that the fund was originally only raised to invest in one continuation fund, which received $3 million from Fund I plus a capital from a $14 million co-investment fund. After that deal closed, Westwood found itself with dry powder and so it pivoted plans, acquiring 15 LP stakes.

“We wanted to take advantage of what we thought was a big mismatch between primarily institutional sellers who wanted liquidity and a relatively few number of buyers willing to step into an illiquid private energy fund,” Reid said about the strategy.

Reid said the Dallas-headquartered firm’s pipeline sits at around $800 million, and the fund could be “properly put to work” in the first or second quarter of the year.

About 70 percent of the fund will go toward LP-led transactions, with the remaining 30 percent earmarked for continuation vehicles and direct investments, Reid said. The fund is currently 88 percent allocated to LP-leds and 12 percent to CVs, although Reid expects to reach the 70-30 split.

The fund is primarily focused on traditional energy deals, meaning oil and gas. A typical LP-led deal would average about $3 million-$4 million, and Reid said those deals could be as low as $1 million and as high as $90 million. The fund will primarily target LP interests that are seven to 12 years old at a significant discount, the firm said in a statement Wednesday.

Reid said Westwood won’t invest in renewable energy or “anything unproven” and said he considers oil and gas more tried and true, profitable areas of focus. He noted that renewable energy in the US is heavily reliant on government subsidies, which have recently been taken away.

The Trump administration’s tax policy for endowments has also made oil and gas more favourable for buyers. As endowments look to offload their portfolios, Reid said traditional energy sectors are normally at the top of the list and come with discounts.

“If you’re going to go to market and sell an asset class, you’re probably going to sell something you don’t want to own. Energy hits the top of your list,” Reid said. “That’s why it’s so attractive to us, these are pretty proven businesses.”

Reid and Westwood declined to comment on targeted returns.

In her view, China laid the groundwork for carbon pricing in emerging economies that are now beginning to follow suit.
“India, Turkey, Indonesia, and Vietnam are all piloting or expanding carbon pricing.
And it shifts the expectations of industry.” This momentum is especially significant in countries with large manufacturing bases and growing energy demand, Chenfei explained.
“We need to make clean options as cheap, or cheaper, than the dirty way of doing things,” Jackie explained.","Energy systems scientist Jackie Dowling and climate economist Chenfei Qu come from different backgrounds, but both find themselves in the Stanford Energy Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Precourt Institute for Energy, working on interdisciplinary solutions to the challenges facing the clean energy transition.

In a recent conversation, both postdocs sat down to discuss the same question: Where is the energy transition gaining momentum, and what stands in its way?

“Diamonds are made under pressure, and right now, the pressure is climate change and AI,” said Jackie, who earned her Ph.D. at Caltech and begins a tenure-track faculty position at the University of Iowa this month.

Their discussion addresses the deployment gap between clean energy discoveries and the reliable, socially accepted systems needed for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions to zero.

“We’re still far from a sufficiently clean electricity system, not because we lack technology, but because of frictions in the real world,” Chenfei said, pointing to factors like unpriced pollution and income losses in fossil-fuel-dependent regions, like her home province in China.

Where momentum is building

In her Ph.D. at Tsinghua University, Chenfei studied China’s emissions trading system, which covers 60% of China’s emissions and almost 20% of global emissions. In her view, China laid the groundwork for carbon pricing in emerging economies that are now beginning to follow suit.

“In emerging economies especially, we are seeing momentum,” Chenfei said. “India, Turkey, Indonesia, and Vietnam are all piloting or expanding carbon pricing. It’s not perfect, but it’s movement. And it shifts the expectations of industry.”

This momentum is especially significant in countries with large manufacturing bases and growing energy demand, Chenfei explained. Raising the cost of carbon in these economies helps drive cleaner production at the source.

Jackie agreed that policy signals matter, and emphasized that not all policy tools operate in the same way, or on the same timeline. While carbon pricing can shape long-term expectations, she argued that many clean energy technologies are still constrained by cost in the near term, particularly in the United States.

“For a lot of these technologies, the problem is still cost,” Jackie said. “We want the cost to be lower.”

Government interventions, such as subsidies, have driven prices down for buyers of newer energy technologies, like solar and wind power, and batteries. But as federal support becomes uncertain, private sector demand becomes the major driver of deployment.

“Hyperscalers like Google and Microsoft are interested in 24/7 carbon-free power, and they want it yesterday,” Jackie observed. This demand is accelerating learning curves, particularly for clean firm power options like geothermal, nuclear, and carbon capture, which have remained expensive to develop and deploy despite subsidies. In her Ph.D, Jackie also looked at long-duration energy storage as an enabler of 24/7 carbon-free power systems. It appears corporate urgency is moving the needle on these deep decarbonization technologies, she explained.

Both fellows see the same principle at work: Clear, credible, and sustained signals, whether from policy or corporate commitments, create expectations that drive investment in cleaner technologies.

What stands in the way

Despite progress, the central obstacle to the energy transition is eliminating the “green premium,” Chenfei and Jackie agreed. The term, popularized by Bill Gates, means the extra cost of choosing a clean technology or pathway over the fossil fuel-based incumbent.

“We need to make clean options as cheap, or cheaper, than the dirty way of doing things,” Jackie explained.

At Stanford, her postdoctoral research addressed the challenge of achieving zero-emissions heat for industry and buildings. “For example, there are few options for producing steel with carbon-free, high-temperature heat. You can combust hydrogen, which is quite expensive, or keep using fossil fuels with carbon capture,” she explained. While some firms have electrified steel-making, these methods rely on the availability of cheap electricity to eliminate the green premium.

Chenfei countered that lowering costs alone won’t be enough. Eliminating the green premium also requires driving up the cost of polluting: “Fossil fuels feel free to burn, but they aren’t. Carbon pricing internalizes the externalities, like health and climate impacts, that we are all paying for.”

Jackie nodded. “That price gives scientists and engineers a target,” she said. “You’re setting the goal, and we’re trying to get there.”

Setting that goal can prove politically fraught, as Chenfei explores in her postdoctoral research. She studies who benefits and who bears the costs of the energy transition, and how those impacts vary by region. Even well-designed policies to fairly price carbon are often delayed or diluted by concerns over short-term economic impacts and loss of competitiveness, she explained. For instance, countries with large industrial sectors are hesitant to impose strict domestic climate policies if countries with competing industries are not doing so.

The challenge, Chenfei said, is designing carbon pricing policies that can withstand those pressures.

What comes next

When asked what gives them hope, the postdocs pointed to the mounting pressure itself. Climate change and surging energy demand are tightening constraints on engineers and policymakers alike. But those same pressures are also accelerating innovation and forcing hard choices.

“The stakes are higher than ever to drive down the green premium,” said Jackie. “But diamonds are made under pressure, and I’m betting on innovation.”

As Jackie begins her faculty career and Chenfei continues her fellowship at Stanford, their conversation underscores that reaching net zero will depend not on one lever, but many, pulled in concert by all kinds of people.",https://energy.stanford.edu/sites/energy/files/styles/large/public/media/image/chenfei_jackie_filter_960_x_640_1.jpg?itok=MCw58-Zo,N,,2026-01-14 14:59:40.215257

The costs and benefits of regulation are also unevenly distributed.
Most of the health benefits are concentrated in a small number of urban counties, while some rural areas bear significant costs with few benefits.","Most of the claimed benefits of federal regulation stem from air quality controls. Between 2006 and 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) accounted for 71 percent of the monetized benefits and 55 percent of the costs of all major federal regulations. Of those benefits, 95 percent came from air quality rules, primarily those targeting fine particulate matter (PM2.5), microscopic airborne particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter.

Thus, the EPA decision to no longer quantify the benefits of PM2.5 emission reduction is important. The rationale offered by the EPA is “the E.P.A.’s analytical practices often provided the public with false precision and confidence regarding the monetized impacts of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone.”

What do we know about the benefits of PM2.5 reduction? David Kemp and I examined the issue last year. The central problem is that our estimates of the mortality risks associated with PM2.5 exposure rely on observational studies. Randomized controlled trials, the gold standard for demonstrating cause and effect, are not feasible. Instead, researchers rely on statistical methods that remain vulnerable to unobserved and unmeasured alternative causes of mortality other than PM2.5 exposure.

Despite these limitations, such studies continue to underpin federal standards. The EPA also assumes there is no safe threshold for PM2.5 exposure. This assumption is highly contested and may exaggerate the estimated benefits of regulation. In addition, the EPA treats PM2.5 as a uniform substance, even though it includes a wide range of particles with different levels of toxicity.

For example, coal ash or diesel exhaust may be far more harmful than dust from unpaved roads, but current standards treat them all equally. This one-size-fits-all approach can result in too little regulation in some areas and too much in others.

The costs and benefits of regulation are also unevenly distributed. Most of the health benefits are concentrated in a small number of urban counties, while some rural areas bear significant costs with few benefits. When scientific uncertainty and regional variation are taken into account in the analysis, PM2.5 regulation may result in negative net benefits in many parts of the country.",https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/styles/optimized/public/2025-07/air%20quality%20.jpg?itok=EgL2RTV_,N,,2026-01-14 17:59:25.981443

In the opening weeks of 2026, Tesla Inc. has reasserted its grip on the U.S. electric vehicle market, capitalizing on the abrupt end of federal incentives that once buoyed its competitors. With the $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases eliminated under recent policy shifts, traditional automakers like Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. are reeling from production cuts and mounting losses. Tesla, however, has seen its domestic market share climb to new heights, driven by its unmatched production efficiency and a loyal customer base undeterred by higher prices.

This shift comes at a pivotal moment for the auto industry, as electric vehicles transition from subsidized novelty to mainstream necessity. Data from recent reports indicate that Tesla delivered over 1.8 million vehicles globally in 2025, though its U.S. sales have surged in the absence of incentives. Competitors, reliant on government support to make their EVs price-competitive, are now facing a stark reality: without those crutches, their offerings struggle to attract buyers in a cost-conscious environment.

Analysts point to Tesla’s vertical integration—controlling everything from battery production to software updates—as a key advantage. Unlike rivals who outsource critical components, Tesla can scale operations without the same profit erosion. This has allowed the company to maintain pricing power, even as overall EV demand softens amid economic headwinds.

The Incentive Vacuum and Its Immediate Fallout

The elimination of federal EV tax credits, effective at the start of 2026, has exposed vulnerabilities in the strategies of legacy carmakers. Ford, for instance, has scaled back production of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup, citing unprofitable sales without subsidies. Similarly, GM has paused expansions at its battery plants, with executives admitting that EV margins are “underwater” in the current climate.

According to a report from Business Insider, Tesla’s U.S. market share has soared to approximately 60% in the first quarter of 2026, up from 50% just a year prior. This resurgence echoes Tesla’s early dominance before incentives leveled the playing field for newcomers. The article highlights how Tesla’s focus on high-volume models like the Model Y and Model 3 allows it to absorb cost pressures better than competitors juggling diverse lineups.

Posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, reflect growing sentiment among industry watchers that Tesla’s scale is its ultimate weapon. Users have noted how rivals’ EV programs, once propped up by incentives, now face existential threats, with some predicting further market consolidation.

Competitors’ Struggles in a Post-Subsidy World

European and Asian automakers aren’t faring much better in the U.S. Mercedes-Benz and BMW, which relied on incentives to push luxury EVs, have reported double-digit sales declines. Rivian Automotive Inc., a darling of the startup scene, has slashed its 2026 production targets by 20%, blaming the incentive loss for eroding consumer interest in its higher-priced trucks and SUVs.

A deeper look reveals structural issues. Many competitors entered the EV space with ambitious plans but lacked Tesla’s cost discipline. For example, Volkswagen AG’s ID.4 SUV, once a strong seller with tax credits, now sits on dealer lots longer, leading to aggressive discounting that further squeezes margins. Industry data from Cox Automotive shows EV inventory levels rising 15% year-over-year, a sign of oversupply without demand stimulants.

Tesla, by contrast, has leveraged its Gigafactories to drive down per-unit costs. Elon Musk, the company’s CEO, has publicly touted this efficiency, stating in recent earnings calls that Tesla’s profitability per vehicle remains robust even without subsidies. This narrative is supported by financial analyses suggesting Tesla’s gross margins on EVs hover around 25%, compared to single-digit or negative figures for many rivals.

Global Contrasts and Domestic Dominance

While Tesla thrives domestically, its global position tells a different story. China’s BYD Co. overtook Tesla as the world’s top EV seller in 2025, delivering over 3 million units, according to reports from The New York Times. The piece details how BYD’s affordable models and massive home-market scale allowed it to surge ahead, even as Tesla grappled with competition in Europe and Asia.

Yet in the U.S., protective tariffs and regulatory barriers have shielded Tesla from BYD’s full onslaught. American policies restricting Chinese imports mean BYD’s low-cost vehicles aren’t flooding showrooms here, allowing Tesla to consolidate its lead. This dynamic underscores a bifurcated market: global fragmentation versus U.S. concentration.

Analysts from Reuters, in a piece on Tesla’s quarterly deliveries (Reuters), note that while Tesla’s overall sales dipped 9% annually due to international pressures, its U.S. performance bucked the trend. The report raises questions about Musk’s pivot to robotaxis and AI, but affirms that core auto operations remain resilient stateside.

Strategic Pivots and Future Trajectories

As competitors regroup, some are shifting toward hybrids to bridge the gap. Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co., long skeptics of full electrification, are seeing hybrid sales boom, capturing market segments where pure EVs falter without incentives. This hybrid resurgence, detailed in insights from Fastmarkets (Fastmarkets), could alter steel demand and supply chains, as hybrids require different materials than battery-heavy EVs.

Tesla, undeterred, is doubling down on innovation. The company plans to launch an updated Model 2, a more affordable compact aimed at broadening appeal. Musk has hinted at integrating advanced autonomy features, potentially justifying premium pricing in a subsidy-free era.

Industry insiders speculate this could further entrench Tesla’s position. A CarPro analysis (CarPro) emphasizes how Tesla’s loss of the global crown to BYD highlights rapid market changes, but in the U.S., the absence of incentives amplifies Tesla’s manufacturing edge.

Consumer Sentiment and Market Realities

Buyer behavior is evolving too. Without tax credits, affordability becomes paramount, favoring Tesla’s established ecosystem of Superchargers and over-the-air updates. Surveys indicate that 70% of recent EV purchasers cite range anxiety and charging infrastructure as top concerns, areas where Tesla excels.

Posts on X capture this enthusiasm, with users praising Tesla’s real-world usability over competitors’ promises. One thread discusses how Ford’s Mustang Mach-E, once a threat, now lags in software reliability, driving owners back to Tesla.

Moreover, economic factors like rising interest rates are making financed EV purchases less attractive, hitting incentive-dependent models hardest. Tesla’s direct-to-consumer sales model bypasses dealer markups, offering another layer of cost control.

Regulatory Ripples and Industry Adaptation

Policy changes extend beyond incentives. The Biden administration’s prior push for electrification has given way to a more hands-off approach, leaving automakers to navigate emissions standards without fiscal carrots. This has prompted lobbying efforts from GM and Ford for reinstated supports, but political gridlock suggests little relief soon.

TechCrunch’s coverage of Tesla’s sales decline globally (TechCrunch) contrasts this with U.S. gains, attributing the domestic boost to Tesla’s brand loyalty amid Musk’s controversial politics. Despite backlash, sales data shows minimal impact on core buyers.

Looking ahead, experts predict further consolidation. Smaller players like Lucid Group Inc. may seek mergers, while giants like Stellantis NV reassess EV commitments. Tesla’s robotaxi ambitions, if realized, could diversify revenue beyond vehicles, insulating it from market fluctuations.

Innovation as the Ultimate Differentiator

Tesla’s software prowess remains a wildcard. Features like Full Self-Driving, though regulatory hurdles persist, promise to elevate vehicle value post-purchase. Competitors scrambling to match this often partner with tech firms, adding complexity and costs.

AP News reports on Tesla’s second consecutive year of global sales drops (AP News), yet notes U.S. resilience tied to expiring incentives and competition. The article underscores Musk’s influence, from political endorsements to product pivots, as factors in consumer perceptions.

In this environment, Tesla’s ability to iterate rapidly—evidenced by Cybertruck refinements—sets it apart. As rivals cut losses, Tesla invests in expansion, eyeing new factories to sustain volume growth.

Sustaining Momentum in Uncertain Times

The road ahead isn’t without bumps. Supply chain disruptions, particularly in rare earth minerals, could challenge all players. Tesla’s investments in domestic sourcing mitigate some risks, but global dependencies linger.

Sentiment on X suggests optimism for Tesla’s trajectory, with discussions highlighting how incentive removal weeds out weaker competitors, paving the way for true innovators.

Ultimately, 2026 may mark the year Tesla solidifies its U.S. stronghold, proving that scale, efficiency, and vision trump subsidies in the long run. As the industry adapts, Tesla’s blueprint could redefine automotive success for decades.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/article-6384-1768373549.jpeg,N,,2026-01-14 14:59:36.305281

Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis, asked that the text also go directly on bills to better reach elderly ratepayers.

House Bill 1002, a House Republican priority proposal, would reshape utility providers’ low-income customer assistance programs, block service shut-offs to such customers on dangerously hot days, put all ratepayers on predictable billing plans and refashion ratemaking into three-year plans outfitted with performance-based incentives.

“The goal … is to prioritize affordability for Hoosier ratepayers and ensure our utilities are maintaining transparent, cost-effective practices,” the bill’s author, Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler, R-Noblesville, said in a statement after Tuesday’s committee meeting.

“Any potential changes to the bill will align with those goals,” she continued.

Only testimony was taken in in the House’s utilities committee on Tuesday, with amendments and a vote expected next week.

Advocates like Delaney Barber Kwon of Indiana Conservation Voters thanked Shonkwiler for her work but suggested “further clarification in order for intent to match implementation.”

The legislation would require electricity suppliers under Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission jurisdiction that don’t already offer low-income customer help programs to do so by July. The companies would fund those offerings to at least half the amount they recovered from ratepayers under their IURC-approved energy efficiency programs in the most recent year.

Luke Wilson, the chief policy officer of the Indiana Office of Energy Development, estimated that could direct up to $30 million annually to low-income Hoosier households.

“That is a cost shift that is already in bills,” he added, “so ratepayers are not feeling additional impact.”

The provision encountered mixed testimony.

Danielle McGrath, president of the Indiana Energy Association, said lawmakers shouldn’t use that funding mechanism because the revenue varies by utility and by year, while Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, said it’s “more than adequate funding.”

Committee Chair Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, noted the money has to come from somewhere, lest the bill be caught up in the finance-focused Ways and Means Committee.

Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, and others pushed for greater regulator oversight of the program requirements instead of leaving it largely up to the utilities themselves.

The legislation would require providers to notify customers of assistance programs on their websites. Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis, asked that the text also go directly on bills to better reach elderly ratepayers.

“My daughter is my parents’ IT support, so I appreciate your point,” Shonkwiler joked.

Another provision intended to ease the burden on low-income Hoosiers would mimic current policy banning winter electricity service shut-offs — from Dec. 1 to March 15 — to the summertime. A key difference, however, is the pause would be triggered by federal extreme heat warnings instead of taking effect across the hottest months of the year.

Pierce and customer advocates argued a months-based approach would be simpler to administer and benefit customers more.

“We need to be really careful (that) we just don’t pile up four months of debt on these people, and now they’re looking at trying to get reconnected, and the price is so high they can’t do it,” Soliday replied.

Debt fears also arose in detailed discussion over so-called budget billing plans, which promote predictability for customers by holding monthly bill amounts steady despite changes in usage. But when utilities settle up, shocked customers may find themselves on the hook for large sums.

“Families think they’re being on a program to help stabilize their finances, and they feel like they’re being preyed upon,” said Rep. Alex Burton, D-Evansville.

Pryor suggested a name change.

“I think part of what’s confusing the people is they hear ‘budget billing,’ and they think … there is a savings,” she said. “So, maybe, the word ‘budget’ needs to be changed to something that’s more reflective of what it really is.”

“It is confusing,” Soliday agreed. “… It doesn’t save you money. It saves you from spikes, is what it does. And some folks can endure spikes, and (for) others, it’s really painful.”

House Bill 1002 would require that every customer be put on such plans, but be given the ability to opt out. Utilities would settle up with participants at least twice a year, in an effort to avoid the sticker shock of a once-annual true-up.

Several witnesses recommended removing “at least” from the legislation to ensure true-ups don’t occur so often they erode the predictability budget billing is supposed to bring. Other suggestions included limiting implementation to just low-income customers, adding more detail on when the debt is due and pushing the effective day back from July.

Bill explores longer rate cycles, incentives

The measure would also switch up Indiana’s traditional ratemaking process by requiring utilities to pursue IURC approval of multi-year rate plans. The first year would be done “in the same manner” as now, while the second and third years would be based on projections.

Although Soliday said the intent was to make utilities file the same detailed information as is currently required, some warned the language may not be explicit enough.

Joe Rompala, representing the Indiana Industrial Energy Consumers, also testified there’s no mechanism to settle the difference between the projected data and what actually transpires.

“This helps ensure that customers are only paying for assets which have actually been put into service, and which are actually being used to serve them when rates go into effect,” Rompala said. “This upholds a longstanding legal principle which helps shield ratepayers from excessive investment, which generates no direct benefits to them.”

Pierce and several witnesses objected to language specifying that the multi-year rate plans operate “independently” of trackers — requiring that regulators consider them “separately.”

Trackers allow utilities to increase rates based on certain expenses they have.

Sam Carpenter, the executive director of the Hoosier Environmental Council, feared that could “undermine some of the cost-containment goals.” He asked for lawmakers to clarify the “interaction” between those mechanisms.

Soliday previously said some trackers may “disappear” if multi-year ratemaking is adopted, telling the committee, “I’ve had some (utilities) say to me, they may just drop (the Transmission, Distribution, Storage Improvement Charge) completely, because it works into the plan.”

The multi-year rate plans would be paired with new performance metrics and incentives tied to customer affordability and service restoration.

Several witnesses suggested incentivizing additional priorities, like reducing peak load demand or promoting environmental sustainability. Others asked that the incentives be tailored to specific utilities or said the proposed incentive range is too small to drive utility decision-making.

It’s unclear which chunks of the bill could get the biggest revisions.

Where we are

1. Where are we? Well, we are still hurtling toward disaster

We are way behind on emission reduction pathways.

In 2025 it looks like total global emissions were roughly the same as 2024. That’s a small win, but they need to be reducing 8-10% p.a. to meet climate goals. And fossil fuel emissions went up 1.1%; it’s just that land-use emissions were down, partly because of the ending of El Niño.

And we have discovered that a major short-term pollutant – methane – is much more of a problem than we had expected. US ‘natural’ gas, for example, has been booming, but we now find that its life cycle emissions may be worse than coal-fired power; so, while we’ve been shouting “we’re transitioning,” we have in fact been going backwards. Aaargh!

Our lack of progress on emissions reduction means that temperatures have been rising rapidly. We have now breached the 1.5°C threshold that scientists have been pressing us to have as an outer limit, and we're experiencing increasingly severe heatwaves, storms, and floods around the world. This is now going to get progressively worse for the foreseeable future, with disastrous impacts unless we rapidly prepare and adapt.

In the meantime, biodiversity collapse continues apace, with scientists talking of millions of species at risk of disappearing on land and in the seas, on top of what has already gone. One sobering statistic from the animal kingdom: domesticated animals comprise 60% of the world's mammalian biomass, humans account for 34%, leaving only 6% for wild animals — a share that continues to decline.

The challenges we face remain severe. But there is progress.

2. Yet, we have won the energy argument. A big win!

Despite the grim state of things, we are making progress. The impact of efforts to date has been to lower what is the expected maximum level of warming to around 3.5°C. We have “bent the curve”.

That’s largely due to changes in energy use. In 2024, according to the International Energy Agency, over 90% of all investment in electricity generation was for clean energy.

I’d call that a slam dunk.

Solar power costs continue to fall by up to 20% annually, thanks primarily to the production cost reductions driven by China's massive renewable energy deployment — motivated as much by energy security as environmental commitment.

Solar is now cheaper, easier, and faster to deploy across markets from Africa to SE Asia. And, as predicted by our friends at Carbon Tracker, it’s creating piles of stranded assets, like the coal-fired power stations now losing money in Pakistan.

Wind energy, perhaps surprisingly, continues to drop in cost as well. And that includes floating offshore wind! Earlier this month, Japan started up its first floating offshore wind farm, with lots more in the planning (investment that will need a lot of green bonds).

Yes, we still need to shut down all the fossil fuel power generation on the planet – a vast task – and that will require speeding upthe renewables roll-out. But let’s savour the energy win.

3. Electric car sales are surging, and mass transit is growing

That comes thanks again to a history of strong government support in China, where 50% of Chinese cars sold in 2024 were EVs. But this has now spread to emerging markets, with 26% of car sales in Pakistan being EVs, 60% in Ethiopia, 70% in Nepal, etc.

Given the resource and energy intensity of car manufacturing, substituting petrol and electric cars is not the perfect solution; but we are also on the cusp of a broader mobility revolution.

The development that gets most attention is the meteoric rise of ride-hailing services (Uber, Didi, Ola, Grab, etc). Their huge growth in recent years has changed transport habits, with more to come with the imminent morph into driverless cars (already working in some Chinese and US cities). Privately owned cars are generally only driven 5% of the time; as shared vehicle services grow we should expect to see a lot fewer vehicles per capita, with higher utilisation rates; and more space in cities to turn over to cafes and small parks.

The development I find most compelling is with electric two-wheelers. In China they have become ubiquitous; in cities from Chennai to London they are also booming, especially for commuters. In a rapidly aging world, their ease of use is especially useful for older people.

But the development that is having the most impact is the growth of mass transit systems.

If you’ve ridden the subway networks of Tokyo or Shanghai or Delhi you’ll know what the future looks like in big cities. In the past 25 years subway development has been most incredible in China; Beijing, for example, had 54 kms of subways in 2000; it now has 879kms. But this now happening in other countries as well: Mumbai had no subways in 2000; it now has 80kms of them, with more coming this year.

Public capital for subway development in emerging markets like Bangladesh is scarce, but cities like Tokyo and Hong Kong have shown us how to finance mass transit without government subsidies, by using property development over new stations to finance the building of new lines. Expect every emerging market city to be beating a path to their doors.

4. Green and Sustainable bonds are now over USD6tn outstanding — and growing

The climate transition is capital-intensive! Decarbonisation and resilience both involve huge amounts of capital investment to build new kit, like solar farms or to retrofit what we have to make it future-fit, although operating costs are much lower. As well, we have to deliver on economic opportunities for citizens (for example, did you know that in India a million young people join the workforce every month?). To make all this happen we will need to see more than USD10tn a year flowing to climate solution investments.

Capital availability is not the issue. Global investment pools have expanded profoundly over the last 50 years, with the total value of global financial wealth increasing from tens of trillions to over USD305tn by 2024. Immense! It’s just that those pools are not always in the right places.

Except in one area. Ten years ago, when the Paris Agreement was signed, there were only USD100m in green and sustainable bonds outstanding globally. Today it’s more than USD6tn, with demand remaining strong and issuers reaping the rewards.

In a report we published at COP30 we found that, based solely on bonds expected from existing issuers, the next 10 years should see USD17.8tn in global issuance. I.e. that’s without accounting for new issuers, and they continue to appear.

Investors will choose green when given a good chance.

What to expect in 2026

1. Transition finance is building up a head of steam

The idea of transition planning in industries like steel, cement and chemicals has become a norm, encouraged by shareholders and regulators in Japan, Europe and China. We’re now seeing the spread of credible transition plans.

For example, China's Hebei province has issued steel transition-finance guidance, supporting decarbonisation through 176 eligible technologies, including hydrogen-based production. As Hebei produces 11% of global steel, this guidance — which requires steel companies to develop transition plans — sets a powerful precedent. The same guidance requires that the steel companies develop a transition plan.

12 provinces in China, covering a population greater than the US and the EU combined, have now issued transition plans.

Japan’s government has made Green (industrial) Transformation into a major national programme. They’ve even set up a special “GX Acceleration” agency to invest in transition technologies and companies, and are issuing USD10bn of sovereign climate transition bonds each year to finance the programme. The programme still needs work in some places, but every country needs one of these. Japan is moving.

Change is in the air.

2. Resilience finance is growing

As the atmosphere warms, avoiding catastrophic climate change means emission reduction targets get tougher, not weaker. Simultaneously, consequence of past emissions growth have to be managed, including secondary effects on economies, societies, health and nature. They will get progressively more severe over the next 25 years.

We need to prepare.

We are fortunate: we now have unprecedented predictive capacity — the tools to anticipate and plan for rising climate impacts.

These tools are working. In places like Tokyo, for example, where an understanding of climate impacts has led to massive investments to improve resilience to increased rainfall, flooding and storm intensity. To finance that work, late last year Tokyo issued its first EUR300m (¥53bn) Climate Bonds Certified resilience bond; it was seven times oversubscribed!

Banks are starting down this road: last week Standard Chartered Bank issued its first green bond, with a big chunk of the proceeds going to finance climate resilience investments. This mixing of decarbonisation and resilience will be a major part of finance for climate action in the future.

3. Financing the boom in emerging market cities

Last November the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs published research showing that nine of the world’s 10 largest cities are now in emerging markets. Jakarta has nearly 42 million people; Dhaka, the world’s second largest city, has 36.6 million.

Around the world, 33 cities now have more than 10 million people.

In some regions, like South Asia and Africa, overall populations are still growing. But the big issue is the rapid shift from rural communities to cities. The West went through this last century; for example, in the US, in 1900, 60% of people were rural dwellers; it’s now down to 20%. In emerging markets impacted by increasingly severe climate change, volatile weather will make life tougher for small farmers, accelerating the shift that’s already underway.

We need to plan for 80% of people to live in cities by 2050. And those cities will have to be fit for the sort of future we’re heading into.

For a start, they’ll have to be heat-resilient. Severe heat waves are going to become the norm. Large-scale urban tree planting helps, reducing ambient temperatures by up to 5°C, but we also need building designs and materials that will help keep us cool. And to go underground.

They’ll also have to be low-carbon, water-efficient, and denser.

Cities including Nairobi, Montreal, and Reykjavik already run 100% on clean electricity. Transport will be electric, from two-wheelers to ride-hailing to mass transport. Using property development over subway stations to pay for the vast number of subway lines needed will become the norm.

Cycles of drought and flood will become the norm, forcing us to better collect, use and recycle water. Perhaps the best current example is Singapore, which uses high levels of recycling to achieve water self-security.

Dense cities use less energy, are easier to service, and serve as incubators of economic growth. Managing density can help with other objectives — for example, if we allow zero-carbon and water-efficient buildings to have more height (and so floor space) than normal buildings, developers will build accordingly.

But cities will, above all, have to be engines for wealth and job creation. If we’re to avoid slums and favelas that will leave millions at risk of disaster in every severe storm and flood, the millions moving must find livelihoods, housing, and services. Cities are already national engines for national economic development, but rapid growth will require extra effort to absorb people smoothly.

Step change in urban development will take significant investment capital. Tax-based funds are totally inadequate for the work required.

In places like the USA, a robust market of municipal bonds finances urban infrastructure and development; that’s also been the same in China. Municipal finance is increasingly visible in emerging markets — in the last few months, we have seen very successful green bond issuance from Bogota in Colombia, Surat in Gujarat, and from the State of Lagos in Nigeria. Plus green bonds from city water and transport utilities all around the world.

Expect more in 2026.

4. Finance for nature grows

The most common discussion of “nature” focuses on protecting and restoring biodiversity, on land and at sea. While we continue to look for ways of funding forest protection, the bulk of effort will involve government expenditure. We already have, for example, France using its green bond to fund work to protect the rainforest of French Guaiana, and the Australian Government using its green bond for ecosystem restoration in the Great Barrier Reef. Expect to see more of this being included in sovereign green bond issuance in the coming year.

The second focus is bringing nature and agriculture closer together. Sustainable agriculture that supports biodiversity usually requires changes to farming practices, such as the creation of wildlife corridors that Brazil’s Forest Code encourages, or the avoidance of polluting pesticides and fertiliser. Expect relevant issuance to grow in Brazil and in China.

Watch Sean Kidney speak from the Amazon at COP30 in Belém

The third focus is the integration of nature into cities. That will range from greening streets (reducing heat while we do so), to planning wildlife corridors, to preserving wetlands for birds. Expect to see the inclusion of relevant expenditures in green debt issuance from cities and from major developers.

5. Grow climate finance to match the tens of trillions needed

Green bonds continue to get higher over-subscription rates than ordinary bonds, and regular pricing benefit. That leads governments and corporates to ask “could this work for us?”

USD6tn+ is a great start as an indicator of capital flowing, but we need a lot more — more like USD30tn by 2030.

A lot will be new investment, from solar power to resilient water infrastructure in places starting to experience more severe droughts.

For governments it means bringing in policy settings that lead to the creation of more climate investment opportunities.

That might range from better planning for the expansion of transmission lines to bring renewable energy to industry and setting up subway authorities with the powers needed for property development over railways stations, as Hong Kong as done to finance its subway network, to tax-breaks for urban agriculture that improves city resilience and getting involved in ensuring critical minerals availability. The very first and often most impactful step will be reform to fast-track relevant investment approvals.

Programmes will range from the national, like China’s New Economy Plan or Japan’s Green Transformation initiative, to simply requiring water utilities to incorporate robust climate impacts planning into their decision-making process.

It’s not always about new capital, it’s also about making sure what we invest in is future-fit.

The majority of investment we need involves changing the requirements of what we’re already planning to do, from making sure that when we upgrade ports we prepare them to deal with more severe storm impacts, to switching transport investments to electric.

In fact, the majority of what we have to do is to “green” existing capital flows — rethinking what we build and how we manage. Upgrading the requirements for underlying investments will allow bond issuance to be included in climate investment portfolios.

This year we’ll also see bonds related to improving the resilience of everything from physical infrastructure (like Tokyo’s successful Climate Bonds Certified resilience bond late last year) to economic systems.

Emerging transition and resilience guidance gives governments, cities, and corporates a clear roadmap for action.

Thinking past 2026 — it's not just the now

Change doesn’t happen in a linear fashion.

There will be backward lurches, like we’re experiencing in US climate policy right now. We are seeing tectonic changes in the norms of government and politics. They could be teaching moments; that ""Trump effect"" can be positive in one key way — it can liberate those of us working to address climate change to think big, to be audacious.

And there are already big shifts. On clean energy we’re in the middle of a gargantuan shift forward, kicked off by the German Greens introducing a feed-in tariff in 2001, then scaled up massively by China. Thank you Beijing.

Other opportunities will present themselves; and the volume of climate finance opportunities — and climate-related bonds — will grow.

The window remains narrow for reducing emissions and preparing for the climate impacts coming our way. We have to move fast.",,N,,2026-01-14 16:00:00.706985

But the hearing detoured into a debate over offshore drilling, and assertions by some Democrats that the proposal amounts to a financial and regulatory giveaway for the oil and gas industry, and is an “extreme waiver of responsibilities” for their infrastructure.

The launch of domestic manufacturing capacity when complete will represent a transformational expansion of NeoVolta’s business model, positioning the Company to serve the utility-scale and commercial & industrial (C&I) energy storage markets as a U.S. manufacturer.

The Georgia facility is designed for 2 GWh of initial annual production capacity, scalable to up to 8 GWh, and is expected to begin mass production in mid-2026. Located along the I-85 corridor, the facility will initially focus on prismatic-cell battery pack assembly and DC container integration, supporting approximately 89 production personnel at steady-state initial capacity.

This announcement marks a step-change in NeoVolta’s scale and strategic positioning. The Company believes the establishment of domestic BESS manufacturing capacity materially expands its addressable market, growth profile, and long-term relevance, and warrants a closer evaluation of NeoVolta’s opportunity set

Illustrative Revenue Potential

Industry analyses, including from the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), indicate that utility-scale and C&I battery energy storage systems in active U.S. markets can generate approximately $200 per kilowatt-hour of installed capacity, depending on configuration and commercial structure.

At an illustrative level, 2 GWh of annual production at an average realized value of $200 per kilowatt-hour would represent approximately $400 million of annual revenue potential at full utilization. This illustrative example is not a forecast or projection and is provided solely to convey the scale of the opportunity. Actual results may differ materially based on product mix, customer contracts, pricing, capacity utilization, market conditions, and other factors.

This illustrative example is provided to highlight the order of magnitude of the opportunity associated with domestic BESS manufacturing and does not constitute financial or revenue guidance. Broader industry forecasts from sources including BloombergNEF, NREL, and Wood Mackenzie project the total U.S. battery energy storage TAM, spanning utility-scale, residential, C&I, and related services, to expand to approximately $45 billion annually by 2030. By establishing domestic manufacturing focused on utility-scale and C&I systems, NeoVolta Power positions the Company to address a significantly larger share of this rapidly growing market.

“This transformative joint venture with PotisEdge and LONGi represents a major step forward for NeoVolta, positioning us as a vertically integrated leader in the fast-growing energy storage sector. By launching domestic BESS manufacturing, we’re directly addressing surging demand in utility-scale and C&I markets, enabling scalable, reliable solutions for grid stability, peak load management, and high-growth applications,” said Ardes Johnson, Chief Executive Officer of NeoVolta.

NeoVolta holds a 60% controlling interest in the joint venture, NeoVolta Power, LLC, and will oversee product strategy, commercialization, and customer engagement. Governance is structured through a five-member board of managers, three of whom are appointed by NeoVolta. PotisEdge holds a 20% ownership interest and contributes deep expertise in large-scale BESS manufacturing, equipment installation, commissioning, and production ramp support. The remaining 20% is held by a group of strategic investors providing additional technical and operational support. Based on this ownership and governance structure, NeoVolta expects to consolidate the joint venture’s financial results in its consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP, with minority interests reflected as non-controlling interests, subject to final agreement terms and applicable accounting standards.

Strategic Manufacturing Platform

Initial production is expected to be weighted toward utility-scale systems, with C&I systems representing an increasing share as demand grows. The platform is designed to support multiple system configurations and product formats to meet evolving market requirements.

Strategic Partnership with Global Renewable Energy Leaders

The joint venture brings together three complementary energy technology leaders: NeoVolta, PotisEdge, and LONGi Green Energy.

PotisEdge, a globally recognized leader in BESS manufacturing and now part of LONGi Green Energy, holds a 20% ownership interest in the JV and contributes deep expertise in large-scale battery manufacturing, including equipment installation, commissioning, and production ramp support, based on proven systems deployed internationally.

LONGi, one of the world’s largest renewable energy companies and the global leader in solar manufacturing, is the majority owner of PotisEdge as part of its strategic expansion into energy storage. LONGi’s involvement reflects broader industry convergence across solar, storage, and integrated clean-energy solutions, and underscores the strategic relevance of the JV within the global renewable energy ecosystem.

Together, the three companies combine NeoVolta’s U.S. market leadership and product strategy, PotisEdge’s advanced BESS manufacturing systems, and LONGi’s global scale, execution discipline, and energy-transition vision, creating a domestic manufacturing platform designed for scale, quality, and long-term growth.

Partner Perspectives

“PotisEdge is proud to partner with NeoVolta in building a U.S. battery manufacturing platform designed for scale and long-term growth,” said Minjie, Founder and Chief Technology Officer of PotisEdge. “As a minority owner, we are contributing our manufacturing experience, systems, and technical capabilities to support efficient execution and a successful production ramp for utility-scale and C&I energy storage solutions.”

“LONGi’s strategic expansion into energy storage reflects our commitment to delivering integrated, scalable clean-energy solutions,” said Eric Luo, Group Vice President and President of North America at LONGi Green Energy. “By aligning PotisEdge’s technology leadership with NeoVolta’s U.S. market expertise, this joint venture brings together complementary strengths to serve the next phase of growth in renewable energy infrastructure.”

Financing and Capital Support

The formation and initial development of the joint venture are supported by capital commitments and phased funding aligned with manufacturing milestones. Funding is expected to be provided through a combination of equity and debt, anchored by Infinite Grid Capital.

NeoVolta announced a $13 million private placement in November 2025, anchored by Infinite Grid Capital, providing near-term capital to support initial JV funding requirements and general corporate purposes. As capacity ramps, the JV is structured to pursue project-level debt financing, incentive monetization, and other customary funding sources for U.S. manufacturing facilities, providing flexibility to support expansion beyond initial production levels.

Upcoming Milestones

Key anticipated milestones include:

• Execution of technical and management services agreements

• Acquisition and installation of manufacturing equipment

• Initial production ramp in mid-2026

• Planning for expansion beyond 2 GWh of annual capacity

NeoVolta expects to provide updates as these milestones are achieved.",https://www.nacleanenergy.com/images/thumbnail_58387_neo.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 17:59:18.560485

BP's low-carbon portfolio also includes U.S. biogas producer Archaea which BP bought in 2022 for $4.1 billion. Citi analysts said they suspected impairments might be linked to this unit.

After taking a $24 billion hit from exiting Russia in 2022, BP - with a current market capitalisation of around $91 billion - recorded impairments of $5.7 billion in 2023, $5.1 billion in 2024 and has flagged around $6.9 billion for last year, according to its releases and Reuters calculations.

'CLEARING THE DECKS'

The company slashed its annual spending on energy transition businesses about a year ago from $7 billion to a maximum of $2 billion as it embarked on a major strategy shift back to oil and gas.

It has also had leadership changes with Meg O'Neill set to replace interim CEO Carol Howle in April after Murray Auchincloss's abrupt exit last month.

""We see this as a first step in new management 'clearing the decks', with the next logical step being to cut the buyback to zero and allow for further de-leveraging in a weaker macro environment,"" said RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria.

BP is buying back around $750 million worth of shares every quarter.

NET DEBT FALLING DUE TO DIVESTMENTS

BP expects net debt to have dropped to $22 billion–$23 billion by the end of 2025 from $26.1 billion in the third quarter, helped by divestments of about $5.3 billion, above earlier guidance. The figure excludes $6 billion from selling a majority stake in its Castrol lubricants unit. BP aims to cut debt to $14 billion–$18 billion by 2027.

Refining margins slipped to $15.20 a barrel from $15.80 in the previous quarter. BP’s 440,000-barrel-per-day Whiting refinery in the U.S. suffered outages after an October fire, adding to earlier disruptions from flooding and a major 2024 outage.

Additionally, multiple ‘hybrid’ companies – those that both produce and purchase cells for ESS units – are classified as cell producers in this model.
Especially for the cell manufacturers, this could be due to the larger investment in R&D, with many larger capacity cells being announced recently.
Tesla and Sungrow, being our only two AAA-rated companies in the report, also have the highest Altman Z-score by a wide margin.
Tesla and Sungrow continue to lead the industry with their AAA bankability ratings, underscoring their financial stability and manufacturing excellence.","The manufacturing score mainly focuses on the shipment and assembly of energy storage system (ESS) modules. An adjustment was made to slightly lower the weight of the cell production score due to the industry’s shift towards a more system integrator model. Although this change had a minimal overall impact on each company’s scores, it reflects the trend of many companies in the business thriving over the last year by purchasing cells for their ESS modules.

When examining all companies rated BB and above, the first release of the report indicated that almost 80% of the companies were involved in some form of cell production. In contrast, the most recent release, in Q3 2025, shows that this figure is just above 50%. Part of this change can be attributed to the shift in methodology. However, even prior to this change, there was a noticeable trend; for example, in Q2 2025, the percentage was just over 60%.

Additionally, multiple ‘hybrid’ companies – those that both produce and purchase cells for ESS units – are classified as cell producers in this model. This suggests that even more of the higher rated companies are involved in some sort of cell purchasing.

This will be an interesting trend to track, especially over the coming quarters, as the larger capacities of cells start to be utilised in utility-scale developments, by both integrators and suppliers.

Shipment Trends

Figure 3 shows the destination for own-brand shipments from the top 15 companies across various regions. Just over 50% of shipments go to China, which is expected, given the size and the presence of many leading companies located in the country.

The data also highlights the emergence of new markets in the Middle East and Africa and Latin America, where there are increasing amounts of large-scale projects and therefore shipments. Given that the sizes of the newer projects are only increasing and the large amounts of money being invested, their proportion of the global market is expected to rise even further in 2026.

The Rest of the World (RoW) segment mainly consists of Australia and other Asia-Pacific countries. Australia is one of the largest developing markets, with multiple 1GWh+ sites expected to be completed in the near future.

While the US remains the second-largest market globally, there has been a slight decline in shipment shares over the past year. This downturn may be attributed to a strategic shift by many top Chinese suppliers, who are actively seeking to expand into other regions to avoid some of the current headwinds in the US market, such as supply chain disruptions, regulatory hurdles, and increasing competition within the sector.

Financial Trends

Figure 4 provides an analysis of the average Altman Z-score for the top 15 companies, breaking it down into its various components. The valuation metric continues to represent the largest portion of the overall score, consistent with our results from last year, but this is now at a more realistic level. Since some companies are still quite overvalued, we have continued to make modifications to certain scores using a Price:Sales ratio. This adjustment aims to ensure the valuation component does not overshadow the other critical metrics.

The Altman-Z score is divided into parts, allowing for a clear evaluation of the three key metrics that contribute to a company’s financial health: Liquidity, Leverage and Profitability. The Liquidity and Leverage metrics are trending upwards, increasing over the last three years in the sample, and profitability is staying around the same level. Especially for the cell manufacturers, this could be due to the larger investment in R&D, with many larger capacity cells being announced recently. These metrics consistently staying positive and rising is an excellent sign for the industry.

Tesla and Sungrow, being our only two AAA-rated companies in the report, also have the highest Altman Z-score by a wide margin. Most companies outside of these two, but in the top 15, lie around 2.1.

As you might expect from a growing industry, the ESS revenue share has increased every year in the sample. However, the scale of growth has been very impressive, moving from a tiny proportion of most of the larger players’ revenues to a solid percentage in only six years. The companies involved have also had revenue growth every year, with the last two years being a much smaller growth than from 2021 to 2023, the majority of this gap due to BYD’s revenue scaling in recent years.

The average operating margin for each of the companies has remained around 10% over the last few years, with it slightly decreasing after 2023, potentially as a result of the decrease in battery prices in the same period. The peak in 2021 comes from a lot of the larger cell-producing companies in the sample peaking in profitability, as a result of lower lithium and higher battery pricing.

In conclusion, the evolving landscape of the BESS market highlights significant shifts in both market dynamics and company strategies. Tesla and Sungrow continue to lead the industry with their AAA bankability ratings, underscoring their financial stability and manufacturing excellence.

However, the rise of system integrators, coupled with a growing reliance on purchased cells, signals a transformative shift in the industry’s operational model. Emerging markets in regions like the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America are driving new growth opportunities, while established markets like the US face challenges from regulatory and competitive pressures.

Financially, the industry remains robust, with key metrics such as liquidity and leverage trending positively, and revenue shares for top companies steadily increasing. As the sector continues to mature, the focus on larger capacity cells and utility-scale projects will likely shape the next phase of growth, making it an exciting time for stakeholders across the BESS ecosystem.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-4.png,N,,2026-01-14 15:00:05.318512

The request, filed with the Louisiana Public Service Commission, is the first time Earthjustice has formally petitioned a utility regulator to probe data center financing, and the group said it believes it is the first of its kind nationwide.

The motion centers around the financing of Meta's largest-ever data center project - a more than 2 gigawatt planned facility in Richland Parish, Louisiana.

The Louisiana Public Service Commission approved an application last year for the local utility to build three new gas-fired electric generating stations and transmission to power the data center. The original financing structure came with a parent-company financial guarantee that would ultimately fall on Meta, which was the parent company of the site's developer at the time, Earthjustice said.

Under a financial agreement later announced between Meta and its joint venture partner Blue Owl Capital, a newly formed company called Beignet Investors became the new owner of the data center and the parent company of the project's developer, said Earthjustice, which cited an analysis of the deal reported by the Wall Street Journal.

Meta, meanwhile, became a lessee. The new arrangement also allows Meta to exit its lease after four years, instead of an initially agreed-upon 15 years, potentially allowing it to stop paying for energy or infrastructure build-out costs early, the motion said.

""If Meta ends the lease after four years almost none of the costs of the generating station or the associated transmission will have been paid up by Meta at that point,"" said Earthjustice attorney Susan Stevens Miller. Instead, those costs would be moved to customers of the local utility, Stevens Miller said.

Meta and Blue Owl were not immediately available for comment.

This status traps workers in lower-productivity jobs that offer limited benefits and weak social protection, reinforcing the cycle of poverty and poor-quality work.
These sectors can generate quality jobs, including for lower-skilled workers, but require infrastructure, stable regulatory frameworks, and access to finance that many countries lack.","The difference? Economic growth. EAP averaged 5.3 percent annual growth during this period, while LAC managed just 1.6 percent, the weakest performance among developing regions and well below the 2.7 percent global average. LAC's poverty declined over time, but faster growth could have accelerated progress further. The path forward is clear: accelerating growth and creating quality jobs at scale are essential to moving more people out of poverty and into the middle class.

The 2025 edition of the World Bank's Regional Poverty and Inequality Update for Latin America and the Caribbean shows that by 2025, the middle class —those living on more than $17 per day per capita—will become LAC's largest economic group at 42.8 percent of the population. Yet the poor and those vulnerable to falling into poverty will still represent the remaining 57.2 percent.

While recent job creation has lifted many out of poverty, this progress is built on fragile foundations. The core issue isn’t the quantity of jobs, but their quality. Labor productivity has stagnated for a decade, while wages have grown slowly despite rising educational levels. Eight in ten poor workers in Latin America and the Caribbean remain trapped in informal jobs, lacking benefits, security, and opportunities for advancement .

Jobs lift people out of poverty, but poor-quality work keeps them insecure. Too many workers cycle between low-quality positions, gaining employment but not prosperity. When workers move up the occupational ladder into higher-skilled roles, their chances of escaping poverty increase significantly. However, structural barriers prevent most workers from advancing: inadequate education systems that fail to meet labor market needs, rigid regulations that discourage hiring, and weak capital markets that deprive productive firms of investment.

These barriers create a poverty trap. In Latin America, the persistence of poverty is alarming: over half of poor households remain poor year after year, with persistence rates reaching 76 percent in Brazil and 74 percent in Peru. Informality perpetuates this cycle. Between 2016 and 2024, informal employment (measured by the share of workers without pension contributions) either increased or remained stable across all socioeconomic groups. This status traps workers in lower-productivity jobs that offer limited benefits and weak social protection, reinforcing the cycle of poverty and poor-quality work.

The World Bank aims to break this cycle by making job creation an explicit target. The goal is to foster dynamic private sectors that unlock opportunities where people already live.

In LAC, three priorities stand out:

First, unlocking investment in strategic sectors where the region holds competitive advantages: agribusiness, tourism, and renewable energy. These sectors can generate quality jobs, including for lower-skilled workers, but require infrastructure, stable regulatory frameworks, and access to finance that many countries lack.

Second, forging stronger links between education systems and labor markets. Rising school enrollment means little if graduates cannot find productive work; skills development must connect to employer needs.

Third, reducing the friction that traps workers in low-productivity jobs: rigid labor regulations, limited credit for small enterprises, and weak competition frameworks that entrench incumbents.

LAC’s recent progress confirms that job creation is essential for poverty reduction. However, sustaining this progress and building a thriving middle class requires higher productivity and better jobs.

The World Bank's role is to help make that transition possible, combining financial resources with technical expertise and convening power to break down the barriers holding the region back. The alternative is sluggish socioeconomic progress, and the region cannot afford it.",https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/wbcollab/BlogMejoresempleosLAC?qlt=90&hei=630&wid=1200&fit=hfit,N,,2026-01-14 14:59:47.677138

The Compliance Memorandum, nicknamed the Pritzlaff Memo, directs staff to prioritize efficient compliance over punitive measures, supporting the agency’s “Powering the Great American Comeback” initiative and balancing environmental protection with economic growth. The Compliance Memorandum emphasizes that enforcement should focus on obtaining compliance efficiently and economically. We have yet to see how the Compliance Memorandum manifests. These themes are noteworthy:

The Compliance Memorandum does not de-prioritize inspections or other compliance assurance activities; and

The Compliance Memorandum changes the potential set of remedies and EPA’s approach.

Key Changes from Past Practice

Historically, EPA enforcement focused on building robust cases that aligned with compliance priorities and forced regulatory interpretations through enforcement that could withstand litigation. EPA’s case selection often resulted in prolonged investigations, expansive injunctive relief, and noteworthy fines. The Compliance Memorandum shifts EPA’s enforcement focus away from expansive enforcement actions and towards efficiency and clarity to achieve well defined compliance. Notable changes include:

Compliance Over Punishment

The Compliance Memorandum directs EPA personnel to prioritize achieving compliance “in the most efficient, most economical, and swiftest means possible.” This includes open communication between EPA and regulated entities throughout inspections and the enforcement process. The increased transparency or “no surprises” framework aims to avoid disputes over process and procedures.

Rescission of 2021 Injunctive Relief Guidance

The Compliance Memorandum rescinds the April 2021 memorandum that encouraged expansive injunctive relief measures such as advanced monitoring, third-party audits, and supplemental environmental projects (SEPs). Under the new framework, injunctive provisions must be narrowly tailored, legally defensible, and directly tied to specific violations. And notably, SEPs are prohibited until further guidance is issued.

Clear and Consistent Findings of Violation

Findings of violation must now be clear and unambiguous, well-tailored, and based on the “best reading” of statutes and regulations. When a respondent questions how EPA interprets and applies the rule, questions will be elevated for review on a national level.

Enhanced State and Tribal Coordination

Reinforcing cooperative federalism, the Compliance Memorandum emphasizes deference to authorized state programs and mandates open communication to avoid duplicative or conflicting enforcement actions.

Compliance Assistance and Voluntary Programs

EPA will expand the use of compliance assistance tools, including proactive outreach, technical training, and voluntary self-audit programs. This reflects a shift toward collaborative problem-solving rather than adversarial enforcement.

Reasoned Decision-Making Using LEAPS Factors

Enforcement decisions must now apply the “LEAPS” framework—Law, Evidence, Analysis, Programmatic impact, and Stakeholder impact—supporting transparency and rationality in case development. Notably, the Compliance Memorandum explains that this framework should be used to act swiftly to limit citizen suit actions that EPA believes “unfairly impact policy through abusive litigation tactics.”

Implications for Enforcement Going Forward

If EPA regional offices follow the directives, we expect more expedient and narrower enforcement actions, driving quick corrective actions. Regulated entities can expect:

Faster Case Resolution: Reducing protracted investigations and negotiations, EPA aims to shorten negotiation timelines and avoid unnecessary complexity by focusing on timely compliance rather than punitive measures.

Reduced Use of Expansive Remedies: Constraining expansive and expensive injunctive relief, EPA aims to limit obligations to the identified violations and a narrower reading of compliance obligations under the regulations.

National Consistency: Preventing EPA regions from enforcing the same regulations differently, the Compliance Memorandum anticipates development of consolidated criteria for violation categories resulting in national consistency and transparency.

More Collaborative Engagement: Enhancing cooperative federalism, the roles of agencies with delegated authorities, and voluntary compliance programs, the Compliance Memorandum directs EPA staff to engage in more communication with both state and tribal partners, and to use voluntary compliance programs to achieve quicker compliance.

What Should Companies Do Now?

Although the Compliance Memorandum portends a new EPA enforcement approach, EPA does not diminish the obligations and importance of investment in robust compliance programs. Maintaining a culture of compliance is strongly recommended:

Review and Strengthen Compliance Programs

Ensure internal environmental compliance systems are robust, documented, and capable of quickly addressing potential violations. Maintain or implement regular environmental compliance audits to identify and address potential non-compliance expeditiously.

Voluntary Audit and Self-Reporting Opportunities

The memorandum encourages voluntary “find and fix” programs. Participating in self-audit initiatives can reduce enforcement risk and demonstrate good faith to regulators. Companies should fully understand self-disclosure programs and their pitfalls before disclosing potential violations.

Enhance Communication with Regulators

Have a plan in place for regulatory inspections, with clear roles and responsibilities defined. Communicate with EPA staff during inspections and enforcement discussions to understand the agency’s expectations, deliverables, and milestones.

Stay Within Clear Legal Boundaries

EPA aims to apply the “best reading” of statutes and regulations. Companies should do the same when interpreting compliance obligations to avoid compliance risks. If there is ambiguity, work with counsel to develop a defensible interpretation and consider seeking clarification from EPA. If companies have preferable examples, communicate those examples in alignment with EPA’s goal of national consistency and uniform enforcement.

Monitor State Coordination

Relationships with state regulators remain important. EPA will give greater deference to authorized state programs, which means state regulators may play an even more active role in enforcement. Companies should maintain strong relationships with state regulators and understand state-specific enforcement priorities.

Environmental Laws

The Compliance Memorandum is a new chapter in EPA’s enforcement approach, but the underlying environmental laws remain in place. Citizen plaintiffs can initiate actions. And states may act more aggressively in the absence of EPA enforcement.

Published Jan 14, 2026 · Updated Jan 13, 2026

By bringing together industry leaders, governments and communities, the World Economic Forum’s Transitioning Industrial Clusters (TIC) initiative is driving shared economic growth, protecting jobs and reducing emissions worldwide.

The World Economic Forum’s Transitioning Industrial Clusters (TIC) initiative has partnered with multiple organizations across 20 countries to advance frameworks that reduce millions of tons of emissions, protect millions of jobs and contribute billions to global gross domestic product.

Industrial clusters often lack governance structures and development strategies that could enable collaboration; the TIC initiative was launched to align organizations across sectors and help them secure support and resources to make gains.

The TIC initiative delivers tangible outcomes across three levels – policy, cluster and project – showing how collaboration can turn strategic dialogue into real-world change.

Strengthening collaboration, delivering low-carbon growth.

Industrial clusters are the cornerstone of economies, generating millions of jobs. At the same time, they account for some of the world’s toughest emissions.

The good news is that they are also where the greatest opportunities for rapid, shared decarbonization lie. With the right framework, these regions can unlock hundreds of millions of tonnes of emissions reductions, protect industrial competitiveness and accelerate national green growth agendas.

Now, from France to South Africa and India to the United States, such industrial regions are adopting comprehensive frameworks that are delivering a successful transition to low-carbon growth through the World Economic Forum’s Transitioning Industrial Clusters (TIC) initiative.

TIC is engaging more than 70 global corporations and public institutions, creating unprecedented collaboration in zones such as ports, energy hubs, industrial complexes, special economic zones and eco-industrial parks.

Launched at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) by the Forum, in collaboration with Accenture and EPRI, the initiative began with four clusters: Humber Cluster and HyNet North West – both in the United Kingdom – Kwinana Industries Council in Australia and the Net Zero Basque Industrial Super Cluster in Spain.

It has since expanded to 40 industrial clusters across 20 countries, becoming the world’s largest community of its kind. Approximate data shows that the 40 signatory clusters collectively represent:

877 million tonnes of potential reduction in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) emissions.

$508 billion contribution to global gross domestic product.

4.6 million jobs protected or created.

What are industrial clusters trying to solve?

Despite their potential, many industrial clusters face shared headwinds. These challenges often include fragmented or absent governance structures and divergent development strategies, resulting in limited collaboration on shared business opportunities.

The TIC initiative was created to help overcome these barriers by bringing together industries, governments and investors around a common plan, through a holistic and technology-neutral approach.

By focusing on the key elements needed to secure funding, regulation and project delivery, it helps clusters move from ideas to action and build a shared vision for transformation.

The Framework: How the Transitioning Industrial Clusters initiative delivers results.

The initiative is built on the belief that four foundational components are essential for sustainable, cross-sector transformation anywhere in the world:

Balanced impact: Advancing economic, social, and environmental value together.

Inclusive innovation: Considering all technologies and processes that can reduce CO₂e emissions.

Collaborative action: Bringing together industry, government, financiers, labour, and community stakeholders.

Coordinated strategy: Aligning policy, financing, partnerships and technology deployment.

One of the challenges is that the maritime industry is largely a regional industry supported by hundreds or thousands of companies of relatively small- and medium-sized operators around the world, most of whom do not have the financial strength to make large upfront investments. It is vital that the maritime industry aligns and collaborates with larger-scale industries such as steel and power generation to work out such challenges.

The initiative delivers tangible outcomes across three levels – policy, cluster and project – showing how collaboration can turn strategic dialogue into real-world change. Each level reinforces the others, creating a scalable model that can be replicated across countries and industries.

1. Policy Impact

By engaging governments early, aligning evidence-based priorities and fostering cross-sector dialogue, the TIC initiative demonstrates how industrial collaboration can influence national policies and economic strategies.

For example, in June 2025, thanks to the collaboration of the Malaysia Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution with the initiative, Malaysia adopted the TIC framework as a national agenda.

Malaysia hosts key industrial hubs, including Sarawak, Johor, Selangor and Penang, which are active in the petrochemical, data centre, manufacturing, semiconductor and Electrical & Electronics sectors. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced the TIC framework as a key driver of green economic growth, skilled employment and carbon reduction.

“

“The government agreed to adopt TIC as a national agenda as it is a strategic move that unites companies and public institutions to drive green economic growth, open up highly skilled job opportunities and reduce carbon emissions.”

2. Cluster Impact

At the regional level, the TIC initiative helps public and private partners create a shared vision for transformation tailored to local economic priorities.

For example, established clusters in Malaysia, Colombia and Pakistan include a wide range of stakeholders, including companies, port authorities and government accelerators. TIC-facilitated workshops and partnerships have played a major role, helping leaders co-design industrial ecosystems around energy-intensive sectors.

In Colombia, this work has been instrumental in unifying stakeholders around a vision centred on energy security and decarbonization.

In the country’s largest port-based industrial area, the Cartagena Industrial Cluster, partners – including Ecopetrol, Frontera Energy and Promigas – worked together through the TIC framework to endorse a governance model which merged two existing clusters into a joint cluster, with the Cartagena Chamber of Commerce.

Within this structure, senior executives have collaborated to identify potential joint decarbonization projects.

3. Project Impact

Through ongoing facilitation and collaboration, TIC supports industrial projects to reach bankable, implementation-ready status. This approach can be replicated elsewhere to unlock financing and accelerate the deployment of low-carbon infrastructure worldwide.

One of the first TIC signatory clusters, the UK’s HyNet North West, has reached final investment decision in April 2025 for its CO2 transport and storage system – a milestone that provides a reference point for financing shared energy infrastructure.

Similar momentum is evident in port-anchored clusters such as Antwerp-Bruges and Rotterdam, as well as in emerging low-carbon industrial hubs around the world.

That’s the finding of a new report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the International Labour Organization.

The study finds that despite renewable energy installations hitting new highs, jobs in the sector have only increased by 2.3% from 2023, reaching 16.6 million in 2024.

“Renewable energy deployment is booming, but the human side of the story is as important as the technological side,” said IRENA Director-General Francesco La Camera.

“Governments must put people at the centre of their energy and climate objectives through trade and industrial policies that drive investments, build domestic capacity, and develop a skilled workforce along the supply chain.”

China dominant

The report found there is uneven development in jobs across the world – a trend seen for the past few years.

China remains the dominant force in both deployment of generating capacities and equipment manufacturing, mainly due to its integrated, large-scale supply chains that deliver equipment at unmatched prices.

The research found that in 2024, China created an estimated 7.3 million renewable energy jobs, accounting for 44% of the global total.

What's the biggest workforce challenge facing the energy transition?

The EU followed suit with the same total as in 2023 at 1.8 million jobs. Brazil’s renewables employment runs to 1.4 million, while that of India and the US barely grew from around one million to 1.3 million and 1.1 million respectively.

La Camera added that the geographical imbalance of job growth “reminds us to get international collaboration back on track”.

“Countries that are lagging behind in the energy transition must be supported by the international community. This is essential not only to meet the goal of tripling renewable power capacity by 2030, but also to ensure that socio-economic benefits become lived realities for all, helping to shore up popular support for the transition.”

Solar jobs stay top

In terms of employment by technology, solar PV is in the lead, owing to the continued rapid expansion of installations and panel manufacturing plants. The industry employed 7.3 million people in 2024. Asian countries hosted 75% of the world’s PV jobs with China garnering the bulk of the employment at 4.2 million.

Liquid biofuels follow solar PV, creating 2.6 million jobs in 2024 with 46.5% of the total jobs generated in Asia. Hydropower was third with 2.3 million jobs, and wind next with 1.9 million jobs.

Beyond the numbers, the report also stresses the need for more inclusion and equity in the renewable energy workforce. It states that “a just transition demands that no population groups are left at the margins. The renewables-based energy future must be shaped by diverse talents and perspectives.”

Growing skills gap is putting energy transition at risk

The International Labour Organization’s Gilbert F. Houngbo said: “A just transition to a renewables-based future must be grounded in inclusion, dignity, and equal opportunity.

“As countries scale up renewable energy investments and job creation, we have a particular responsibility to ensure that accessibility for persons with disabilities – who too often face barriers to inclusion in labour markets despite their skills, experience and talent - is built into every stage of policy design and implementation.

He added that this “requires accessible training systems, inclusive hiring practices and workplaces that accommodate, welcome and respond to diverse needs and respect every worker’s rights”.

“Disability inclusion is not only a matter of justice: it is essential for resilient labour markets and sustainable development. By removing barriers to equality and promoting decent work, we strengthen economies and ensure that the energy transition truly works for all.”

India’s electric vehicle (EV) revolution is gathering pace nationwide. In early 2025 the country surpassed 5.5 million EVs on its roads and sales are soaring. This growth is not limited to big metropolises such as Delhi or Bengaluru. In fact, the fastest gains are coming from Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. The Union government and state governments are rolling out ambitious policies and subsidies to support this trend. Public and private fleets of electric two-wheelers (e-2Ws), three-wheelers (e-3Ws), cars, buses, and light commercial vehicles (e-LCVs) are expanding rapidly outside the major cities. Initiatives such as Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME-II), PM eBus Sewa, PM e-DRIVE and the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for EV batteries are key drivers, helping improve air quality and boost India’s energy security as the country moves towards its 2047 goal of energy independence.

Booming e-2W and e-3Ws in smaller cities

The India Electric Mobility Index (IEMI) score assesses how the states and union territories are performing in developing the electric mobility ecosystem, including EV adoption, charging infrastructure and electric mobility technology. The states are categorised into frontrunners, performers and aspirants, based on their scores.

Frontrunners: Delhi, Maharashtra, Chandigarh

Performers: Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Haryana

Aspirants: All others

e-2Ws and e-3Ws are leading the charge on city streets across India. These vehicles are ideal for urban and peri-urban travel in Tier-2 cities, offering low operating costs and zero emissions. For example, e-scooters and moped bikes have seen record demand in recent years. In fact, all-India e-2W sales have jumped so sharply that companies are forecasting growth to seven million units annually for the first time. Local markets are responding quickly.

The case of Assam and Bihar

Assam is a striking example: here over 85% of newly registered three-wheelers were electric in 2024. This was driven by state incentives such as waiving road tax and registration fees on e-rickshaws. Assam even launched ‘Baayu,’ one of India’s first app-based electric bike-taxi networks, to show how e-bikes can serve as affordable urban cabs. In Bihar, the state has also seen rapid uptake. Local registrations rose from ~10,000 vehicles in FY24 to ~23,000 by FY25. These numbers show a quick transition to e-scooters and e-rickshaws on Bihar’s roads as they offer low running and high state incentives.

Chandigarh and Punjab

Chandigarh and Punjab in the North have enabled strong actions for 2Ws and 3Ws. Chandigarh, for one, offers incentives for e-bicycles in addition to mass advertising of e-rickshaws. This has led to significant results as nearly 92% of the new 3Ws in Chandigarh were electric by 2024. The city also achieved a 65% electrification rate of its commercial EV fleet. Punjab, in turn, has planned Rs. 300 crore (US$ 32 million) over three years to boost e-2Ws, e-cycles, e-autorickshaws and e-LCVs. It is also installing public charging infrastructure on streets in major cities such as Ludhiana, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Patiala, and Bathinda. These measures are making EVs more affordable and convenient, prompting more drivers in smaller towns in Punjab to switch to e-scooters and tuk-tuks.

Across India

Similar momentum is visible across the country. In Odisha, the state government approved a large EV manufacturing complex, specifically a JSW Group investment of Rs. 4,000 crore (US$ 453 million) for EVs and components. Moreover, the schemes, e.g. interest-free advances for government employees for buying EVs, encourage the state. The far north-east, Arunachal Pradesh, for its part, has already been deploying e-buses in several cities, such as intra-city routes in Itanagar, Namsai and Pasighat. The above examples from Assam, Bihar, Chandigarh, Punjab, Odisha and Arunachal, proves that state and local measures allow spreading the benefits of electric mobility to every city and corner in India.

E-buses transforming regional transit

It’s not just personal vehicles that are going electric. Public buses, for long the backbone of city transit, are undergoing an overhaul in smaller cities. Historically, India’s nine largest metros (including Delhi and Mumbai) had over 61% of the nation’s public buses, while many Tier-2 cities had very few or no bus networks at all. To address this gap, the government’s PM eBus Sewa scheme is deploying e-buses widely outside the big cities.

The scale of this effort is unparalleled: over 50 cities are currently deploying 10,000 e-buses, with another 20,000 on the horizon. As an example, according to World Resources Institute (WRI) - India, the growth of e-buses in smaller urban centers can be massive and low cost, allowing India to achieve its goals of long-term energy independence. As a result, in the near future, Tier-2 cities will have e-buses that are cleaner and quieter than heavily polluting diesel fleets. This is critical not just for reducing urban pollution but also for curbing expensive fuel imports. By 2047 the aim is to have a predominantly electric public transport system and rolling out e-buses beyond Delhi and Bengaluru is a key step in that direction.

National schemes fuel electric mobility

In order to fast-track EV uptake, the central government introduced numerous schemes. The majority of the funds were set for the purchase of subsidies, charging infrastructure and research and development (R&D) under the FAME II policy (2019-24). FAME-II was allocated approximately Rs. 11,500 crore (US$ 1.30 billion). In 2024, the government announced a new e-DRIVE scheme to provide ~Rs. 10,900 crore (US$ 1.24 billion) to advanced EVs. Meanwhile, the PM eBus Sewa scheme earmarks roughly Rs. 20,000 crore (US$ 2.27 billion) to finance 10,000 e-city buses in 169 cities. It covers not only vehicle purchase but also up to 10 years of operating support via public-private partnerships.

Another cornerstone is the PLI scheme for advanced battery cells. This Rs. 18,100 crore (US$ 2.05 billion) programme aims to build domestic battery manufacturing capacity. Together with policy push for charging infrastructure, these measures are turning India into a global EV hub. As NITI Aayog notes, schemes such as FAME and the PLI for battery cells underscore our resolve to localise electric mobility. In summary, the government’s concerted push through generous subsidies, targets and industry incentives is creating a favourable climate for EVs to thrive beyond the big cities.

The impact

The transition to electric mobility in India has clear benefits. EVs produce no tailpipe emissions, cutting harmful pollutants in crowded towns. This improves air quality and public health in smaller cities as much as in big ones. Beyond local clean air, EVs help India’s energy strategy. Road transport accounts for ~13.5% of India’s energy-related emissions. Electrifying vehicles can significantly reduce carbon emissions over time and allows India to shift away from imported oil to domestic clean power. As analysts note, EVs are a “critical pathway” for decarbonising transport and enhancing energy security.

Government data and expert projections suggest these positive impacts are accelerating. For example, electric mobility is already helping India edge closer to its target of 30% EV share by 2030. Industry projections estimate India’s EV stock could exceed 17 million vehicles by 2030 under current policies. The rapid growth in Tier-2 cities is vital to meeting these national goals. Every e-auto and e-bus in a small city adds to the big picture of sustainability. With continued expansion of central programmes and state incentives, India’s secondary cities are poised to mirror or even surpass the EV success seen in its big metros. The country is moving steadily toward a future where clean, affordable EVs connect not just New Delhi and Bengaluru, but every town and city across India.

FAQs

What is the FAME-II scheme?

FAME-II is a national subsidy programme (2019-24) designed to boost EV uptake. It provided financial incentives for purchasing EVs and building charging infrastructure, with an outlay of about Rs. 11,500 crore (US$ 1.30 billion).

What does the PM eBus Sewa scheme do?

PM eBus Sewa is a government initiative launched in 2023–24 to put 10,000 e-buses into service in cities across India. It allocates ~Rs. 20,000 crore (US$ 2.27 billion) for buying and operating e-buses in 169 cities.

Which cities and states are leading in EV adoption?

While major metros are well known, many smaller cities and states have become EV leaders. For instance, Chandigarh achieved a 91.8% electrification rate for new 3Ws in 2024. Assam recorded over 85% of new autorickshaws as electric. Punjab, Odisha, Bihar, Jammu & Kashmir, and Arunachal Pradesh have all launched special EV policies or incentives.

Why are e-2Ws and e-3Ws popular in smaller cities?

E-2Ws and e-3Ws are well-suited to India’s smaller urban centres. They cost less to run per kilometre than petrol vehicles, often have lower service needs and benefit from state incentives. In many Tier-2 towns, riders of e-scooters save substantially on fuel and maintenance. This practical benefit, plus government support.

What benefits do EVs bring to secondary cities?

EVs offer cleaner air and quieter streets, directly improving urban living standards. Fewer tailpipe emissions mean lower levels of smog and pollution. Over time, widespread EV adoption in smaller cities can shrink carbon footprints and contribute to India’s climate goals.",,N,,2026-01-14 19:00:10.712946

Once a global leader in producing solar panels and semiconductors, the United States saw that capacity erode due to domestic policy choices and international developments.","The clean economy stands at a critical turning point. Global investments in next-generation technologies are surging, and the Biden administration put the United States in a position to lead. Since 2021, Congress has enacted three landmark laws—the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), the CHIPS and Science Act (CHIPS), and the Inflation Reduction Act—to strengthen U.S. manufacturing and invest in emerging sectors that create good-paying jobs. These measures contained flaws, including slow implementation and insufficient checks on anti-union activity by companies benefiting from public funds, but they were delivering results. Billions in federal funding sparked over a trillion dollars in private investment and generated hundreds of thousands of manufacturing and construction jobs. But unfortunately, the Trump administration is now working aggressively to reverse this progress, threatening the United States’ ability to compete in the global market.

In July, President Donald Trump signed the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” repealing nearly $550 billion in funding that would have supported clean energy investments. In addition to that repealed funding, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) also canceled hundreds of contracted awards worth $11 billion for domestic manufacturing, innovation, and decarbonization projects. DOE Secretary Chris Wright led the efforts to halt these clean energy and manufacturing projects. The problem isn’t just the sheer amount of canceled federal funding—it’s that these dollars were driving private investment into critical sectors and delivering benefits to communities nationwide.

Canceling projects will eliminate jobs in emerging sectors; prevent existing industries from adopting advanced technologies and preserving jobs; and squander the opportunity to build a next generation industrial ecosystem in the United States. This story has played out before. Once a global leader in producing solar panels and semiconductors, the United States saw that capacity erode due to domestic policy choices and international developments. Recent efforts to reshore these sectors underscore how challenging it is to rebuild industries once they’ve been lost. Even more troubling, these actions follow a clear pattern: the Trump administration repeatedly canceled legally obligated funding for projects finalized under the Biden administration, relying on flimsy or outright illegal rationales. Moreover, the administration has not disclosed the criteria it uses to review projects. Members of Congress have raised concerns that decisions to cancel projects were made entirely by a small group of political appointees, “based on nothing more than a one-page summary memo for each project, drafted by yet another political appointee.” These actions undermine faith in the public sector, inflict material harm on companies that held signed agreements, and diminish the public sector’s ability to partner with strategic industries in the future.

But the legislation also reveals how far Washington remains from treating development finance as a fully realized instrument of American power.","Tucked into the National Defense Authorization Act is the reauthorization of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), an agency that sits at the intersection of development, foreign policy, and industrial competition. On paper, the reauthorization signals ambition. It expands the DFC’s balance sheet and broadens where it can operate, reflecting rare bipartisan agreement that development finance is a core instrument of American power.

What the statute does not resolve is whether the United States is prepared to use that instrument effectively.

Strategic competition today is increasingly waged through finance—decisions about which infrastructure gets built, which technologies scale, and which firms and standards shape global markets. In that contest, speed, scale, and institutional confidence matter as much as formal authority. The DFC was created to compete in precisely this space. Whether its reauthorization equips it to do this—or entrenches a model that favors caution over action—is less clear.

The China Challenge

Development finance is neither traditional foreign aid nor purely commercial investment. It uses public financial tools—loans, guarantees, equity, and insurance—to mobilize private capital in markets where political risk, weak institutions, or long time horizons deter investment. Development finance aims to help countries build infrastructure, expand productive capacity, and integrate into global supply chains—while simultaneously advancing the strategic interests of the sponsoring state.

Congress created the DFC in 2018 in response to China’s growing use of state-backed finance as a geopolitical and industrial tool. By that point, Beijing was financing ports, power plants, rail lines, data networks, and mines across much of the world—often faster and on terms Western institutions were unwilling or unable to match. For many governments, China’s model proved attractive precisely because it moved quickly, with few due diligence requirements, and often bundled capital with construction. These investments also tied countries into Chinese technology, entrenched Chinese firms, and embedded long-term dependencies into the physical and digital infrastructure of a country’s growth.

China’s model carries well-documented risks. Research has linked a substantial share of Beijing-financed projects to corruption, labor abuses, environmental damage, and debt distress. Yet these liabilities coexist with an uncomfortable reality for Washington: In many contexts, Chinese finance is the only option able to move at the speed and scale required to meet infrastructure needs.

Through the DFC, Congress sought to offer countries a credible alternative—one that was principled but also competitive.

The DFC’s Early Record and Enduring Challenges

Since becoming operational in 2019, the DFC has established itself as a consequential tool of American power. Its portfolio has grown rapidly, reaching nearly $49 billion. The agency now operates in over 100 countries and has established a modest overseas footprint across Africa, the Indo-Pacific, and Latin America. It has supported critical minerals projects, solar manufacturing using U.S. technologies, and vaccine production abroad. For a relatively young institution with just over 500 staff, these gains are impressive.

Yet since its inception, the DFC has struggled to resolve a more fundamental question: What, precisely, is its core identity and purpose? The agency has a dual mandate—to advance both development and foreign policy—but the balance of those two goals is contested in execution. Development advocates have emphasized poverty reduction and development impact. China hawks have pressed for investments that prioritize geopolitical objectives. Subsequently, each administration has reinterpreted the agency’s purpose, producing strategic drift rather than cumulative direction.

That ambiguity is reinforced by an operating model designed to minimize error rather than to compete effectively. The DFC is subject to multiple, and oftentimes redundant, layers of internal review, interagency consultation, and congressional reporting. These safeguards help ensure accountability, high standards, and the responsible oversight of taxpayer dollars. But in practice, they bias the institution toward minimizing failure rather than maximizing impact. The result is an agency unable to move quickly or absorb calculated risk, even in sectors where timing determines long-term outcomes.

The reauthorization attempts to address some of these challenges, particularly around scale and strategic focus. Yet by adding new procedural handcuffs, the legislation also reflects congressional anxiety about executive discretion—unease that reinforces the very patterns of risk avoidance and slow decision-making that have limited the DFC’s effectiveness.

The Reauthorization’s Advances

The reauthorization’s most consequential change to the DFC is to the agency’s scale. Congress raised the DFC’s maximum contingent liability, or portfolio investment cap, from $60 billion to $205 billion, bringing the agency’s balance sheet closer to its strategic ambitions. This expansion recognizes that competition with China depends on scale: The DFC must be able to shape markets and support sustained private investment over time.

The legislation also broadens the DFC’s geographic scope by authorizing investment in high-income countries. This change reflects a bipartisan recognition that the World Bank’s income classifications, based on per-capita gross national income, are poorly suited to contemporary realities. Some projects critical to supply chains, energy transition, and digital and transportation infrastructure may be located in countries deemed “high income” but that nonetheless fail to attract private capital on purely commercial terms. Allowing the DFC to operate in these contexts brings its authority closer to strategic needs.

In addition, the legislation elevates the agency’s strategic focus. It establishes a chief strategic officer, who will sit alongside the existing chief development officer, to advise on national security and foreign policy matters. It includes a “Sense of Congress” encouraging the agency to prioritize critical minerals and telecommunications infrastructure. It authorizes additional positions for specialized expertise and requires a five-year strategic priorities plan.

These changes demonstrate real congressional interest in making the DFC a more ambitious and impactful player, particularly in strategic sectors. However, other changes underscore a persistent reluctance to trust the institution to exercise that ambition with flexibility and speed.

What the Reauthorization Leaves Unresolved

This reluctance is most evident in the legislation’s treatment of high-income country investments. Congress authorizes the DFC to operate in high-income countries, but only following a dense thicket of advanced reporting, certifications, and notifications. Each year, the agency must submit a report identifying the high-income countries it anticipates supporting and the types of projects it expects to finance. If a project falls outside of that report, the DFC must submit an additional notification explaining how it advances U.S. foreign policy. The DFC must further certify that each project in a high-income country is the preferred alternative to foreign adversaries or furthers U.S. strategic interests, among other requirements. Transactions exceeding $20 million trigger yet another congressional notification. None of these requirements operate in isolation. Each entails weeks, often months, of internal coordination and clearance before a notification, certification, or report can proceed to Congress for review.

In theory, this sequencing preserves congressional oversight while enabling investments in more of the world. In practice, it risks rendering the new authority marginally useful. Companies seeking DFC support already face uncertainty associated with prolonged reviews and open-ended congressional scrutiny, even for modest projects. The manifold procedural layers introduced by the reauthorization will likely deepen that hesitation. As one senior congressional staffer told Devex, “[W]e will need to scrutinize every single investment the DFC makes under this administration, especially in high-income countries.” That impulse for control is politically satisfying in the short term. Over the DFC’s seven-year reauthorization period, however, it may erode the agency’s strategic ambition and undercut the rationale for extending the authority in the first place.

The creation of new advisory councils reinforces this pattern. The legislation establishes both a development finance advisory council and a congressional strategic advisory group, each requiring periodic consultation. The latter—composed of a subset of members of the House and Senate foreign affairs committees—functionally duplicates Congress’s existing powers to request briefings, convene hearings, and legislate. What it adds instead is time and process. Its creation reflects institutional mistrust—an effort to legislate consultation following the marked decline in the Trump administration’s engagement with Congress. But legislating new advisory processes does not repair the damaged norms around the separation of powers. In some sense, it codifies that dysfunction.

The modest changes to congressional notification thresholds illustrate the same mismatch between ambition and execution. Congress raised the dollar amount that triggers congressional notification from $10 million to $20 million—a meaningful but limited adjustment that still captures a substantial share of the DFC’s portfolio. Meanwhile, speed remains China’s enduring advantage. Research shows that Chinese government-financed infrastructure projects on average reach completion in less than three years, compared to five to 10 years for similar projects financed by the World Bank and regional development banks. That differential creates powerful first-mover advantages and aligns with the political incentives of governing elites facing short electoral cycles. Officials across the developing world have repeatedly cited speed and certainty as central reasons for choosing Beijing over slower-moving alternatives. The reauthorization does not address this fundamental challenge. It may, in fact, make the problem worse.

The treatment of equity illustrates similar tensions. The law creates a $5 billion revolving equity fund, which appropriators would need to capitalize over several years, allowing the DFC to recycle returns on successful investments over time rather than returning them to the Treasury. Equity authority matters because it allows the agency to take ownership stakes in companies or projects, shaping early-stage markets, supporting technology deployment, and participating in growth when projects succeed. Yet budget scoring rules treat equity investments as total losses, rather than their expected cost to the government over the life of the investment. For instance, a $10 million equity investment that yields $20 million five years later must still be recorded as a $10 million loss. The revolving fund may expand the pool of capital available for equity investments over the long term, but it does not correct this underlying distortion. As a result, one of the DFC’s most valuable tools remains artificially constrained.

Political risk insurance presents a parallel case. One of the DFC’s most effective instruments for mobilizing private capital in difficult environments, political risk insurance continues to be hampered by budgetary interpretations that inflate its apparent cost to taxpayers. Congress chose not to address this issue, despite substantial historical evidence that political risk insurance has generated net returns rather than losses. Ultimately, this leaves one of the DFC’s most important tools far short of its potential.

The reauthorization also avoids the question of government-to-government, or sovereign, lending. The reauthorization requires the DFC to establish a clear policy governing investments involving state-owned enterprises, sovereign wealth funds, and other parastatal entities—an important measure given the authority’s limited use and confusion within the U.S. government. But Congress stopped short of authorizing direct sovereign lending. In many parts of the world, the state remains the principal economic actor, with public financing driving 80 percent of infrastructure investments. The limitation on sovereign lending creates a self-imposed strategic vulnerability, preventing the United States from matching the flexibility of partners like Japan and Australia, which routinely finance governments to secure their interests.

Finally, Congress declined to make the DFC permanent. Congress allowed the DFC’s authorization to lapse in October, failing to meet its own statutory deadline, and signaling the fragility of an institution meant to finance long-term projects. China’s policy banks are permanent. So are peer institutions in Japan, Korea, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Their permanence strengthens their credibility with both partner governments and the private sector. The DFC’s impermanence creates uncertainty about whether the institution will exist over the long term or whether political winds might eliminate it entirely. That uncertainty undermines the agency’s competitive position.

* * *

The DFC’s early years have demonstrated real promise, and its reauthorization reflects bipartisan enthusiasm for expanding its role. But the legislation also reveals how far Washington remains from treating development finance as a fully realized instrument of American power.

The gap between aspiration and execution runs throughout the statute. Guardrails driven by short-term political concerns have narrowed the utility of new authorities. Two of the agency’s most catalytic tools—equity and political risk insurance—remain handicapped by faulty budget rules. The prohibition on sovereign lending leaves the DFC limited in strategic sectors where public borrowing is standard. And the DFC’s temporary status continues to undermine confidence in investors and partners.

The reauthorization is a step forward, but it falls short of the destination. America’s success in shaping critical infrastructure, technologies, and supply chains hinges on whether our public institutions are built for competition rather than caution. Achieving this will require removing redundant controls, tolerating calculated risk, and adopting a longer view of American power—one that extends beyond the cycles of short-term politics.",https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/u-s-flag-finance.jpg?sfvrsn=52274c25_5,N,,2026-01-14 12:00:44.375811

New energy infrastructure will reduce fuel costs, maximize 40% federal tax credits to save customers money

CHARLOTTE, N.C. – Duke Energy has brought on line a 50-megawatt, four-hour battery energy storage system (BESS) at its former Allen coal plant on Lake Wylie, serving customers in North Carolina and South Carolina, and has unveiled plans for additional battery storage and new jobs at the Gaston County site.

What’s happening: The first BESS, at a cost of approximately $100 million, was completed under budget and ahead of schedule, serving customers beginning in November. Final testing is being completed this month. Construction of a second BESS – Duke Energy’s largest, a 167‑MW, four-hour system – will begin in May on 10 acres where the coal plant’s now-demolished emissions control system once stood.

Both lithium-ion battery systems qualify for federal investment tax credits, which will offset 40% of the cost for Duke Energy customers. That figure includes an extra 10% for reinvesting into an energy community; the coal plant retired in December 2024.

Our view: “We’re building new resources to keep the Carolinas’ economy thriving, while reinvesting in a former coal plant community that helped power this region for decades,” said Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy’s North Carolina president. “Repurposing existing energy infrastructure and taking advantage of federal funding significantly offset costs for our customers while continuing to support rapid growth across the region.”

Why it matters: Utility-scale battery systems are particularly useful for cold winter mornings before the sun comes up, filling the gap before solar generation is available. During low-demand periods, they can also store excess energy – such as the clean power generated by Catawba Nuclear Station just across Lake Wylie – for use during high-demand periods.

Duke Energy plans to make similar battery storage investments in multiple counties across the Carolinas. The company’s 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan, now under review by state regulators, projects the addition of 6,550 MW of batteries by 2035 to protect reliability and meet growth needs in North Carolina and South Carolina. That’s enough storage to power more than 5 million homes during times of peak energy use.

The big picture: Duke Energy’s long-term plan maintains a diverse energy mix, adding solar, storage, nuclear and natural gas generation to meet electricity demand that’s rising at an unprecedented pace. Across the Carolinas, customer energy needs over the next 15 years are expected to grow at eight times the growth rate of the prior 15 years.

Coming full circle: The plan also maintains Gaston County’s legacy of supporting the company’s customers across both states. Duke Energy’s plans call for battery storage at both of the county’s retired coal plant sites along the Catawba River, Allen (1957-2024 in Belmont) and Riverbend (1929-2013 in Mount Holly). Construction of the latter, a 115-MW, four-hour BESS, is expected to begin in late 2026, coming on line in late 2027.

“We are proud of how this site and its people continue to support our customers,” said Bryan Walsh, Duke Energy’s vice president of Regulated Renewables and Lake Services. “Multiple former Allen plant employees now work on our Regulated Renewables team, which maintains and operates the new batteries at Allen and elsewhere in the Carolinas. Duke Energy’s test site for new battery technologies, its Emerging Technology and Innovation Center, is also in Mount Holly.”

What’s next: As part of the company’s rate review now before the North Carolina Utilities Commission, Duke Energy has proposed a third BESS at Allen to come on line by the end of 2028, as well as a regional operations, training and warehouse facility for batteries and renewables that could house 20-50 employees. Plans for both are still evolving and subject to regulator approval.

The Detroit Auto Show is underway again this January, bringing with it a mix of modern vehicles, interactive exhibits and test-track experiences for the public. The show, held at Huntington Place in downtown Detroit, runs from Jan. 14 through Jan. 25.

Once famous for major global debuts, the event has shifted focus as automakers increasingly choose to unveil vehicles digitally. These private launches allow brands to avoid sharing the spotlight with competitors and control their messaging to wider online audiences.

Despite fewer reveals, organizers say the event still holds value. More than 40 brands are participating this year. Last year’s show drew 275,000 visitors, many of whom came for a chance to test new cars in person.

“That’s what makes the Detroit Auto Show different,” said show chairman Todd Szott. “You can get up close, talk to the people behind the brands and actually experience the vehicles.”

Ride experiences take the wheel

Interactivity is at the center of the 2026 event. Two indoor test tracks allow attendees to take ride-along trips in vehicles powered by gasoline, hybrid systems or electric batteries. These curated rides offer insight into acceleration, braking and vehicle comfort.

Ford and Jeep are also offering dedicated adventure zones. Camp Jeep allows riders to experience off-road features on simulated hills and trails. Ford’s Bronco Built Wild Experience offers similar rugged terrain in one of the automaker’s signature SUVs.

These hands-on displays are designed to go beyond static exhibits and give attendees a better feel for the cars. Organizers said the interactive features are now a core attraction, especially for families and car shoppers curious about electric vehicles.

A different kind of launch

While the number of splashy new vehicle debuts has fallen, the show’s media and industry preview days still carry some significance. Ford Motor Co. was expected to make announcements on Jan. 14, while the winners of the North American Car, Truck and Utility Vehicle of the Year awards were set to be revealed at the same time.

Brands with displays this year include Alfa Romeo, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Ford, GMC, Jeep, Kia, Lincoln, Ram, Subaru and Toyota. Visitors will find a wide range of vehicles from concept cars to current showroom models.

Public days begin Jan. 17 and run through Jan. 25. Organizers are also hosting panel discussions, tech spotlights and mobility forums to explore broader issues in transportation and electrification.

A show in transition

The Detroit Auto Show was once the must-see event for vehicle premieres. Over time, that spotlight has dimmed as manufacturers choose standalone global launches or digital events to create more controlled hype.

Still, the show remains a significant platform for connecting consumers with brands. Attendees can compare vehicles side by side and speak with company reps or engineers who are present at the displays.

Automakers are using the event to promote their latest electric and hybrid models, supported by indoor EV test tracks. These tracks provide a chance to feel how EVs perform in acceleration and handling, something not possible from spec sheets alone.

A cultural and community hub

Beyond the cars, the show plays an important role in Detroit’s civic and cultural life. It brings economic activity to the region, supports charities through preview galas, and creates a gathering place for automotive professionals and enthusiasts.

Speakers this year include Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno. Their appearances highlight how the auto industry continues to intersect with politics, infrastructure and economic development.

For Detroit, the auto show remains a symbol of the city’s industrial heritage and ongoing transformation. The 2026 edition may not be filled with surprises, but it offers an increasingly personal and hands-on way for the public to connect with the cars of today and tomorrow.

“This project has always represented unprecedented risk to Louisianans, and from the start Meta has done everything it can to shield themselves from that risk.
""Louisiana ratepayers may have even less protections from the costs of this massive data center than they had just several months ago, which were already severely lacking.","NEW ORLEANS, La. (Jan 14, 2026)—Earthjustice filed a motion today on behalf of the Alliance for Affordable Energy (AAE) and the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) recommending the Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC) conduct an investigation into the effect of Meta’s new financial arrangement with Blue Owl Capital and its impact on ratepayer protections related to the Richland Parish data center project.

On the same day of the Commission’s approval of Entergy’s application to build 3 new billion-dollar gas plants and related transmission assets, Meta fundamentally changed the financial terms of the project by shifting 80% ownership of the data center complex to a new joint venture with Blue Owl Capital, Beignet, for roughly $3 billion. Beignet then borrowed $27 billion to fund the Richland Parish data center, creating a risky and complex financial scheme that allows Meta to walk away from the data center after just 4 years. The consequence for Louisianans is an increased risk of shouldering the costs of billions of dollars in stranded assets.

The motion seeks an investigation into whether the Commission was misled regarding the financial arrangements of the data center project and recommends the Commission conduct a prudence review to determine whether Entergy knew about the new financial arrangement and failed to inform the Commission before its vote on August 20, 2025. Even if Entergy did not know about the financial arrangement, the motion calls into question whether construction of the projects continues to be prudent.

In addition to the changes with the ownership structure, there have been significant changes to the proposed size of the data center. In July 2025, Mark Zuckerberg announced that the final size of the project will be 5 gigawatts, roughly double the size originally listed in planning documents.The LPSC has an obligation to know and understand the financial structure supporting the data center and its overall impact so it can protect existing customers and the assumptions the Commission made when it voted on this project have been significantly altered.

Below is a statement from Logan Burke, Executive Director of AAE.

“This project has always represented unprecedented risk to Louisianans, and from the start Meta has done everything it can to shield themselves from that risk. The additional distance created by this financial deal is a tacit acknowledgement of that risk, and shows that this venture is really a gamble using other people’s money.”

Below is a statement from Paul Arbaje, energy analyst at UCS.

""Louisiana ratepayers may have even less protections from the costs of this massive data center than they had just several months ago, which were already severely lacking. The Commission must look further into Meta's new financing structure to make sure that the bag Entergy's customers are already holding hasn't ballooned out of control.""",https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/media-release-image.png,N,,2026-01-14 12:00:36.479438

Entergy’s application under the state’s Industrial Tax Exemption Program would waive local property taxes on a new natural gas-fired power facility to serve Meta’s operations, according to records obtained by The Center Square. The Titanium Power Station is expected to include two combined-cycle combustion turbines capable of producing 1,500 megawatts of electricity for the massive data center.

Building this infrastructure, which the state has deemed an “investment,” will exceed $2.3 billion. Entergy has said Meta will pay to build the power station and the deal will save ratepayers $650 million over 15 years.

“The new generation resources being added to Entergy Louisiana’s system will be among the most efficient in the state, providing additional fuel savings and long-term reliability benefits for customers statewide,” Entergy said.

The filing comes as Louisiana’s largest utility races to meet the electricity needs of new industrial and tech investments, notably Meta’s data center in Richland Parish and Hyundai Steel’s $5.8 billion hydrogen-integrated mill in Ascension Parish. Both companies have applied for or received approval under the state’s Quality Jobs and Industrial Tax Exemption Programs to offset their capital costs.

Entergy has already proposed billions in transmission and generation upgrades statewide to support these developments. Company officials say the utility must expand generation capacity quickly to keep up with rising electricity demand, but also as a means of economic development.

Once operational, Meta’s contributions to costs that would otherwise paid by Entergy ratepayers are expected to reduce customer bills. In particular, Meta is expected to lower customer storm charges by an average of approximately 10% and lower the bill impacts of resilience upgrades for customers by a similar amount.

“The rates are not going to go up, and, in fact, may go down,” Entergy public affairs director Jody Montelaro told lawmakers in 2025, citing Meta’s agreement to shoulder much of its infrastructure costs.

Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration has pushed regulators to fast-track such projects under its “Lightning Speed” initiative, a directive that allows expedited approval for industrial-scale energy needs. Critics have warned the approach risks shifting billions in costs onto ratepayers if oversight lags.

All of them were either awardees or subawardees of environmental project grants from the US DOE.

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit were the City of St. Paul in Minnesota, Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC), Plug In America, Elevate Energy, the Southeast Community Organization and Environmental Defense Fund. All of them were either awardees or subawardees of environmental project grants from the US DOE.

In the ruling, which can be accessed here, the judge mentioned that the terminated grants had a common point, which was that all but one of the awardees were based in states that did not vote, in the majority, for US President Donald Trump in the last presidential election.

“Defendants admit that “[a] primary reason for the selection of which DOE grant termination decisions were included in the October 2025 notice tranche was whether the grantee was located in a ‘Blue State.’” Id. So, Defendants concede that the political identity of a terminated grantee’s state, including the fact that the state supported Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, played a preponderant role in the October 2025 grant termination decisions,” wrote the judge.

“The court recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.

“The administration’s damaging actions violated the U.S. Constitution, foundational American values, and basic decency, and it imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” said Vickie Patton, General Counsel at the Environmental Defense Fund.

In the ruling’s conclusion, the judge ordered that “parties shall file a Joint Status Report by January 16, 2026, which indicates whether Plaintiffs still seek permanent injunctive relief and whether Plaintiffs intend to move for attorney’s fees.”

Houchin emphasized that these investments reflect her commitment to delivering tangible results for Indiana’s Ninth District through responsible infrastructure improvements that protect communities and support long-term growth.","Last week, House Republicans passed H.R. 6938, the Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and Interior and Environment Appropriations Act 2026, which makes appropriations through Fiscal Year 2026 and supports efforts to strengthen America’s energy security, secure communities, reduce bureaucratic environmental red tape, advance critical programs and implement President Trump’s America-First agenda.

As part of this legislation, Congresswoman Erin Houchin, Ind. 09, secured nearly $8 million in Community Project Funding for critical infrastructure projects across Indiana’s Ninth District, including:

•$3,700,000 for upgrades to the Brown County Regional Sewer District;

•$2,000,000 for shoreline protection in Clark County;

•$1,250,000 for water treatment upgrades through City of Bloomington Utilities; and

•$1,000,000 for stormwater management improvements in the City of Madison.

“This funding is focused on taking care of real needs in our communities,"" Houchin said. ""From protecting our riverbank to upgrading sewer and water systems, these projects will make a tangible difference for families across Indiana’s Ninth District. We will continue to fight for these necessary resources to return to Indiana.”

“We truly appreciate Congresswoman Houchin’s continued support for infrastructure projects that protect environmental health and safety. The Lake Lemon and Bean Blossom Creek Watershed Project will replace failing septic systems that have contributed to excessive E. coli levels in local streams. This funding lays the groundwork for reliable, sustainable wastewater management that will improve water quality and public health,"" said Clint Studabaker, vice president of the Brown County Regional Sewer District.

Kevin Baity, from the Town of Clarksville, said, “For many years, the north shoreline of the Ohio River has continued to erode, destroying streets, recreational facilities and historical artifacts. We have lost direct access to rescue boats, impacting emergency services. Previous temporary stabilization efforts were unsuccessful, and studies show that altering water currents through Bendway Weirs is the most effective solution. We strongly encourage the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to implement similar prevention methods to protect our community.”

“I appreciate Congresswoman Erin Houchin’s support for this critical investment in Bloomington’s water infrastructure.

Rehabilitating aging equipment will improve reliability, modernize controls, and strengthen the long-term resilience of our water system,"" Kerry Thomson, mayor of Bloomington, said.

Katherine Zaiger, director of the City of Bloomington Utilities, said, “Booster stations are an essential component of our distribution system, acting like a heart in the system by maintaining water pressure throughout miles of pipes. This rehabilitation will add Variable Frequency Drives to improve efficiency, upgrade monitoring and control systems, and enhance reliability and cybersecurity, resulting in more cost-effective operations.”

“This project will improve the health, safety, economic development and quality of life for residents of the City of Madison and Jefferson County.

""By allowing designated scholarship granting organizations to offer scholarships to qualified child care providers for preschool students, it should reduce some of the strain on the federal Child Care and Development Fund and enable more Hoosiers to return to the workforce and increase their household income.

Among the list are addressing barriers to work-based learning opportunities, tort reform to help maintain a business-friendly climate and creating additional child care options.

All of the organization’s goals align with its current visioning plan for the state, Indiana Prosperity 2035 (IP35).

A survey of Indiana Chamber member companies at the end of 2025 solidified that the IP35 pillar of Economic Growth, Innovation and Entrepreneurship ranked as the most critical area for the organization’s increased involvement, with the Education and Workforce pillars rounding out the top trio.

“This session, we are focusing on the policies we believe will have the biggest impact on employers, particularly small employers, and can get accomplished in the short timeframe we have,” said Vanessa Green Sinders, Indiana Chamber president and CEO. “What they all have in common is preserving or improving Indiana’s economic competitiveness in various areas and overall business climate. We look forward to working with lawmakers, Gov. Braun and other stakeholders to advance bills that make that happen.”

The Indiana Chamber’s 2026 legislative priorities are:

•Ensure tax conformity or decoupling with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OB3) to maintain Indiana’s competitive tax status.

“Indiana has worked over many years to maintain a tax code that is broad-based, stable and relatively easy for individuals and employers to navigate,"" Sinders said. ""We have and will continue to urge state leaders to take action around OB3 to ensure clarity for taxpayers and ongoing stability in Indiana’s tax system.”

•Enact tort reform to protect those unjustly targeted and improve the state’s business climate.

“Smart tort reform is not about limiting legitimate claims; it’s about ensuring a level playing field, reducing uncertainty and protecting employers who operate responsibly, all in the interest of economic growth,"" said Sinders. ""Indiana has long benefited from a reputation as a balanced, business-friendly state that values fairness while discouraging abusive litigation practices. Maintaining that reputation matters, particularly as competition among states for high-growth companies and innovation-driven investment intensifies.”

The Indiana Chamber is part of the Indiana Alliance for Legal Reform, a new non-profit entity seeking state-level civil and tort law reforms, announced in late December and comprised of statewide groups and Indiana-based businesses.

•Establish a sustainable, scalable approach to addressing liability barriers for employers hiring students under 18 years old for work-based learning experiences.

“If Indiana wants to be a leader in work-based learning and grow its own talent pipeline, we must address barriers to participation on both sides,"" Sinders said. ""For employers, too often the obstacle is around liability insurance; we need to determine a long-term solution that is accessible to multiple industries and sizes of corporate partners.”

•Establish framework to enable scholarship granting organizations to serve children aged five and under in childcare settings.

“One of the things we hear repeatedly from our member companies is the need to do more around child care to help families and employers,"" Sinders said. ""By allowing designated scholarship granting organizations to offer scholarships to qualified child care providers for preschool students, it should reduce some of the strain on the federal Child Care and Development Fund and enable more Hoosiers to return to the workforce and increase their household income. Plus, employers benefit from a deeper talent pool to fill their job openings.”

•Provide the option for township government elimination to maximize resources and efficiency.

“We have been chipping away at common sense local government reform for years,"" said Sinders. ""This is the next step in that modernization by allowing township governments that are within another unit of local government to essentially eliminate themselves to better serve their residents. There is support from some of these impacted municipalities to do just that; they recognize the redundancy and want to consider this option.""

•Build on economic development collaboration across the state to continue momentum for initiatives in all regions.

•Enhance workplace safety by allowing employers to act quickly when credible threats of violence emerge.

LAFAYETTE, IN, UNITED STATES, January 13, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — Subaru of Indiana Automotive (SIA), a recognized industry leader in environmental stewardship, has energized a 204-kilowatt rooftop solar project atop its new building expansion in Lafayette.

The system went into service in August 2025 and represents the latest step in SIA’s multi-decade effort to reduce its carbon footprint while strengthening Indiana’s clean energy economy.

The solar installation produces more than three times the energy currently consumed by the expansion, meaning the solar installation generates a net surplus of clean power. That surplus is fed back into the company’s operations, creating both long-term energy cost containment and measurable carbon reduction benefits.

The project is expected to offset more than 250 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, the equivalent of supplying the electricity needs of 43 homes. Over its 30-year operating life, the system will deliver millions of kilowatt-hours of clean electricity, helping Subaru advance its corporate sustainability goals while reducing operating costs of the expansion at its Lafayette facility.

Building on a legacy of environmental leadership

SIA has long been recognized for its leadership in environmental practices. It was the first U.S. auto assembly plant to achieve zero-landfill status and has consistently invested in technologies that reduce waste, conserve natural resources and lower greenhouse gas emissions.

The new solar project builds on that legacy, demonstrating how one of Indiana’s largest manufacturers is using renewable energy as both a cost-containment strategy and a core component of its environmental vision.

Scott Brand, President and Chief Operating Officer of Subaru of Indiana Automotive, said, “The expansion rooftop project completed by Emergent Solar Energy further demonstrates an ongoing commitment to reduce our environmental impact. By expanding the use of renewable energy at our facility, we continue to embrace sustainable technology to help offset our carbon footprint.”

Partnership with Emergent Solar Energy

SIA selected Emergent Solar Energy, a commercial and industrial solar EPC headquartered in the Purdue Research Park of West Lafayette, as its partner for the design and construction of the project. Emergent specializes in turnkey solar and energy storage solutions for large manufacturers and agricultural operations across the state.

Jeremy Lipinski, Managing Partner of Emergent Solar Energy, said, “Subaru of Indiana Automotive has set the standard for sustainable manufacturing in Indiana and the Midwest. We are honored to contribute to that vision with a solar project that will deliver long-term energy savings, reduce emissions and showcase how renewable energy can integrate seamlessly with advanced manufacturing. This project reflects what’s possible when industry leaders take bold steps toward a carbon-conscious future.”

Adam Bolen, Project Manager at Emergent Solar Energy who led the on-site construction, said, “Executing a solar installation on an active, high-volume manufacturing campus requires rigorous safety planning and precise coordination. We worked seamlessly with the SIA facilities team to ensure this array was installed safely and efficiently without disrupting operations. It is rewarding to see the system now delivering clean power to this impressive facility.”

The 2009 Endangerment Finding and EPA’s Proposed Recission

The 2009 Endangerment Finding — EPA’s foundational determination that GHGs “threaten the public health and welfare” — underpins EPA’s broader authority to regulate GHGs and has served as the legal cornerstone for EPA’s GHG regulatory architecture since 2009. Although EPA’s current efforts to repeal the 2009 Endangerment Finding are most directly tied to the motor vehicle program, recission could have implications extending to other regulated industries, such as power plants (read more about the recission decision here).

EPA’s proposed rule, now set for final review, contends that the Obama-era 2009 Endangerment Finding relied on outdated science, focused on global rather than localized risk, and was overly pessimistic about temperature impacts. EPA also purports that US vehicles represent a small fraction of global emissions and that federal GHG standards impose “hidden taxes” that raise new-vehicle prices and paradoxically keep older, less efficient vehicles on the road longer. Because subsequent vehicle standards relied on the 2009 Endangerment Finding, EPA’s proposal could have notable impacts on EPA emissions programs for light- and medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicles and engines, and, if finalized, could preempt conflicting state fuel efficiency or vehicle emissions programs.

What Happens Next?

Release of the final repeal is expected to trigger extensive litigation and public debate, building on years of controversy over the scope of EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act and the US Supreme Court’s ruling in Massachusetts v.

Two wind farms off the west and north Wales coastline have secured UK government funding to supply the national grid, with up to 7,000 jobs expected to be created.

The Erebus wind farm, set to be built off Pembrokeshire, would become Wales' first floating offshore wind farm, following two projects already operating in Scotland.

It is hoped the development could open up a new industry, leading to as many as 5,000 jobs in the next decade.

A second wind farm, Awel y Môr, using more traditional offshore turbines, is planned close to existing projects and will be 10km (6.2 miles) off Rhyl, Denbighshire.

The funding comes from a government scheme to encourage investment in renewable energy.

What is a floating wind farm?

While traditional offshore wind turbines are built into the seabed with fixed foundations, floating turbines sit on large floating steel structures which are then tethered to the seabed.

This allows the turbines to be manufactured and also maintained and serviced on land, then carried on ships to locations further out at sea with higher winds.

The long-term goal is to establish the Celtic Sea as a major hub for floating offshore wind energy. The Crown Estate is currently leasing three large-scale projects, with an estimated 264 turbines to be installed by the mid-2030s.

The Erebus wind farm off the Pembrokeshire coast would be able to produce 96MW - enough to power about 90,000 homes.

The plans by Blue Gem Wind - which is co-owned by the French energy giant Total - include building between seven and 10 turbines, in the Celtic Sea, about 45km (28 miles) off the coast.

While it may sound like a small amount compared to other offshore projects, it has been described as a ""pathway project"" for the Celtic Sea.

But, as it will be the first project to use this new technology in the Celtic Sea, there is currently limited infrastructure, supply chain or workforce in Wales to produce these turbines - which can be as tall as skyscrapers.

In addition, ports in the Celtic Sea are not yet prepared to handle the large-scale infrastructure, with three Welsh ports, in particular Port Talbot, in the running for contracts to develop these projects.

Scotland is already home to two of the largest floating wind farms in the world, Hywind Scotland and the Kincardine.

These will soon be joined by the Pentland and Salamander projects, along with the 560MW Green Volt project, which previously secured funding from the UK government.

Awel y Môr will becomethe first offshore wind farm to be built in 10 years off the coast of Wales.

It is one of six projects around the UK which will be paid £91 per MWH on average for the power they generate.

The Conservatives claimed the deals would not lower bills, but analysts Aurora Energy Research said the prices would deliver a net benefit to bills over the next decade.

Majority owned by the energy company RWE, Awel y Môr will see between 34 and 50 turbines, 10km (6.2 miles) off the north Wales coast, next to the existing Gwynt y Mor windfarm.

This could potentially supply enough energy to power half of Wales' homes.

The company claims it has the potential to create 2,000 jobs during the construction phase.

Becky Gittins, MP for Clwyd East - the constituency where Awel y Môr will be - said the funding decision represented ""a major step forward for... our local economy, and the UK's energy security"".

Aled Jones-Griffith, chief executive of Llandrillo Menai, a local college, told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast it would ""bring opportunities to young people and perhaps lead them to consider new career options"" and was especially positive for their Rhyl campus, ""where we have a specialised centre to deal with wind energy"".

Abi Beck of trade body RenewableUK Cymru told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast that floating offshore wind farms were ""the new revolution"".

She likened the deal to a ""fixed-term mortgage"" adding: ""The government has agreed a price to pay for electricity, and that price won't change.

""That means it'll keep bill payers' costs down and will make sure we don't have to import more gas - we don't have control over that price.

""We're protecting our own energy security and protecting our bill payers as well.""

Charlotte Wood, commercial manager at Mainstay Marine Solutions which is based at Pembroke Dock, said the announcement was ""hugely welcome news"".

""It's the next big step in securing what we hope will be a strong pipeline of work for engineering companies like ours and hopefully it reinforces the future of Pembroke Port, and other south Wales ports as vibrant hubs of offshore renewables,"" she said.

Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said: ""It is a massive vote of confidence in Wales' clean energy industry which is already delivering the well-paid, highly-skilled jobs of the future with the potential to bring thousands more.""

Wales' first minister Eluned Morgan added she was ""delighted"" by the news.

""This demonstrates how Wales is well placed to build on its existing capacity for renewable energy, to reap the benefits of these new projects bringing many high-quality jobs and wider economic benefits to our economy.""

How do wind farms work?

Offshore wind farms work on the same basic principle as traditional power stations - electricity is generated by rotating magnets inside a coil of conductive wire.

But, in offshore wind farms, that rotation comes from the wind rather than the steam produced by burning fossil fuels.

Strong sea winds turn the turbine blades, which spin a shaft inside the fixed box on top of the tower. This drives a generator, producing electricity without releasing carbon emissions.

Because a single turbine produces only a limited amount of power, many are grouped together in a wind farm.

Electricity is sent through underwater cables to an offshore substation, where the voltage is increased before being transmitted to land and fed into the national grid.

With a lifespan of 20-25 years, offshore wind farms are maintained by specialist crews who work from vessels stationed at sea.

The largest offshore wind farm in the UK - and the world - is currently the Dogger Bank Wind Farm, located in the North Sea off the east coast of Yorkshire.

Once fully built, it will have a capacity of around 3.6GW, capable of powering millions of homes.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1a18/live/2c000620-f142-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 11:00:34.964462

Combined, the two transactions could add more than 8.1 GW of modern gas generation to Vistra’s portfolio. According to Vistra’s November 2025 earnings report, the company operated approximately 43.7 GW of total capacity across its generation fleet, including 6,448 MW of nuclear generation (the second-largest competitive nuclear fleet in the U.S), about 26,000 MW of natural gas capacity across combined cycle, combustion turbine, and steam turbine configurations, 4,570 MW of coal generation, and 1,421 MW of solar and battery storage.

Under the Jan. 5 agreement, Vistra will acquire 10 natural gas–fired generation facilities, including five in the PJM Interconnection, four in ISO New England, and one in ERCOT. Under the transaction, Vistra could effectively acquire 90% of Cogentrix’s portfolio, though Cogentrix is slated to retain its ownership interest in Cedar Bayou 4, a 550-MW natural gas-fired plant in Baytown, Texas.

In PJM, the acquisition comprises a mix of combined-cycle and combustion turbine assets, including the Patriot and Hamilton-Liberty combined-cycle plants in Pennsylvania, each rated at 881 MW, and the Lakewood combined-cycle facility in New Jersey (286 MW). The PJM portfolio also includes two combustion turbine plants: Rock Springs in Maryland (740 MW) and Ocean in New Jersey (375 MW).

The ISO New England assets—Newington in New Hampshire (624 MW), Bridgeport in Connecticut (558 MW), Tiverton in Rhode Island (297 MW), and Rumford in Maine (271 MW)—consist entirely of efficient combined-cycle facilities. In ERCOT, Vistra is poised to acquire Altura Cogeneration (583 MW), which supplies both electricity and thermal energy to the rapidly growing Texas market.

Vistra said it is acquiring 100% ownership of all plants in the portfolio, including the remaining 25% interest in the Patriot and Hamilton-Liberty facilities that Cogentrix did not previously own. The “Cogentrix portfolio is composed of a modern and efficient set of gas assets that adds baseload-weighted capacity, complements Vistra’s fleet, and enhances Vistra’s efficient generation capabilities,” the company noted. “The portfolio has an average heat rate of approximately 7,800 Btu / kWh and features the Patriot and Hamilton-Liberty plants, which are 2016 COD facilities with sub 7,000 Btu / kWh heat rates.”

The company also cited a geographic strategy, noting that the acquisition will expand Vistra’s footprint across some of the U.S.’s most capacity-constrained and fastest-growing power regions. Following the transaction, Vistra said its total generation portfolio will hover at 50 GW of capacity nationwide.

Last week, Vistra also said the transaction aligns with its disciplined capital allocation framework. The Cogentrix portfolio is expected to contribute mid-single-digit accretion to Ongoing Operations Adjusted Free Cash Flow before Growth per share in 2027, and high-single-digit average accretion over the 2027–2029 period, and it will be supported by cash flow from operations and transaction-related tax benefits. Vistra said it expects the deal to exceed its mid-teens levered return target.

“Successfully integrating and operating generation assets is a major undertaking, and our talented team continues to demonstrate that it is a core competency of our company,” noted Vistra President and CEO Jim Burke.

“Our diversified fleet, anchored on natural gas and nuclear generation, will play a critical role in the reliability, affordability, and flexibility of U.S. power grids,” Burke added. “The addition of this natural gas portfolio is a great way to start another year of growth for Vistra as we’ve completed, acquired, or developed projects in each of the competitive power regions where we operate. Vistra continues to look for opportunities that allow us to meet the growing demand of customers and meet our disciplined investment thresholds. We look forward to closing the transaction and welcoming new team members to the Vistra family.”

Vistra Spearheading Growth Across Multiple Fuel Types

Vistra’s Cogentrix transaction remains subject to regulatory approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and certain state regulatory authorities, but the company anticipates the transaction will close in mid-to-late 2026.

FERC’s review under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act will examine competitive impacts, particularly in PJM and ISO New England, where the combined Vistra-Cogentrix fleet will hold significant generation capacity. The commission will also assess whether the transaction adversely affects competition, rates, or regulation, and whether it involves cross-subsidization of non-utility activities. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC served as Vistra’s exclusive financial advisor, with legal counsel provided by Latham & Watkins LLP, Sidley Austin LLP, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP. Evercore served as exclusive financial advisor to Cogentrix Energy, with King & Spalding LLP providing legal counsel.

As a reference for timing, Vistra’s acquisition of the Lotus Infrastructure portfolio—announced in May 2025 and closed in October 2025—took approximately five months from signing to completion. However, the larger scale and greater geographic concentration of the Cogentrix portfolio may extend regulatory review timelines.

Beyond the Lotus acquisition completed in October 2025, Vistra in September 2025 announced plans to build new gas-fueled dispatchable generation in West Texas’s Permian Basin, an effort rooted in the next phase of its ERCOT capacity expansion to support grid reliability amid surging demand.

And in July 2025, the company received Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approval to extend the operation of its Perry Nuclear Plant—a 1,268-MW boiling water reactor located on Lake Erie, about 40 miles northeast of Cleveland—through 2046, in a measure that completes license extensions across all six of its nuclear reactors spanning Ohio and Pennsylvania. During its November 2025 earnings call, the company also announced it secured a 20-year power purchase agreement with an undisclosed customer for up to 1,200 MW at its Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant site near Glen Rose in Central Texas. “We believe this 20-year agreement, which enables our customer to energize up to 1,200 MW of new load ensures the Comanche Peak nuclear plant will continue to deliver power to Texans at least through the middle of this century,” Burke said on Nov. 6, 2025.

Days after announcing the Cogentrix acquisition last week, notably, Vistra unveiled agreements with Meta Platforms to support 20-year power purchase agreements covering 2,609 MW of nuclear capacity from its Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio and Beaver Valley facility in Pennsylvania—including 433 MW of uprates across all three sites. The Meta partnership, which marks the largest corporate-backed nuclear uprate program in U.S. history, will provide financial certainty to pursue subsequent license renewals and extend operations at all three facilities for decades while adding more than 15% new capacity to the PJM grid.

To fund its expansion while preserving its investment-grade credit profile, Vistra has executed multiple capital markets transactions. The company in October 2025 priced $2 billion in senior secured notes—debt securities backed by pledged assets and ranked ahead of unsecured debt in repayment priority—across multiple maturity dates. In January 2026, concurrent with the Cogentrix announcement, Vistra priced an additional $2.25 billion in senior secured notes to support the transaction and general corporate purposes.

Another Big Move for Cogentrix

Cogentrix Energy, founded in 1983, is a leading independent power company that develops, acquires, and operates power generation assets across the U.S. The company owns about 5.5 GW of natural gas generation capacity positioned throughout PJM, ISO New England, and ERCOT.

However, since August 2024, Cogentrix has been owned by funds managed by Quantum Capital Group, a Houston-based private equity firm that has managed more than $32 billion in equity commitments since its founding in 1998. Quantum acquired the company from Carlyle Group for approximately $3 billion, citing rising demand for dispatchable power.

“We are at a critical juncture in the evolution of the domestic power market,” said Wil VanLoh, Founder and CEO of Quantum, when Quantum acquired Cogentrix in August 2024. “Electricity demand is rapidly increasing thanks to explosive growth in data centers and AI, the reshoring of manufacturing, and the electrification-of-everything. This growth is occurring at the same time our grid is becoming more unstable with additions of intermittent renewable power and continued retirements of coal-fired generation. Now more than ever, we need reliable and efficient power infrastructure. This is what the Cogentrix assets provide.”

Last week, VanLoh suggested the transaction reflected a similar strategy. “This highly successful partnership with Cogentrix highlights the scale and capabilities of the Quantum platform and our deep expertise across the gas-to-power space,” he said. “This transaction delivers a strong outcome for our investors and strategic partners in Cogentrix, including Williams, Trafigura Group, and Carnelian Energy Capital, and reinforces our long-standing belief in the critical importance of dependable power generation. We are pleased to become shareholders of Vistra and have strong confidence in Vistra’s ability to create long-term value through its industry-leading asset base and strategic execution.”

Jeff Ingraham, interim CEO of Cogentrix, said, “Our partnership with Quantum was instrumental in advancing the company and preparing Cogentrix for its next phase.”

A Race to Secure Gas Generation Assets

The Cogentrix acquisition, notably, follows significant consolidation activity in the competitive generation sector and a concerted industry-wide move to secure modern gas-fired generation assets. In January 2025,Constellation Energy—which operates the nation’s largest nuclear fleet—announced a $26.6 billion agreement to acquire Calpine Corp., the country’s largest natural gas fleet operator, creating a combined portfolio with about 55 GW. Constellation reported the deal was complete earlier this month.

In May 2025,NRG Energy announceda $12 billion agreement to acquire 18 natural gas-fired facilities (13 GW) from LS Power, roughly doubling NRG’s generation capacity across the Northeast and Texas. The transaction closed in early 2026 following regulatory approvals.​ Similarly, Talen Energy in July 2025 announceddefinitive agreements to acquire two combined-cycle gas plants in PJM—the 1,045-MW Moxie Freedom Energy Center in Pennsylvania and the 1,836-MW Guernsey Power Station in Ohio—for a net $3.5 billion. Both transactions closed in in the fourth quarter of 2025.​

Meanwhile, municipal utility CPS Energy executed two major gas acquisitions in 2025: a$785 million purchase of Talen’s 1,710-MW Texas portfolio that closed in Q2 2024, and a$1.4 billion agreement to acquire four natural gas plants (1,632 MW) from PROENERGY that closed in September 2025.​

According to Enverus Intelligence Research (EIR), U.S. natural gas power sector merger and acquisition (M&A) valuations have doubled since 2024. Scott Wilmot, principal Analyst at EIR, in an October 2025 briefing, suggested that accelerating data center growth, grid electrification, and rising capital costs and supply chain issues are driving “premiums for operating natural gas power plants and transforming valuation methodologies in competitive markets,” particularly in PJM and ERCOT.

Enverus said capital costs for new-build natural gas generation now average $2,200 to $3,000/kW, which reinforces the appeal of existing, high-efficiency combined-cycle assets with established interconnections and capacity market exposure. The firm also noted that investment strategies are increasingly focused on portfolios capable of capturing capacity revenues and favorable spark spreads, a factor it suggests marks a shift in valuation frameworks across competitive wholesale markets.

For now, the valuation premium for natural gas assets appears to be reinforced by capacity market dynamics. PJM’s 2026/27 Base Residual Auction cleared at the federally mandated price cap of $329.17/MW-day, which represents a 22% increase from the prior auction. The organized wholesale market’s subsequent 2027/28 auction cleared at $333.44/MW-day, reflecting prices that would have reached approximately $530/MW-day without a temporary cap negotiated with Pennsylvania’s governor.

In the 2027/28 PJM auction, Vistra cleared 10,566 MW of generation capacity, securing approximately $1.3 billion in annual capacity revenue. Natural gas generation accounted for 43% of total cleared capacity in PJM, underscoring its central role in maintaining grid reliability amid accelerating demand growth.

Likewise, ISO New England capacity markets have attracted robust investment, with 1,928 MW of new resources clearing Forward Capacity Auctions for delivery years 2025-2028. Grid operators across all three markets—PJM, ISO-NE, and ERCOT—project sustained load growth driven primarily by data center development.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/odessa-ector-powerplant-2017.png,N,,2026-01-14 11:01:13.093487

According to the report, statewide emissions of the air pollutants regulated under the federal Clean Air Act have declined sharply from 1990 through 2022.
Measured concentrations of those air pollutants have been below every federal health-based standard for more than a decade.
Average concentrations of SO2, for example, are 95% below the federal standard; annual nitrogen dioxide concentrations are 89% below the standard.
From 1990 through 2022, CO, NOx, and VOC emissions have declined by 81%, 72% and 85%, respectively, from these on-road sources of air pollution.","DEQ attributes the decline of air pollution emissions to efforts by state leaders, regulatory agencies, electric utilities, industry and the public to significantly address air quality concerns over the last 50 years. Statewide emissions of carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide in particular reached all-time lows in 2022, the latest year for which data are available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

According to the report, statewide emissions of the air pollutants regulated under the federal Clean Air Act have declined sharply from 1990 through 2022. Specifically, emissions fell:

• 95% for sulfur dioxide (SO2)

• 74% for carbon monoxide (CO)

• 71% for nitrogen oxides (NOx)

• 48% for fine particles (PM5)

• 67% for volatile organic compounds (VOCs)

Not surprisingly, North Carolina’s outdoor air quality has improved as emissions have fallen. Measured concentrations of those air pollutants have been below every federal health-based standard for more than a decade. Average concentrations of SO2, for example, are 95% below the federal standard; annual nitrogen dioxide concentrations are 89% below the standard.

North Carolina’s transition away from coal for power generation has been a major driver of these changes. More of the state’s power now comes from clean sources such as solar, wind and nuclear energy. Energy efficiency improvements in homes and buildings also reduced emissions from power plants.

Cars, trucks and other vehicles on North Carolina roads also emit far less pollution than older vehicles, thanks to improved engine and fuel standards and more advanced emissions controls. From 1990 through 2022, CO, NOx, and VOC emissions have declined by 81%, 72% and 85%, respectively, from these on-road sources of air pollution. The state expects to see further reductions from the transportation sector in the coming years due to the increasing adoption of electric vehicles.",https://smokymountainnews.s3.amazonaws.com/media/k2/items/cache/89f71e57b4d5a65174f4d42e6fd86758_L.jpg?javer=2601141102,N,,2026-01-14 11:03:01.869206

That’s a larger increase than last year’s 3.5 million increase, which was also higher than the previous year, showing that EVs keep growing despite unprecedented attacks against them by governments, media and even by automakers themselves.

2025 was once again marked by ubiquitous falsehoods in the media regarding electric cars.

If you spent the year reading headlines, or listening to lobbying from automakers, or political statements by fossil shills squatting in government, you’d think the bottom was falling out of EV sales.

After all, for not just this past year, but over two years now, there have been stories all throughout media claiming that EV sales are slowing, cooling, falling, or any other number of inaccurate words.

Advertisement - scroll for more content

Even automakers have reacted to these falsehoods and reduced their EV production plans – even ones which have increasing EV sales and declining gas car sales, and which know will lose billions due to their EV intransigence.

The mildly-informed person might see these headlines and these actions and think that doom and gloom is on the horizon, that the EV transition has fizzled out.

But anyone who bothered to look up one single sales number all year would perhaps see things differently.

Yes, once again, EV sales are up. By a lot.

It turns out, EV sales are actually up. Not only are they up, they’re up by a lot. Though that shouldn’t be a surprise, because they’ve never not been up.

And now, once again, we have more data to show it.

Rho Motion/Benchmark Minerals Intelligence released its annual tally of EV sales today, showing a big jump in global electric vehicle sales in 2025 as compared to 2024.

Globally, EV sales went up 20% to 20.7 million, setting yet another record (note: there has never been a year that a global record wasn’t set for EV sales, because EV sales have never gone down year over year). Any company, especially one in a long-term low-growth industry, would kill for a sales increase that large.

Not only were sales up globally, they were up in most regions. China saw a 17% rise to 12.9 million, Europe rose 33% to 4.3 million, and “Rest of World” sold 1.7 million EVs, a whopping 48% increase.

One region did go down though – North America, which saw a 4% decrease in EV sales year-over-year, with 1.8 million total EVs sold (only barely above the RoW number… a fairly pathetic showing for the market dominated by the richest country in the world).

The drop in North American EV sales shares similarities to what happened in Europe from ’23-’24. When Germany abruptly cancelled EV incentives in late 2023, EV sales dropped significantly in Europe’s most car-buying country.

This dragged down European EV sales totals for the next year or so, even though almost all other countries still experienced an increase in sales. And was accompanied by many thinkpieces about the end of the EV transition, or incorrect sentences suggesting that EV sales were dropping Europe-wide.

And yet, look at that new number for 2025 – European sales were up 33% year-over-year. It turns out, the EV transition is still going on quite well enough, after working through the hiccup from one country.

Does this sound familiar?

Indeed, in the US, republicans just inflated the price of EVs by $7,500, on the way to their goal of sending the US auto industry to China and in response to asked-for bribes from the fossil fuel industry. This led to a big boom in EV sales in Q3 before incentives expired, and a big drop in EV sales in Q4, after they were gone. And just like Germany, we expect depressed sales will remain for some period of time, after which sales will resume rising once again.

Not only are EV sales up, they’re up more than last year

Over the course of the last couple years of false headlines about EV sales, some have tried to suggest that the phrase “EV sales slow” doesn’t refer to the sales numbers themselves, but to growth of sales numbers.

But in fact, the 3.6 million unit increase in EV sales in 2025 is larger than the 3.5 million unit increase in 2024, which is larger again than the 3.2 million increase in 2023.

So, not only are sales up, but sales growth is up. If a unit sales increase gets larger every year, that’s accelerating growth, not decelerating.

And gas car sales are still down

Meanwhile, gas car sales are actually down long term.

Globally, sales of internal combustion vehicles are down about a quarter from their peak in 2017, and are expected to never reach that peak again. The combustion engine’s time in the sun is over, and it has been for a while.

So, to look at rising EV sales and claim a problem there while ignoring – or worse, re-committing – to the falling internal combustion market makes no sense whatsoever, especially in a business with long development timelines.

So of course, that’s what Western auto manufacturers have done.

Western automakers will fail if they commit to a falling market

Throughout the last couple years, automakers have played their standard tune – begging governments to let them poison everyone just a little bit more.

There’s even reason to believe that incorrect headlines about EV sales were an intentional effort by automakers to influence regulations, as argued by Union of Concerned Scientists’ David Reichmuth. By claiming that EV sales are softer than they are, and ignoring falling gas car sales, automakers were hoping to influence governments to soften targets, so that they could save a few pennies on regulatory costs.

Automakers did have some success in getting governments to soften their targets as a result of these falsehoods. The Biden EPA adopted softer exhaust rules as a result of automaker lobbying, and Europe recently softened its EV timeline for a second time, both in response to incorrect claims about EV demand. Expect the same behavior in the UK this year, even though that country is on track to meet timelines.

But those same automakers seem to have gotten too high on their own supply, adjusting their plans to incorporate the misinformation about EV sales that they themselves planted. Many have reduced their EV production plans and re-committed to outdated and unpopular gas cars going forward.

Yet despite their best efforts, EV sales still rise, and gas car sales still fall, as we’ve seen above.

Guess who isn’t doing that? China

This push against progress has at least been true for Western automakers, and for Japanese ones too (the Koreans, Hyundai/Kia, do participate in backwards industry lobbying organizations, but have mostly been clear that EVs are the way to go).

Not so for Chinese automakers. Chinese automakers are charging forward with EV production, committing to produce the more efficient vehicles that the world needs and is demanding. Instead of putting their effort into providing the outdated gassers that nobody wants, they’re making state-of-the-art EVs that are far more affordable to use.

And instead of competing, Western countries have thrown up unwise trade barriers that won’t work to get those countries back on track.

This is why China recently became the largest auto exporter in the world – it planned and competed, instead of playing the same stupid game of trying to stop progress that incumbent industry always plays.

We here at Electrek have been clear about this for years now – automakers should look forward, not backwards, and should stop pushing misinformation about their own sales numbers by claiming that up is down. We haven’t had any special insight here, just the simple ability to compare two numbers to see which one is bigger.

Two months after sticking it to South Carolina by locating its corporate headquarters in downtown Charlotte, North Carolina, crony capitalist carmaker Scout Motors – a subsidiary of über-woke Volkswagen – is asking Palmetto State taxpayers for hundreds of millions more of their hard-earned money.

The corporate welfare recipient – which already got a whopping $1.3 billion in incentives three years ago – is reportedly dealing with “cost overruns” at its massive manufacturing facility near Blythewood, S.C.

This facility – which company leaders insist will create 4,600 jobs – has yet to produce a single vehicle. Now, sources familiar with the situation say Scout is petitioning governor Henry McMaster and leaders of the S.C. General Assembly to shell out another $200 million to address these cost overruns.

A massive taxpayer-funded bailout, in other words…

McMaster, ever Scout’s dutiful cheerleader, is pushing lawmakers hard to approve the request – although he is reportedly encountering stiff resistance across both the partisan and ideological spectrum.

“Not just ‘no,’ hell no!” one lawmaker familiar with Scout’s request emphatically told FITSNews.

Two months ago, Scout announced its intention to locate its new corporate headquarters in the Queen City – bringing an estimated 1,200 high-paying, corporate jobs and $200 million in capital investment to North Carolina. Scout chose Charlotte over Charleston, S.C., an abject humiliation for McMaster – who has breathlessly fellated Scout for years.

Last year, McMaster unsuccessfully championed legislation which would have given the woke EV automaker an undeserved leg-up on its competitors by ensconcing it as the only vehicle manufacturer permitted to bypass the Palmetto State’s established dealer marketplace. McMaster also unsuccessfully sought an additional $100 million in recurring annual funding for EV industry scholarships from the S.C. Education Lottery.

FITSNews has consistently opposed market-distorting crony capitalist subsidies – and specifically the Scout deal, which is looking more and more like previous failed boondoggles with each passing day.

***

“Scout got an insanely (and we mean insanely) good deal from South Carolina lawmakers, one no government in its right mind should have ever offered up based on prevailing market conditions,” I noted in a recent editorial.

Not only that, the deal was rushed through the legislature in just seven days – providing absolutely no opportunity for public scrutiny.

Which appears to have been the whole point…

South Carolina made its massive investment in Scout at a time when the EV market was already showing signs of collapse – which is probably why no other state seriously entertained the project (save Mississippi, which offered a comparatively small $150 million in total incentives to the company).

Needless to say, we encourage lawmakers to reject McMaster’s latest entreaties on behalf of this über-woke crony capitalist corporation…

The decision, communicated publicly by the White House in early January, represents a major shift in U.S. engagement with international climate cooperation and partially follows earlier actions by President Donald Trump to exit other global climate commitments.

What the change means

By removing the U.S. from the UNFCCC and related agencies — including scientific bodies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) — the administration has effectively reduced Washington’s role in shaping global climate strategy, emissions reporting and cooperative climate finance mechanisms.

The shift builds on earlier actions by the Trump administration. In 2025, for example, Trump issued an executive order withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement — the landmark climate pact under the UNFCCC — for the second time since his first term, meaning the nation will again stand outside the global framework aimed at limiting global temperature rise.

Global leaders condemn the move

The withdrawal from the UNFCCC — the umbrella treaty that underpins nearly all multilateral climate agreements, including the Paris Agreement — has drawn sharp criticism from global officials and experts.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell called it a “colossal own goal” that threatens both the U.S. economy and public welfare as climate-related risks grow.

European Union Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra described the U.S. retreat as “regrettable and unfortunate,” emphasizing that the UNFCCC “underpins global climate action” by bringing nations together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has also expressed “regret” over the United States’ broader withdrawal from several U.N. and international entities tied to climate, labor and migration policy, while reminding member states of their ongoing funding obligations under the U.N. Charter.

Legal questions about the withdrawal

Some legal experts and critics argue the president may lack authority to unilaterally exit a treaty that was ratified by the Senate.

Harold Hongju Koh, former legal adviser to the U.S. State Department, said the move “may be illegal” because the Constitution requires Senate approval to enter treaties, suggesting — in his view — similar approval might be necessary to leave one.

Local voices and past reactions in Indianapolis

While national and international reactions have dominated headlines, local leaders in Indianapolis point to the potential domestic impacts of reducing federal climate engagement — particularly amid increasingly extreme weather and environmental health concerns.

In the past, when the U.S. exited the Paris agreement under Trump’s first term, then-Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said joining the pact was “about ensuring the future health and livability of our city” and pledged to pursue local climate action.

Balancing local priorities with global retreat

Some local business leaders argue that reducing federal climate commitments could free up resources for domestic economic growth, while others counter that embracing clean energy and sustainability offers long-term economic opportunities — especially in technology, construction and manufacturing sectors.

Indiana’s energy sector, historically reliant on coal and natural gas, sits in a transition toward more diversified energy sources. Under Braun, the state has taken steps to shape that transition, including the creation of a Strategic Energy Growth Task Force to address rising electricity demand and a push to expand nuclear energy, including support for small modular reactors. Indiana has also joined a multi-state initiative focused on advancing nuclear development and launched a federally funded energy efficiency program aimed at lowering utility costs for residents. How the federal withdrawal from international climate agreements will affect Indiana’s long-term energy planning, investment incentives and clean-energy partnerships remains unclear.

Economists and climate analysts in the region note that while U.S. withdrawal from international treaties does not directly dictate domestic energy policy, it sends a signal that could influence investor confidence, federal funding for climate research and interstate cooperation on emissions reduction.

Looking ahead

As the United States moves forward outside the UNFCCC framework, cities and states may increasingly take the lead on climate initiatives — a trend supporters of local action say could accelerate community-based solutions.

For Indianapolis, the latest federal posture underscores the tension between national policy and local climate realities — from heat waves and flooding concerns to long-term planning for sustainable growth.

As farmers and rural communities confront worker losses, reduced project funding, and declining markets, it is critical that federal funding supports projects that do not deepen these harms.
“Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from industrial livestock operations is critical, but manure digesters are a false solution,” said Kara Goad, Senior Associate Attorney at Earthjustice.
Methane leaks and herd expansion linked to manure digesters also make their impact on greenhouse gases dubious.
“REAP funds exist to help rural communities, not the industries that harm them.” The full petition is available here.","Hundreds of millions of dollars intended to cut energy costs have been funneled to costly manure digesters, benefitting industrial-scale livestock operations.

WASHINGTON — Today, a coalition of 34 organizations filed a rulemaking petition urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBCS) to deem anaerobic digesters that are located at industrial livestock operations or use livestock manure ineligible for grants and loans under the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). At the same time, Earthjustice filed a lawsuit on behalf of petitioner Friends of the Earth, challenging the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s violation of the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for illegally withholding public records that detail the agency’s decisions to fund manure digesters using REAP dollars.

“REAP exists to help farmers and rural small businesses lower energy costs and foster stronger communities, not prop up factory farms,” said Molly Armus, Animal Agriculture Policy Program Manager at Friends of the Earth. “If USDA wants to save taxpayer dollars, it should stop wasting its funds on inefficient, costly digesters and instead invest in projects that truly benefit rural communities.”

The petition urges RBCS to disqualify manure digesters from REAP funding because these projects undermine the very goals the program was created to advance. REAP was created to help farmers and rural small businesses cut energy costs and strengthen local economies; yet hundreds of millions of tax dollars have been funneled into expensive, polluting manure digesters. Manure digesters, which are meant to capture methane emissions and generate energy from large amounts of animal waste, overwhelmingly benefit industrial-scale livestock operations, fuel consolidation in rural areas, and contribute to air and water pollution that threatens nearby residents.

The petition also notes that over the last five years, new manure digesters received average loan guarantees of $18.7 million, almost three times more than the average loan guarantees for solar projects, all while delivering far less energy per taxpayer dollar than the solar projects. As farmers and rural communities confront worker losses, reduced project funding, and declining markets, it is critical that federal funding supports projects that do not deepen these harms.

“Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from industrial livestock operations is critical, but manure digesters are a false solution,” said Kara Goad, Senior Associate Attorney at Earthjustice. “Manure digesters do not offer cost-effective emissions reductions or energy generation, and supporting them keeps limited funds from going to practices that reduce emissions, support small farms, and mitigate air and water pollution.”

Petitioners include: Socially Responsible Agriculture Project, Animal Legal Defense Fund, Buffalo River Watershed Alliance, Campaign for Family Farms and the Environment, Cape Fear River Watch, Center for Food Safety, CleanAIRE NC, Climate Action California, Environmental Justice Community Action Network, Farm Aid, Farm Forward, Food & Water Watch, Friends of Toppenish Creek, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, Kansas Rural Center, Kissimmee Waterkeeper, Michiganders for a Just Farming System, Milwaukee Riverkeeper, North Carolina Environmental Justice Network, National Family Farm Coalition, Nebraska Communities United, Northeast Organic Dairy Producers Alliance, Organic Farming Research Foundation, Potomac Riverkeeper, RE Sources, RedTailed Hawk Collective, Rural Empowerment Association for Community Help, Shenandoah Riverkeeper, Southern Coalition for Social Justice, Sustain Rural Wisconsin Network, Upper Potomac Riverkeeper, and Waterkeeper Alliance.

Meanwhile, the lawsuit filed today challenges USDA’s unlawful use of the “deliberative process” exemption under FOIA to withhold 25 spreadsheets that show how the agency evaluated digester funding applications. These records reflect final decisions, not internal deliberations, and are critical for the public to understand why USDA uses its limited REAP funds to support these harmful and ineffective projects.

The petition outlines how funding for digesters is hurting–not helping–farmers and our environment, including:

Benefits go to the biggest polluters. Subsidies for anaerobic digesters primarily benefit the largest industrial animal operations, giving them another subsidized competitive advantage over smaller farms and accelerating the loss of independent farms and rural economic vitality.

Environmental harms. The petition documents numerous environmental harms associated with digesters, including spills and overflows releasing hundreds of thousands of gallons of waste into waterways as well as increased ammonia and nitrate pollution from the leftover byproduct, digestate. Methane leaks and herd expansion linked to manure digesters also make their impact on greenhouse gases dubious.

High costs and poor returns. Digesters often cost between $2–12 million, require enormous taxpayer subsidies, and rarely recoup their costs. They’re also inefficient, with the digesters that received loan guarantees generating 4.5 times less energy per dollar than solar loan guarantee recipients. Specifically, the digesters that received loan guarantees generate an average of 8,047 BTUs annually per REAP dollar, while the solar projects that received loan guarantees generate an average of 36,728 BTUs annually per REAP dollar. Data further shows that many digesters shut down prematurely, making them a risky investment of public dollars.

Better alternatives to build resiliency exist. REAP is consistently oversubscribed, so by making digesters ineligible, more funding could support projects like solar panels for small farms or energy-efficient refrigeration for rural grocery stores. These are the types of projects that lower costs and deliver lasting community benefits.

“There is no way to make factory farm gas sustainable,” said Sherri Dugger, Executive Director at Socially Responsible Agriculture Project. “Rather than using already limited REAP funds to subsidize these toxic operations, USDA should support the independent farmers, small business owners, and rural residents who are working to build healthier outcomes in their home communities.”

“These enormously expensive digesters serve as a subsidy for factory farms, incentivizing them to get bigger to produce more waste as they push small and mid-sized farms out,” said Ben Lilliston, Director of Rural Strategies and Climate Change at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. “Digesters are an increasingly risky investment, when more stable and cost effective options for renewable energy are in high demand from farmers.”

“This petition is important to the people of south central Washington where farmers are struggling to survive after three straight years of drought,” said Jean Mendoza, Executive Director of Friends of Toppenish Creek. “The REAP program should endeavor to disperse funds as equitably as possible with a goal of maximizing environmental benefits for all farmers. REAP funding should not be siphoned off to benefit a segment that actively and brazenly pollutes the land.”

“The use of anaerobic digesters exacerbates the already heavy burden imposed by factory farming on communities and the environment,” said Patience Burke, Pure Farms, Pure Waters National Campaign Manager at Waterkeeper Alliance. “This petition removes the veil and is a powerful illustration of how factory farm biogas is not a clean source of energy. Limited REAP funding should be available to truly renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, and not used in a way that perpetuates the abysmal manure management practices of factory farming.”

“It is important that the government takes steps to ensure that applicants selected for this funding are using the best available technology for the protection of the public’s health,” said Sherri White-Williamson, Executive Director of Environmental Justice Community Action Network.

“For too long, USDA has allowed factory farms and their Big Ag backers to syphon limited conservation funds toward expensive, ineffective, and dirty factory farm biogas projects,” said Tyler Lobdell, Senior Attorney at Food & Water Watch. “USDA must cut them off. It’s time these federal dollars were put back in the pockets of sustainable farmers who need them most.”

“REAP should help build the Michigan we all want to see by supporting truly clean energy, not subsidizing polluting manure digesters on factory farms.” said Val Schey with Michiganders for a Just Farming System. “Ending REAP funding for digesters would ensure the program works for Michigan’s rural communities, not against them.”

“In North Carolina, communities are living next to some of the nation’s largest hog operations, many of them owned by international corporations,” said Anne Harvey David, Chief Counsel for Environmental Justice at Southern Coalition for Social Justice. “That reality is a far cry from the small family farms REAP was meant to serve.”

“Factory farm gas is being sold as climate progress, but in reality, it locks in the very pollution and consolidation that rural communities are struggling to escape,” said Andrew deCoriolis, Executive Director of Farm Forward. “Taxpayer dollars spent on digesters prop up industrial animal operations while worsening air and water pollution. USDA should redirect these funds to farmers and ranchers who are producing food in ways that actually protect the climate, public health, and rural livelihoods.”

“Factory farm biogas production further enriches industrial animal agriculture and biogas developers at the expense of rural communities,” said Christine Ball-Blakely, Senior Staff Attorney at the Animal Legal Defense Fund. “REAP funds exist to help rural communities, not the industries that harm them.”

“Republicans rolled that back this year under Donald Trump’s leadership,” he said in September, referring to the lost EV mandate.
“But the American automobile manufacturers allowed that to happen.” Automakers are eager to engage as the state hammers out the details.
“People respond to incentives.” Newsom’s open hand to automakers has environmentalists split, with some taking a realpolitik approach.
While the governor’s budget last year included a $132 million boost for a popular EV truck and bus incentive program, he didn’t include new funding this year.","“We need to see the details of the new program, but this is a policy that has worked in the past,” said John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents most major automakers and successfully lobbied congressional Republicans to kill California’s nation-leading EV sales mandate in June. “At this stage of the transition and given current market conditions, consumer incentives can lead to more EV adoption and affordability in California — and support the automotive and battery industrial base across the country.”

Yes, automakers overwhelmingly opposed California’s vehicle emissions rule, which had required them to sell an increasing proportion of EVs each year. But they also weren’t pleased with Trump’s dismantling of Biden-era incentives for car buyers and battery manufacturing. (See Bozzella’s reference to “current market conditions,” which also includes the administration’s ongoing tariff policy.)

That dynamic opens a window in forthcoming negotiations on the proposal, which finance officials left vague and said they plan to hash out by February, that could thaw Newsom’s relationship with car companies — and keep the state’s climate goals on track — as he terms out of the governor’s mansion and looks towards higher office.

While Newsom has reserved his most pointed criticism for General Motors CEO Mary Barra, whom he’s repeatedly said in recent months “sold out” California, he hasn’t been afraid to issue barbs to the industry as a whole.

“Republicans rolled that back this year under Donald Trump’s leadership,” he said in September, referring to the lost EV mandate. “But the American automobile manufacturers allowed that to happen.”

Automakers are eager to engage as the state hammers out the details. Among the unanswered questions are who would qualify for the incentive and if there will be a cap on the price of EV models that are rebate-eligible. Companies like Rivian and Hyundai already weighed in during a series of California Air Resources Board workshops last year, advocating for a simple-to-use rebate without an income requirement.

“In our view, every $1,000 leads to a bump in EV registrations in the state,” Tom Van Heeke, Rivian’s senior policy adviser, said in November. “People respond to incentives.”

Newsom’s open hand to automakers has environmentalists split, with some taking a realpolitik approach.

Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California state director at the Environmental Defense Fund, said the state should work closely with the automakers to design an incentive program that gets more EVs on the road — and bury the hatchet in the process.

“I think this is a real opportunity for partnership,” she said.

Not all enviros are thrilled with the idea of handing the keys over to automakers.

Bill Magavern, policy director at Coalition for Clean Air, said he’s encouraged by the inclusion of EV funding in the budget, but that incentives need to target low-income drivers who are more likely to need help covering the cost. And he recoiled at the idea of car manufacturers taking the leading role in designing the program.

“Now that they have bitten the hands that fed them, are they really expecting a handout?” Magavern said. “The program design should be based on what’s good for Californians, especially those who are struggling to make ends meet, and not be based on what’s good for large auto companies.”

One thing that Newsom’s budget omits: Incentives for zero-emission heavy-duty trucks, which the state has also lost the authority to mandate and which have a disproportionate impact on greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. While the governor’s budget last year included a $132 million boost for a popular EV truck and bus incentive program, he didn’t include new funding this year.

Trucking fleets and manufacturers argued during a November workshop that those incentives — which are typically snatched up the same day California opens applications — are the most important tool for transitioning to cleaner models.

“We need to make sure these trucks are at the same price as the diesel equivalent when they open their paychecks and they justify the purchase of that truck,” said Chris Brown, head of government affairs at Harbinger Motors, which builds electric delivery trucks in Orange County.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F74%2Fea%2Fa44be1b14da5a56522b9faf645f2%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1239417080,N,,2026-01-14 09:58:46.780802

In March, residential customers will experience another approximately $11 decrease – meaning their bills will be $44 lower when compared to January

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. – Today, Duke Energy Florida announced that the storm cost recovery charge – the result of costs associated with the company’s approximately $1.1 billion response to hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton – will be removed from customers’ bills a month earlier than originally scheduled.

What this means

Because the full amount for all three storms was recovered ahead of schedule, beginning in February (instead of March):

Residential customers can expect an approximately $33 reduction on their monthly bills, when compared to January, for every 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity they use.

Commercial and industrial customers’ monthly bills will be lowered between 9.6% and 15.8%, also when compared to January, though the specific impact will vary depending on several factors.

Our view

“We understand all of our customers have been affected by the rising costs of living, many may be facing financial challenges, and some are even having to decide which bills they can afford to pay every month,” said Melissa Seixas, Duke Energy Florida state president. “It was important to us that our customers get this significant rate relief as soon as possible while we continue to deliver the safe, reliable power they expect and deserve.”

More savings coming soon

In March, residential customers will experience another approximately $11 decrease (per 1,000 kWh) on their monthly bills, reflecting a seasonal decrease that Duke Energy Florida institutes annually (March-November) to help customers save money during times when energy use is typically higher.

This means, when compared to January, their March bills will be approximately $44 lower – again, per 1,000 kWh.

Even more savings

Recently, the company also:

Made efficiency improvements at many of its natural gas plants (see here), saving customers $340 million in fuel costs

This translates to $10 savings on customers’ monthly bills

Completed three new solar energy sites (see here and here), saving customers another $750 million from displaced fuel costs

Passed on $65 million in Inflation Reduction Act tax credits to customers

This saves residential customers at least $2.50 per 1,000 kWh

Help is available

While Duke Energy Florida is focused on keeping its own costs in check, the company is committed to connecting customers with practical ways to save energy and manage their bills, including flexible payment plans. For more information, please visit duke-energy.com/SeasonalSavings.

The details: At a kickoff press event for the Detroit Auto Show, Barra said the elimination of the $7,500 EV tax credit and rollback of fuel emissions standards have required GM to shift its product strategy but stressed that EVs are still key to the company’s long-term plan, reports Reuters.

Why it matters: For GM dealers, Barra’s message is clear: Instead of going away completely, EVs are now on a slower, more complicated path.

Between the lines: Barra’s comments at the event come as automakers continue to scale back on their EV strategies amid the Trump administration’s rollback of EV-focused policies and slowing market growth.

Ford, which took a $19.5 billion write-down last month, has killed several EV programs, adjusting to policy and market challenges tied to electric vehicles, per Reuters.

Last week, GM said it would record a $6 billion charge to unwind some electric-vehicle investments, following a $1.6 billion third-quarter charge.

Even amid the challenges, electric vehicles will continue to be a priority for GM, as the U.S. volume leader focuses on maintaining flexibility to be able to adjust to regulations imposed by other administrations down the road, explained Barra.

“I’m a little surprised at some [automakers] that are really pulling away very quickly, because we don’t know what will be in ‘29, ‘30, ‘32,” added the CEO.

Bottom line: Dealers who lean into the new reality by fostering EV and hybrid expertise, educating customers on the long game, and staying nimble as GM adjusts investments and timelines, will be better positioned than others.",https://beehiiv-images-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/asset/file/1014cae6-3463-44dd-aa43-cc2770ec3d37/DAS_Tech_SNP__DecJan_202526___7_.png?t=1768397017,N,,2026-01-14 11:02:09.959603

In Great Britain’s most competitive auction for renewable subsidies to date, energy companies vied for contracts that guarantee the price for each unit of clean electricity they generate.

Contracts were awarded to eight new offshore farms after ministers doubled the amount of funding available to developers to help them produce projects worth £22bn.

The government expects the investment to support 7,000 skilled jobs, and has promised that its clean energy agenda would help to lower energy bills for good.

The funding was awarded to offshore windfarms with a total capacity of 8.4 gigawatts (GW), or enough to generate clean electricity for more than 12m British homes by the end of the decade.

These included standard windfarms fixed to the seafloor and a new generation of floating windfarms that could help the UK to build projects in far deeper areas of the North Sea.

The standard windfarms were awarded a contract price of £89.49 a megawatt-hour (MWh) in 2024 prices for those in Scotland, and £91.20/MWh for those in England and Wales. The two floating windfarms were granted a contract that will earn £216.49/MWh.

Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, said: “We’ve secured a record-breaking 8.4GW of offshore wind … This is the largest amount of offshore wind procured in any auction ever in Britain or indeed Europe.”

He called it “a significant step towards clean power by 2030”, adding: “The price secured in this auction is 40% lower than the alternative cost of building and operating a new gas plant. Clean, homegrown power is the right choice to bring down bills for good, and this auction will create thousands of jobs throughout Britain.”

The most successful energy company in the bidding was the German utility RWE, which secured contracts for almost 7GW of offshore wind projects out of the 8.4GW total, including its Dogger Bank South and Norfolk Vanguard windfarms. Shares in the €36bn company climbed by almost 1.5% on Wednesday morning.

SSE also won a contract for the first phase of its massive 4.1GW Berwick Bank project off the Scottish coast. The market value of the London-listed company surged in early trading before settling at 0.5% higher by midday.

Although the winning bids’ prices are higher than in previous years and above the typical price of electricity in the wholesale power market, which stands at about £81/MWh, experts say the growth of wind power in the UK energy system could still help to keep bills down because they would lower the market price by limiting the use of expensive gas plants.

The government said investing in locally generated renewable electricity would also help to reduce the UK’s exposure to volatile global fossil fuel markets, which have contributed to record high energy debts and cost inflation across the UK economy.

The success of the auction was considered crucial if the government hoped to achieve its election pledge to double onshore wind, triple solar power and quadruple offshore wind by 2030 with the aim of creating a virtually zero-carbon electricity system by the end of the decade.

However, the government will need to repeat the results of its record-breaking auction by securing another 8GW of offshore wind power at similar prices at next year’s allocation round if it hopes to meet its goal of committing to between 43GW to 50GW of offshore wind by 2030.

Andy Prendergast, the national secretary of the GMB trade union, said “the real litmus test” of the auction’s success would be “if it delivers the jobs so often promised and so often fail to materialise”.

“This is a golden opportunity to on-shore supply chains and create genuine employment opportunities across the UK. It’s imperative that we take it,” Prendergast said.

The UK government has faced criticism for accelerating its investment in offshore wind at a time when the technology faces higher costs. Supporters of the industry have argued that speedy investment is key to replacing Britain’s ageing nuclear and gas plants, about half of which are due to close before 2035.

“Investment in renewables is also crucial to keep pace with the UK’s need for more energy,” said Ana Musat, a policy director at RenewableUK. “Electricity demand is set to increase significantly in the years ahead as existing nuclear and gas capacity retires, so the 8.4GW awarded contracts today will be crucial for economic growth.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7bfcaf2e88dfadc29df99a99adb89dd45eef7b7/87_0_4606_3685/master/4606.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=93ad2a5b0d0f71cb2ae7d6b6a4a278d8",N,,2026-01-14 11:00:44.255985

A major reason for this is an extensive backlog of clean energy projects.
A report jointly published by Clean and Prosperous and the nonpartisan research firm Greenline Insights finds that more than 250 clean energy projects have stalled due to permitting and other delays.
According to the report, Washington has the right ingredients for success: a pipeline of projects, strong policies and goals, industry, and abundant resources.
“The part that now we're struggling with really exists outside the Climate Commitment Act, and outside our state's 100% clean energy law.","“I hope that after this panel, you're all comfortable saying ‘build sh**,’ knowing what we mean behind it. It’s a genuine intent,” joked Isaac Kastama, the government relations director for the nonprofit Clean and Prosperous Washington.

Kastama was wrapping up a panel discussion about a new report with a cheeky acronym: the Build Sustainable High Impact Infrastructure Together, or ""‘Build SHIIT’"" Report, at the eighth annual Carbon Policy Forum in Seattle. He was joined by the state directors of commerce and ecology, and the chair of the state council to evaluate energy facility sites.

The humor is meant to call attention to a serious issue. Despite leading the nation in climate policy, Washington has fallen far behind in renewable energy growth.

Recent reporting from ProPublica and OPB showed Washington ranking dead last among U.S. states in renewable energy growth. A major reason for this is an extensive backlog of clean energy projects.

A report jointly published by Clean and Prosperous and the nonpartisan research firm Greenline Insights finds that more than 250 clean energy projects have stalled due to permitting and other delays. It says those projects add up to $149 billion in economic activity and 580,000 jobs.

Their findings include a map showing project specifics. Tiny colored dots represent everything from large-scale solar developments to a green hydrogen biomass refinery, wind farms and pumped storage proposals scattered all over the state.

According to the report, Washington has the right ingredients for success: a pipeline of projects, strong policies and goals, industry, and abundant resources. But the state continues to miss emissions reduction goals and to fall behind others.

Speaking to KNKX after the panel discussion, Kastama said this backlog is not all negative. Rather, it's a strong indication that Washington’s climate policies are “working really well to motivate the interest” of the sector.

“The part that now we're struggling with really exists outside the Climate Commitment Act, and outside our state's 100% clean energy law. That is, how do we manage other processes to get these facilities permitted?” he said.

Kastama said they need a stronger consensus that these projects are necessary and beneficial, especially with tribes and other local governments in rural areas.

More transmission lines are needed as well. One bill Kastama is working on this session seeks to create a new state entity to examine bottlenecks and facilitate new construction of transmission lines.

Officials on the panel agreed that meeting the mandates of state climate policies is challenging.

“When you look at a lot of work that's being done now, this is the first time it's ever been done,” Commerce Director Joe Nguyen said.

Nguyen said these challenges are often extremely complex, but that leaders need to step up.

“That is what leadership looks like, and that is why Washington state is able to build sh**, is because we are not scared of doing hard things,” he said.

Nguyen estimated that in the last four months alone, the state had lost out on ""probably 15,000 jobs,"" potentially because companies that wanted to come to Washington could not get enough energy to bring their project.

“They wanted to be here. Their clients were here. The workforce was here. Everything's great here, but they couldn't get the 10, 20, 50 megawatts that they wanted to be able to build,” he said.

Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller said Gov. Bob Ferguson has given clear direction on these issues.

“We are incredibly motivated to prove that we can get things built in this state. And I think the report highlights that there's huge opportunity,” he said, adding that the state has a long history of maintaining strong environmental protections while growing the economy.

Sixkiller said the state needs to use more of a customer-service approach to permitting. And officials need to demystify what that permitting looks like.

“We need to do more to encourage people to come into a room and work together to deliver a project,” he said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/191030b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+91/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F36%2F68%2F37fae915404f8cf10814722000ac%2Fap23140144489106.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 11:00:50.889445

“Sierra Club and our partners intervened in this case to defend Oregon’s clean energy law and to ensure that customers are not stuck paying more for a dirtier, less reliable energy system,” said Rose Monahan, Senior Attorney, Sierra Club.
The court reaffirmed that the PUC regulates monopoly utilities and has broad authority to hold them accountable,” said Claire Valentine-Fossum, General Counsel, Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board.
This is a win for clean energy, regulation’s necessary role, and all Oregonians,” said Mike Goetz, Regulatory Affairs Director, Renewable Northwest.
PacifiCorp serves more than 600,000 Oregon customers and remains the state’s largest emitter of power-sector greenhouse gases.","MARION COUNTY, Ore. — Today, the Circuit Court for Marion County dismissed PacifiCorp’s appeal of the Oregon Public Utility Commission’s (PUC) determination that the utility failed to demonstrate “continual progress” toward meeting the emissions-reduction mandates of Oregon's clean energy bill, HB 2021. The law requires electric utilities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80% by 2030, 90% by 2035, and 100% by 2040.

PacifiCorp had argued in court that it could not be held accountable for failing to meet the standard because, in its view, the Commission had not clearly defined what “continual progress” required. The Court rejected that claim and sided with the PUC and environmental, clean energy, and consumer advocates—including Sierra Club, Green Energy Institute at Lewis & Clark Law School, Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, and Renewable Northwest—affirming that under any reasonable interpretation of the statute, PacifiCorp’s plan plainly failed to comply.

Advocates stressed throughout the case that PacifiCorp’s 2023 Clean Energy Plan could not show continual progress because the company:

Never forecasted meeting any of HB 2021’s emission reduction targets,

Presented a plan that included significant backsliding compared to its prior clean-energy plans, and

Offered no coherent path for returning to compliance

Advocates emphasized that the lawsuit was a transparent effort to delay implementation of HB 2021 and avoid any consequences of failing to comply with the state’s landmark clean energy law. With the appeal now dismissed, the PUC’s decision stands, and PacifiCorp must take immediate steps to align its resource planning with state law—most critically by procuring affordable clean energy resources before federal tax incentives expire this year.

“Sierra Club and our partners intervened in this case to defend Oregon’s clean energy law and to ensure that customers are not stuck paying more for a dirtier, less reliable energy system,” said Rose Monahan, Senior Attorney, Sierra Club. “The court’s decision confirms what the record made clear: PacifiCorp has been moving backward, not forward, on reducing emissions and planning for the clean energy transition required by Oregon law.”

“This is an important victory for customers. The court reaffirmed that the PUC regulates monopoly utilities and has broad authority to hold them accountable,” said Claire Valentine-Fossum, General Counsel, Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board.

“This ruling underscores that Oregon’s energy laws are not optional and that utilities must plan responsibly for a cleaner, more resilient grid—and when they fail to do so, regulators will step in to protect customers and the public interest,” said Alex Houston, Staff Attorney, Green Energy Institute at Lewis & Clark Law School.

“The Court’s decision upheld the PUC’s broad authority to implement and ensure the sanctity of Oregon’s clean energy mandates and made clear that Oregon utilities must bring forth actionable plans to comply with the law, or be held accountable. This is a win for clean energy, regulation’s necessary role, and all Oregonians,” said Mike Goetz, Regulatory Affairs Director, Renewable Northwest.

Luke Wilson, the chief policy officer of the Indiana Office of Energy Development, estimated that could direct up to $30 million annually to low-income Hoosier households.
Other suggestions included limiting implementation to just low-income customers, adding more detail on when the debt is due and pushing the effective day back from July.
Others asked that the incentives be tailored to specific utilities or said the proposed incentive range is too small to drive utility decision-making.","Ambitious electric service affordability legislation faced dozens of recommendations for improvement Tuesday — from lawmakers and lobbyists alike — across a two-hour hearing.

House Bill 1002, a House Republican priority proposal, would reshape utility providers’ low-income customer assistance programs, block service shut-offs to such customers on dangerously hot days, put all ratepayers on predictable billing plans and refashion ratemaking into three-year plans outfitted with performance-based incentives.

“The goal … is to prioritize affordability for Hoosier ratepayers and ensure our utilities are maintaining transparent, cost-effective practices,” the bill’s author, Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler, R-Noblesville, said in a statement after Tuesday’s committee meeting.

“Any potential changes to the bill will align with those goals,” she continued.

Only testimony was taken in in the House’s utilities committee on Tuesday, with amendments and a vote expected next week.

Advocates like Delaney Barber Kwon of Indiana Conservation Voters thanked Shonkwiler for her work but suggested “further clarification in order for intent to match implementation.”

The legislation would require electricity suppliers under Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission jurisdiction that don’t already offer low-income customer help programs to do so by July. The companies would fund those offerings to at least half the amount they recovered from ratepayers under their IURC-approved energy efficiency programs in the most recent year.

Luke Wilson, the chief policy officer of the Indiana Office of Energy Development, estimated that could direct up to $30 million annually to low-income Hoosier households.

“That is a cost shift that is already in bills,” he added, “so ratepayers are not feeling additional impact.”

The provision encountered mixed testimony.

Danielle McGrath, president of the Indiana Energy Association, said lawmakers shouldn’t use that funding mechanism because the revenue varies by utility and by year, while Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, said it’s “more than adequate funding.”

Committee Chair Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, noted the money has to come from somewhere, lest the bill be caught up in the finance-focused Ways and Means Committee.

Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, and others pushed for greater regulator oversight of the program requirements instead of leaving it largely up to the utilities themselves.

The legislation would require providers to notify customers of assistance programs on their websites. Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis, asked that the text also go directly on bills to better reach elderly ratepayers.

“My daughter is my parents’ IT support, so I appreciate your point,” Shonkwiler joked.

Another provision intended to ease the burden on low-income Hoosiers would mimic current policy banning winter electricity service shut-offs — from Dec. 1 to March 15 — to the summertime. A key difference, however, is the pause would be triggered by federal extreme heat warnings instead of taking effect across the hottest months of the year.

Pierce and customer advocates argued a months-based approach would be simpler to administer and benefit customers more.

“We need to be really careful (that) we just don’t pile up four months of debt on these people, and now they’re looking at trying to get reconnected, and the price is so high they can’t do it,” Soliday replied.

Debt fears also arose in detailed discussion over so-called budget billing plans, which promote predictability for customers by holding monthly bill amounts steady despite changes in usage. But when utilities settle up, shocked customers may find themselves on the hook for large sums.

“Families think they’re being on a program to help stabilize their finances, and they feel like they’re being preyed upon,” said Rep. Alex Burton, D-Evansville.

Pryor suggested a name change.

“I think part of what’s confusing the people is they hear ‘budget billing,’ and they think … there is a savings,” she said. “So, maybe, the word ‘budget’ needs to be changed to something that’s more reflective of what it really is.”

“It is confusing,” Soliday agreed. “… It doesn’t save you money. It saves you from spikes, is what it does. And some folks can endure spikes, and (for) others, it’s really painful.”

House Bill 1002 would require that every customer be put on such plans, but be given the ability to opt out. Utilities would settle up with participants at least twice a year, in an effort to avoid the sticker shock of a once-annual true-up.

Several witnesses recommended removing “at least” from the legislation to ensure true-ups don’t occur so often they erode the predictability budget billing is supposed to bring. Other suggestions included limiting implementation to just low-income customers, adding more detail on when the debt is due and pushing the effective day back from July.

Bill explores longer rate cycles, incentives

The measure would also switch up Indiana’s traditional ratemaking process by requiring utilities to pursue IURC approval of multi-year rate plans. The first year would be done “in the same manner” as now, while the second and third years would be based on projections.

Although Soliday said the intent was to make utilities file the same detailed information as is currently required, some warned the language may not be explicit enough.

Joe Rompala, representing the Indiana Industrial Energy Consumers, also testified there’s no mechanism to settle the difference between the projected data and what actually transpires.

State explores multiyear rate setting, performance incentives for utilities

“This helps ensure that customers are only paying for assets which have actually been put into service, and which are actually being used to serve them when rates go into effect,” Rompala said. “This upholds a longstanding legal principle which helps shield ratepayers from excessive investment, which generates no direct benefits to them.”

Pierce and several witnesses objected to language specifying that the multi-year rate plans operate “independently” of trackers — requiring that regulators consider them “separately.”

Trackers allow utilities to increase rates based on certain expenses they have.

Sam Carpenter, the executive director of the Hoosier Environmental Council, feared that could “undermine some of the cost-containment goals.” He asked for lawmakers to clarify the “interaction” between those mechanisms.

Soliday previously said some trackers may “disappear” if multi-year ratemaking is adopted, telling the committee, “I’ve had some (utilities) say to me, they may just drop (the Transmission, Distribution, Storage Improvement Charge) completely, because it works into the plan.”

The multi-year rate plans would be paired with new performance metrics and incentives tied to customer affordability and service restoration.

Several witnesses suggested incentivizing additional priorities, like reducing peak load demand or promoting environmental sustainability. Others asked that the incentives be tailored to specific utilities or said the proposed incentive range is too small to drive utility decision-making.

It’s unclear which chunks of the bill could get the biggest revisions.

“I appreciate everyone who testified in the committee today and expect any amendments put forth to reflect the valuable insights and feedback we continue to receive from experts, stakeholders and residential ratepayers,” Shonkwiler said.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1135812-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 11:03:11.599335

Of the approximately 60,000 Venezuelans living in the city’s metropolitan area, “at least a third have some connection to the oil industry,” Monaldi says.
“By 2016, before the sanctions, PDVSA was producing far less oil, something like 600,000 or 700,000 barrels.
It was a brutal collapse.” When the oil sanctions arrived in 2019, PDVSA was still producing 1.3 million barrels.
Last week, the Republican stated that the world’s largest oil companies had committed to rebuilding Venezuela’s oil industry.","At 53, Arturo lost the job where he had spent half his life. It was January 2003, and Hugo Chávez had begun mass layoffs at PDVSA, the Venezuelan state oil company. More than 18,000 people were left jobless overnight. Arturo, who was the executive manager of the company’s exploration unit and head of the technical team, learned about it from the press. “They fired us and took away all our benefits,” he recalls from his home in Houston, where he lives at 76. Two decades later, the same city that took him in after his dismissal is receiving the oil tankers that the United States is seizing from Venezuela. The same city that is ready to receive even more crude once — as Trump has promised — it begins to flow again in Venezuela as it did in the boom years.

The first of the ships, the Skipper, was intercepted last December while transporting 1.8 million barrels of heavy crude. It was taken to the coast of Galveston, about 50 miles from Houston, where it remains in custody. At over 300 meters in length, it cannot enter the port, so it is anchored offshore.

Since then, other vessels have been targeted by the Trump administration in its efforts to block tankers carrying sanctioned Venezuelan crude. The Centuries was intercepted on December 20 in the Caribbean. The Bella was pursued for weeks in the North Atlantic and finally captured in January, after futilely claiming Russian protection, as part of the ghost fleet evading international economic sanctions on the high seas.

Arturo, who asked that his last name be withheld, is one of nearly 20,000 Venezuelans working in Houston’s energy sector, according to Dr. Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin American Energy Program at Rice University’s Baker Institute. Of the approximately 60,000 Venezuelans living in the city’s metropolitan area, “at least a third have some connection to the oil industry,” Monaldi says. He adds that hundreds of Venezuelans work at companies like Chevron, Shell, and Exxon, “many of them in high-level positions.”

The same professionals who helped build one of the world’s most successful oil industries now work in Houston, watching as confiscated ships arrive at the same place they fled to.

This is the case of Arturo, a geological engineer who worked for PDVSA for 32 years. He recounts that his workdays were “12 to 14 hours a day, including Saturdays and Sundays.” After being laid off, he founded his own company with other professionals in the sector. It operated in countries like Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. But traveling from Venezuela became increasingly difficult. “They wouldn’t allow us to work with any company in Venezuela,” he says. That’s why, in 2008, he decided to open an office in Texas, where he emigrated with his family.

The collapse of the industry

“What destroyed the Venezuelan oil industry was the lack of strong institutional frameworks, corruption, inappropriate expropriations, and the dismissal of thousands of workers,” says Dr. Luis A. Pacheco, former executive director of corporate planning at PDVSA. “The Venezuelan hydrocarbon industry has been the victim of bad policies for two decades,” he adds.

Pacheco, 75, was also CEO of BITOR, the Orinoco Belt’s extra-heavy crude subsidiary. He is now a research fellow at the Baker Institute. Both Pacheco and Monaldi agree that U.S. sanctions were not the primary cause of the collapse. “PDVSA was producing three million barrels when Chávez came to power,” Monaldi points out. “By 2016, before the sanctions, PDVSA was producing far less oil, something like 600,000 or 700,000 barrels. It was a brutal collapse.”

When the oil sanctions arrived in 2019, PDVSA was still producing 1.3 million barrels. Today it produces around one million. “Only 300,000 barrels less than when the oil sanctions began,” explains Monaldi.

“If you look at how much Iran or Russia produce, which have also been under sanctions for a long time, you’ll see they have a powerful oil industry. That’s your best answer,” Pacheco states. According to him, to revive the Venezuelan industry, an investment of “$100 billion over 10 years would be needed to reach 3.5 million barrels per day, plus recovering part of the refining infrastructure, the petrochemical industry, carrying out environmental remediation, and restoring the necessary electricity generation capacity.”

That very figure was recently mentioned by President Trump. Last week, the Republican stated that the world’s largest oil companies had committed to rebuilding Venezuela’s oil industry. “They are going to go in. They are going to rebuild the whole oil infrastructure. They are going to spend at least $100 billion,” he said.

“It’s unrealistic in the short term to think that this money will arrive without very substantial changes to the institutional framework, without political stability, and without a political consensus on opening up the sector,” warns Monaldi. Pacheco, for his part, believes that “under the current regime, it’s not possible to achieve the necessary changes. If you ask me tomorrow if there will be a political change, it might begin, but I don’t see it happening today.”

What could happen in the short term, according to Monaldi, is what he calls “low-hanging fruit.” Chevron, which already has signed projects and its own cash flow, could increase production. Repsol “might too.” And several small Texas producers, the so-called “wildcatters,” could also invest in conventional oil fields “from which PDVSA is barely extracting any barrels.” “The sum of Chevron, Repsol, and these small projects could add a maximum of 400,000 or 500,000 barrels over the next two years,” Monaldi estimates.

Meanwhile, the major Houston oil companies are proceeding cautiously. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, both expropriated by Chávez, are demanding guarantees before returning. “We’ve had our assets seized there twice, and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes,” Exxon CEO Darren Woods said last Friday.

Chevron, for its part, is the only U.S. oil company that never left the South American nation. Following the arrest of president Nicolás Maduro, the company issued a statement supporting “a peaceful, lawful transition that promotes stability and economic recovery.”

Clear rules, security and transparency

Miguel Morales, a 59-year-old Cuban who has worked in Texas refineries for eight years, says that “the majority of oil workers are Latino. They’re mostly Mexican because of the proximity, but there are also many Cubans and Venezuelans.” Regarding the arrival of the confiscated ships, he says that “it was quite shocking, given the United States’ capacity to carry out operations of that kind and to stop fuel shipments to Cuba and other countries.”

The operations have been methodical. The Skipper was sailing toward Cuba under a false Guyanese flag when the Coast Guard intercepted it off the Venezuelan coast on December 10. Days later, they did the same with the Centuries in the Caribbean, while it was sailing under a Panamanian flag. The Bella 1, which was renamed Marinera under a Russian flag, managed to escape, but was pursued for weeks until its capture. Another vessel, the Sophia, was seized in Caribbean waters last week.

Currently, only Chevron’s ships, which have a special license from Washington, continue to operate normally.

For Venezuelans like Arturo, the situation is emotionally complex. “Seeing those ships arriving here doesn’t evoke any feelings in me,” he says. “I see it as a transition process. There hasn’t been any real change yet. Now, with Maduro’s arrest, we’ll have to see if there’s a real change in how the country is run, from a political and democratic standpoint, in the oil industry, and in other areas.”

Arturo is a member of the Venezuelan American Petroleum Association, an organization with nearly 200 members. “Its goal is to preserve knowledge, maintain professional development, and support Venezuela in rebuilding its industry,” he explains. “Those of us Venezuelans who have been abroad for many years have been preparing to return to the industry if there is a change,” Arturo adds. When asked if he would return to contribute his experience to this effort, he says he is “willing to collaborate, but I don’t see myself returning to Venezuela to work in operations.”

“There are many Venezuelan professionals who are willing and of the right age to go,” Pacheco points out. “But it depends on their age, how well-established their families are, and how attractive the financial opportunity is.”

In that sense, Monaldi believes that with the right conditions, “a good percentage would return temporarily if the opportunity is attractive.” But without conditions, “they wouldn’t even want to leave as expatriates.”

For Miguel, the situation in Venezuela is a mirror of what could happen in Cuba. “With everything that’s happening now and with the expectation of possible change, I’ve considered the idea of moving back to my country,” he says. However, he wouldn’t leave Texas permanently. “I’ll maintain both nationalities as long as possible.”

“The United States has historically bought Venezuelan oil at market price, and I don’t see why it would be any different now,” Arturo says. “It’s a business, after all. It’s not like the oil is just hanging from trees for people to come and take. Foreign companies have to invest money.” For that investment to happen, everyone agrees that “clear rules of the game, legal certainty, and transparency in the processes” are needed.

“I envision a country where there is investment from North American companies and possibly also from Asian companies,” says Arturo. “Oil is a good business as long as it is managed with clear and transparent rules.”",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/2KZMJNXAJ5ON3PP5GURYLGCMFI.jpg?auth=351001271903272247dc0fee2f25dbf58e9344e1762815bbe82abb9da4d88d9a&width=1200,N,,2026-01-14 11:02:38.029306

In a decision that “has not been taken lightly but is necessary during the current situation”, Novo’s plans have been put on pause while Volvo Cars continues its search for an external battery technology partner.

As part of its ambition to produce batteries for its electric cars in Gothenburg, Sweden, Volvo founded Novo Energy as a joint venture with European battery company Northvolt to develop sustainable battery solutions.

When Northvolt filed for bankruptcy, Volvo took on full ownership of Novo. Novo was due to begin production of battery cells at the Gothenburg facility this year, which was planned to produce up to 50GWh annually.

According to an announcement from the battery company, until a new technology partner is secured, Novo can no longer proceed with its operations as previously planned. While Volvo continues the search, all positions in Novo (a total of 75 staff) have been laid off.

The company said that it is currently not possible to share details of when battery production could start, or under what ownership structure that might happen.

When Novo was founded, it was intended to produce cells for Volvo vehicles and potentially others in the Chinese-owned Geely group (of which Volvo is a part) at the Gothenburg facility, which was pegged to created 3,000 jobs.

Despite its findings taking an overall optimistic outlook, a report by transport research and data firm NewAutomotive noted Northvolt’s insolvency as evidence of “the financial and execution risks inherent in this capital-intensive sector”.

Europe remains heavily reliant on imports in the midstream refining and precursor/anode material production, while securing reliable sources of critical raw materials such as lithium, cobalt, nickel and graphite is of the utmost importance.

While China has long had a competitive advantage in battery manufacturing for EVs and energy storage applications due to strong national supply chains, global trade tensions have seen it restrict export of some of the components critical to battery production.

Those tensions have also impacted the stationary battery energy storage market, however the technology has benefitted from huge private and government investment in Western regions as its value has been proven both economically and logistically in achieving net zero.

The quick ROI that energy storage deployment offers has seen many formerly EV-focused initiatives switch to storage.

It could be that Volvo’s difficulty recruiting a technology partner is the result of an increasingly common reluctance to invest in the EV sector, reacting to legislative backtracking on the transition away from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. All European-founded battery companies have struggled in the past few years in light of softened EV demand, competition from China and the US, and a lack of expertise in battery cell manufacturing.

Perhaps not unrelated, it may well be that many battery tech firms are otherwise occupied, or looking to be, by cell manufacturing supply deals with the storage sector, which at the moment can offer more certain long-term investment.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt452efb5f3e725f7e/blte06b480a5882d293/69677d8e10eee8d949e987ec/Volvo_Novo_Energy.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-14 07:58:20.075163

A hefty tax break for businesses included in what Republicans dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” won’t be applied to state taxes under legislation advancing in the state Senate.

Republican fiscal leaders, however, haven’t said which of the dozens of other new federal tax cuts — including the temporary deductions for workers who receive tips and overtime wages — will be extended to state taxes.

An analysis from Gov. Mike Braun’s administration estimated that total state tax breaks on businesses and individuals could top $900 million over the next two years if the Legislature were to fully conform the state tax code with the federal changes.

The Senate Tax and Fiscal Committee last week endorsed Senate Bill 212 adopting a few of the federal tax breaks.

Committee Chair Sen. Travis Holdman, however, specified that the bill would not include a federal tax cut on some production property because of its cost.

“It’s just got a hefty price tag. It was $60-some million the first year, and it grew to like $300 million over four or five years,” Holdman, R-Markle, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “So it’s just just too hefty for us to do that.”

Sam Charron, a vice president of the Indiana Manufacturers Association, argued for adoption of that tax break, saying it “incentivizes manufacturers to increase their production capacity in the U.S. and, therefore, here in the state of Indiana.”

Uncertainty on other tax breaks

Holdman said his committee would take up a separate bill next week addressing whether to conform state tax law with 37 other provisions in the federal legislation.

He said the first bill focused on federal tax changes that would take effect for the 2025 tax year, with the aim of getting that bill to Braun’s desk by the end of January. It is set for a full Senate vote on Thursday.

Holdman hasn’t specified what will be adopted from the longer list, which includes the temporary federal deductions for workers who receive tips and overtime wages along with the interest on loans for vehicles built in the U.S.

The state analysis projects that taxpayers would save nearly $275 million over the next two years with the deduction for overtime wages.

The tax break on tips would total about $80 million during that time, while the vehicle loan deduction was estimated at $70 million.

The state tax code generally conforms with federal law for the simplicity of determining taxable income.

Indiana’s last major conformity update came in 2023, when Indiana adopted the Internal Revenue Code as of Jan. 1, 2023, bringing the state into line with pandemic-era relief measures such as the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan.

Whatever tax measures the state Senate endorses will then go to the Indiana House for its consideration.

House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jeff Thompson, the chamber’s leader on tax matters, said he was in “ongoing discussions” on provisions such as the exemptions for overtime and tips income.

A planned Phase 2 expansion aims to bring total capacity to 20,000 tpa of Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (LCE).","The global push toward electrification continues to reshape international supply chains and manufacturing priorities. For executive leaders across the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing and mining sectors, the evolution of procurement strategies is a primary concern.

The industry seeks to secure the critical minerals required for battery production. A new partnership between Lilac Solutions and Traxys North America highlights this transition. The two firms have formalised a binding 10-year offtake agreement for lithium carbonate.

Produced at the Great Salt Lake facility in Utah, this move signals a significant change in how critical minerals flow through North American supply networks. Under the terms of the agreement, Traxys will buy 50,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate over a decade.

This volume represents 100% of the planned Phase 1 production capacity. The agreement uses a ""take-or-pay"" structure, which provided Lilac the financial certainty required for a Final Investment Decision (FID). For the wider EV market, it secures a reliable supply of battery-grade material.

Securing vital battery minerals

The scale of this commitment reflects growing confidence in domestic lithium production. By locking in the entire Phase 1 output, Traxys underwrites the commercial viability of the project while securing its position in a competitive market.

This is particularly relevant for EV manufacturers, which require stable mineral flows to maintain production schedules. Lilac Solutions specialises in Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technology, which offers an alternative to conventional methods.

Its proprietary Gen 5 ion exchange technology could improve supply chain speed. Reports indicate the technology delivered an 87% recovery rate during pilot operations. Unlike evaporation ponds, which can take 24 months to yield results, this process works in hours.

For supply chain managers, the speed of DLE could mean shorter lead times and more responsive production cycles. Traditional lithium extraction requires extensive infrastructure and long processing times that create bottlenecks.

Enhancing domestic manufacturing capacity

The Great Salt Lake Phase 1 facility is designed to produce 5,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) of battery-grade lithium carbonate. This facility is expected to nearly double current US production, aiding companies seeking to diversify their supplier base.

A planned Phase 2 expansion aims to bring total capacity to 20,000 tpa of Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (LCE). This growth is essential for meeting the rising demand of the automotive sector as it transitions away from internal combustion engines.

Raef Sully, CEO of Lilac Solutions, explains: ""Securing offtake for 100% of planned output moves us closer to construction of a significant new source of domestic lithium."" This project provides essential support to battery manufacturing facilities.

For EV manufacturers, the primary challenge to mass adoption has been a fragile and geographically concentrated supply chain. Domestic projects like the Great Salt Lake facility help mitigate these risks by providing a localised source of high-quality materials.

Navigating global supply requirements

In US and European markets, tax credits are frequently tied to the provenance of minerals. Sourcing minerals domestically helps manufacturers meet these requirements while reducing transportation costs and the associated carbon footprint.

The 10-year structure offers a buffer against spot market volatility. This allows for better long-term financial planning and more predictable overheads for companies involved in the production of electric vehicle batteries.

Lilac has completed FEL-3 engineering and is collaborating with Utah regulators to finalise permits. The ion exchange media will be manufactured in Fernley, Nevada, creating a domestic supply chain that benefits the regional economy directly.

This integrated approach reduces dependency on international equipment suppliers. Successful implementation of these technologies could provide a blueprint for how the global EV market manages critical mineral shortages in the future.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/757e82107998a4e66f28b72e79b5a76d:1bbbb51d6ec79bf82485a648bb8b87f1/1737221472440.jpg.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 06:59:47.948855

With more than two dozen state and local climate lawsuits against Big Oil ongoing from Maine to Hawaii—and a successful outcome for youth litigants in Montana in 2023—Republicans from President Donald Trump down to state lawmakers are scrambling to find ways to stem the tide of legal action against one of their biggest sources of financial support.

In June, Republican attorneys general in 16 states asked the Trump administration for protections from climate lawsuits. The AGs suggested modeling such policy on a 2005 law protecting gun manufacturers from litigation when their products are used in crimes. As a result, no gun company accused of negligence has ever been brought to trial. Gun control advocates have been trying to repeal the law for years.

“Big Oil is openly asking Congress for a ‘get-out-of-jail-free’ card because fossil fuel companies are desperate to avoid facing the evidence of their climate lies in court,"" Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity (CCI), said Tuesday in a statement. ""Congress must make clear that any proposal to strip Americans of their right to hold corporations accountable for the damage they cause when they lie to the public about the harms of their products will be dead on arrival.""

The CCI statement came in response to an announcement by the American Petroleum Institute—the nation's biggest oil lobby—that fighting state climate lawsuits is one of its top priorities for 2026. API has been named as a defendant in several state climate accountability and deception lawsuits.

As CCI explained earlier:

Communities across the country are paying nearly $1 trillion per year for damages from extreme heat, floods, wildfires, and rising seas and other extreme weather events that fossil fuel-driven climate change is making more intense, deadly, and destructive. Major oil and gas companies knew decades ago that their products would fuel these climate damages, but they orchestrated a Big Tobacco-style campaign of deception to mislead the public and protect their profits. More than 1 in 4 Americans now live in a state or community taking Big Oil companies to court to hold them accountable for this deception and make polluters pay for the harm they have caused.

""A legal shield for Big Oil could forever shut the courthouse doors for all Americans, forcing the rising bill for climate change onto taxpayers, and setting a harmful legal precedent that protects corporations instead of communities,"" CCI added. ""No industry should be above the law—especially one with a documented history of deceiving the public. Congress must oppose the fossil fuel industry’s lobbying efforts and keep the courthouse doors open for communities seeking accountability.""

Our sad reality is what happens when the oil industry is allowed to run rampant.
At least 75% of end-of-lease and idle oil infrastructure off the Gulf Coast is overdue for decommissioning.
When news of Trump’s plan first broke, the administration faced so much pushback from states like Florida, South Carolina and Georgia that the entire East Coast was eventually scrapped from the plan.
Why should the oil industry expand off the Gulf, California, and Alaska coasts when it can’t even clean up its mess off Louisiana?","Let’s say you hired a landscaper to work on your backyard. But they left their trash and broken tools scattered around your property and made you clean it all up. Would you hire that same company to work on your front yard?

The Trump administration would, apparently.

The administration’s proposed five-year program calls for new oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska and, for the first time in decades, off the coast of California. But the same industry that will benefit from Trump’s plan already turned the Louisiana coast into a dumping ground, leaving infrastructure behind to decay and pollute our waters.

We can’t afford more of this. Much of Louisiana’s marine ecosystem has already been sacrificed for profit, and Trump’s plan would be devastating for the Gulf’s remaining manatees, sea turtles, gulf sturgeon and Rice’s whale — one of the world’s most endangered baleen whales, with an estimated population of just 51 animals.

Our sad reality is what happens when the oil industry is allowed to run rampant. It should be a cautionary tale for other states.

There are currently more idle wells than producing wells in the Gulf of Mexico. At least 75% of end-of-lease and idle oil infrastructure off the Gulf Coast is overdue for decommissioning. Hundreds of these wells have sat idle for more than a decade, some far longer. These wells have proven to be dangerous, leaking oil into the water and spewing methane into the atmosphere. In April, Well 59 — an 82-year-old idle well — broke loose and spewed tens of thousands of gallons of pollutants into Louisiana state waters and wetlands.

For decades, operators have also avoided their cleanup obligations, selling off their low-producing wells to smaller companies, leaving their infrastructure to sit idle for some purported future use, or going bankrupt and deserting their platforms. Even though many of these companies raked in enormous profits while their wells were active, their attempts to evade cleanup obligations lead to persistent safety and environmental hazards.

This is California and Alaska’s future if Trump’s five-year plan moves forward. Louisiana can serve as their crystal ball, and the plan deepens the decommissioning crisis in the Gulf.

Long after operators pack up and leave, the underwater world off our coasts will be permanently scarred by rusting platforms and unplugged wells that leak harmful gases and toxins. The fishing industry that helps drive the Gulf Coast and Alaska’s economy could be in peril; so will California’s robust tourism industry and iconic beaches.

This danger is not lost on most coastal politicians, regardless of political party. When news of Trump’s plan first broke, the administration faced so much pushback from states like Florida, South Carolina and Georgia that the entire East Coast was eventually scrapped from the plan. Several top Florida politicians, all Republican, are still working to stop the expansion in the Gulf of Mexico, worried more drilling will harm the state’s tourism industry.

Why should the oil industry expand off the Gulf, California, and Alaska coasts when it can’t even clean up its mess off Louisiana? Once these wells are no longer profitable, the industry will follow its trusted playbook — pack up the equipment that still works and leave the rusting remnants behind for us to deal with.

These companies should be paying to clean up the disaster they created in Louisiana. Instead, they’re bidding on the next marine environment to pollute.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-85/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/main-pass-oil-spill-2023-1024x7461768409637.jpg?h=bc62b519&itok=IbIMseaO,N,,2026-01-14 12:01:40.641105

Aging water systems leak trillions of gallons, leaving residents in some of the country’s poorest communities with a substantial financial burden to fix them.
The report highlights technology like rainwater harvesting and gray water reuse systems that can decrease water demand and increase resilience to drought.
In the Navajo Nation, hundreds of solar-powered home water systems have brought running water to more than 2,000 people.
“Water is a basic human right,” said Tome, whose encounter with the elderly woman inspired her to pursue a doctorate in water resources.","“How can we be living in the United States of America … one of the most powerful countries in the world, and people are living like this here?” asked Tome, a citizen who grew up in the community of Ganado, Arizona, in the nation’s largest Native American reservation at 27,000 square miles in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.

A report published in March identifies ways historically neglected communities most vulnerable to climate change, like Tome’s, can create resilient water and wastewater systems. Its highlights include nature-based solutions, tailoring approaches to each community and using technology — all the while recognizing barriers to implementing them.

“What we hope to do with this report, what I hope, is that it actually gives people hope,” said Shannon McNeeley, a report author and senior researcher with the Pacific Institute, which published the report with DigDeep and the Center for Water Security and Cooperation. “In spite of some of the major federal funding sources becoming uncertain and possibly not available, I think people will find other ways.”

CLIMATE IMPACTS AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

Weather extremes made worse by climate change have disrupted people’s access to water. In September, more than 100,000 residents in western North Carolina were under boil-water notices for nearly two months after Hurricane Helene destroyed much of a local water system.

In January, several water providers declared their drinking water unsafe after wildfires roared through Los Angeles. One utility in Pasadena, California, sent out its first notice since it began serving water more than a century ago.

Aging water systems leak trillions of gallons, leaving residents in some of the country’s poorest communities with a substantial financial burden to fix them.

An estimated 30% of the population in the Navajo Nation lives in homes that don’t have running water, and many residents drive long distances to get water from public spigots, according to the Navajo Nation Department of Water Resources and the Natural Resources Defense Council.

The report also notes that some federal resources and funding have become unavailable since Donald Trump returned to the White House. The Trump administration has cut or paused funding for critical water infrastructure projects, touted a reversal of diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and eliminated environmental justice policies meant to protect the communities the report centers on.

Greg Pierce, director of the Human Right to Water Solutions Lab at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the report “comes at a very depressing moment where we’re not going to see federal action in this space, it doesn’t seem, for the next four years.”

SOLUTIONS COME WITH CHALLENGES

The report synthesizes existing literature about water, climate change and solutions. Its authors reviewed academic studies, government and private reports and interviewed experts to identify ways low-income and communities of color can build water and wastewater systems to withstand extreme weather.

The report highlights technology like rainwater harvesting and gray water reuse systems that can decrease water demand and increase resilience to drought. But it adds that implementing and maintaining technology like it can be too expensive for poorer communities.

The report also advocates nature-based solutions such as wetlands, which studies find can reduce the length and severity of droughts, provide flood control, reduce or remove pollutants in water and protect water supplies. Communities across the country are increasingly recognizing the benefits of wetlands. In Florida’s Everglades, for example, officials have spent billions of dollars to build engineered wetlands that clean and protect a vital drinking water source.

The report argues for government-funded water assistance programs to help poorer households pay water and sewer bills, like the Low Income Household Water Assistance Program launched during the COVID-19 pandemic.

BUT SOME ARE BENEFITING COMMUNITIES

Gregory Moller, a professor in the soil and water systems department at the University of Idaho, notes that some approaches are too complex and expensive for smaller or poorer communities. “Our innovations also have to be on a scale and stage that is adaptable to small systems,” he said. “And that’s where I think some of the most serious challenges are.”

Some solutions the report highlights are benefiting communities. In the Navajo Nation, hundreds of solar-powered home water systems have brought running water to more than 2,000 people. Kimberly Lemme, an executive director at DigDeep, which is installing the systems, said it can be a complex and lengthy process. But it shows that solutions do exist.

The facility will include the Project Jade data center campus built by AI infrastructure company Crusoe and the BFC Power and Cheyenne Power Hub built next door by Tallgrass Energy Partners to provide it with electricity. BFC Power and Cheyenne Power Hub will provide on-site power from natural gas turbines. Matt Field, chief real estate officer for Crusoe, told the Laramie County commissioners during last week’s hearing that the first phase of the project will leverage natural gas with a potential pathway for CO2 sequestration in the future.

Crusoe and Tallgrass announced in July that the center’s close proximity to Tallgrass’ existing CO2 sequestration hub will “provide long-term carbon capture solutions” for the gas turbines powering the data center. “Future renewable energy developments” touted by the companies in their joint statement could include solar power to augment the gas turbines in later stages of the project, according to Wyoming Energy Authority.

The companies have yet to announce the specific tech firms to benefit from the Jade data center, but the project is expected to meet the extreme power and infrastructure demands of hyperscale cloud providers and AI industry leaders, said Crusoe spokesperson Andrew Schmitt.

Both of the interconnected projects are now proceeding to the construction phase in the Switch Grass Industrial Park area, located 8 miles south of Cheyenne. With the site plans approved by the county, Crusoe and Tallgrass energy expect construction to be completed on the first buildings in 2027.

Prior to the final vote, the Hyndman Homesites Homeowners Association, which represents a community adjacent to the project, wrote a letter to the county commissioners requesting that the site plan adhere to certain considerations. The letter details residents’ concerns with deep wells drilled into the aquifer, increased traffic and noise, light pollution, gas turbine emissions, noxious odors and the location of wastewater ponds. Additionally, the letter urged the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to ensure compliance with requirements to minimize the impacts to wildlife migration routes and sensitive habitat inside the project area.

The Associated Press reported that electricity needed to power the first phase of the center is predicted to double the entire state of Wyoming’s current energy generation. Compared to a report listing the 15 largest data centers in the world by the information technology provider Brightlio, the Jade Project could set a global record in energy use by a single center if the planned expansion reaches 10 gigawatts. Jones Lang LaSalle’s 2026 Global Data Center Outlook projects total global data center energy capacity to rise from 103 gigawatts to about 200 gigawatts by 2030.

“Building an American AI factory that can scale to 10 gigawatts of capacity illustrates Crusoe’s commitment to delivering infrastructure at the scale needed for the U.S. to win the global AI race,” Crusoe co-founder and CEO Chase Lochmiller stated in a July press release announcing the project.

Jumping Into the AI Race

Wyoming developers and state officials have touted the projected benefits of becoming a hub for AI and high-performance computing, which they say will include job creation, economic diversification, increased tax revenue and demand for natural gas and renewable energy. The project’s construction phase is expected to employ approximately 5,000 workers at its peak, per the site plan. Field said the data center will have approximately 400 permanent jobs, ranging from janitorial positions to engineers.

“Wyoming is pro-business and pro-growth,” U.S. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) said in a press release. “Our commitment to innovation and investment is what makes our state great. New, state-of-the-art data centers like this will bring high-paying jobs and a skilled workforce to southeast Wyoming.”

The state is also looking to nuclear energy to meet the increasing demands of the AI industry. TerraPower, the advanced nuclear reactor company founded by Bill Gates, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced Friday that Cheyenne is one of the sites being considered for a dual-unit Natrium power plant that could be completed as soon as 2032 to fuel the Meta AI data center already under construction there. TerraPower is building the world’s first Natrium reactor in Kemmerer, Wyoming.

The proposals for AI are exciting for the state’s fossil fuel industry as well.

In a statement last year when the Jade data center was announced, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon wrote that the news was exciting for “Wyoming and for Wyoming natural gas producers.” Gordon had previously called Wyoming an optimal location for AI expansion, partly due to its energy infrastructure and cooler climate.

Wyoming Energy Authority Executive Director Rob Creager told Inside Climate News that the state needs to keep up with the world’s growing demand for AI. Creager said that the AI platform ChatGPT will eventually become as mainstream as a Google search.

“I’ve heard it as an arms race before,” Creager said. “We can’t lose track of the fact that we’re in a competition with folk in China. It is really crucial to national security that we lead on AI and that we have those technologies.”

But Johanna Fornberg, a senior researcher at Greenpeace USA, has urged local and state governments to rein in huge AI investments. Legislators should instead focus on what directly benefits people’s lives, such as transitioning to renewable energy, Fornberg said.

“The industry has been using a lot of these big hypothetical promises about the benefits of AI,” Fornberg said. “They’re selling it for healthcare and curing cancer, accelerating climate action, improving well-being, even in your day-to-day life and in your job. And that’s all sort of a tactic to create demand and support for the data center buildout that’s happening.”

Fornberg noted that the Crusoe and Tallgrass project, which will use “an unprecedented amount of power in a relatively short amount of time,” is an example of charging ahead without fully investigating the potential risks involved.

“This data center, at 10 gigawatts, is huge,” Fornberg said. “I mean, a large nuclear power plant provides about 1 gigawatt of energy. So, at the top end, we’re talking about the same energy output as 10 big nuclear power plants, which is a lot.”

AI’s Opportunities and Challenges for Wyoming Energy

Wyoming’s energy resources position the state to capitalize on AI, Creager said.

“Everybody knows that there is plenty sitting in the ground that can help fuel this,” Creager said, noting that Crusoe’s plan to augment its electricity supply with solar should bring down the demand for gas. “I think it’s doable. I think as we do this … we’ll figure out how to do it more efficiently.”

Some AI data centers, including Microsoft’s facility in Cheyenne, power their servers with a mix of fossil fuels and renewable energy, and learning how to power and manage data centers efficiently is a work in progress, Creager said.

Neither Crusoe nor Tallgrass made representatives available for comment, but Crusoe’s website stated that the center would source energy from natural gas rigs outfitted with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology to limit their emissions of climate-warming gases.

But Fornberg believes using CCS for data center energy generation is counterproductive.

“Carbon capture is sort of one of these techno solutions that is very energy intensive, expensive and often just increases net emissions and pollution overall,” she said. “Especially when compared to just replacing those energy sources with clean energy sources. It’s a way that we are really providing a longer lifespan for existing fossil fuel infrastructure. And in some cases, even justifying new fossil fuels.”

An August analysis from Goldman Sachs Research forecasts that about 60 percent of the increasing electricity demands from U.S. data centers will be met by burning fossil fuels, increasing carbon emissions through 2030 by approximately 220 million tons. Those increased emissions could also impact human health, Fornberg added.

“Part of the nature of working with gas as an energy source is that you have these leaks and in some cases, intentional flares or releases of gas,” Fornberg said. “That is a major climate impact but can also cause well-documented health impacts for the communities that live locally to those gas generation facilities.”

Crusoe and Tallgrass have yet to state the amount of solar power that will be paired with natural gas or at what stage in the project solar power would be included in the energy mix.

Thirsty Technology in a Water-Stressed State

A single data center’s cooling towers can consume millions of gallons of water annually to prevent the computing infrastructure from overheating, according to Veolia Water Technologies & Solutions, which is particularly problematic for a facility as large as Project Jade in an arid state like Wyoming.

To reduce that demand, Crusoe announced plans in its 2024 Impact Report to combat significant water loss at its data centers by implementing closed-loop cooling systems that recycle treated water and treatment fluids.

Still, there are always system losses, said Jonathan Brant, a University of Wyoming environmental engineering professor.

“Even if it’s a quote-unquote closed loop, you’re going to have losses because of the nature of heat exchange,” Brant said. “Those computers generate an incredible amount of heat.”

To remove the most heat from computers, water must transform from a liquid into a vapor, Brant explained, and a portion of that evaporates, much like the billowing clouds that rise from the cooling towers at power plants. How much new freshwater will be needed to replace what evaporates from the cooling system is a critical question, he said.

“It’s scary when you think about the power and the water that’s going to be consumed by these facilities,” Brant said. “That’s why they keep it secret.”

Many AI centers in Wyoming tap into brackish or alkaline groundwater, as opposed to using freshwater, Brant said, but even if the cooling water is sourced from an aquifer with water too low quality for other uses, it could potentially impact a connected aquifer with a potable supply, so industry engineers must study how aquifers are connected before tapping into them. And safely disposing of increasingly salty water after it has undergone many cycles of heat exchange also poses a challenge, Brant said.

“Some say they’re going to reinject it, like they do in the oil and gas field,” Brant said. “That may work. But if that’s not something that can be done, are they just going to use surface impoundments? Evaporation ponds can be an environmental hazard just like they are in the gas sector.”

If waste water is expelled during the cooling process, it could be contaminated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals. PFAS are used to prevent the corrosion of AI electronics, which would pose other health concerns, Fornberg cautioned. Studies have linked long-term exposure to even low levels of some PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals” for their persistence in the environment, with serious health problems, including cancer and damage to reproductive and immune systems.

A Lack of Regulation

During the hearing to review the Jade project’s site plan, several Laramie County residents voiced concerns with lack of water regulations.

The plan states that engineers plan to drill deep wells underneath the shale and sandstone Lance Formation to access industrial water beneath the Ogallala Aquifer’s potable water. But Randy Fox, president of Hyndman Homesites Homeowners Association, questioned whether the geologic survey of the region that will guide the drilling of the wells adequately maps the varying size and depth of the aquifer to protect the drinking-water supply.

“You don’t know until you punch a hole in it what you’re dealing with,” Fox said. “Does the state have the data to support drilling deep wells into the Lance Formation without compromising the Ogallala Formation’s [drinking water] above it?”

Resident Thomas White, who lives near the site of the Jade data center, is also concerned about water contamination.

“They say that they’re going to drill deeper,” White said. “What happens when they punch a hole and there’s leaks that contaminate the aquifer? How much water will they be taking out of the ground? We have to take that into consideration.”

In November, the Wyoming Outdoor Council released a white paper about data center policy in Wyoming that recommends regulations for permitting, site selection and community assistance.

Among them: mandating public energy and water use reporting “to allow regulators and communities to assess impacts of data centers and track progress toward efficiency or sustainability goals.” The report pointed to Illinois’ Data Center Energy and Water Reporting Act as a regulatory guide.

Wyoming has yet to establish laws to track the environmental and economic impacts of AI centers, and state legislators are not expected to discuss the growth of the industry during the upcoming budget session in February.

In December, Greenpeace USA, along with over 230 environmental groups, signed an open letter to Congress demanding a national moratorium on new data-center construction until regulations address environmental and economic concerns. State and local governments, which negotiate deals with data developers, need comprehensive rules, Fornberg said—protecting consumers from utility rate hikes, requiring renewable energy and more.

“There has to be strong regulations in place in order for these companies to do the right thing,” Fornberg said. “I think the issue is not whether or not we should value innovation, it’s how we are valuing innovation.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Cruso-_Abilene-Data-Center-1024x682.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 07:00:03.150161

This note explains the methodology behind these indicators.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) made methodological improvements to many economic statistics in Blue Book 2025, leading to upwards revisions to business investment, GVA, and productivity metrics.

Estimating quarterly economic indicators for the IS-8

This section outlines the approach for business investment, GVA, employment, and productivity.

Mapping the Industrial Strategy growth-driving sectors (IS-8)

The IS-8 cannot be precisely mapped and measured using official statistics. The ONS economic data is based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system, which does not always align with or capture the full detail of ‘frontier industries’ (subsectors, for example, artificial intelligence) within the IS-8. As a result, coverage varies across sectors.

The SIC system is hierarchical, ranging from broad sections to detailed 5-digit subclasses. To improve accuracy, we map IS-8 sectors using 4-digit SIC codes wherever possible, as higher-level SIC categories are too broad. This approach allows us to extract more precise economic metrics for each sector.

Table 1 summarises how well each IS-8 sector is represented by the SIC framework. View SIC definitions for the IS-8.

Table 1: SIC-based definition coverage across the IS-8

Advanced Manufacturing Clean Energy Industries Creative Industries Defence Digital and Technologies Life Sciences Financial Services Professional and Business Services Proxy SIC-based definition Not easily represented by SIC, with no coverage Well defined by SIC Not easily represented by SIC, with partial coverage Proxy SIC-based definition Not easily represented by SIC, with partial coverage Well defined by SIC Well defined by SIC

Clean Energy Industries cannot be proxied at all under the SIC system so is not captured in the business investment, GVA, employment, or productivity metrics. Defence and Life Sciences only have partial coverage.

Thus, overall IS-8 estimates for the economic indicators will not fully reflect all 8 sectors. Estimates are at the IS-8 sector rather than the frontier industry level for all frontier industries outlined in the Industrial Strategy.

The IS-8 sectors are not mutually exclusive, businesses can belong to more than one IS-8 sector. Therefore, we use a unique list of SIC codes rather than summing the totals for each sector.

Data sources and methodology

We use a combination of official datasets and estimation techniques, depending on how well each sector aligns with the SIC system.

1. Direct use of official data

For sectors such as Financial Services and Professional and Business Services, which can be directly mapped at the 2-digit SIC level, figures are taken directly from official data.

2. Apportionment for other sectors

For other sectors, it is necessary to produce estimates for lower-level SIC breakdowns than are published in timelier official data.

We apply apportionment fractions to the latest 2-digit SIC data to estimate data for low-level SIC industries. This approach combines 2 objectives:

timeliness – using the most up-to-date data available ensuring consistency with quarterly national accounts data

granularity – ensuring data reflects detailed sector structures

These fractions are derived from the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) and Annual Business Survey (ABS), both of which provide granular SIC-level data. While the IDBR is timelier, it does not cover GVA or investment. For these measures, the ABS is used as it collects comprehensive sector-level financial information.

All apportioned values use the same price deflator as the 2-digit SIC level.

3. Data sources by metric

Table 2 summarises the main data sources for each economic metric.

Table 2: Data underpinning each economic metric

Metric Industrial Strategy growth-driving sectors Business investment • ONS datasets on investment by industry (data is assembled from several published ONS spreadsheets on investment: Industry-level data taken from ONS Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) by Industry and Asset (released 22 December 2025), Volume Index Capital Services (VICS) (released 7 November 2025) Supply and Use tables (released 31 October 2025), Business investment by industry and asset (released 22 December 2025)

• apportioned using the Annual Business Survey GVA • ONS GDP low-level aggregates (released 22 December 2025)

• apportioned using the Annual Business Survey Employment • payrolled employees from HMRC’s Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Real Time Information (RTI) data (released 16 December 2025). Monthly figures are averaged to produce quarterly data

• apportioned using the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR), breakdowns taken by Department for Business and Trade (DBT) from the IDBR dataset Productivity (output per job) • ONS GDP low-level aggregates (released 22 December 2025) divided by ONS productivity jobs figures (released 13 November 2025)

• apportioned using the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR), breakdowns taken by DBT from the IDBR dataset

We use 2023 prices for GVA, business investment, and output per worker, consistent with the national accounts.

These metrics will be updated in future quarters to incorporate historic actuals and revised sector mixes when more accurate or recent data is published by ONS. Each new quarterly update supersedes all previous figures, so users should always refer to the latest release.

Approach for exports

Official ONS and HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) trade data is not readily available at the IS-8 sector level, so a bespoke IS-8 trade definition has been created. This can be found in the accompanying exports definition list

Services exports are classified using the Extended Balance of Payments Classification (EBOPS) system, and goods exports using Harmonised System (HS) codes. Individual IS-8 sectors can export both goods and services – for example, Digital and Technology exports both use semi-conductors (goods) and cyber-security (service).

Estimates of trade in services and trade in goods are presented as separate values because they are not comparable on any basis so should not be added together. They use different data sources and different classification systems, and measure different concepts of trade.

The IS-8 sectors do not fully align with these classification systems (tables 3 and 4 for coverage). EBOPS uses broad categories making it difficult to isolate specific IS-8 components, while HS codes classify products, rather than industries or technologies, which limits coverage of emerging sectors.

For example, Clean Energy Industries exports are likely underestimated when using an HS-based approach compared to the ONS Low Carbon and Renewable Energy Economy survey (LCREE) as HS code inputs do not cover the entire sector. However, the latest ONS LCREE exports data is for 2023 so cannot be used to track Clean Energy exports in the quarterly update.

An HS-based approach for Defence differs from the UK Defence Export Statistics publication, which relies on an annual survey of defence orders won by known UK companies operating in the sector. The latest available data is for 2023, so it cannot be used to track Defence exports in the quarterly update.

An EBOPS-based approach for Creative Industries differs from the Department for Culture, Media, and Sports’ Trade in Services Economic Estimates publication, which is classified by the business involved in the trade and not the type of service provided. The latest available data is for 2023, so it cannot be used to track Creative Industries exports in the quarterly update.

The EBOPS and HS IS-8 mapping is subject to change as further analysis is undertaken.

Services and goods definitions for the IS-8 can be found in the accompanying exports definition list.

ONS Trade in Services is used to measure services exports. The data was extracted from UK Trade in Services: service type by partner country, non-seasonally adjusted Q2 2025 released by the ONS in October 2025 for the period of Q1 2024 to Q2 2025.

Services export data is collected via a survey and measures the value of transactions of UK businesses by industry. The data is calculated on the ‘change of ownership’ principle of trade, meaning trade is recorded when ownership of the service transfers between UK and non-UK entities.

HMRC Trade in Goods data is used to measure goods exports. The data was extracted from the Overseas Trade Data table from January 2024 to September 2025 for all exports; this was the November 2025 release. HMRC trade in goods data is based on a ‘cross-border’ or ‘physical movement’ principle where goods entering and leaving an economic territory are recorded as imports and exports respectively.

Approach for new large ‘home-grown’ businesses

For a business to be included as part of the metric, it must satisfy all of the following criteria:

the company must be founded in the UK – it originated in the UK and is not a subsidiary or branch of a foreign firm

it is headquartered in the UK, meaning it is incorporated in the UK and registered with Companies House

there is no foreign parent company – it is not majority owned or controlled by a foreign entity

the company has a significant economic footprint in the UK – this means a significant proportion of its workforce, operations, or supply chain is based in the UK

the company must have a valuation benchmark of over £10 billion

To ascertain a valuation benchmark of £10 billion, market capitalisation and post-money valuations will be used. These measures will capture both listed and private companies in the UK. Data is collected from Companies House and the Stock Market to calculate company valuations.

Based on the definition, as of 16 December 2025, there are currently 27 businesses in scope. This number represents a baseline of existing businesses, rather than exclusively new large firms. The number is subject to revision as further analysis is undertaken.

Major new investments made in IS-8 sectors

The quarterly update summarises the major investments in the IS-8 between October and December 2025 and their related job numbers. These are listed in the accompanying investment totals spreadsheet. We have recorded investment projects where government has been involved in the process or where they stem from policy decisions made as part of the Industrial Strategy.

The figures represent the nominal value over the lifetime of each investment and reflect the position at the point of announcement, rather than when the investment occurs or jobs are created. Therefore, they do not represent completed investment to date. The data is not subsequently updated or tracked in the table, so the actual amount invested may change after the original announcement.

Where announcements are updates from commitments made in previous quarters, we record only the net increase and exclude the previously committed value.

Major new export announcements in IS-8 sectors

The quarterly update summarises major export announcements relating to the IS-8 between October and December 2025 and their related jobs numbers, as listed in the accompanying export totals spreadsheet.

These figures reflect the nominal value of trade deals, export deals, contracts, sales, or other agreements that have resulted from support provided by UK government. This is separate from DBT’s reporting on export wins, which only refers to support provided by DBT only and is compiled via internal reporting rather than public announcements.

As with investment announcements, figures reflect the position at the point of announcement and are not subsequently updated or tracked. The amount of money that materialises in the economy may change after the original announcement.

Electric vehicle (EV) sales globally reached 20.7 million last year, up 20%, hitting record high, London based research firm Benchmark announced on Wednesday.

EV sales totaled 12.9 million units in China, up 17%, 4.3 million in Europe, up 33%, 1.8 million in North America, down 4%, and 1.7 million in the rest of the world, up 48%.

20.7 million units, globally, were sold in the passenger car and light-duty vehicle segment, Benchmark's press release read.

In Europe, the EV market grew by 33%, with 31% growth coming from Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and 38% from Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) over the same period.

The press release recalled that the European electric vehicle market was marked by a year of legislative change, as EU tailpipe emissions targets were softened throughout the year.

Over 2025, EV sales accelerated in several major markets; large-volume countries such as Germany and the UK grew by 48% and 27%, respectively.

It said: ""2025 was a turbulent year for the North American EV market. In the US, the elimination of federal tax credits on 30 September 2025, alongside the reduction of

CAFE standards fines to zero and the introduction of protectionist policies aimed at onshoring vehicle production and supply chains, significantly weakened market

momentum.

""As a result, US EV sales grew by just 1% in 2025. Amid these changes, the Canadian market performed poorly following the removal of subsidies early in 2025, causing EV sales to fall by 41% over the year.""

In contrast, EV sales in Mexico grew by 29%, with the majority of this growth driven by imports of Chinese EVs.

In China, the EV market grew by 17% in 2025 compared with 2024, with BEVs increasing by 26% and PHEVs by 6% over the same period.

Year‑on‑year growth slowed markedly in the final quarter of 2025, reaching just 4% compared with the last quarter of 2024.

In contrast, EV sales in the first half of 2025 grew by 33% year on year.

In the rest of the world, a significant number of regions had a strong presence of Chinese EV imports, including Southeast Asia that almost doubled year-on-year and in the final three months of the 2025 average over 55,000 EVs sold per month compared with an average of 32,000 per month in the final three months of 2024.",https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2026/01/14/thumbs_b_c_8f552fbdd0e518c0ed86ee321400b0d1.jpg?v=115652,N,,2026-01-14 07:58:26.830746

This milestone certification follows a detailed review by a panel of independent experts confirming the physics and engineering basis of the Helios design, and its feasibility to put fusion energy on the grid

KEARNY, N.J., Jan. 13, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Thea Energy, Inc., a fusion technology company advancing the stellarator for the commercialization of a carbon-free and abundant source of energy, today announced the certification of its preconceptual “Helios” pilot plant design by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) following a detailed review by a panel of independent fusion experts. This preconceptual design review marks the completion of the final major milestone in the DOE’s Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program (“the Milestone Program”) and Thea Energy is the first awardee company to receive certification of its pilot plant design.

The Milestone Program launched with $46 million in funding across eight private fusion companies to support progress on the path to commercial power plants. Modeled after the NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program, essential in launching the private space industry, the Milestone Program supports companies focused on grid-scale power through non-dilutive capital and external validation, where funds are only paid when key milestones that de-risk fusion technologies are completed and approved by a review panel.

The U.S. DOE approved completion of the Helios preconceptual design following a detailed report review by independent experts from national laboratories, research institutions, and universities focused on fusion. Members of the DOE review team visited Thea Energy’s headquarters in Kearny, NJ as part of the certification. Reviewers focused on comprehensively validating that the Company has a system architecture and a robust path towards deploying a fusion power plant. Other disclosed milestones completed by Thea Energy since selection in 2023 include successful performance of the world’s first superconducting planar coil magnet array and the down selection to a family of stellarator plasma configurations.

“This final design milestone, now certified by the DOE, substantiates the validity of the planar coil stellarator and shows a clear pathway to a deployable power plant,” said Brian Berzin, co-founder and chief executive officer of Thea Energy. “Practicality, conservatism, and engineering margins are emphasized in Helios, and the DOE has recognized those differentiators in this design. The Helios preconceptual design reflects decades of specialized expertise, now vetted and confirmed by fusion leaders and foremost technical authorities. This significant approval allows us to definitively communicate confidence in this design to the interested power offtakers and hyperscalers that we are in conversations with. Working with the DOE across this milestone, and eight prior, ensured team Thea approached each cornerstone with rigor, scrutiny, and thoroughness. Now is the time to prioritize fusion and the teams driving meaningful progress, and we strongly support the expansion of the Milestone Program to align with the industry’s commercialization goals.”

“Overview of the Helios Design: A Practical Planar Coil Stellarator Fusion Power Plant” outlines how the Helios preconceptual design meets all requirements for a commercial fusion plant while detailing several world’s firsts for fusion: a system that combines software-controlled magnet coils that are adaptable to real-world conditions; a stellarator ‘divertor’ exhaust system capable of fusion power operations; and a stellarator sector-based maintenance scheme enabling long-term plant viability. This preprint is available on the Company’s website under “Presentations & Publications” and via arXiv. This paper was submitted to a peer-reviewed journal alongside additional manuscripts on specific system components further detailed in the Milestone Program report to the DOE.

Jean Paul Allain, Ph.D., associate director for fusion energy sciences in the DOE Office of Science, added, “The inaugural period of the Milestone Program’s goal is to see companies demonstrate critical underlying technologies while on the path to a preconceptual fusion pilot plant design. Thea Energy tackled key milestones swiftly and enthusiastically leading to this in-depth design for a modernized stellarator system – summarized in a 200-page report to the DOE. The Milestone Program mandates a heightened level of accountability from awardees and we look forward to seeing Thea Energy’s continued momentum.”

Felix Parra-Diaz, Ph.D., head of the theory department at the U.S. DOE’s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) and professor of astrophysical science at Princeton University, added, “As a member of the expert review committee, I had the chance to dive deep into Thea Energy’s Helios plant and verify that the Company had executed on this design with a remarkable degree of technical detail and high standards. Helios represents a new era for the stellarator where this magnet array and plant design pushes fusion towards a commercial format. I look forward to seeing the Company continue to work towards building a fusion power plant.”

Thea Energy is on track to operate Helios in the 2030s following “Eos”, its large-scale demonstration system which will create power-plant-relevant, steady-state fusion. Eos will directly benefit from the breakthroughs highlighted in the Company’s Helios design and is scheduled to be online by 2030. Thea Energy is currently in conversations with five states for the siting of Eos and expects to select and announce a location for the integrated system in 2026.

France actually built numerous nuclear power plants slightly faster because it had picked a standardized pressurized water reactor design and built it over and over.
""Delays to nuclear power stations are bureaucratic and managerial,"" he writes, and ""it's not beyond our wit to make them cheaper by building them faster.""","Nuclear power construction projects in England and France, years late and billions over budget, reached milestones in recent weeks. In January, a project in Somerset, U.K. took delivery of its second reactor. In December the other project, in Normandy, France, powered up fully for the first time.

Instead of being examples of a bad trend, a prominent British supporter of atomic energy says, those projects are outliers and nuclear power developers and contractors are building new power plants faster than in the 1970s and 1980s.

""We're actually faster now,"" writes Tim Gregory, a nuclear chemist and author of ""Going Nuclear: How Atomic Energy Will Change the World"" (Pegasus Books, 2025).

The French state-controlled utility, Electricité de France (EdF), is developing both the English and French projects as European pressurized water-type power plants.

The completion of the U.K. project, Hinkley Point C, will likely stretch from an estimated seven years to 12 to complete, Gregory writes.

The first reactor arrived in 2023 and is already installed and welded in place, EdF reported. Work is proceeding faster on this later phase of work due to experience with the first reactor, the company wrote.

In Feb. 2024, following recent news of additional delays and cost hikes on the 3,260-MW power plant, EdF forecast completion to between 2029 and 2031, with costs rising to a range of $39 to 43 billion. The previous completion target set in May 2022 was June 2027.

At the Normandy project, EdF announced that it had reached full power in a test before operation of its EPR reactor, called Flamanville-3.

The ramp-up followed the approval by the French nuclear safety and radiation protection authority to go beyond the 80% power threshold, EdF stated. The plant was scheduled to be connected to the grid Dec. 30, EdF told NucNet.

Gregory notes in his book that the project will be finished at a cost many times what was first estimated in 2004.

Nuclear power's role as a carbon-free source of energy is likely to grow, he writes, but cost and schedule woes have plagued many recent projects.

Hinkley Point C and Flamanville-3 ""are outliers,"" argues Gregory, and ""we're actually faster now than we were in the 1970s and 1980s.""

Citing an International Atomic Energy Agency report from 2024, Gregory writes that Europe in those decades built nuclear power plants at a median time of 7 years and 2 months. France actually built numerous nuclear power plants slightly faster because it had picked a standardized pressurized water reactor design and built it over and over.

Slower Post-Chernobyl Build Times a Localized Issue

But since the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine, Europe's median build time reached 13 years as the continent ""forgot how to build quickly,"" Gregory writes.

China, he says, has built 51 nuclear reactors since 1990, with a median build time of under six years. South Korea, too, has built 27 nuclear reactors since the 1970s. Although that country's three newest reactors took more than eight years to build, South Korea built 27 nuclear reactors since the 1970s in a ""decade-on-decade"" build time of under six years, says Gregory.

Cutting construction time will lead to savings, Gregory states. ""Delays to nuclear power stations are bureaucratic and managerial,"" he writes, and ""it's not beyond our wit to make them cheaper by building them faster.""

While nuclear reactors are built on time and budget in some parts of the world, says Gregory, ""We need the motivation to do it again in Europe and the USA.""",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2026/01/13/Hinkley-Point-C-nuclear-project.jpg?height=635&t=1768330060&width=1200,N,,2026-01-14 06:59:59.909442

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

Radical policy shifts, including U.S. President Donald Trump's U-turn on electrification and a relaxation of emission standards in the European Union, shook the global EV market in 2025 into a ""virtually unrecognisable landscape"", according to BMI data manager Charles Lester.

Rising competition in Europe and cooling demand in China are likely to intensify the debate between electrification proponents who emphasise the need to curb planet-warming CO2 emissions, and carmakers who say a quick transition threatens jobs and profit.

BY THE NUMBERS

Global EV registrations, a proxy for sales, rose by 6% to almost 2.1 million units in December, reaching 20.7 million vehicles in 2025, the data showed.

They were up by 2% in China to more than 1.3 million, the lowest year-on-year increase since February 2024, leading to a 17% increase to 12.9 million units in 2025. The country produced 71% of EVs sold worldwide.

North American registrations fell by 39% to just over 100,000 cars sold, following similar declines in October and November at the end of U.S. tax credits. They were down 4% for the entire 2025.

Europe was up by 34% in December to over 450,000 registrations and by 33% in the year, while in the rest of the world sales were up by 41% to over 160,000 units in December, and by 48% in 2025.

WHAT'S NEXT

BMI expects 23.9 million EVs will be sold globally this year, a 15.7% increase, with growth sharply accelerating in China to 21% and slowing in Europe and the rest of the world to 15% and 26%, respectively. It forecasts a sharper decrease of 23% in North America due to a 29% slump in the U.S.

By Eric Starkman

General Motors disclosed in a late-2024 regulatory filing that it was facing litigation and other risks so severe that an adverse outcome could result in “significant” damages and even “interruptions of businesses.” It was a remarkable admission for a company already reeling from strategic whiplash. Yet the disclosure passed almost unnoticed, except by one veteran auto reporter, Phoebe Wall Howard.

That silence helps explain why GM CEO Mary Barra now speaks less like a corporate leader and more like a lawyer constructing a class-action defense in the wake of GM’s still-unfolding EV debacle.

On Monday, Barra told members of the Automotive Press Association that she has “no regrets” about GM’s electric-vehicle strategy, despite the company recording more than $7 billion in charges tied to abandoned EV plans and eliminating thousands of jobs because of a massive strategic misjudgment.

Same Decision

“Everything that we knew at that point in time we would have made the same decision,” Barra said, leaning on her familiar EV loyalty talking points. That’s the kind of statement one expects in litigation defense, not from an executive overseeing one of the most expensive strategic reversals in modern automotive history.

If there was any serious pushback to Barra’s claims, it did not appear in the coverage that followed. None of the reporting explained why GM committed to an all-electric future before it could profitably manufacture EVs, or why Toyota, long mocked for its EV restraint, correctly determined that American consumers were not ready to fully embrace electric vehicles.

It’s hard to imagine Japan’s auto writers asking Toyota’s leaders whether they have regrets about embracing hybrids, which are selling briskly, generating profits, and reducing emissions by as much as 30 percent. That Barra is paid roughly 80 percent more than Toyota’s CEO only makes her EV miscalculation more damning, a compensation disparity the auto press almost never notes when reporting on Barra.

Barra’s defenders will point to GM’s surging stock price as proof that her strategy has worked, even though part of that runup reflects the $25 billion in stock buybacks GM authorized over the past three years. A rising share price, however, does not negate a $7 billion EV write-down, thousands of lost jobs, or the decision to bury bad news in regulatory filings. Nor does it excuse a press corps that treats market approval as a substitute for scrutiny.

Barra also claimed that some GM gas-powered vehicles are more fuel-efficient than hybrids, a statement the Detroit Free Press reported without offering examples, perhaps because no one in the room pressed her for any. The claim was especially galling given that a climate-activist group ranked four GM vehicles, including the electric Hummer, among the 12 most environmentally harmful vehicles on the road. Toyota and its Lexus brand accounted for half of the greenest vehicles. GM did not place a single model on that list.

Toyota's Hybrids

Although Toyota’s fleet is already about 50 percent hybrid and Ford has announced a similar goal, Barra reportedly said GM is still “working on” its hybrid and plug-in strategy. That’s remarkable given that GM introduced the plug-in Chevy Volt in 2011, a pioneering vehicle that arrived well before the market was ready for it.

Developed under legendary GM executive Bob Lutz, the Volt was designed to drive primarily as an electric car, with a gasoline engine acting mainly as a generator once the battery was depleted. That architecture was novel at the time and gave early credibility to the idea that most daily driving could be electric years before charging infrastructure or consumer psychology caught up.

With about 40 miles of electric range, the Volt covered the daily commute for many Americans, allowing owners to go weeks or months without buying gas. In my West Los Angeles neighborhood, I see more Chevy Volts than any other GM vehicle, which makes sense given that every owner I’ve spoken with praises its reliability.

Barra killed the Volt in 2019 to focus on GM’s all-electric future. While she now insists EVs remain GM’s “North Star,” the company’s stock has surged largely because Barra has reassured Wall Street that GM will resume its focus selling highly profitable trucks and SUVs with enthusiasm.

One might have expected the auto media to arrive at Barra’s press conference prepared for tough questioning, especially after GM disclosed a $7.1 billion fourth-quarter loss tied largely to diminished EV and battery investments. Unlike Ford, which announced its $19.5 billion write-down in a separate release and whose CEO Jim Farley candidly acknowledged on Bloomberg Television that it “didn’t make sense to keep plowing billions into products that we knew would not make money,” GM disclosed its loss in a regulatory filing.

Available For Good News

Barra remains readily available to the media when GM has good news to share. When the company stumbles, she is far harder to find, a pattern that has gone largely unremarked upon despite how frequently those stumbles have occurred in recent years.

The pattern helps explain why the same auto press that failed to challenge Barra’s “no regrets” performance readily accepted the claim that the four floors GM has rented in Dan Gilbert’s Hudson’s Detroit office tower constitute the company’s headquarters.

A careful reading of the coverage of the official opening only reinforced my skepticism that the office is largely window dressing meant to create the impression that GM still maintains a meaningful Detroit presence.

For starters, of roughly a dozen executive offices, only four are permanently assigned — to Barra, President Mark Reuss, CFO Paul Jacobson, and Chief Legal Officer Grant Dixton. I can find no confirmation that any of those executives will work from the Detroit office on a full-time basis and pay Detroit’s nonresident income tax.

GM has 16 corporate officers. That means 12 are not expected to spend enough time at “headquarters” to warrant an assigned office. That reality was absent from the media’s coverage.

Instead, GM’s senior leadership is scattered across the country. Sterling Anderson, who oversees product development, is based in the Bay Area, as is Lin-Hua Wu, who runs marketing and public relations. Chief People Officer Arden Hoffman lives in Montana and has conducted company calls from her ranch

Improve Collaboration?

Ed Nightingale, who oversees digital products and infrastructure, is based in Seattle. Zach Kirkman, GM’s recently appointed vice president of strategy and corporate development, is based in Austin.

Yet the claim that the Detroit office will improve collaboration was repeated by the auto press without scrutiny or context.

The contrast with GM’s West Coast priorities is hard to ignore. Barra attended the May 2024 opening of GM’s Mountain View Technical Center, where she declared, “This is going to be a very central hub for us.” Coverage of the Detroit office media tour, by contrast, made no mention of Barra’s presence.

At the Mountain View event, GM showcased executives it had recruited from Silicon Valley. One of them was Baris Cetinok, then vice president of product software and services, who proclaimed that “Detroit is the original Silicon Valley of the world.”

Cetinok left GM last November, one of four senior Silicon Valley-based executives whose tenures lasted two years or less.

Another speaker at the Mountain View opening was Marissa West, GM’s president of North America, who reiterated the company’s all-electric vision. West, a roughly 25-year GM veteran, left the company about eight months after being promoted to oversee North American operations.

Hudson’s Detroit reportedly cost $1.5 billion to develop. GM is occupying about 200,000 square feet — space that includes 14 conference rooms, 52 huddle rooms, 63 phone rooms, and three common areas. While Barra promotes GM as a technology company, its supposed headquarters is four floors of leased commercial office building space — a far cry from the kind of purpose-built environments associated with companies that actually operate like tech firms.

Ford's HQ

By contrast, Ford spent more than $1 billion on its new Dearborn headquarters, a 2.1-million-square-foot campus designed to accommodate 4,000 employees, with plans that will eventually place roughly 14,000 employees within a 15-minute walk.

Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford, CEO Jim Farley, and former CEO Jim Hackett attended the official opening. Ford also spent more than $500 million restoring Michigan Central Station, a civic project for which it did not seek naming rights.

GM, by contrast, was previously obligated to maintain 4,000 headquarters jobs in Detroit as part of the $3.5 billion it received in state incentives. Governor Gretchen Whitmer relieved GM of that obligation in exchange for the company building electric trucks and SUVs at Factory Zero.

Tellingly, GM will not disclose how many employees will work at Hudson’s Detroit or how many will pay Detroit’s nonresident income tax. Factory Zero, the facility GM cited in exchange for being relieved of its headquarters job obligations, has already seen 1,100 workers laid off as the company retrenches from its electric-vehicle ambitions.

Gilbert received substantial tax breaks for Hudson’s Detroit, justified in part by promises that the development would attract new companies and jobs to the city. Meanwhile, the Detroit Regional CEO Group has named Barra and Reuss as co-chairs, despite GM’s continued downsizing of its Michigan workforce.

A headquarters without disclosed staffing, without full-time executive presence, and without accountability to the city that subsidized it is not a headquarters in any meaningful sense. It is a carefully branded installation — and the willingness of the auto press to treat it otherwise says far more about the state of automotive journalism than it does about GM’s supposed commitment to Detroit.

CASH FOR CARS: California’s relationship with Detroit is still frosty after automakers helped kill the state’s electric vehicle rules — but Gov. Gavin Newsom is betting that some cold, hard cash will help warm them up.

Newsom’s plan to balance the budget, released Friday, sets aside $200 million to prop up a new incentive program for electric vehicle buyers to help replace the $7,500 federal tax credit that the Trump administration eliminated last year.

It could help bolster the EV market, which industry analysts anticipate will soon start to flag in the face of rising car prices. But it could also help get automakers back to the negotiating table.

“We need to see the details of the new program, but this is a policy that has worked in the past,” said John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents most major automakers and successfully lobbied congressional Republicans to kill California’s nation-leading EV sales mandate in June. “At this stage of the transition and given current market conditions, consumer incentives can lead to more EV adoption and affordability in California — and support the automotive and battery industrial base across the country.”

Yes, automakers overwhelmingly opposed California’s vehicle emissions rule, which had required them to sell an increasing proportion of EVs each year. But they also weren’t pleased with President Donald Trump’s dismantling of Biden-era incentives for car buyers and battery manufacturing. (See Bozzella’s reference to “current market conditions,” which also includes the administration’s ongoing tariff policy.)

That dynamic opens a window in forthcoming negotiations on the proposal, which finance officials left vague and said they plan to hash out by February, that could thaw Newsom’s relationship with car companies — and keep the state’s climate goals on track — as he terms out of the governor’s mansion and looks towards higher office.

While Newsom has reserved his most pointed criticism for General Motors CEO Mary Barra, whom he’s repeatedly said in recent months “sold out” California, he hasn’t been afraid to issue barbs to the industry as a whole.

“Republicans rolled that back this year under Donald Trump’s leadership,” he said in September, referring to the lost EV mandate. “But the American automobile manufacturers allowed that to happen.”

Automakers are eager to engage as the state hammers out the details. Among the unanswered questions are who would qualify for the incentive and if there will be a cap on the price of EV models that are rebate-eligible. Companies like Rivian and Hyundai already weighed in during a series of California Air Resources Board workshops last year, advocating for a simple-to-use rebate without an income requirement.

“In our view, every $1,000 leads to a bump in EV registrations in the state,” Tom Van Heeke, Rivian’s senior policy adviser, said in November. “People respond to incentives.”

Newsom’s open hand to automakers has environmentalists split, with some taking a realpolitik approach.

Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California state director at the Environmental Defense Fund, said the state should work closely with the automakers to design an incentive program that gets more EVs on the road — and bury the hatchet in the process.

“I think this is a real opportunity for partnership,” she said.

Not all enviros are thrilled with the idea of handing the keys over to automakers.

Bill Magavern, policy director at Coalition for Clean Air, said he’s encouraged by the inclusion of EV funding in the budget, but that incentives need to target low-income drivers who are more likely to need help covering the cost. And he recoiled at the idea of car manufacturers taking the leading role in designing the program.

“Now that they have bitten the hands that fed them, are they really expecting a handout?” Magavern said. “The program design should be based on what’s good for Californians, especially those who are struggling to make ends meet, and not be based on what’s good for large auto companies.”

One thing that Newsom’s budget omits: incentives for zero-emission heavy-duty trucks, which the state has also lost the authority to mandate and which have a disproportionate impact on greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. While the governor’s budget last year included a $132 million boost for a popular EV truck and bus incentive program, he didn’t include new funding this year.

Trucking fleets and manufacturers argued during a November workshop that those incentives — which are typically snatched up the same day California opens applications — are the most important tool for transitioning to cleaner models.

“We need to make sure these trucks are at the same price as the diesel equivalent when they open their paychecks and they justify the purchase of that truck,” said Chris Brown, head of government affairs at Harbinger Motors, which builds electric delivery trucks in Orange County. — AN

FROM TRADE TO INVEST: It was Newsom’s big legislative lift last year, and now it’s regulators’ turn.

The California Air Resources Board on Tuesday released new draft rules for the state’s flagship cap-and-trade market (renamed cap-and-invest following its extension in a state law last year.) They’re proposing removing a third of the pollution permits they sell to industry through 2045, to get closer to meeting increasingly ambitious climate goals.

Environmentalists didn’t love it, arguing that CARB should have gone further in cutting emissions and raising more money for the state (fewer permits means each one is more valuable).

But affordability looms large. CARB staff said cost concerns ultimately drove the decision to aim for a 40 percent emissions cut by 2030, rather than the 48 percent regulators had previously considered.

“We are in a very different place politically and economically than we were two years ago,” CARB spokesperson Lindsay Buckley said, pointing in part to federal rollbacks under the Trump administration that have weakened incentives for climate projects.

But they’re still hoping to dramatically steepen the curve over time. From 2030 to 2045, CARB would remove another 899 million metric tons under the draft rules. They would also gradually lower the number of free permits given to natural gas suppliers and let utilities pass on the value of the allowances to customers based on actual energy use, rather than as a fixed bill credit.

Another part of the new rules aim to promote industrial decarbonization, including new categories for low-carbon cement production and a special incentive for manufacturers that lower emissions on-site.

The release of the draft rules sets up a period of back-and-forth with environmental advocates and industry before a planned vote by the board in the second quarter of 2026. — CvK

DRILL AWAY: The feds may open up more of California to oil and gas drilling.

The Bureau of Land Management published draft environmental analyses Monday concluding that new drilling on vast swaths of public land would not significantly harm public health or the environment, reports Ian Stevenson for POLITICO’s E&E News.

The analysis from the Bakersfield Field Office, which oversees 400,000 acres of federal land, predicts as many as 400 new wells per year. The Central Coast Field Office predicts up to 37 new wells in its area over 20 years; the office manages 250,000 acres of public land, as well as the mineral rights for more than 500,000 acres.

BLM is considering various leasing options after years of litigation over drilling in the region. Environmental groups sued over environmental impact statements released in 2019, during the first Trump administration, arguing BLM did not adequately consider environmental harms. That led to 2022 settlements in which BLM agreed to conduct further analyses — including of drilling techniques like hydraulic fracturing, or fracking — while suspending new oil and gas leasing in the area.

The draft supplemental environmental impact statements will be open for public comment until early March. The program areas range from the San Francisco Bay Area south to the Los Angeles suburbs and east to Fresno and Bakersfield. — IS, NB

PAY YOUR WAY: Trump announced Monday that he’s teaming up with tech companies to keep data centers from driving up utility bills. Microsoft is first up.

The company pledged in a blog post to pay more for the electricity going to its data centers, reports Jason Plautz for POLITICO’s E&E News. Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote that the company would ask utilities and regulators to set rates for the company’s data centers high enough to cover the costs of adding and using the electricity infrastructure needed. The company will also pay for new generation as well as improvements in transmission and distribution capabilities as needed.

“Our goal is straightforward: to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our datacenters is not passed on to residential customers,” Smith wrote.

As it so happens, the California Public Utilities Commission is poised to green-light during its Thursday meeting agreements between Microsoft and Pacific Gas & Electric to energize a new 90-megawatt data center in San Jose. Under the agreements, Microsoft will pay the upfront costs of connecting to the electricity grid. If the company follows through with getting the facility operational and purchasing energy from PG&E, then the utility would have 15 years to pay Microsoft back using ratepayer funds. — NB

BACKING THE BUS: Bay Area lawmakers are throwing their weight behind the region’s transit operators as negotiations with Newsom’s office over how to avert drastic service cuts drag on.

Fourteen state senators and assemblymembers, including Bay Area Caucus Chair Sen. Josh Becker, penned a Monday letter to Newsom in which they offered support for a plan that would use a piece of annual statewide transit dollars — funded by diesel fuel taxes — to issue loans for operating expenses. Bay Area transit operators made that counterproposal to the Department of Finance late last month, after Newsom’s administration suggested tapping into existing grants for long-term construction projects.

“We are concerned that, absent a clear commitment from the state to fully honor existing grant awards, the January 9th proposal from the Department of Finance could have unintended consequences for project schedules and matching funds, including approximately $6 billion in federal funding,” the lawmakers wrote.

DOF hasn’t laid out a timeline for approving a transit loan, but operators say a deal is needed well ahead of the July 1 start to the new budget year. BART has warned that it could reduce train service by 65 to 85 percent, while Muni projects a 50 percent cut. — AN

By Trilby MacDonald, Ecology Center Writer

Over many decades, Michigan nurtured talent, invested in R&D, and built the advanced manufacturing capabilities that launched the global auto industry. Today, the state is winding the mainsprings of its industrial legacy to spring into high-growth industries, such as renewable energy, semiconductors, autonomous driving, and electric vehicles. Strategic investments in workforce development and public-private partnerships are helping strong companies reach new heights.

These investments are paying off. According to Fast Company, jobs in clean energy and electric vehicles are growing nearly four times faster than the state’s economy as a whole — with employment in EV manufacturing up 13% in 2025, smart-grid modernization up 6.9%, and solar energy up 5.6%. Michigan is home to more engineers per capita than anywhere else in the U.S., and is in third place for semiconductor jobs.

Why are Michigan’s labor force and population declining?

Many of these good jobs are going unfilled because we don’t have enough qualified workers. Meanwhile, workers and young people move to other states in search of jobs they can fill. The policy imperative is clear: prepare our workforce to fill open jobs or lose opportunity to other states. The state is not sitting on its heels. Key agencies have matched Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funding to upskill its workforce through over a dozen programs.

In the first year of the Statewide Workforce Plan, launched in early 2024, The Economic Development Corporation’s Talent Action Team connected 1,748 people directly to good-paying high-tech roles and trained an additional 1,291 workers. Labor and Economic Development (LEO) served more than 9,500 businesses across the state, helping them recruit talent and increase their competitiveness, and served more than 336,000 Michiganders with workforce development support, the most of any state in the Midwest. Further, millages have been passed in many areas to educate K-12 students in careers in technical education, including Washtenaw County.

How did we fall behind?

The energy crisis of the 1970s spurred massive federal investment in the research and development of alternative energy, including solar, wind, and natural gas. It led to the creation of the Department of Energy and a raft of tax incentives and supportive policies that allowed the sector to flourish. President Jimmy Carter even put solar panels on the roof of the White House. America was leading the world in the development of green technologies our scientists invented, including solar panels and electric vehicles.

All of that momentum came to an end when Ronald Reagan entered the Oval Office after a successful campaign paid for in large part by the fossil fuel industry. In the name of limited government and free market capitalism, he dismantled the policies and programs that nurtured the growing industries, including the symbolic removal of President Carter’s solar panels from the White House roof. Renewable energy and EV development came to a grinding halt. But where Reagan-era conservatives saw costly government programs, countries like Germany and China saw economic opportunity, and now our industries are eating their dust.

We are experiencing the same cycle of investment, disinvestment, and missed opportunity again.

The Biden Administration made the largest investment in renewable energy and technology innovation in the nation’s history with the Inflation Reduction Act, investing hundreds of billions of dollars to jump start the industry. It gave rise to new companies, expansions of existing industries, and major infrastructure projects across all 50 states.

And now the Trump Administration is attempting to reverse that progress. Not only was the U.S. absent from the UN Climate Change Conference in November, we are seeing a freeze in new R&D funding for clean energy technology and the illegal clawback of billions in federal dollars approved by Congress for climate-related projects. Tariffs on products connected with renewable energy and electric vehicles create more economic uncertainty, further discouraging businesses from pursuing clean energy and technology projects. According to Climate Power, 158,000 clean energy jobs have been lost across the U.S. since Trump took office for his second term, 6,000 of them in Michigan.

Not surprisingly, the oil and gas industries were among Trump’s top campaign contributors.

States like Michigan are running hard to stay in the lead of the clean energy transition. Part of our strategy to stay competitive are strong cross-sectoral collaborations between state, corporate, and nonprofit partners to create the workforce we need to keep industries and talent here. We need to keep this momentum going so that young people will see their future in Michigan.

Disconnect between workers and jobs

Roughly 26,000 new clean energy and clean vehicle jobs have been created since 2022, part of over 127,000 in the state, according to The Clean Jobs Midwest Report. This growth is partly the result of major federal policies like the 2022 IRA that incentivized private sector initiatives and a raft of supportive state legislation. Michigan lawmakers created the 2022 MI Healthy Climate Plan, which built a policy framework to pursue a clean energy transition, and the 2023 clean energy legislation including workforce development. However, the number of new jobs created falls short of the Whitmer administration’s projections—and it’s nowhere near enough to offset Michigan’s shrinking labor force, which lost 45,000 workers between March and September of 2025, according to the Michigan Department of Technology, Management & Budget.

The gap between projected and actual job growth is due to a few factors, including automation, project cancellations caused by tariffs and unfavorable policies, and lack of qualified candidates.

With so many people out of work, it’s hard to believe that 88% percent of clean energy employers in Michigan report at least some difficulty hiring workers, according to a 2023 report by Clean Jobs Midwest. Michigan is facing shortages in several types of jobs, including EV manufacturing and maintenance technicians, battery engineers, energy efficiency specialists, solar and wind power installers, HVAC and building automation techs, and skilled trades tied to clean infrastructure. The Michigan Growth Office and Make Michigan Home program are working to attract people with those skills to live in the state. But rather than import qualified workers, wouldn’t it be better to train local workers for these positions?

Closing the employment gap: when opportunity meets preparation

The cost to replace an employee can range from half to twice the position’s annual salary, according to Gallup. As industries change to meet shifting market demands, corporations that invest in their talent pool save money, have higher retention, and are more nimble in a shifting market. Transitioning a workforce requires an upfront investment, and that’s where state leadership is key. Government agencies including the Michigan Infrastructure Office, Office of Labor and Economic Development, and Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) are partnering with corporations, nonprofits, and higher education to deliver apprenticeships and training programs that allow the workers of today to qualify for jobs in construction, energy efficiency, and cutting edge industries that would otherwise go to workers outside of the state.

The private, nonprofit, and government sectors each bring unique tools and expertise to close the employment gap:

Private Sector

Innovates to meet emerging market demands

Develops curricula and technical training

Offers on-the-job training and career pathways

Provides paid apprenticeships

Community-Based Organizations, Labor Unions & Higher Education

Identify and recruit prospective participants

Provide training and credentialing

Offer wraparound services (transportation vouchers, stipends, childcare) that make training accessible

Offer coaching and case management to help workers navigate barriers

Track participant progress and outcomes to refine programs

Government Agencies

Establish policies and regulatory frameworks

Provide funding for workforce development

Incentivise collaboration by high-road companies, including mandates and contracting preferences

Build connections between sectors to support coordinated transitions

Align training investments with statewide climate, energy, and economic transition goals

The Continuous Partner Collaboration Cycle model is one method to coordinate the public, private, and nonprofit sectors by fostering just transitions through social dialogue and refinement of training programs to keep up with advancements in green technologies and labor market conditions. The Midwest Air Source Heat Pump Collaborative uses the CPCC model, aligning training with market demands and policy goals, preparing workers for emerging green tech and energy sectors through shared tools, data, and feedback loops.

Predictive workforce planning can better align training programs with climate action plans by using data to forecast the supply and demand of skills and workers needed for emerging green sectors. Tracking labor markets and creating feedback loops between employers, educational institutions, and training providers allows collaborators to adjust workforce development strategies proactively.

Germany’s dual system is an example of a national strategy that runs apprenticeships and vocational training programs within a strong public, private, union partnership dating back to the Middle Ages. Companies have found that the best way to recruit highly skilled personnel that fit their cultures is to provide apprenticeships and on the job training. Meanwhile, state-sponsored vocational schools provide the classroom education and theoretical framework to support hands-on learning. The system works so well that 50% of high school graduates that don’t go to college enter the trades through this program.

I want to thank the Pride of The Orange marching band. The best marching band in the country as far as I’m concerned. I want to acknowledge the leader of the Senate, Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie — two extraordinary leaders I consider incredible partners as we chart the path forward for New York.

Our protector, Attorney General Tish James. Keeper of the coffers, Comptroller Tom DiNapoli. From Buffalo, Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes. Senate Minority Leader Rob Ortt. Assembly Minority Leader Will Barclay. Judges of the New York Court of Appeals. New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani. And Mayors and County Executives from across the State.

Representatives from labor and distinguished guests. Members of my Cabinet. Secretary Karen Persichilli Keogh and the Executive Chamber senior team.

And I’m very proud to acknowledge New York’s very first ever First Gentleman, my husband, William Hochul.

Today, on this 13th day of 2026, we will embark on a journey together. A State of the State address is a chance to look to the future. But this year calls for us to reflect on something bigger than this moment:

The origins of our nation, founded 250 years ago this year, and how that history shapes where we are and where we must go from here.

From the very beginning, New Yorkers have always been a rather rebellious lot, willing to take on forces larger than ourselves in the cause of liberty and freedom.

That resilience, that strength, that spirit, that willingness to fight for a better future was born in secret meetings in the taverns of Albany and New York CIty — charting a path forward under the weight of an oppressive power.

And later, with New York as our country’s first capital, our bold revolutionary leaders became the governing leaders of a New Nation with unlimited possibilities.

Over my four years as your Governor listening to your stories, feeling the pulse of this great state, I have seen that same strength, the resilience, the optimism that defined New Yorkers 250 years ago.

As I shaped our agenda for 2026 and beyond, I kept returning to my conversations with New Yorkers from every corner of the state — people who refuse to back down on their dreams.

People like Theresa Durham, a Syracuse grandmother I was lucky enough to meet last May.

Thanks to our housing policies, Theresa just fulfilled her lifelong dream of owning a home.

People like Deborah Koenigsberger who owns a clothing boutique in the Flatiron District.

Her business is getting hit so hard by Trump’s tariffs. And somehow, she’s making it work while leading a nonprofit that supports homeless women and children.

I think of people like 14-year-old Joziah Morales, who found the courage to seek help when he was struggling with his mental health. Today, he’s out there sharing his inspiring story, reminding his peers it’s okay to accept a helping hand.

So when I say your family is my fight, these are the people I’m talking about.

I carry their stories and those of countless others with me, because I’ve lived my own version of them. Growing up in a cramped home just outside Buffalo, sharing a drafty attic bedroom with my brothers, doing homework late at night by a space heater after finishing a shift at the local pizzeria not knowing where my path would lead. But I learned when people work hard, and when someone has their back, it can change the course of their entire life.

That’s why I believe with my whole heart that government can and must be a force for good. And over the last four years, we’ve proven it. We took our State emerging from a crisis and powered a comeback that few believed was possible.

Crime is down in the places New Yorkers feel it most. Our streets, our subways, our communities are safer than they’ve been in years.

We also know people need a safe place to live. That’s why we secured the most significant housing deal in half a century so young families can put down roots.

We expanded child care, capped the cost of insulin and launched the nation’s very first paid prenatal leave program.

We also made historic investments in clean energy, chips manufacturing and advanced technology, creating tens of thousands of good-paying jobs. And the impact is undeniable.

Retail is surging. More college graduates are moving to New York than anywhere else in the country. We’re leading the nation in return-to-office. From Babylon to Buffalo, New York is rising.

If you’re betting on the future, you need to bet on New York. If you’re searching for talent, you find it in New York. If you’re looking for the epicenter of culture, innovation, opportunity, it has always been and remains New York.

My friends, I am proud to say: The State of our State is strong! And we’re just getting started.

But I need to level with you: This moment carries real threats from Donald Trump and his enablers in Congress. Driving up costs on everything from groceries to farm equipment through these reckless tariffs. Killing major infrastructure projects that put union members to work. Tearing nursing immigrant mothers from their babies and calling it public safety.

And just last week, the world watched as an immigration operation in Minneapolis that never should have happened — left a child without a mother, and a community, and indeed a nation, shattered.

It’s all part of an agenda that only makes our lives harder.

Well, here’s the thing about New Yorkers: We don’t back down. We rise up.

When they tried to take away funding for first responders and law enforcement, we made them restore it. When they tried to kill congestion pricing, we beat them in court again and again. The President even made another threatening post less than 24 hours ago. But my message to the wannabe king remains the same: We will not bow.

Yes, this is a year of real uncertainty driven by reckless federal policies. Washington’s chaos is hitting our bottom line. But we’ve built the boat to withstand the storm. Because we’ve managed our money responsibly. We’re able to make transformative investments in our future. Without raising taxes. Without saddling the next generation with mounds of debt.

Four years ago, we laid out a bold vision. I took responsibility for making it real.

And in 2026, we’re seeing the results.

Clean hydropower flowing in from Quebec to power more than a million New York City homes.

Long-stalled housing projects rising from the ground.

A new stadium bringing pride and investment to Western New York. Go Bills!

The brand new Belmont Park carrying racing into the future.

The World Cup, drawing soccer fans from across the globe.

Critical infrastructure being rebuilt, from the Port Authority Bus Terminal to our bridges and tunnels.

Expanding the Second Avenue Subway even further.

And with the Interborough Express, we’ll connect Queens and Brooklyn like never before.

Even the renovations at Penn Station long dreamed of are on a path forward.

Families will get more breathing room.

Another minimum wage hike.

Better paid family leave. A child tax credit up to $1,000 and the lowest middle class tax rates in 70 years. Let me repeat, the lowest in 70 years! And we lifted a major burden for businesses, paying off billions in unemployment insurance debt while increasing benefits by 70 percent.

That’s a critical safety net for anyone who finds themselves out of work.

What else can we look forward to in 2026?

World-renowned companies reinvigorating communities long overlooked: Micron in Onondaga County shovels in the ground not 3 years from now, but 3 days from now! GlobalFoundries in Saratoga County. Fairlife in Monroe County. Chobani in Oneida County.

These wins are the results of fights we took on investments we made and a future we chose together. And when I say “together,” that includes my great partners in state government who are with us today. And it also means the local leaders who work around the clock keeping our towns and cities running.

Let’s hear from some of them.

As your Governor, I am proud to lead the fight to protect communities and build an economy that works for all! And today I’m here to tell you how we continue that fight, and it starts with making life more affordable.

Whether we’re talking about child care, groceries or utility bills, one thing is clear: Parents, veterans and seniors need relief. That’s why, last year alone working with the Legislature, we put $5,000 back in the pockets of hardworking families.

But now, Washington Republicans are waging an all-out war on the middle class: Driving up costs and leaving states to pick up the pieces. So this year, while Washington takes a machete to our safety net, I’m doubling down on the fight for a more affordable New York starting with child care.

For working parents, no cost is more overwhelming. I know how urgent this is because I’ve lived it.

When my husband Bill and I were starting out, child care was one of our greatest obstacles. I was fresh out of law school working my dream job on Capitol Hill with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. But when our babies arrived, I had to give that career up simply because we could not find affordable child care.

It was heartbreaking.

It was tough then. And for too many families today, it’s almost impossible.

Get this: In New York City, child care costs between $26,000 and $40,000 a year. For that price, your toddler should be fluent in three languages and doing your taxes.

One year ago, I stood on this very stage and placed our state on the path to Universal Child care. Today, I stand before you with a clear roadmap to show how we’ll get there. Building on over $8 billion in child care investments that my Administration has made since 2022, this plan will ultimately deliver Universal Child care for every single family in New York.

Full stop.

The work has already begun. Five days ago, I stood with Mayor Mamdani to announce the State will fully fund the first two years of his Universal 2-Care program while also helping New York City realize the full promise of Universal 3-K.

Statewide, we’re taking a different, but equally ambitious approach:

Universal Pre-K for every single 4 year old by 2028!

This year, we’ll also pilot community-wide child care to provide year-round, full-day, affordable care for newborns to 3 year olds.

And we’ll build on the proven success of our State Child Care Assistance Program and our voucher system so tens of thousands more families can access high-quality care for no more than $15 per week.

Thanks to our strong economy, we have the revenue to get these initiatives off the ground.

But to keep our momentum going, we need partnership from the private sector.

So we’ll work with employers and improve tax incentives for those who invest in child care benefits. We want New York to be the number one place for anyone about to start a family and build their future.

When that happens, we all win.

Our classrooms are fuller.

Our economy is stronger.

And our communities are richer in every sense of the word.

But affordability doesn’t stop at child care. Right now, the average New York household pays nearly $1,700 per year just to keep the lights on and the heat running. And Donald Trump’s stop-work order on offshore wind will only make it worse in the long run.

I’m fighting it every step of the way.

But while that battle continues we’re taking action now streamlining utility assistance helping homeowners make energy efficient upgrades and protecting New Yorkers from being blindsided by exorbitant rate hikes.

We can make energy more affordable and reliable today while still leading the nation in sustainable investments, leaving this state stronger for our children and grandchildren.

And there’s another affordability issue that’s been apparent for years: The sky-high cost of auto insurance.

Because in many parts of our state, owning an automobile is not a luxury, it’s essential. Yet, New Yorkers pay the highest auto insurance rates in the nation, averaging $4,000 a year — $1,500 more than the national average. Not because New Yorkers are doing anything wrong, but because rampant fraud and runaway litigation costs are jacking up prices.

Let’s be clear about how that happens. When the system allows out-of-control payouts. Those costs get passed on to you in the form of higher monthly bills.

New Yorkers should not pay more for the same coverage. And this is the year, we’re going to do something about it.

We’re putting the brakes on fraud and ending a system that rewards illegal behavior. If you were driving drunk, driving without a license, or committing a felony at the time of a crash, you should not get a payday.

This is about finally standing up for millions of New York drivers who deserve a break.

And this year, we’ll continue cracking down on criminals of all kinds.

When I came into office, New York was facing a crisis of crime and disorder.

In the two years before I arrived, shootings had nearly doubled. Repeat offenders were cycling in and out of the criminal justice system. And too many people felt unsafe.

I promised New Yorkers to do everything in my power to restore safety and security.

We backed that promise with action. We made unprecedented investments in police and public safety over $3 billion. We enacted the strongest gun laws in the nation along with common sense reforms to keep serial lawbreakers off the streets and stop criminals from walking free on technicalities.

We equipped police with the best technology, deployed more officers in our subway, formed specialized units to crack down on retail theft and domestic violence.

Four years later, crime is hitting record lows. Shootings, homicides and subway crime all down

But we will never be satisfied. This year, we’re building on what works using data, coordination and smart enforcement to stay ahead of criminals.

We’ll expand our successful network of Crime Analysis Centers statewide. On our subways, we’ll maintain enhanced police patrols, install platform barriers at 85 additional stations and expand our elite mental health units that get people in crisis off the train and into care.

We’ve stemmed the tide of firearms flowing into our state along the iron pipeline. And now, we’re taking aim at the plastic pipeline.

Illegal 3-D printed ghost guns are homemade killing machines assembled with pieces you can easily purchase. To fight back, I’m proposing a first-in-the-nation law requiring ALL 3-D printers sold in the State of New York to include software that blocks the printer from creating a gun.

And we’re putting gun manufacturers on notice: You will no longer sell handguns that can be converted into automatic machine guns — that are able to fire 1,200 rounds per minute.

Not here. Not in New York. That’s how we save lives and fight crime.

As we reflect on freedoms fought for 250 years ago, among them is the freedom to practice your religion without interference.

In 2026, we’ll take new steps to protect our houses of worship against the rising tide of Antisemitism and Islamophobia. New York has already invested $131 million to better secure these sacred places. But clearly, more must be done.

Just last week, protestors led pro-Hamas chants outside a Synagogue in Kew Gardens Hills. That’s not free expression. That’s harassment. And targeting a Jewish community in this way is antisemitism.

That’s why I’m proposing a ban on protests within 25 feet of the property line at houses of worship. So those who simply want to pray can do so without fear or harassment.

My responsibility for keeping New Yorkers safe extends to protecting our children as well.

We’ve taken on Big Tech and passed nation-leading laws. So kids will no longer be subjected to addictive algorithms that manipulate their minds.

They will no longer be targets for mega- corporations monetizing their mental health. And now when the school day begins, their phones are tucked away under our bell-to-bell ban.

In just four months, the transformation has been extraordinary.

Classrooms are alive with discussion. Laughter fills our lunchrooms. And Frankie Focus haunts our childrens’ dreams.

Building on our success, I say we enact new requirements to protect all social media users under 18: Let’s block direct messages from would-be child predators with automatic privacy settings. Let’s disable A-I chatbots that can cause serious mental health problems.

Let’s block location-sharing and let’s do more to cut off access to online sports gambling so our kids are not ensnared by addiction at a young age.

You’ve heard me say that our communities cannot reach their full potential without an abundant supply of safe, affordable housing.

For too long, over-burdensome regulations made it too hard not just to build homes but the places people work and the infrastructure our future depends upon.

That’s why four years ago I made a commitment: To challenge the status quo, cut red tape and clear the way to build, build, build!

Working with the Legislature, we took on a system that was failing our families and passed the most significant housing deal in 50 years!

We made it clear: Standing still is no longer an option. The result? We saved over 71,000 homes that were at risk of being scrapped.

And we opened the door for another 800,000 over the next decade!

We’ve funded shovel-ready projects, strengthened tenant protections, turned vacant properties into homes and protected rent-regulated housing.

Local governments are stepping up, too. Over 400 pro-housing communities have agreed to build more homes because we lead with carrots. not sticks.

Under my approach, communities that say yes to housing get access to $750 million in state funding.

We’re changing the culture around building brick by brick.

This year we'll invest an additional $250 million for affordable housing and $100 million to scale innovative, manufactured housing that lowers costs and speeds construction.

And we’ll update tax incentives to help owners of rent-regulated buildings in New York City make repairs and investments.

Meanwhile, we'll crack down on the worst landlords with increased penalties and strengthen rent relief for seniors and New Yorkers with disabilities.

But as far as we’ve come, too many projects still get stuck.

Not because they’re bad ideas but because the system itself has become the obstacle.

Even projects everyone agrees we need affordable housing, clean energy. Critical infrastructure can spend years trapped in red tape pushing up costs and pushing opportunity further out of reach.

So this year, we’re taking a hard look at environmental review processes that haven’t been updated in literally half a century.

Right now, they slow down the very projects that help us fight climate change, create housing and strengthen our communities.

That’s why, in this budget, I’m proposing a simple, common-sense update: When communities say yes to housing, infrastructure, or clean energy, we’re going to LET THEM BUILD!

When a town or city decides to move forward they shouldn’t get stuck in regulatory hell.

Cutting red tape doesn’t end at the construction site, it extends to government as well.

This year, we’ll also eliminate outdated and onerous regulations and leverage cutting-edge technology to make government work better.

But we’ll also do it the old-fashioned way, talking to small business owners and other impacted New Yorkers about the bureaucratic barriers that are holding them back.

People deserve to know their tax dollars are being spent wisely and their government is operating efficiently.

And we’re bringing that same productivity as we build the jobs of the future.

Today the Empire State is home to over 8.5 million private sector jobs, almost a million more than when I took office.

And now we’re forging ahead tapping into the creativity that has always defined our state.

200 years ago the Erie Canal made New York an industrial powerhouse. It sustained generations of manufacturing jobs and entire communities.

But when those jobs were shipped overseas in the ‘70s, communities like mine paid the price.

I remember the year the steel plant shut down in Buffalo and the toll it took. I saw it in the bustling businesses gone dark. In the drawn faces I passed on the sidewalk drained of hope.

None of my siblings could find a job.

They couldn’t stay in Western New York.

That taught me a lesson I’ve never forgotten: New York should never be left at the mercy of decisions made far away with no regard for people here at home.

So we’re ushering in a rebirth of manufacturing one that’s built to last. In 2022, we enacted the nation’s largest semiconductor incentive program ensuring the defining technology of our time would be built in New York by New Yorkers.

We’re already landing the world’s largest chipmakers.

But we must ensure these fantastic opportunities are within reach for all not reserved for a select few.

That’s why we’re investing over half a billion dollars to help New Yorkers gain the skills they need to succeed.

It starts with the fundamentals.

That’s why two years ago I took on entrenched interests and insisted that we go back to basics teaching kids how to read and doing away with ineffective methods.

We took on that fight and we won.

This year we’ll take the same approach with math preparing the next generation for the jobs of tomorrow.

And for those who want to embark on a new career, we launched free community college for adult learners pursuing high-demand careers from health care to advanced manufacturing.

Since last summer, more than 11,000 people have enrolled.

This year let’s expand that opportunity even further adding new fields like logistics, air traffic control and emergency management.

And speaking of preparing for the future, we must plan for the energy that industries require.

Last summer, I took the bold step of greenlighting the first nuclear power project in a generation, a vital part of our all-of-the-above approach to energy.

At the time we set a goal of building one gigawatt of nuclear power.

But if there’s one thing I believe, it’s this: Go big or go home.

So I’ve decided to raise the bar to five gigawatts.

That’s more nuclear energy than has been built anywhere in the United States in the last 30 years!

And to make sure New Yorkers are ready, we’ll launch a nuclear workforce development program so we can forge our clean energy future together.

Let me be clear: our energy system exists to serve New Yorkers first.

Data centers are vital for an innovative future. But they guzzle up tremendous amounts of energy and leave ratepayers footing the bill.

So if they want to build in New York, they’ll have to pay their fair share for the power they use and ultimately generate their own power independently.

Because we will not allow technology to undermine our infrastructure, and we won’t let it undermine our democracy, either.

People deserve to trust what they see and hear during election season. So this year we’ll require disclosures on all AI-generated images and videos so New Yorkers know what’s real and what’s not.

And we’ll strengthen our existing laws to prohibit deepfakes that impersonate candidates, deceive voters and manipulate elections.

So take a good look at these guns cause it’s the last time you’re gonna see them.

All jokes aside, New York has always been a place where fundamental rights are vigorously defended.

And at a moment when those rights are under direct attack, New York is doing what we’ve always done: We’re standing firm.

When Roe v. Wade was overturned, we acted immediately protecting abortion access and shielding patients and providers from political persecution.

We enshrined the Equal Rights Amendment in the State Constitution and strengthened one of the nation’s oldest Human Rights laws.

But over the last year, that record has come under siege by the Trump administration.

One of the clearest examples of what’s at stake is the right to health care. Republicans in Washington want to drive up premiums, deny coverage, and force families to choose between seeing a doctor and paying their rent.

Here in New York we are fighting like hell to stop them. This year, we’ll protect affordable health care for more than 1.3 million New Yorkers. And we’re also protecting access to lifesaving vaccines.

Last year, when pharmacies began turning people away I declared an emergency and expanded who can prescribe and administer vaccines so no New Yorker is left unprotected.

This year, I’ll go further ensuring New York’s immunization standards are set by trusted medical experts, not conspiracy theorists!

And protecting New Yorkers also means standing up to ICE agents who abuse their power.

New York is a state that was built by immigrants, people like my own grandparents from Ireland who fled great poverty.

And we don’t forget where we came from.

Over the past year, communities across New York from farms in Sacketts Harbor to factories in Cayuga County to high schools on Long Island have been shaken by aggressive federal immigration actions that go too far.

Just yesterday they arrested an analyst at New York City Hall. An analyst with legal work authorization.

Is this person really one of the baddest of the bad? Is this person really a threat?

I will do whatever it takes to protect New Yorkers from criminals, but people of all political beliefs are saying the same thing about what we’ve seen lately: enough is enough.

New York will not allow the use of State resources to assist in federal immigration raids on people who have not committed serious crimes.

Public safety will always come first, but it must be pursued lawfully and with humanity.

We will not allow masked federal ICE agents to storm into our schools, daycares, hospitals, and houses of worship for civil immigration raids unless they have a judicial warrant, meaning signed by a judge.

And when boundaries are crossed, accountability matters. No one from the president on down is above the law.

Let me repeat: No one.

That’s why I will move to allow New Yorkers to hold ICE agents accountable in court when they act outside the scope of their duties.

This doesn’t interfere with lawful enforcement or public safety.

It simply affirms a core truth: Power does not justify abuse.

And if someone’s constitutional rights are violated here in the state of New York, I say they deserve their day in court.

And no matter what happens in Washington, no matter who’s in the White House, rest assured: Your family and your future are my fight.

History has proven when freedom is on the line New York shows up.

Beginning with the ordinary people who stood up and fought when their freedoms and values were under attack over 250 years ago.

We are the patriots (no, not those Patriots) who forged a new nation.

We are the people who shed blood at Saratoga, blazed a trail from Seneca Falls, demanded dignity at Stonewall.

When the American experiment is put to the test, when the path ahead is dark, it is New Yorkers who light the way forward.

Some of the challenges before us today are very similar to those New Yorkers faced 250 years ago.

Others are new. The battles may look different, but there’s one thing that never changes: And that is the unbreakable spirit and toughness of the people of this state.

You see it every single day. The police officer from Pelham Bay patrolling the streets through the night allowing the rest of us to sleep safely.

Teachers encouraging students to pursue their dreams like my 8th grade social studies teacher Mr. James back at Hamburg Middle School.

The nurse from the North Country who puts her kids to bed before heading to the hospital for the overnight shift.

The fifth generation dairy farmer from Wyoming County up before dawn knowing that people are depending on him for their daily existence.

Different callings, one shared purpose. Showing up, standing guard, doing the work day after day. That’s the legacy we must uphold.

And I believe 250 years from now people will look back on this moment and ask: Did we fight for and uphold our most fundamental values? Did we protect New York as a beacon of opportunity for people all over the world, a place where you can have a family without being crushed by bills, where you can afford a home, where you can start a business or work a farm without being destroyed by tariffs?

Did we properly invest in education, knowing that an educated populace may be our best defense against tyranny?

And when long cherished rights were stripped away and our very democracy was threatened, did we stand up and protect them?

To each of these questions, I know that New Yorkers will accept no answer other than a resounding YES.

That is the essence of my 2026 State of the State.

In the weeks ahead, working with Leader Stewart Cousins and Speaker Heastie we’ll find even more ways to deliver for New Yorkers just as we’ve done these past five years.

Because if there’s one thing I know, it’s that when New Yorkers move forward with strength and compassion side by side there is no challenge we cannot meet, no tyrant we cannot beat and no future we cannot build.

So let’s build that future together with enthusiasm, optimism, and fearlessness.

And to conclude, I say this: let’s go Bills!

Cookies, pixel tags (“web beacons”), HTML Storage Objects, web tags, and embedded scripts within our communications and on our Services to collect data related to usage, location, device and logs.

Among other reasons, we use various cookies and other tracking technologies to provide our Services, authenticate users when visiting our Services, for security purposes (e.g., to prevent fraudulent use of the Services and protect our Services generally), track your preferences, provide personalized recommendations of content, features, and Services, deliver more relevant ads to you as you browse the web, including ads on websites and applications other than on our Services, and help us understand how our websites and communications are being used. For more information on Cookies see the “Cookies and similar Tracking Technologies; “Do Not Track” section immediately below.

Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies

We and our service providers may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our Services as discussed immediately above. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. Among these technologies include:

A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser and device you use to access our Services. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.

A web beacon (also called a web bug or clear GIF) is a graphic on a webpage or in an email message that is designed to monitor who is reading the page or message. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-by-1 pixel in size. Web beacons are often used alongside cookies to track activity. Web beacons may be used to add data to a profile about a site visited, provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a website, gather statistics about usage, among other things.

HTML Storage Objects are program code that collects data about your activity on our Services. The HTML is temporarily downloaded onto your device while you are connected to our Services.

Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the ""Help"" section of your browser for more information (e.g., Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Apple Safari). By blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.

Online Analytics and Advertising

Online Analytics

We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics, Hubspot, LinkedIn, Hotjar, Gainsight and others. These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the “Personal Data We Collect About You and Why” section to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive. The information collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here.

In some cases, we may also associate analytics and usage data with identifiers such as your name or email address, but only as needed to enable our Customers to analyze user engagement, feature usage, or onboarding effectiveness. These tools are used solely on behalf of our Customers to support the Services they direct us to provide. For example, we use Gainsight to support in-product analytics and engagement, on behalf of our Customers, and subject to our role as a service provider.

Tailored Online Advertising

We may personalize the content and advertising that you see when using the Services through the use of third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Services, as well as other websites you visit and other applications you use.

The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and may be tailored to your interests.

We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. You can also use the options below in the ""Rights Regarding Your Information"" section below.

Please note that you may still receive advertisements even if you opt out of tailored advertising. In that case, the ads will just not be tailored. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

Notice to California Residents

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) “share” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising,” and/or (c) “sell” such personal information.

Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration. Our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services as discussed in detail in our Privacy Policy may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA.

Consent. In certain cases, we ask you for your consent to process your personal data, for instance, for certain marketing purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. You can withdraw your consent by using the prompts within the messages you receive, the settings within your account, or by contacting our support using any of the privacy support emails listed at the end of this Policy.

Legitimate Interest. We process certain personal data for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include contacting you to provide support or sending you marketing information (subject to applicable law); detecting, preventing, and investigating illegal activities and potential security issues; and maintaining and improving our Services.

Performance of a Contract We process personal data to perform our obligations under an agreement with you or our Customers. For example, we use payment information you provide when you purchase a Service.

Other Legal Bases. In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal data, such as in response to a court or regulator order. We also may need to process your personal data to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims.

Automated Decision Making and Profiling.

We use an automated chat bot within some of our Services to screen your requests and questions. The purpose of the automated chat bot is to fulfill frequently asked questions provided by our users, tag the requests and questions to route to our most appropriate contact, and improve our responses and Services. The chat bot is not fully automated and will not have a legal or significant impact on you.

Retention and Removal.

For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law.

Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday proposed limiting states’ and Native American tribes’ power to wield the Clean Water Act to block major projects like natural gas pipelines, advancing the Trump administration’s goal of accelerating the construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure and data centers.

The agency said new constraints on local water quality reviews for federally regulated projects will still allow states to protect their environment while preventing unnecessary delays. Successive administrations have seesawed on the scope of states’ power. President Donald Trump’s first administration reduced it, the Biden administration restored it and now the Trump administration is once again adding constraints to what’s called Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.

“When finalized, the proposed rule will increase transparency, efficiency and predictability for certifying authorities and the regulated community,” said Jess Kramer, EPA’s assistant administrator for water. “It will also ensure states and authorized tribes adhere to their Section 401 role.”

The Clean Water Act allows states and some authorized tribes to review what effect pipelines, dams and other federally regulated projects have on water quality within their borders. Pipelines, for example, might cross rivers, streams and wetlands — disruptions that states can scrutinize and that have caused holdups before. In 2017, for example, New York regulators rejected a permit for a pipeline, saying there weren’t sufficient protections for hundreds of streams and wetlands.

The proposed change is similar to EPA’s rule in Trump’s first term. They proposed a clear description of what applicants need to submit to states, strict deadlines for reviews and a requirement that states fully explain why any conditions were placed on a developer or why their permit was rejected.

In 2023, the Biden administration strengthened states’ and tribes’ authority to conduct water quality reviews. Activists at the time praised the change, saying it would help protect the local environment. The agency said then that states should be able to look beyond pollution that’s released directly into waters and instead “holistically evaluate” the impact of a project on local water quality.

The Trump administration wants to do away with that broader authority to focus reviews on direct releases to federally regulated waters. They are doing so at a time when fewer waters are federally regulated by the Clean Water Act. In 2023, the Supreme Court in Sackett v. EPA limited the federal government’s power to regulate millions of acres of wetlands.

Congress has said that when federally backed projects like oil pipelines or nickel mines affect water quality, fishing and drinking water, states and tribes get to review them and reject proposals that will do too much damage, according to Moneen Nasmith, director of national climate, fossil fuel infrastructure at the nonprofit Earthjustice.

“EPA’s claims that states and tribes are overreaching are baseless,” she said. “This proposed rule is trying to solve for a problem that does not exist.”

Under Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA expanded its traditional focus on the environment and public health to include several economic “pillars” like restoring America’s energy dominance — Trump’s shorthand for fossil fuels — and making the U.S. “the artificial intelligence capital of the world.” As demand for new data centers increases, some of these projects will need state water quality permits. Kramer said the update will make the rules for these reviews clear.

“This makes what we are doing in the 401 space crucial, right? Those projects, they need to be able to move forward with certainty,” said Kramer.

A final rule is expected in the spring after a public comment period.

The demonstration facility is set to begin production in mid-2028 and could pave the way for an eventual $850 million plant.","Private equity companies and the federal government are planning to make a $450 million investment in the Atlantic Alumina plant near Gramercy, a move officials say will allow the facility to boost production and clean up longstanding environmental issues.

Concord Resource Holdings and its majority shareholder, Pinnacle Asset Management, will put up more than $300 million for the plant and the Department of Defense will invest $150 million, said David LaPlante, a consultant working on the project.

The money will allow Atalco to bring alumina production up to the 1 million pounds it is capable of delivering. Right now, the plant is producing below that level due to attrition of equipment, LaPlante said.

Founded in 1959 by Kaiser Aluminum, the refinery extracts alumina from red bauxite ore. Alumina is smelted and used to make aluminum and it also has a number of uses in the defense, aerospace and automotive supply chain.

Over the years, alumina production has shifted to China because of what chemical industry officials have labeled as unfair trade practices. The Gramercy facility is the last alumina refinery in the U.S.

The investment will allow the plant to keep its current 500 jobs and will lead to some additional hiring, when a gallium production facility opens at the plant. It will be the first large-scale gallium production facility in the U.S., capable of producing up to 50 million metric tons a year. Gallium is used to make semiconductors.

The exact number of new jobs that will be created by the gallium production facility has not been determined and the timetable for construction is not known yet.

In a joint statement, Gov. Jeff Landry and Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois praised the investment as advancing national security while supporting advanced manufacturing.

""This announcement marks a significant win for Louisiana and for the nation. Atalco’s $450 million strategic partnership with the United States government will revitalize a critical industrial facility, retain skilled jobs and position America to produce essential materials domestically at a time when supply chain security has never been more important,"" the statement says.

The investment will also allow Atalco to address environmental issues that have plagued the facility. Massive waste piles, which are as tall as buildings, lie in hundreds of acres along the Mississippi River. The piles have been a source of dust complaints and caustic liquid leaks.

A Southeastern Louisiana University researcher said runoff from the red mud is a potential source of heavy metal and other pollutants in Lake Maurepas and leaks may also be reaching the Blind River. Atalco has rejected those suggestions.

“This facility has been in survival mode and staying alive under pressure,” LaPlante said, which means it hasn’t been able to invest in environmental and health and safety issues like it wants to.

Already some effects from the investment are being seen at the facility. Instead of staking up piles of red mud, water is now being squeezed out of the waste, creating a hard dry material, much like pavement. That allows flat, compacted layers of waste to be stacked up on one another “like a Doberge cake”, said Renwick Deville, another consultant on the project. That eliminates issues with dust and liquid runoff.

The new investment would be the second at Atalco in the past month that supporters said will reduce the waste at the plant. ElementUSA said it will build a demonstration plant that will extract ""gallium, scandium, iron and other critical minerals"" from the piles of red mud. The demonstration facility is set to begin production in mid-2028 and could pave the way for an eventual $850 million plant.

The Atalco upgrades and ElementUSA's demonstration plant will complement each other, LaPlante and Deveille said.

But MaryLee Orr, executive director of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, which filed a lawsuit in federal court late last year over the ponds of red mud waste at Atalco, said questions remain about the expansion, given the plant's troubling track record.

""Of course, it is a positive to remove a hazardous material from their waste stream and put it to good and needed use. But will it be done in a way that is protective of the workers, the community, and the environment,"" she said in a statement.

Pollution, health, and long-term impacts

While the facility would replace an older coal plant, opponents argue that natural gas still produces pollution and could affect air quality and health across the Lowcountry. Activists say once built, the plant could operate for 30 to 40 years — further locking South Carolina into fossil fuels and slowing the transition to cleaner energy sources.

“That community already dealt with increased rates of asthma and cancer,” said Belvin Olasov, director of the Charleston Climate Coalition. “Now we have more fossil fuel polluting industry trying to move into the exact same spot to further deepen those health wounds.”

Opponents also say the plant’s proximity to the Edisto River raises concerns beyond Colleton County, including potential impacts to downstream drinking water supplies used by the Charleston region.

Questions about data centers and energy demand

Some protesters are questioning whether the proposed plant is being built in part to support growing electricity demand from data centers.

“The reason we’re being told we need this energy isn’t just organic growth from people moving here,” Olasov said. “The reason is primarily data centers.”

Dominion Energy disputes that claim, saying it has not attributed the need for the new power plant to data centers and that a proposed data center in Colleton County is not located within its service area.

Dominion Energy response

In a statement, Dominion Energy said the Canadys Station is critical in meeting increased customer demand for electricity and supporting economic prosperity in South Carolina, which it notes is one of the fastest-growing states in the nation. The company said the facility would use proven technology and state-of-the-art environmental protections, calling the natural gas plant a reliable and highly efficient source of energy that will help secure South Carolina’s energy future.

Dominion Energy said the Canadys site was selected because of its established footprint, which would eliminate the need to acquire and clear large areas of new land. The site is located approximately 40 miles northwest of Charleston in Colleton County and is positioned at what the company described as the energy intersection of the Lowcountry, with strong electric transmission connectivity to major load centers and proximity to existing and planned Santee Cooper transmission lines.

The company also emphasized that the facility would incorporate advanced air-cooling technology, resulting in exceptionally efficient use of water resources and minimal impacts to the Edisto River or groundwater. According to Dominion Energy, the Canadys Station would use about 90 percent less water than the retired coal-fired generating plant that previously operated at the site.

What happens next

Environmental groups say Tuesday’s protest is only the beginning and are calling on regulators to reject the proposal and explore alternative energy solutions.

“Our ask to Dominion is to go back to the drawing board,” Olasov said. “We think Dominion needs to commission a real study into the feasibility of investing in other fuels instead of pushing a massive gas plant through too fast.”

The final decision now rests with the South Carolina Public Service Commission, which is expected to determine whether the project will move forward on April 14.",https://abcnews4.com/resources/media2/16x9/800/1320/0x75/90/a98346f0-5037-4380-a0d9-4c80149b9371-Image.jfif,N,,2026-01-13 22:12:35.294147

Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency says it will stop calculating how much money is saved in health care costs and preventable deaths avoided from air pollution rules that curb two deadly pollutants.

The change means the EPA will focus rules for fine particulate matter and ozone only on the cost to industry, part of a broader realignment under President Donald Trump toward a business-friendly approach that has included the rollback of multiple policies meant to safeguard human health and the environment and slow climate change.

The agency said in a statement late Monday that it “absolutely remains committed to our core mission of protecting human health and the environment"" but “will not be monetizing the impacts at this time.” The EPA will continue to estimate costs to businesses to comply with the rules and will continue “ongoing work to refine its economic methodologies” of pollution rules, spokeswoman Brigit Hirsch said.

Environmental and public health advocates called the agency's action a dangerous abdication of one of its core missions.

“The EPA’s mandate is to protect public health, not to ignore the science in order to eliminate clean air safeguards that save lives,'' said John Walke, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

He called the change in how public health benefits are calculated “reckless, dangerous, and illegal,'' adding: “By pretending real health benefits do not count, EPA wants to open the door for industry to foul the air, while communities and families pay the price in asthma attacks, heart disease and premature deaths.”

The change in how the EPA calculates health benefits was first reported by The New York Times.

The move is part of the EPA's broader change in approach

The move comes as the Trump administration is seeking to abandon a rule that sets tough standards for deadly soot pollution, arguing that the Biden administration did not have authority to set the tighter standard on pollution from tailpipes, smokestacks and other industrial sources.

In a court filing in November, the EPA said the Biden-era rule was done “without the rigorous, stepwise process that Congress required” and was therefore unlawful.

The EPA said it continues to recognize the “clear and well-documented benefits” of reducing fine particulate matter, also known as PM2.5, and ozone.

“Not monetizing DOES NOT equal not considering or not valuing the human health impact,” Hirsch said in an emailed statement, saying the agency remains committee to human health.

Since the EPA’s creation more than 50 years ago, Republican and Democratic administrations have used different estimates to assign monetary value to a human life in cost-benefit analyses.

Under former President Joe Biden, the EPA estimated that its proposed rule on PM2.5 would prevent up to 4,500 premature deaths and 290,000 lost workdays by 2032. For every $1 spent on reducing PM2.5, the agency said, there could be as much as $77 in health benefits.

But the Trump administration contends that these estimates are misleading. By failing to include ranges or other qualifying statements, EPA’s use of specific estimate “leads the public to believe the Agency has a better understanding of the monetized impacts of exposure to PM2.5 and ozone than in reality,” the agency said in an economic impact analysis for the new NOx rule.

“Therefore, to rectify this error, the EPA is no longer monetizing benefits from PM2.5 and ozone but will continue to quantify the emissions until the Agency is confident enough in the modeling to properly monetize those impacts.”

The United States has made substantial progress in reducing PM2.5 and ozone concentrations since 2000, the agency said.

Critics warn the change poses risks to human health

But critics said a new EPA rule that revises emission limits for dangerous nitrogen oxide pollution from new gas-burning turbines used in power plants demonstrates the risks of the new approach.

Emissions of nitrogen oxide, also known as NOx, form smog and soot that is harmful to human health and linked to serious heart and lung diseases. EPA’s final NOx rule, issued Monday, is substantially less restrictive than a proposal under the Biden administration. For some gas plants, the rule weakens protections in place for two decades.

The new rule does not estimate the economic value of health benefits from reducing NOx and other types of air pollution under the Clean Air Act. Critics said the change means EPA will ignore the economic value of lives saved, hospital visits avoided and lost work and school days prevented.

Under Trump, the EPA ""recklessly refuses to place any value on protecting the health of millions of Americans from nitrogen oxides pollution in the face of mountains of medical science finding that this pollution contributes to asthma attacks, heart disease and other serious health problems.” said Noha Haggag, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund, another environmental group.

“EPA is leaving millions of people in harm’s way when common sense solutions are at hand for modern national limits on nitrogen oxides pollution,'' Haggag said.

“The Trump EPA is unequivocally committed to following the Clean Air Act, and EPA legally cannot approve Colorado’s SIP revision,” the agency wrote.
“Colorado submitted a highly protective, innovative plan that met all state and federal requirements to reduce regional haze,” Ogletree said.
Either process would require the state to craft a new long-term strategy consistent with Clean Air Act requirements and the agency’s updated regional haze rule.
The decision also arrives as the EPA has formally delayed the next planning phase of the regional haze program.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Friday rejected Colorado’s latest air-quality plan aimed at improving visibility in the state’s national parks and wilderness areas, saying the measure violated federal law by forcing the closure of coal-fired power plants without the consent of plant operators.

The EPA’s full disapproval of Colorado’s 2022 Regional Haze State Implementation Plan, wrote the agency, was necessary to prevent “the premature closure of power plants” and to uphold the Clean Air Act.

“The Trump administration chose dirtier air and higher costs … and rejected Colorado’s and utilities’ careful plans to save people money and increase energy availability and reliability,” the office of Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a Tuesday statement to the newspaper. “Keeping old coal plants online will increase costs to ratepayers, worsen air quality, and make it harder to bring lower cost and cleaner generation online.”

The Regional Haze Program , adopted in 1999, requires states to reduce airborne pollutants that impair views at national parks and wilderness areas.

“Reliable baseload energy sources are essential to Powering the Great American Comeback and ensuring families have cost-effective energy,” wrote EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in the statement. “EPA is ready and willing to work full-heartedly with Colorado to revise its SIP, ensuring full compliance with the Clean Air Act as written.”

The agency said Colorado’s inclusion of non-consensual retirement dates — in particular, the proposed 2028 closure of Colorado Springs Utilities’ Nixon Unit 1 — lacked the legal assurances required under Section 110 of the Clean Air Act, noting that the plan failed to show that such retirements would not constitute an unlawful taking of private property.

The EPA also cited concerns regarding the plan’s harmful impacts to “grid reliability,” referencing the Department of Energy’s Dec. 30 emergency order requiring Craig Station’s Unit 1 to continue operating until at least March 30, 2026 due to an energy “emergency” in the West.

“The Trump EPA is unequivocally committed to following the Clean Air Act, and EPA legally cannot approve Colorado’s SIP revision,” the agency wrote. “Shutting down these power plants is not necessary to meet regional haze requirements, and including forced closure deadlines for facilities that want to stay open would have been a misuse of the CAA.”

According to the statement, Colorado has two years to submit a “revised, approvable” plan — otherwise the EPA will complete a “federal implementation plan.”

Federal rejection sets off political and policy backlash

Colorado leaders swiftly criticized the move as a setback for both climate goals and consumer savings.

The governor’s office called the decision “out of touch with the realities of the electric grid in Colorado,” arguing that the state’s utilities have already planned — and in many cases begun — to retire aging coal plants based on cost, not politics.

In the case of Craig Station, Tri-State confirmed to the newspaper last month that the plant, as a result of the Department of Energy’s emergency order, “will likely require additional investments in operations, repairs, maintenance and, potentially, fuel supply, all factors increasing costs.”

While the agency’s disapproval does dictate that state coal plant closures are not federally enforceable, the closures are included in state regulation, meaning they remain enforceable through state law.

“President Trump’s so-called ‘energy emergency’ is being used to justify tying the hands of utilities, forcing them to keep aging, outdated power plants open,” said U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet in a statement.

“It’s unacceptable to burden ratepayers with unnecessary costs,” he continued. “Federal intervention like this makes long-term planning impossible — this is not how you operate a business, plan an electric grid, or help a community stay prosperous.”

Bennet accused the White House of using federal energy policy to retaliate against states like Colorado that have adopted more aggressive clean-energy goals, adding that “President Trump continues to take out his personal and political grievances on Coloradans who are already struggling to make ends meet.”

Michael Ogletree, senior director of state air quality programs at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said in a statement the EPA’s decision undermines progress under the very program it was meant to advance.

“Colorado submitted a highly protective, innovative plan that met all state and federal requirements to reduce regional haze,” Ogletree said.

“EPA’s action is not based on a failure to meet visibility protections, which Colorado continues to meet,” he continued. “The decision reflects a disagreement over our inclusion of coal-fired power plant retirement dates — a provision that signals the state’s commitment to a cleaner energy future and aligns with existing law and market realities.”

“Regardless of EPA’s decision, Colorado will continue to lead,” he added, noting that the state has shown “that it is possible to protect public health, reduce pollution, and maintain a reliable energy system at the same time.”

Ogletree said the department is continuing to review the EPA’s disapproval and is “considering taking next steps.”

Tri-State weighs in

In a Tuesday statement to the newspaper, Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, which co-owns Craig Station, said it was evaluating the implications of EPA’s decision.

“Tri-State is reviewing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s disapproval of plant closure dates included in Colorado’s revised 2022 Regional Haze State Implementation Plan, particularly as it relates to Craig Generating Station,” wrote Tri-State Public Relations Specialist Mark Stutz.

“Tri-State appreciates the federal government’s focus on grid reliability and rising energy demand in the West, as they remain our members’ top priorities,” he added. “Regardless of market conditions and regulatory landscape, we are committed to meet our members’ needs in the most reliable, affordable and responsible way possible.”

In Northwest Colorado, the ruling could keep coal generation at the Craig Station operating longer than expected.

Tri-State originally decided to close the plant by the end of 2025 as part of its move to more environmentally-friendly energy sources. It plans to close the Craig station’s two other coal-burning plants by 2028.

Those plans remain in effect under state law, but will no longer be federally enforceable pending a new plan proposed by the state or federal implementation plan through the EPA.

What happens next

Under federal law, Colorado must now resubmit a revised SIP that meets EPA’s conditions or face a federally imposed implementation plan within two years. Either process would require the state to craft a new long-term strategy consistent with Clean Air Act requirements and the agency’s updated regional haze rule.

The decision also arrives as the EPA has formally delayed the next planning phase of the regional haze program.

The same day the federal Department of Energy ordered Craig Station’s Unit 1 to remain open, Zeldin extended the deadline for states to submit the next round of state plans from 2028 to 2031, citing the need for additional time to align state plans with the agency’s forthcoming regulatory overhaul of the haze program.

The EPA initially proposed a partial approval of the plan in July 2025, citing general alignment with visibility objectives but warning that certain provisions raised legal questions.

After a 60-day public comment period, the agency pivoted to full disapproval following energy supply concerns and the DOE’s emergency directive to keep the Craig unit online.

In the Friday statement, EPA Regional Administrator Cyrus Western said the final ruling is “fully compliant with the Clean Air Act while simultaneously providing for clean air for all Americans,” emphasizing that the agency “is ready and willing to work full-heartedly with Colorado to revise its SIP, ensuring full compliance with the Clean Air Act as written.”

The disapproval underscores a familiar tension between state ambition and federal authority, and raises new questions about the limits of state-driven climate action under an administration prioritizing fossil fuel use for reliability.

For now, the EPA says its “line of communication” with Colorado is open, and the agency “looks forward to working hand in hand” with the state on a new plan.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/8/2025/12/31105222/Station-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 19:00:27.918567

The proposed rule would revise a 2023 rule by former President Joe Biden’s administration on Section 401 of the Clean Water Act that gave states and tribes authority to protect waterways in their reviews of projects like pipelines and power plants requiring federal permits. Biden’s rule replaced a rule from President Donald Trump’s first administration that limited the ability of states and tribes to block or force changes in the projects.

Jess Kramer, the EPA assistant administrator for water, told reporters the 2023 revision was “fundamentally flawed and it’s inefficient and ineffective.” Kramer said Biden’s revision led to lengthy certification timelines. The proposed rule, Kramer said, will lead to predictable permitting that would “unleash American energy dominance” and support emerging artificial intelligence infrastructure.

Biden’s rule had been praised by conservationists and environmental justice groups concerned about pollution effects on waterways and communities depending on them.

Kramer said the proposed rule will ensure that section 401 is “not weaponized by states to shut down projects for political purposes.” It would set timelines and standardize approaches that states and tribes use in water quality certifications that are required before the federal government issues project permits, the EPA said.

It was the latest move by Trump’s environmental agency to roll back Biden-era environmental rules while supporting development of energy including fossil fuels. The Biden administration had already narrowed the rule in August 2023 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 9-0 to limit the regulatory reach of the EPA on the rule, after many farmers and landowners had slammed the agency for what they called regulatory overreach.

The proposed rule will undergo a 30-day comment period and the EPA hopes to finalize the rule in the spring, Kramer said.

Aquatech further processed lithium produced at Adionics’ facility to validate the conversion and refining to battery-grade lithium carbonate. In additional testing, Aquatech converted the lithium-rich brine to a ≥99.5% lithium carbonate product, meeting key specifications for battery manufacturing.

Following the testing results, the parties will continue to move forward under their joint development agreement to evaluate the construction of a lithium facility in Wendover.

The companies have agreed to complete comprehensive feasibility studies and detailed engineering of a 5,000 metric tonne lithium extraction facility and plan to reach a final investment decision in 2026. They also intend to advance project design and development of the project and negotiate definitive agreements to enable construction and operation of the proposed project.

The lithium processing facility is expected to use some of Intrepid’s existing infrastructure in Wendover, Aquatech’s expertise to design, develop and operate the site and Adionics’ direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology to convert Intrepid’s post-process brine to lithium carbonate.

Adionics acquired the technology from Koch Technology Solutions in September 2025.

“Advancements in direct lithium extraction (DLE) technologies have come at the perfect time, as the United States has reprioritized increasing its production of critical minerals,” said Kevin Crutchfield, Intrepid’s CEO. “We believe the existing infrastructure at our Wendover potash operation and the presence of lithium in our post-process brine differentiates this opportunity from other lithium development projects and we’re hopeful our Wendover lithium project will be among the first domestic projects to enter the market.”

“We are excited about this project for many reasons, including the advantage we have by working with Intrepid to be able to access brine from Intrepid’s existing potash production site. Coupled with the naturally high lithium concentration in the resource, we expect our integrated flowsheet will operate at an attractive marginal cost, allowing us to produce domestic lithium at a pace and cost point that can compete with global benchmarks,” added Devesh Sharma, CEO of Aquatech.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/intrepid-potash-utah.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 19:58:49.330615

Under the old federal tax credit, used EVs qualified for up to $4,000 in tax credits.
The EV tax credit was added in 2022 by the Biden administration.
What happened after the federal EV tax credit went away?","California is gearing up to plug a major hole in the nation’s electric-vehicle landscape. With the federal $7,500 EV tax credit wiped out by President Donald Trump and Congress late last year, Gov. Gavin Newsom is moving to deploy state dollars to keep electric car sales from losing momentum.

On Friday, Jan. 9, Newsom unveiled a $200 million plan to offer a new “on‑the‑hood” rebate—an instant discount at the dealership aimed at softening the blow for California drivers and preserving the state’s status as the country’s EV stronghold. While Newsom didn’t specify how large the rebate will be, he cast the effort as California once again stepping in where Washington won’t.

Here's what to know about the California EV rebate program.

Why is California stepping in to offer EV tax credits?

California has the highest percentage of car buyers who choose electric cars.

According to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which lobbies in Washington for most major automakers, EVs and hybrids accounted for 22.9 percent of new light-duty vehicle registrations in California in the second quarter of 2025, the most recent data the group has made publicly available. Colorado was the only others state above 20 percent market share in the second quarter of 2025.

Carmakers have lamented the loss of the federal incentive for EVs, and several have slashed plans to build future electric models in light of the shift in the federal government's support for the technology.

California Air Resources Board Chairwoman Lauren Sanchez said in an exclusive interview with USA Today that her state is stepping up to offer EV tax credits because ""the rest of the global market is moving toward' Zero Emission Vehicles, despite the backsliding in the level of federal support under Trump.

Sanchez said embracing EVs is ""a point of pride in California"" because ""a third of EV sales are in California.""

Under California's previous EV tax credit program, which ran from 2013-2024, the state spent $1.49 billion to cover credits for 586,000 vehicles, according to CARB.

Do used EVs qualify for tax credits?

Under the old federal tax credit, used EVs qualified for up to $4,000 in tax credits. The EV tax credit was added in 2022 by the Biden administration. Prior to that, only new EVs qualified for any tax credits.

Sanchez said California is still sorting out whether it will be able to offer a used EV tax credit under Newsom's plan.

""The team is taking a hard look at how we can a used incentive work, given how important used EVs are in California,"" she said.

How Californians can get the tax credit rebate

California officials say the program will function as an “on‑the‑hood” discount, meaning buyers receive the rebate instantly at the dealership rather than waiting for tax season. Here’s what to expect based on how similar state programs have operated:

Point‑of‑sale enrollment: Buyers will likely sign a short form at participating dealerships, which will apply the discount directly to the purchase price.

Income and vehicle requirements (pending): CARB says it is still finalizing details, but past programs included income limits and price caps to prioritize middle‑income buyers and affordable EV models.

New vs. used EVs: California hasn’t confirmed whether used EVs will qualify, but officials say they are evaluating options due to the state’s large used‑EV market.

Launch timeline: Newsom’s office has not announced a launch date, but the administration says it aims to offer rebates “soon,” with CARB expected to publish full eligibility rules once finalized.

What happened after the federal EV tax credit went away?

Several of the most popular electric car models experienced steep sales drops in the fourth quarter of 2025, after setting records in the third quarter as car buyers rushed to take advantage of the $7,500 federal tax credit before it expired at the end of September 2025.

Here's how some of the top-selling U.S. EVs fared in the third quarter compared to the fourth quarter:

Tesla Model 3 and Model Y | Q3 2025: 481,166 | Q4 2025: 406,585

Ford Mustang Mach-E | Q3 2025: 20,177 | Q4 2025: 9,658

Hyundai Ioniq 5 | Q3 2025: 8,408 | Q4 2025: 2,279

Honda Prologue | Q3 2025: 20,236 | Q4 2025: 2,641

Volkwagen ID.4 | Q3 2025: 4,518 | Q4 2025: 248

What people are saying about California's move to backfill EV tax credits?

Automakers cheered California's move to step in and offer tax credits for EV buyers in the nation's most populous state, saying incentivizing EV sales has worked in the past.

""At this stage of the transition and given current market conditions, consumer incentives can lead to more EV adoption and affordability in California – and support the automotive and battery industrial base across the country,” John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, said in a statement.","https://www.desertsun.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/30/PNAS/87961172007-tesla-charging.jpg?crop=1919,1079,x0,y0&width=1919&height=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-13 19:00:13.544237

Unlike Oklo, however, TerraPower has focused almost all of its attention on a single design: its Natrium reactor.
TerraPower, like Oklo, has its share of private partnerships to complement its federal collaborations.
The terms of Meta’s deal with TerraPower are, as of now, less developed than those with Oklo.","Oklo’s existing pipeline: Oklo enters this deal with Meta as it works through a complicated network of partnerships with the Department of Energy along with tentative commitments in the private sector.

In 2025 alone, Oklo announced a number of deals with companies like Vertiv, Liberty, Kiewit, Blykalla, and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power.

As for DOE programs, first, in August, Oklo was selected for the Reactor Pilot Program. The company’s selection was noteworthy, because three of its projects were chosen for the program, whereas other companies have only one project.

Oklo was also selected for the related Fuel Line Pilot Program, which focuses on fuel fabrication facilities rather than new reactor builds. Since then, the company has broken ground on the site of its first Aurora reactor at Idaho National Laboratory (dubbed Aurora-INL), has signed an other transaction agreement with the DOE, and has received approval for its Nuclear Safety Design Agreement for its Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility, also at INL.

New Auroras: Meta’s partnership with Oklo will center on a new facility in Pike County, Ohio. Targeted to come on line as early as 2030, the campus could feature as much as 1.2 GW of new nuclear capacity.

This capacity will come from the deployment of multiple Aurora reactors. Because of the reactor’s complicated history, however, some details are still up in the air. In 2016, Oklo entered into preapplication activities with the NRC for a 1.5-MW version of the Aurora. The eventual license application for that project was denied by the NRC in 2022. Since then, the planned capacity of the reactor has changed several times.

Aurora-INL is rated at 75 MWe. Assuming the Auroras deployed with Meta will mirror the design of Aurora-INL, the Ohio site could be home to as many as 16 reactors.

Oklo coming to Ohio makes good on plans that have been in the making since 2023, when it signed an agreement with the Southern Ohio Diversification Initiative to deploy two 15-MWe Auroras on land near the site of the former Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant.

More deals for TerraPower: Like Oklo, TerraPower is entering into this new collaboration with Meta boosted by tailwinds of DOE support. Unlike Oklo, however, TerraPower has focused almost all of its attention on a single design: its Natrium reactor.

The first deployment of the Natrium reactor will be in Kemmerer, Wyo., where the company broke ground on nonnuclear construction in June 2024. This project was first selected for fast-tracking under the DOE’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program in 2020.

On that front, TerraPower has made persistent progress. Most recently, the NRC completed its final safety evaluation for the project’s construction permit application in December 2025. The company expects to complete the project in 2030. TerraPower is also supported by the DOE’s HALEU Availability Program and was allocated HALEU in 2025.

TerraPower, like Oklo, has its share of private partnerships to complement its federal collaborations. In 2025 alone, the company signed an MOU with the Utah Office of Energy Development to potentially site a Natrium reactor in the state; signed an MOU with engineering company KBR to conduct joint studies on deploying a Natrium reactor in the U.K., building on its broader engagement in the U.K. regulatory process; and signed an MOU with Evergy and the Kansas Department of Commerce to potentially site a Natrium reactor in that state as well.

The terms of Meta’s deal with TerraPower are, as of now, less developed than those with Oklo. The locations of the eight potential reactors that the partnership could involve are currently undecided. TerraPower said in a statement that the companies “will target identification of a specific site for the initial dual reactor unit in the coming months.”

TerraPower is aiming for the first units in this new project to come on line as early as 2032. The terms of the deal state that Meta will support early development activity for the first two new units, and hold rights for energy from up to six additional units.",https://www.ans.org/file/23147/l/OkloTerraPowerLogos.png,N,,2026-01-13 18:13:45.137208

This comprehensive document is a win for Texans and all Americans alike. It is a bold roadmap for House Republicans’ next reconciliation bill that aims to tackle the affordability crisis created by former President Biden’s administration.

The plan lays out a clear, actionable strategy to restore the American Dream of homeownership, reduce health care premiums, cut energy prices, rebuild the American family, and slash wasteful government spending while codifying President Trump's America First agenda that puts American families, not Washington bureaucrats, first.

“Texans are tired of excuses from Washington. They want lower prices, less government, and real results,” said RSC Chairman August Pfluger (TX-11). “It’s no secret that families across the nation are paying more for gas, housing, and health care because of failed Biden-era policies. This plan takes a sledgehammer to that unaffordable agenda, cutting waste, unleashing American energy, and making it easier for Texans to own a home, afford high-quality health care, and keep more of their hard-earned paycheck. We have 11 months of guaranteed majorities. We're not wasting a single day.”

For years, hardworking Texans have been stretched thin from skyrocketing prices for groceries, gas, rent, and health care. The RSC's Reconciliation 2.0 framework flips the script.

A Plan Built Around Affordability

The RSC’s Reconciliation 2.0 Framework centers on three pillars rooted in building off the success of the Working Families Tax Cuts to deliver lasting affordability:

· Housing: restoring the American Dream of homeownership by expanding supply, lowering mortgage barriers, eliminating marriage penalties, and stopping policies that crowd Americans out of the housing market.

· Health Care: putting patients back in control, lowering drug prices, increasing transparency, and ensuring taxpayer-funded benefits serve American citizens—not bureaucrats or special interests.

· Energy: unleashing American energy dominance by cutting red tape, accelerating permitting, and driving down energy bills and prices at the pump.

The framework also achieves over$1 trillion in net deficit reduction, and permanently codifies more of President Trump’s historic executive actions so future administrations cannot reverse them.

""this is a politically framed announcement about weakening how states and tribes can block federally permitted projects using water quality rules, dressed up as “streamlining” and “efficiency.”

Here is what it actually means in plain English.

What is Clean Water Act Section 401?

Section 401 gives states and authorized tribes the power to say yes, no, or yes-with-conditions to federally permitted projects that could affect their waters.

Examples: pipelines, dams, power plants, transmission lines.

They can block or condition a project if it would violate state or tribal water quality standards.

This is one of the strongest tools states and tribes have to protect local water.

What changed in 2023?

The Biden EPA rule:

Let states and tribes look broadly at water impacts

Allowed more time and back-and-forth to fully review projects

Let them deny projects not just for narrow pollution issues, but for wider water quality harms

Industry and Republican lawmakers said this gave states too much power to slow or stop projects they didn’t like.

What is the Trump EPA proposing now?

The proposed rule would:

Narrow what states and tribes are allowed to consider

Force faster decisions, even for complex projects

Limit denials only to very specific, narrowly defined water quality issues

Prevent states and tribes from using Section 401 to block projects for climate, land use, treaty rights, or cumulative impacts

In practice, it makes it much harder for states or tribes to say no.

What does “streamline permitting” really mean here?

Translated:

Fewer reasons states/tribes can deny a project

Less time to review

Less leverage to demand changes

More projects automatically move forward

This primarily benefits:

Energy projects (pipelines, LNG, coal, transmission)

Large infrastructure developers

What does “eliminating regulatory overreach” mean?

This is political language, not a neutral legal term.

It means:

“We think states and tribes were using their authority too aggressively”

“We want to reduce their power”

Why does this matter?

Because it:

Shifts power from states and tribes to federal agencies and developers

Weakens tribal sovereignty in water protection decisions

Increases the likelihood that projects get approved even over local objections

Makes environmental review faster but shallower

Supporters call this economic growth.

Critics call it rolling back environmental and tribal protections.

All wildlife species - particularly migratory waterfowl - that journey across multiple states know no geo-political or economic boundaries. Waterways within states or tribal territories - potholes and vernal pools, e.g. - serve as essential stopover sites for migrating wildlife to nourish and rest during their journeys across the states.

Furthermore, while some waterways whose surface area is within state or tribal boundaries, their aquifers and water tables often cross state and tribal boundaries.

It is a fool's errand, therefore, to allow water quality in such waterways to be compromised - also at the risk of human health and lives - by the acts of greedy industrial corporations and their billionaire executives who seek economic self-enrichment at the expense of the very natural resources upon which even their own lives depend.

If this is what's called ""making America great,"" then someone has an awfully warped sense of what ""great"" is.

Washington, D.C. - Today, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY-14) highlighted widespread job loss across New York State as a result of billions of dollars in project cancellations(link is external) by the Department of Energy (DOE) during a hearing in the Subcommittee on Energy of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.

At the hearing Representative Ocasio-Cortez questioned Alex Fitzsimmons, Acting Undersecretary of Energy and Director of the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) at the U.S. Department of Energy. Mr. Fitzsimmons spearheads President Trump’s “dominance(link is external)” agenda, which had a stated goal of increasing good-paying jobs in the energy sector. However, across the country, families are losing much needed jobs and the state is losing private investment due to DOE project cancellations.

Find Representative Ocasio-Cortez’s remarks as delivered below:

“Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.

Undersecretary Fitzsimmons, you served at the Department of Energy during President Trump's first term, correct?

Yes, I did.

And you've also held a number of positions in this term, including Chief of Staff to Energy Secretary Wright, correct?

I did, yes.

Great. I'm hoping that you could help me understand more about the agency's decision making process.

You know, we've talked about how there have been many clean energy projects that have been canceled over the last year. In fact, since January of last year, over 170,000 energy jobs across the country on clean energy projects have been lost or impacted due to the policy changes from your department.

One company canceled plans for a battery manufacturing facility in Buckeye, Arizona that cost 6,400 jobs to the local community. Glendale, Kentucky, has lost over 150,000 jobs due to another manufacturing facility closure.

As Chief of Staff to Secretary Wright and as acting Undersecretary, were there assessments done on how many jobs would be lost due to these decisions?

Well, my understanding is that when an applicant submits an application, there is a comprehensive assessment because we need to understand what the jobs-

I’m not speaking to applications. I'm talking about, you know, policy changes around tax credits, around other sorts of I mean, it can include applications as well, but did you do an assessment on how many American jobs would be lost prior to you making your policy conclusions?

I think we're always continuously assessing-

I think it's pretty simple. Did you do the assessments? Did you do the assessment on how many jobs would be lost before making a choice, or did you not do the assessment?

We review the applications as they come in, and part of that can be the jobs-

That sounds like a no to me, Undersecretary, that 170,000 Americans have lost their job due to the policy changes implemented by you and your department, and you didn't even think about it.

There was no assessment. 170,000 Americans out of a job, out of health insurance, out of any opportunity- battery manufacturing plants in Georgia, Arizona, Kentucky.

And you are telling me that there was not an assessment done on how many Americans were going to lose their job before you made your decisions and before this administration made decisions on revoking tax credits, manufacturing credits that were going to affect these facilities, that is what I'm being told today. Is that correct?

No. As I mentioned, we have a comprehensive review process for all applications-

And does that process include how many jobs would be lost?

Job numbers are typically-

That sounds like a no to me. That sounds like a no to me, Undersecretary Fitzsimmons.

Now I want to move forward. In Newnan, Georgia, a company planning a battery manufacturing facility walked back a $2.6 billion investment in the state of Georgia.

The company cited the clean energy tax credits that were critical to its decision to invest in the project, and the Trump administration's reversal and decimation of these tax credits ended a $2.6 billion energy investment in the state of Georgia alone. You must be aware that under President Trump, the United States, in just a year, has lost $53 billion in clean energy investment in our infrastructure.

So what I am trying to understand, since you have described yourself as “spearheading” the Department of Energy's dominance agenda, is why- and under President Trump's energy dominance executive order, it talks about good paying jobs. So how is this administration, and how are you, assessing these projects when we have resulted in a net loss of 170,000 jobs?

As I mentioned, we have a comprehensive review process. President Trump is focused on restoring American energy dominance after years, four years, of disastrous energy subtraction policies. And so we're investing in an affordable, reliable and secure-

So we’re doing that by cutting American jobs, and then trying to invade Venezuela to compensate?

Thank you. I yield back.”

Certifying authorities can certify the project as proposed, impose conditions on the federal permit, deny certification, or waive it.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Environmental Protection Agency announced a proposed rule today to restrict the authority of states and Tribes to ensure that federally permitted projects such as oil and gas pipelines and hydropower dams do not undermine water quality. The proposal would make it harder for states and Tribes to deny or modify projects that pollute or degrade rivers, wetlands, and drinking water sources.

The following is a reaction from Jon Devine, senior attorney and director of freshwater ecosystems at NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council):

“The Clean Water Act empowers states and Tribes to stop or fix projects that would foul their waters. EPA's proposal would weaken the law to fast-track pipelines and other polluting projects, leaving it to people downstream to pay the price without input in the process. Instead of sidelining experts, the Agency should abandon its latest attack on our waterways, follow the Clean Water Act, and let communities keep their rivers, lakes, and drinking water supplies safe.”

Background:

What does the proposal do? This proposed rule would dramatically curtail state and Tribal authority under section 401 of the Clean Water Act.

What Section 401 does: Before a federal license or permit is issued for a project that may discharge into protected waters, the project developer must obtain “certification” from the relevant state or authorized Tribe that the project will comply with water quality requirements. Certifying authorities can certify the project as proposed, impose conditions on the federal permit, deny certification, or waive it.

Practical effect: Among other things, the proposal would greatly limit the authority of states and Tribes to look at the whole proposed project and force them to ignore project‑related pollution risks that threaten downstream communities and ecosystems.

Established in 1970, NRDC uses science, policy, law and people power to confront the climate crisis, protect public health and safeguard nature.

By September 2024, 15,000 young people had joined the American Climate Corps, according to the administration, working to restore landscapes and install solar panels around the country.
American Climate Corps jobs were in blue states and red states, in rural areas and cities, according to research published in November.
“You can cancel the Climate Corps, but … a lot of what communities need right now has to do with responding to and preparing for climate change-exacerbated extreme events,” Fisher said.
“In that, we are also building a broader coalition and showing that the Climate Corps Network is not maybe what everyone thinks it is,” Glazewski said.","Two long years ago, it appeared that the much-anticipated American Climate Corps was finally happening. President Joe Biden had promised to build a green jobs workforce inspired by the Civilian Conservation Corps, one of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s most popular New Deal programs, ever since he was on the campaign trail. By September 2024, 15,000 young people had joined the American Climate Corps, according to the administration, working to restore landscapes and install solar panels around the country.

It didn’t even last a year. The Biden administration wound down the program last January ahead of President Donald Trump’s return to the White House, correctly anticipating that Trump would take a hammer to anything with “climate” in the name.

But even as climate change fell off the national agenda and the promise of federal funding vanished, some states have found ways to continue to support Climate Corps-style work over the past year. Their efforts show what’s still politically viable — and under what conditions these initiatives can still succeed — assuming local governments and nonprofits find the funds.

One of the survivors is, unsurprisingly, California, a state with many climate-friendly initiatives that have enough resources to survive a federal drought. “We’ve stayed the course and are moving forward full steam ahead, and our climate work hasn’t been impacted by the chaos at the federal level,” said Josh Fryday, who runs GO-Serve, Governor Gavin Newsom’s newly created office for service and civic engagement.

The “chaos” Fryday was referring to? Last spring, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency abruptly pulled 32,000 AmeriCorps members from their jobs tutoring children in low-income areas, working at food banks, and helping towns recover from weather disasters. It also put 85 percent of the federal service agency’s 500 staffers on leave. Though a court case eventually restored the $400 million in grant funding, much of the damage had already been done: Many programs had been disrupted, if not completely terminated, including some climate and conservation crews.

Thanks to its state funding, Fryday’s California Climate Action Corps was safe. The program now has roughly 400 members spread across the state working to make homes more fire-proof, divert food from landfills, and organize climate action days for the public. “Our hope is that over time, it continues to grow as there’s need and demand,” Fryday said.

Environmental service work has staying power in the state, with the 50-year-old California Conservation Corps still running strong with more than 1,500 members. But even with the state government’s support, other programs — environmental and otherwise — weren’t immune. After the cuts in April, AmeriCorps members helping residents of Los Angeles recover from the fires that had swept through the city were placed on leave, with many unable to finish their terms as they found other work or funding ran out.

It’s a story that played out across the country. Some service programs folded, while others steered clear of using the word “climate” to describe their work; many limped on despite uncertain funding. American Climate Corps jobs were in blue states and red states, in rural areas and cities, according to research published in November. “It speaks to the fact that this kind of work is needed everywhere,” said Dana Fisher, a professor at American University’s School of International Service whose team mapped the locations of Climate Corps positions.

“You can cancel the Climate Corps, but … a lot of what communities need right now has to do with responding to and preparing for climate change-exacerbated extreme events,” Fisher said.

These days, climate service work may be most likely to continue in response to very specific needs. In western North Carolina, AmeriCorps members are still helping with the recovery from Hurricane Helene, clearing storm debris and restoring access to trails and public lands, said Briles Johnson, the executive director of VolunteerNC, which oversees service programs in the state.

There may even be room for growth when local demands arise. In Colorado, Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, recently created a task force to deal with an outbreak of the mountain pine beetle that’s killing the state’s ponderosa pines. Warming temperatures and drought allowed the beetle populations to take off, and all the dead trees they leave behind increase the risk of wildfires. Conservation crews with Serve Colorado are supposed to help address the outbreak, backed by proposed state funding, according to a spokesperson for the state’s climate corps service work.

State-specific funding seems to be the safest way forward, but it can be hard to scrape together the money for it. One model comes from Washington state, which is fueling its new Climate Corps Network with profits from the state’s “cap-and-invest” program that requires polluters to lower their carbon emissions or to buy permits for them at auctions. The Washington Climate Corps Network announced almost $1.5 million in grants in 2025 to 11 different projects across the state, including restoring degraded estuaries to help them sequester carbon and helping communities prepare for extreme heat and wildfire smoke.

Matt Glazewski, director of the Washington Climate Corps Network, described it as a “small program, but with lofty goals” to develop a climate workforce and introduce people of all ages to potential climate-friendly careers.

While the American Climate Corps quickly became bogged down in a partisan fight after Biden proposed billions of dollars for it, Glazewski has found that it’s possible to get Republicans on board with his state’s program. Some grants are flowing to rural parts of Washington where terms like “climate action” may not resonate. “I’m not out there waving that flag in a way that people would expect it to look like,” Glazewski said. A $200,000 grant from the program is going to the Port of Pend Oreille in the northeast corner of Washington along the Idaho border, where workers are converting diesel locomotives to run on cleaner engines.

“You have a community here that is deeply conservative, that is keen on doing this because they know that it makes sense,” Glazewski said. “They know they have a business model — and once they have the opportunity to actually install the infrastructure, are invested in doing that.” He said that a few Republican members of the state legislature support the Washington Climate Corps Network, including state Senator Shelley Short, who represents Pend Oreille County.

“In that, we are also building a broader coalition and showing that the Climate Corps Network is not maybe what everyone thinks it is,” Glazewski said. “We can show them it can be just about anything — if it’s meaningful in your community, it’s mobilizing people to gain exposure to a job that is more climate-friendly and part of this new green or blue economy, that it can be for you.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/California-Conservation-Corps-firefighters.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2026-01-13 16:59:53.799297

Public Land Order 7917 banned mining across the Duluth Complex with no congressional input and no proper notification to Congress as required by law.
“Access to public lands is essential to America’s energy and mineral supply.
The Congressional Review Act offers a way to break that pattern.
“Congress can restore access to vital resources, provide the certainty needed for investment, and establish that major decisions about public lands require congressional accountability.","For the first time in history, a Public Land Order is being submitted to Congress for review. That seemingly technical milestone could reshape how the federal government manages hundreds of millions of acres of public land—and it starts with a mining ban in Minnesota.

In January 2023, the Biden administration locked away 225,504 acres of Minnesota’s Superior National Forest, home to the world’s largest untapped copper-nickel deposit. Public Land Order 7917 banned mining across the Duluth Complex with no congressional input and no proper notification to Congress as required by law. After the Trump administration transmitted the order to Congress on January 8, 2026, Rep. Pete Stauber announced plans to use a powerful tool for congressional oversight—the Congressional Review Act—to overturn the ban.

If successful, this effort would restore access to critical minerals in Northern Minnesota and establish precedent that Public Land Orders are subject to congressional oversight—fundamentally changing how future administrations can restrict resource development on federal lands.

Breaking new ground

Pacific Legal Foundation has long advocated that Public Land Orders constitute “rules” under the Congressional Review Act and must be submitted to Congress for review, but no previous administration has taken this important step. By transmitting PLO 7917, the Trump administration has opened the door for Congress to exercise oversight authority that should have existed all along.

“This constitutes a positive, major shift in policy and a potential breakthrough for miners, rural communities, and anyone affected by the regulatory ‘ping-pong’ on federal lands,” said Joe Luppino-Esposito, PLF’s Federal Policy director. “Access to public lands is essential to America’s energy and mineral supply. When executive actions can shut down lawful exploration overnight, it weakens investment, domestic production, and our ability to secure critical resources at home.”

That regulatory uncertainty has real costs. The Duluth Complex could supply critical minerals for generations, powering American technology and strengthening national security. Yet the Biden administration’s ban meant companies couldn’t plan, investors couldn’t commit, and communities couldn’t build around resources beneath their feet. One administration opens the door to development; the next slams it shut.

The Congressional Review Act offers a way to break that pattern. Congress can overturn agency rules with a majority vote in both chambers. If the president signs a resolution of disapproval, the rule is nullified and the agency cannot issue a substantially similar rule without new congressional authorization. That means once Congress overturns a Public Land Order, similar restrictions can be imposed only through legislation—not executive fiat.

A precedent that matters

The resolution targets one specific mining ban, but its implications extend far beyond Minnesota. Establishing that Public Land Orders are subject to CRA review means Congress can evaluate any executive land withdrawal, past or future.

“This isn’t just about overturning one land withdrawal,” said Paige Gilliard, an attorney in PLF’s Environment and Natural Resources legal practice. “It’s about establishing that the executive branch must follow proper procedures when making decisions that affect resource development and the livelihoods of American communities. This resolution can unlock the abundance that public lands provide while ensuring these decisions are made through the democratic process, not executive overreach.”

Rep. Stauber, who represents Northern Minnesota and is leading the CRA effort, understands what’s at stake for his constituents and the nation. Congress recently used the CRA to overturn the Biden EPA’s California emissions waiver—one of the highest-profile applications of the law in years. These back-to-back efforts signal renewed congressional appetite to reclaim authority over regulatory policy.

Congress should act quickly. The 60-session-day window for expedited CRA procedures means time is limited.

“The opportunity is historic,” Luppino-Esposito said. “Congress can restore access to vital resources, provide the certainty needed for investment, and establish that major decisions about public lands require congressional accountability. The precedent set here will protect resource access for generations—not just in Minnesota, but across the country.”",https://pacificlegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/congressional-review-act-plo-minn.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 16:59:59.010072

In light of this focus and recent DOJ activity, board members and in-house legal and compliance professionals should pay particular attention to the shipment of goods to and from East Asia, certifications made in connection with government contracts or grant or loan programs, and operations in Latin America. For energy and technology companies, we expect three areas to be of particular relevance to compliance efforts:

I. Continued Use of the False Claims Act for Administration Priorities

The DOJ made broad use of the civil False Claims Act (FCA) in 2025 and will continue to do so in 2026. The FCA imposes civil liability for obtaining money from, or avoiding payments to, the federal government through the making of false statements or certifications. The civil FCA does not provide for jail time, but the monetary penalties can be quite high because the government is allowed to collect treble damages for each false claim. FCA cases can be brought either by the DOJ directly or by a private citizen, known as a “qui tam relator,” who stands in the shoes of the government, unless and until the government decides to intervene in the case.

While, historically, the majority of FCA cases have involved alleged health-care fraud, the DOJ under the Trump administration has used the statute broadly to target administration priorities like customs and trade enforcement; immigration; diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI); and cybersecurity.

Customs and Trade-Related Enforcement. On December 18, for example, DOJ announced that Ceratizit USA, a North Carolina–based distributor of tungsten carbide products, had agreed to pay $54.4 million to resolve customs and trade-related FCA allegations, originally brought in a qui tam lawsuit in the Eastern District of Michigan.1 The settlement was reportedly the largest ever settlement of a custom-duties evasion case.

While the monetary amount of the settlement may have been unprecedented, the factual theories of liability have become fairly common in customs-related FCA cases. Specifically, Ceratzit allegedly (i) misrepresented the country of origin on goods imported into the U.S. (declaring goods as originating in Taiwan instead of China); (ii) transshipped Chinese manufactured goods through Taiwan to conceal their true origin; (iii) misclassified products under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule to reduce duties owed; and (iv) failed to properly mark goods with country of origin information. We expect to see more of such cases and investigations in 2026.

Immigration. DOJ used the False Claims Act in the immigration context as well. On September 9, the Department announced a settlement with a New Jersey-based company, Bayonne Drydock, that worked on U.S. Navy ships, for “its continued employment of unauthorized alien employees in violation of the Employment Eligibility clause (‘E-Verify’) of the Federal Acquisition regulations.”2 As part of the resolution, the Company agreed to pay a four million dollar fine.

Anti-DEI initiatives. Previously, in May 2025, DOJ announced the start of the “Civil Rights Fraud Initiative,” which DOJ said, will “utilize the False Claims Act to investigate and, as appropriate, pursue claims against any recipient of federal funds that knowingly violates federal civil rights laws.”3 The Department’s press release announcing the initiative also “strongly encourage[d] anyone with knowledge of discrimination by federal funding recipients to consider filing a qui tam action under the False Claims Act.”

On December 28, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration has launched civil FCA investigations into DEI programs at major U.S. companies.4 The article reported that DOJ’s theory in these investigations is that companies holding federal contracts may be violating the FCA if they continue to consider diversity factors in hiring or promotion. Presumably, the relevant contracts require the company to make some kind of certification that it is in compliance with federal civil rights law, and DOJ’s FCA theory would be that the certification is false if the company is engaging in certain DEI practices. We expect to see these and similar investigations continue in 2026 and potentially beyond.

Cyber. DOJ also continued to use the FCA as a means to enforce cybersecurity requirements for federal contractors. On July 31, DOJ announced that Illumina Inc. agreed to pay $9.8 million to resolve alleged violations of the FCA related to cybersecurity deficiencies in genomic sequencing systems sold to federal agencies.5 The government alleged the company sold genomic sequencing systems to government customers without an adequate cybersecurity program in place, including by failing to incorporate product cybersecurity into software design, development, installation, and post-market monitoring; failing to timely correct known software vulnerabilities in its products; and misrepresenting compliance with recognized cybersecurity standards, including those issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

Potential Headwinds. A significant potential headwind for FCA activity is that, despite being enacted over 100 years ago, the qui tam provision, which allows a private plaintiff to bring an FCA case on behalf of the government, has come under recent judicial scrutiny. In October 2024, in Zafirov v. Florida Medical Associates, LLC, a federal district court in the Middle District of Florida held that the qui tam provision was unconstitutional because it violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. That decision was appealed to the 11th Circuit, and oral argument was held in December 2025. A decision should issue some time in 2026. In 2026, the Third Circuit will also hear oral argument in another FCA case involving a challenge to the qui tam provision, United States ex rel. Penelow v. Janssen Products, L.P..

However, even if these cases hold the qui tam provision unconstitutional, the Department of Justice would still have the ability to launch FCA investigations and bring FCA cases, albeit without the (often significant) help of the plaintiffs’ bar.

II. More Criminal Investigations of Trade and Export Control Practices and Prosecutions Relating to Sensitive Technology

DOJ also continued to bring criminal actions alleging the illegal export of sensitive technology to other countries, in particular China. For example, on November 19, 2025, DOJ announced it had charged four individuals with conspiring to export advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) with artificial intelligence applications to China.6 As alleged, the defendants agreed to purchase the GPUs, which were subject to Commerce Department licensing requirements; transshipped them through Malaysia and Thailand to conceal their ultimate destination in China; and falsified export paperwork to create sham contracts and fake end-users and destinations.

Similarly, in August, DOJ announced that two individuals had been charged in the Central District of California with exporting GPUs to China.7 In that case, the government alleged defendants routed shipments through Singapore and Malaysia to conceal their ultimate destination and received payments from entities based in China and Hong Kong, rather than the listed recipients.

III. The FCPA Lives On

In early 2025, DOJ announced that it was “pausing” enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and in June 2025, announced a new FCPA policy, in which the DOJ would prioritize investigations involving alleged misconduct (i) tied to drug cartels or other transnational criminal organizations; (ii) that deprived U.S. entities of fair access to compete and/or resulted in economic injury to Americans; or (iii) involved critical infrastructure or other assets tied to national security.8

Following the publication of the new policy, the number of FCPA actions remained below historic levels. However, the actions DOJ did announce emphasized these new priorities on bribery that injured U.S. businesses, impacted critical infrastructure, and/or occurred in Latin America.

For example, in August 2025, DOJ filed FCPA bribery charges in the Southern District of Texas against two businessmen, who were alleged to have bribed Mexican officials to obtain business from a Mexican state-owned enterprise and one of its subsidiaries.9 While one of the businessmen remained a fugitive, the other proceeded quickly to trial and was convicted by a jury in Houston federal court in December 2025.

In November, the Department also announced that Comunicaciones Celulares S.A., doing business as TIGO Guatemala, agreed to pay over $118 million as part of a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) to resolve an FCPA investigation.10 DOJ alleged that, between 2012 and 2018, company officials had made bribe payments to Guatemalan congressmen in exchange for legislative and political support benefiting TIGO Guatemala and used laundered narcotics proceeds to fund some bribe payments.

Interestingly, in explaining its rationale for deferring prosecution, DOJ credited TIGO Guatemala’s parent corporation’s “voluntary and timely self disclosure” to DOJ of the bribery in 2015 but noted that TIGO Guatemala’s then controlling Guatemalan shareholder used operational control to block access to information, limit cooperation, and impede remediation during the early phase of the investigation.

IV. Takeaways

Companies should expect sustained DOJ scrutiny of both inbound and outbound China related trade activity, including third country transshipment schemes. As noted above, in the second half of 2025, DOJ targeted efforts to use third countries—including Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore—to disguise the shipment of goods both into and out of China. Energy and technology companies with global supply chains should pay appropriate attention to country of origin determinations, routing practices, and distributor oversight with particular care where China is (or may be) the ultimate source or destination. They should maximize visibility into their supply chains, self-audit on a regular basis to verify the information they submit to the U.S. government about their supply chains and, where appropriate, seek independent, third-party verification.

Customs and trade enforcement under the False Claims Act is likely to accelerate notwithstanding constitutional challenges to qui tam actions. Regardless of the outcome of these cases, DOJ’s own enforcement authority will remain intact. The $54.4 million Ceratizit customs related settlement is likely to further incentivize the plaintiffs’ bar to pursue FCA cases, particularly those involving alleged duty evasion, misclassification, undervaluation, and transshipment of China origin goods.

DOJ is using the FCA to advance broader policy priorities, including immigration, anti-DEI, and cybersecurity compliance for government contractors. The White House’s January 8, 2026 announcement that DOJ would be creating a “new division for national fraud enforcement,” to “enforce the Federal criminal and civil laws against fraud targeting Federal government programs, Federally funded benefits, businesses, nonprofits, and private citizens nationwide,” emphasizes the scrutiny that is being placed on the alleged fraudulent receipt of government funds.11 Energy and technology companies doing business with the federal government should ensure that certifications and policies remain aligned with on-the-ground operational practices.

FCPA enforcement remains selective but real, with Latin America continuing to present elevated risk. In addition, DOJ’s emphasis on the FCPA as a means of promoting fair competition for U.S. companies may provide U.S. companies will an additional avenue of potential recourse if they believe they have been shut out of a foreign government contract because of bribery by a competitor.

Companies should review, and if necessary, strengthen their internal reporting and escalation mechanisms. In particular, compliance programs should ensure that employees have a clear, accessible, and credible path to raise concerns internally, and that reports involving trade controls, China related routing, and third party conduct are promptly investigated and remediated.

Events in Venezuela will continue to play out. DOJ’s recent focus on trade-related investigations and prosecutions and the revised FCPA policy suggest DOJ will, separate and apart from the actual prosecution of Nicolas Maduro, have an important role to play in shaping and implementing U.S. policy in that country.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16337_2239.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 19:12:38.701716

Instead, commissioners sided with Planning Director Eric Nance, who recommended approval of the rezoning as consistent with economic development goals in the county’s 2035 land-use plan.

Drew Nations, CEO of the project’s developer, Engineered Land Solutions, estimated the county would collect $40 million in annual property taxes from the project. The land’s current tax bill is less than $8,000 a year, he said.

“This county desperately needs the revenue that this data center could produce,’’ commissioner Rick Morris said during a meeting overflowing with opponents. In response to weeks of criticism, Nations said the Charlotte-based developer doesn’t plan to encroach on the Dan River floodplain.

“We are not developing the Dan River,’’ he said. Noting that more than 100 data centers are operating in the state, he added, “Our lives go on just fine.’’

The commissioners also approved an amendment to the county’s zoning ordinance to add data centers as a permitted use and “prepare Stokes County for future land use,’’ according to a meeting notice.

Like other data center projects across the state, Engineered Land’s proposal for 1,845 acres stirred critics. On Monday evening, whistling by opponents could be heard from outside the commission chambers.

“How pleasant would this meeting be with a vacuum cleaner running day and night?’’ resident Kenny Smith said. Others said they were upset about the potential disturbance of historic Indian land.

The proposed rezoning from residential/agricultural to heavy manufacturing with conditions has mobilized opponents rallied by nonprofit Clean Water for North Carolina.

Nations said the rezoning protects the property from development other than data centers. “This is narrowly confined to data centers only,’’ he told the commission. “There are no surprises down the road.’’

Spanning numerous buildings, data centers rely upon large amounts of water for cooling and the heavy usage of electricity for servers and other equipment.

The Stokes County project would initially draw from generators before connecting to Duke Energy’s grid. The Charlotte-based utility’s Belews Creek Steam Station is located near the data center site, which is attractive to Engineered Land due to the availability of utility infrastructure.

Engineered Land Solutions works with Fortune 500 companies to develop projects. Nations is a UNC Chapel Hill graduate who previously worked for Panattoni Development, an Irvine, California-based developer with 69 offices in the U.S., Canada and Europe.

Engineered Land Solutions was working with developers Crow Holdings and Crosland Southeast on a data center in southeast Mecklenburg County that was withdrawn in October after strong local opposition.

Three energy developers are challenging the administration's freeze of their offshore wind projects in the federal courts this week.
The Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind.
Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted.
Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.","A federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as President Trump seeks to shut it down.

At the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns. He said it also did not provide sufficient reasoning for its change in position.

Revolution Wind has received all of its federal permits and is nearly 90% complete to provide power for Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Trump says his goal is to not let any ""windmills"" be built. Three energy developers are challenging the administration's freeze of their offshore wind projects in the federal courts this week.

Danish energy company Orsted, Norwegian company Equinor, and Dominion Energy Virginia each sued to ask the courts to vacate and set aside the administration's Dec. 22 order to freeze five big projects on the East Coast over national security concerns. Orsted's hearing was first on its Revolution Wind project. Orsted said it will soon resume construction to deliver affordable, reliable power to the Northeast.

The administration did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns, but Trump said Friday while meeting with oil industry executives about investing in Venezuela that wind farms are ""losers."" He said they lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.

""I've told my people we will not approve windmills,"" Trump said. ""Maybe we get forced to do something because some stupid person in the Biden administration agreed to do something years ago. We will not approve any windmills in this country.""

The Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution. Trump began reversing the country's energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

The Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. New York's attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind.

Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted. Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.

""The law takes precedent over the political whims of one man, and we will continue to fight to make sure that remains the case,"" Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.

At Monday's hearing, attorney Janice Schneider, representing Revolution Wind, said the stop work order came at a critical stage of construction, with the project nearly 90% built and weeks away from beginning to deliver power to the electric grid. She said the delay is costing more than $1.4 million per day, and a specialized vessel has just enough time now to install the remaining turbines before its contract is up at the site in February.

Schneider said they take national security issues seriously, but the government has not shared more information about its concerns with their experts who have security clearances, or shared unclassified summaries.

""We do think that this court should be very skeptical of the government's true motives here,"" Schneider said, citing Trump's comments from Friday.

Department of Justice attorney Peter Torstensen argued that national security is paramount and protecting against new risks identified in the classified materials outweighs any alleged irreparable harm to the developers.

Work on the Revolution Wind project was previously paused on Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns. A month later, Judge Lamberth ruled the project could resume, citing the irreparable harm to the developers and the demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. Orsted is building it with Skyborn Renewables.

With four offshore wind projects still stalled, Hillary Bright, executive director of offshore wind advocacy group Turn Forward, said she's hopeful that they will prevail in court and that the administration will begin to understand ""the immense benefits that these nearly complete power sources can bring to our nation's energy and national security.""

Equinor owns Empire Wind. Its limited liability company, Empire Wind LLC, said the project faces ""likely termination"" if construction can't resume by this Friday because the order disrupts a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with very limited availability. Its hearing is Wednesday.

""I would like to think that offshore wind is, and will continue to be, part of an all-of-the-above energy solution, which our country desperately needs,"" said Molly Morris, Equinor's senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8056x4530+0+55/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2Ff9%2F1375e510444db616b743134fe8af%2Fap26012662836755.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 19:59:08.621959

One of the most pressing issues facing communities across Indiana is the rapid interest in data center development.
I am working to develop a standardized, statewide framework for evaluating data center projects.
At the federal level, there is currently no comprehensive framework governing data center development.
State Rep. Alex Burton (D-Evansville) represents House District 77 and is a voice for solutions and intentional policies that are fair and forward thinking.","As we head into session, my focus is on advancing responsible, forward-thinking and strategic legislation that puts Hoosiers first. Indiana must strike the right balance between economic development, revenue growth, transparency and the long-term needs of our communities. Our state’s economic interests are not one-size-fits-all. Every region has its own priorities, challenges and vision for the future, and state policy should reflect that reality.

One of the most pressing issues facing communities across Indiana is the rapid interest in data center development. Whether Hoosiers support or oppose these projects, it is clear that the Legislature must lead. Without clear guidance from the state, local governments are being forced to make complex decisions on their own. That has resulted in inconsistent processes, confusion and growing concerns from residents who want answers about water use, energy demands and long-term impacts on their communities.

I am working to develop a standardized, statewide framework for evaluating data center projects. That framework must guarantee safe, drinkable water, protect local water supplies and ensure that increased energy demand does not raise monthly utility bills for residential customers. Data centers can use millions of gallons of water and consume as much electricity as small cities, which makes thoughtful oversight essential.

At the federal level, there is currently no comprehensive framework governing data center development. Oversight is limited to broad environmental laws and permitting processes that were never designed to address the scale of water use and energy demand these facilities create. As a result, states across the country are stepping in to fill the gap. California and Connecticut now require disclosure of water and energy use before projects move forward. Minnesota and Arizona have tightened water permitting for large industrial users, particularly in regions facing supply constraints. Virginia, home to the largest concentration of data centers in the world, is actively debating additional transparency and infrastructure safeguards. Indiana should learn from these efforts and lead with a clear, consistent approach rather than leaving communities to navigate uncertainty on their own.

Hoosiers are paying attention and want their voices heard. That is why transparency must be a cornerstone of this effort. I strongly believe that requiring public hearings once plans are ready to be shared gives communities a seat at the table and ensures concerns are heard and addressed.

Handled correctly, this approach can strengthen Indiana’s economy, protect our resources and position our state as a national leader. We cannot afford to think short term. This is our moment to act responsibly and put Hoosiers first.

Facing a hostile federal landscape, the Governor continues to champion her all-of-the-above approach to energy that prioritizes affordability, reliability, and sustainability. Governor Hochul will seek safeguards for ratepayers by pushing strict accountability measures on utility companies to protect consumers while advancing aggressive measures to increase clean energy supply.

“As we grapple with frequent attacks from the federal government on energy progress and prices, I remain laser-focused on energy affordability and reliability in New York State,” Governor Hochul said. “We will continue to protect our most vulnerable by making investments in energy affordability programs like Empower+ while holding utility companies accountable to protect consumers from unfair practices. My commitment to an all-of-the-above approach will ensure we keep the lights on and prices down.”

Protecting Against Utility Bill Increases

New Yorkers deserve reliable energy at a price they can afford. Governor Hochul is proposing a sweeping set of reforms, the NYS Affordable Utilities Omnibus Legislation, to modernize the Public Service Law, demanding strict fiscal discipline from utilities and empowering the State to fight more effectively for lower bills.

Tying executive pay to affordability: The Governor is putting ratepayers first. Utilities will be required to publicly disclose how CEO salaries compare to the average worker’s pay and executive compensation will be tied directly to customer affordability. CEOs shouldn't be reaping outsized benefits while ratepayers are struggling to make ends meet.

Eliminating gold-plated rate cases: When requesting rate increases, utilities will be required to present a budget constrained option that keeps their operating and capital costs below the rate of inflation. This exercise will require utilities to prioritize efficiency and affordability and prove why any spending is truly necessary before asking customers to foot the bill.

Removing hidden fees: Ratepayers should only pay for energy services. Period. The Governor is directing the Department of Public Service to review utility bills to ensure customers never foot the bill for inappropriate utility spending, including corporate advertising, fines, and certain legal fees.

Mitigating Energy Cost Burden

Governor Hochul will introduce legislation that will require utilities to create and report on an affordability index, accurately showing the energy burden on customers throughout their service territory. She will also require the Department of Public Service to report on utility affordability by utility, benchmark against data from other states, and make an annual affordability presentation to the Public Service Commission (PSC).

If the PSC finds that any utility in New York is failing to protect energy affordability, this new legislation will empower the Commission to install an independent “Affordability Monitor” inside the utility to address the issue. The Affordability Monitor will have full access to management meetings, books, and records to review utility operations and expenditures to ensure efficient spending and report opportunities for cost savings to PSC.

Modernizing Utility Regulation to Protect Consumers

Rising utility bills are placing real pressure on household budgets. The current process of utility rate setting is increasingly complex, compressed, and difficult for the public to understand or meaningfully engage with in an impactful way. Governor Hochul will advance reforms to modernize how these rate cases are reviewed and resolved, giving regulators more time and flexibility to evaluate utility proposals to ensure they protect consumers, encourage good-faith negotiations, and reduce the frequency of disruptive rate increases. By improving how rate cases are conducted, New York will protect consumers, promote fair outcomes, and put affordability at the center of utility oversight.

Excelsior Power: Advancing a More Flexible and Affordable Grid

As energy demand grows, New York’s electric grid must become more flexible to control costs and maintain reliability, without overbuilding expensive infrastructure. New technologies such as smart thermostats allow utilities to strategically deploy or conserve energy when the grid needs it the most, effectively maintaining comfort and returning benefits such as lower energy bills. Governor Hochul will advance Excelsior Power, a new statewide initiative to make better use of such technologies to increase grid flexibility by shifting when and how electricity is used across the system. Excelsior Power will direct utilities to treat grid flexibility as a core system resource and expand consumer-facing incentive programs that encourage households and businesses to participate in energy flexibility programs.

By harnessing grid flexibility tools such as demand response and smart technologies, the State can avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in system costs each year while reducing the need for costly upgrades and backup power plants – averting costs that will otherwise be shouldered by rate payers. As these programs scale statewide, grid flexibility is expected to deliver billions of dollars in long-term savings, reducing utility bills and strengthening reliability for households and businesses across the State.

Revitalizing EmPower+ to Upgrade New York’s Homes

New York is home to the nation’s oldest building stock. As a result, the cost of upgrading a home to 21st-century energy efficiency and sustainability standards, which ultimately save consumers money, can be prohibitively expensive

Since its launch in 2023, Governor Hochul’s EmPower+ program has helped nearly 42,000 low- and moderate-income households across the state finance energy improvements, saving families about $600 per year on their utility bills, slashing emissions, and making homes more comfortable for families. In 2026, Governor Hochul will invest an additional $50 million into the EmPower+ program, making sure an estimated 10,000 additional households are able to access the free assessments, low-cost direct installs, and targeted upgrades that keep homes comfortable and safe—all while generating jobs and opportunities for local contractors.

Increasing Uptake of Energy Assistance Programs

New York State invests more than $1 billion annually on programs to help families lower their energy bills, such as the Energy Affordability Program (EAP), EmPower+, and the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). These programs reduce costs through cash assistance, monthly discounts, and weatherization and efficiency upgrades that reduce energy usage and costs. Despite these benefits, these programs are not being fully utilized by qualifying ratepayers. As a result, it is estimated that only half of income-eligible households utilize the EAP. Further, the delivery of bill financial assistance and weatherization programs can be better aligned to help reduce energy usage and associated bills for those households with the greatest energy burden.

To make sure these critical programs are implemented in a complementary manner and to increase awareness and access for vulnerable New Yorkers, the Governor will streamline planning and administration of these programs to increase the impact of public funds targeting energy burden reductions and make these programs simpler to access. She will also improve utilization by launching a centralized outreach campaign to reach as many New Yorkers as possible.

Establishing a Nuclear Reliability Backbone for a Zero-Emission Grid

As New York transitions to a zero-emission electric grid, the State must ensure reliable and cost-effective baseload power to keep homes, businesses, and critical infrastructure running at all hours. Governor Hochul will ensure that New York State leads in the race to harness safe and reliable advanced nuclear energy to power homes and businesses with zero-emissions electricity for generations to come.

To catalyze progress towards those goals, the Governor will advance a new initiative, the Nuclear Reliability Backbone, directing State agencies to establish a clear pathway for additional advanced nuclear generation to support grid reliability. The Nuclear Reliability Backbone will be developed by a new Department of Public Service (DPS) process to consider, review, and facilitate a cost-effective pathway to 4 gigawatts of new nuclear energy that will combine with existing nuclear generation and the New York Power Authority's (NYPA) previously announced 1 gigawatt project, to create an 8.4 gigawatt “backbone” of reliable energy for New Yorkers.

This effort will provide firm, clean power that complements renewable energy resources and reduces reliance on fossil fuel generation. By creating a stable foundation of always-on energy, the Backbone will allow renewable resources to operate more efficiently and flexibly. Together, these actions will support a resilient, flexible, and zero-emission grid that meets New York’s growing energy needs.

Ensuring New York’s Nuclear Power Future is Built By and For New Yorkers

As New York expands advanced nuclear energy, the State must ensure that New Yorkers benefit from these jobs and investments; and, moreso, that New Yorkers are prepared to build, operate, and sustain this emerging industry. Governor Hochul will launch NextGen Nuclear New York to develop a skilled, in-state nuclear workforce through coordinated education and training pathways. The initiative will expand partnerships across K–12 schools, higher education institutions, labor organizations, and training programs to align curricula, credentials, and career pathways with industry needs. It will also support workforce transitions for existing energy workers and increase public awareness of nuclear career opportunities. By investing in people and skills, New York will ensure its nuclear future is powered by New Yorkers, for New Yorkers.

Requiring Data Centers To Pay Their Fair Share and Streamlining Interconnections for Job-Creating Businesses

As energy demand surges across the state, New York State will advance a new initiative with a dual mandate: providing greater certainty and predictability for businesses seeking to invest in New York while ensuring that data centers pay their fair share. Unlike other sectors, data centers consume massive amounts of finite resources and place an unprecedented strain on the electric grid without creating many jobs in the process. Governor Hochul is taking action to ensure every day New Yorkers do not subsidize this energy intensive industry. To stop planning uncertainty caused by “phantom loads” and prevent rising costs for everyday consumers, the State will enforce a simple standard: these industries must pay more; if they do not, they must supply their own energy.

To attract responsible new businesses, give them the certainty they need to invest in New York, and protect the ratepayer, Governor Hochul will tap the Department of Public Service to launch a new initiative, Energize NY Development, with the goal of modernizing how large energy users connect to the grid, making it faster and more predictable, but it comes with strict conditions to protect ratepayers. This effort will streamline interconnection rules and improve transparency around grid upgrades while explicitly requiring that projects driving exceptional demand without exceptional job creation or other benefits cover the costs they create, or supply their own energy. By accelerating responsible development and requiring data centers to shoulder their own burden, Energize NY Development will support job creation, industry growth and economic investment across the State while sparing ratepayers additional pressure on utility bills.

Protecting New York’s Energy Grid from Cyber Threats

As New York modernizes its electric grid and brings more clean energy resources online, we must protect this vital asset from cyber threats that could put our power and safety at risk. Building on nation-leading actions already underway, Governor Hochul will strengthen protections for New York’s electric grid. This effort will expand enforceable cybersecurity standards beyond traditional information technology to include the operational technology that controls power generation, transmission, and distribution, while also addressing the growing cybersecurity risks. These actions will reduce the risk of disruption, protect ratepayers from costly outages, and ensure New York’s evolving energy system remains resilient, reliable, and secure.

Supporting Solar Deployment in Public Schools by Aligning State Building Aid with Climate Goals

New York’s thousands of public schools consume substantial energy, and can and should play an important role in advancing clean energy priorities while also providing healthier learning environments for students. Looking towards a more sustainable future, many school districts are choosing to invest in solar and other renewable energy systems, which will support the state’s transition long-term. However, current Building Aid rules can limit their ability to undertake these crucial projects. Governor Hochul will update how State Building Aid is applied so school districts have greater flexibility to install the most effective renewable energy systems, including ground-mounted solar where appropriate. This change will make it easier for schools to reduce energy costs, cut emissions, and invest in cleaner infrastructure without increasing overall Building Aid.

Establishing a Sales Tax Exemption for Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Stations

As New York continues to work towards a greener, cleaner future, electric vehicles (EV) play an important role in weaning New Yorkers’ reliance on polluting and dangerous fuels. Governor Hochul has led the way in facilitating this transition by significantly building out the State’s EV charging infrastructure, deploying 15,000 chargers at more than 4,000 locations. This has resulted in nearly 187,000 EVs in New York. To further incentivize the installation of EV charging stations for public use, Governor Hochul will support legislation to establish a sales tax exemption on the retail sale of electricity–used to recharge an electric vehicle–by a commercial EV charging station. By encouraging additional charging options, Governor Hochul is removing historic barriers that prevent EV uptake and bringing New York one step closer to realizing its clean energy goals.

Supporting Farms Through the Sun and Soil Program

As New York expands clean energy generation, the State must ensure that renewable development and working farmland can coexist and complement one another. As farmers face rising operating costs, the transition to a clean energy economy presents opportunities to help farms diversify their revenues as they continue to operate and manage their valued farming activity.

Governor Hochul will introduce the Sun and Soil Program to increase options for farmers to benefit from the integration of solar energy development on their land while maintaining valuable land assets. The program builds on existing State-supported research and demonstration projects that show how solar panels can be co-located with active farming, such as grazing and crop production, allowing farms to generate clean energy while keeping land in agricultural use. Identifying avenues to capitalize on solar energy development while supporting continued use of productive farmland will help farmers financially and support the resiliency of their business. The program will be advised by – and inform efforts of – the state Agricultural Technical Working Group (ATWG) and will identify responsible solar development practices that support New York State’s agricultural operations, lands, farmers, and communities. The ATWG, led by NYSERDA in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture and Markets, includes agricultural land and farmer organizations, solar developers and operators, local government officials, academic experts, and additional nongovernmental organizations and state agencies. By advancing research, demonstration projects, and partnerships between farmers and renewable energy developers, Sun and Soil strengthens rural economies by supporting opportunities for both clean energy growth and sustained use of productive farmland for agricultural production.

Predominantly, Blackstone proposes to be a long-term partner with the ability to provide adequate capital to the utilities, it will provide a sum of capital to be used for customer rate credits and economic development support, and Blackstone will retain local leadership and management. Digging into the details of these proposed benefits shows they only scratch the surface of what may be needed to provide true ratepayer protections against the proposed risks of the acquisition.

Blackstone describes its intention as TXNM’s ultimate owner to be that of a longer-term investor that will look to “serve customers and local communities for years to come” rather than focus on short term gains. That being said, an expert witness on behalf of the Texas Industrial Energy Consumers, an association of industrial energy consumers, who has access to non-public trade secret information provided by Blackstone, describes Blackstone’s plan to meet the capital needs of TNMP to be by using double leverage to increase returns. This type of leverage allows private equity investors to maximize returns by placing debt on companies the firm owns while contributing less equity in the transaction. This high risk tactic is known for amplifying returns for investors while risking financial strain at the portfolio company, which is responsible for paying back that debt.

Highlighted throughout the applications for approval by state regulators in Texas and New Mexico is a customer rate credit that would temporarily reduce bill amounts by a few dollars. The proposed credit is for New Mexico $105 million over four years. This credit may seem like a large sum of money, but distributed among PNM’s 550,000 customers, it would result in $47 a year, or about $4 a month, to each customer. Without promises to stabilize rates, those small gains could be lost ifBlackstone and TXNM file a rate case, asking the respective state regulators to raise rates. In Texas, Blackstone will be providing a $45 million rate credit over 4 years, which is about $14 per customer per month to TNMP’s over 265,000 customers.

How would this impact ratepayers – potential issues

In addition to the shortcomings of Blackstone’s proposed benefits, there are a number of additional issues that utility regulators should consider when making decisions regarding the public interest of this acquisition.

Data centers

Blackstone has not been shy about the firm’s enthusiasm for investing in data centers or participating in the AI boom, which some experts have called a bubble. Blackstone currently manages $85 billion worth of data centers globally and continues to invest in the sector for the long term. Notably, Blackstone acquired QTS Realty Trust in 2021 in part with its BIP platform. QTS is currently the largest data center operator in the world. With data centers contributing to an all-time high electricity consumption in the US in 2024, Blackstone’s motivations to materialize investments across the AI supply chain are clear, with language like this appearing on its webpage: “We have built the largest and fastest growing data center business in the world in partnership with incredibly talented teams at our portfolio companies. For years now, we have been planting the seeds for future growth and are positioning ourselves for continued leadership over the long term.”

Blackstone’s ambitions have caught the attention of Congress. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal sent a letter to Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman outlining their concerns with the “firm’s recent acquisitions of publicly traded utility companies, and the extent to which these acquisitions allow you to profit from rising energy demands at the expense of consumers, utility workers, and everyday Americans trying to make their ends meet.” In the letter, the Senators expressed concerns related to potential anti-competitive effects of Blackstone owning both data centers and electrical utilities and, electricity affordability with the proposed TXNM acquisition.

Blackstone’s concerning track record of raising costs and safety risks in other industries

Blackstone is famous for being the world’s largest landlord, and has faced criticism for evictions, rent hikes, and lobbying against rent control. A 2023 Private Equity Stakeholder Project (PESP) report found that in one county alone, Blackstone purchased over 5,000 naturally occurring affordable housing units and raised the rents between 43-64% in 2 years. The report also documented cases of Blackstone evicting tenants who owed just one month’s rent.

In addition to Blackstone’s poor track record as a responsible landlord to its tenants, the firm has faced numerous scandals related to negligent labor practices. The 2023 Private Equity Labor Scorecard found Blackstone to receive an F, performing the worst in reported wage and hour violations compared to its private equity peers. Among Blackstone’s most notorious labor violations are related to a Department of Labor investigation that found the Blackstone-owned Packers Sanitation had hired more than 100 children working in hazardous jobs, under illegal conditions with multiple children suffering injuries. Children had been hired to work at the slaughterhouse cleaning company after Blackstone had acquired the company, and Blackstone ultimately had to pay a $1.5 million fine to the DOL. As a result of this mismanagement, Moody’s downgraded PSSI due to “the loss of contracts and lawsuits related to labor issues,” leading to concerns about “management credibility and track record risk”. Blackstone’s application claims this acquisition will project jobs and wages for union workers, but there are limited details for how the firm plans to ensure workforce benefits and standards are maintained.

PESP’s role and community involvement

PESP is an intervenor in the docket for the TXNM acquisition at FERC, along with Public Citizen, Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association. PESP and Public Citizen jointly filed a motion stating that FERC should find the federal application for the acquisition of TXNM by Blackstone to be deficient, as the application provides little detail about the proposed po

st-transaction corporate structure of TXNM and that the post-acquisition structure could lead to cross-subsidization of non-utility companies within Blackstone’s many subsidiaries. CBD has submitted a protest and reply in the docket outlining similar and additional concerns that the application as-submitted, stating that the proposal lacks detail about what, if any, safeguards will exist between TXNM and Blackstone’s related companies. For example, CBD poses the question of whether TXNM will serve Blackstone-owned data centers. On December 23, 2025, FERC found Blackstone’s application to be deficient and is requiring the company to submit additional information to protect customers from cross-subsidization of other Blackstone-owned companies.

Additionally, PESP is participating in the New Mexico contested case as an expert witness for intervenor New Energy Economy, a grassroots and policy advocacy nonprofit in New Mexico working to radically transform their energy systems. New Energy Economy is among a long list of intervenors in Blackstone’s proposed acquisition of their local utility, including:

Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority (ABCWUA)

Center for Biological Diversity (CBD)

The New Mexico Consumer Protection Alliance (NMCPA)

City of Albuquerque

Diné Citizens Against Ruining Our Environment, Naeva, San Juan Citizens Alliance, and Tó Nizhóní Aní, (together “Community Groups”)

Some interveners have already indicated concerns over the risk that Blackstone taking over the utility would lead to dramatic increases in energy bills. The Kroger Co.intervened as one of PNM’s largest commercial customers and voiced concerns that the cost of electricity could be “substantially impacted” by Blackstone’s purchase of the utility.

NM PRC staff and intervenors have until March 6, 2026 to file direct testimony about the proposed takeover and whether the acquisition would be aligned with the public interest. There will then be a hearing in May of 2026 which will be livestreamed for public viewing. Additionally, there is an opportunity for the public to weigh in with written public comments directly to the NM PRC.

The Trump administration violated the Fifth Amendment when it canceled clean energy grants last year based on whether the projects were located in states that voted for the president in 2024, a federal court judge ruled on Monday.

“There is no rational relationship” between the location-based grant terminations and the government’s stated interest of aligning grant funding with agency priorities, according to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruling.

The court’s decision covers seven grants totaling $27.6 million. The U.S. Department of Energy’s October terminations included more than $7.5 billion in financial awards to clean energy projects in states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.

Dive Insight:

A DOE spokesperson said the agency disagrees with the judge’s decision and stands by its review process, “which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars.”

“The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds,” DOE representative Ben Dietderich said in an emailed statement. He did not respond to questions about a possible appeal.

The lawsuit was filed in November by St. Paul, Minnesota, and a coalition of energy and community advocates: Elevate Energy, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, Plug In America and the Southeast Community Organization.

“This ruling makes clear that no community should be punished for its politics,” SCO Executive Director Ianni Houmas said in a statement.

District Judge Amit Mehta’s order vacated seven termination notices but also noted the limited nature of the decision.

“By no means does the court conclude that the mere presence of political considerations in an agency action runs afoul of the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection. That is not the law. This case is unique,” Mehta wrote. “Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024. There is no rational relationship between that classification and Defendants’ stated governmental interest.”

While the district court decision impacts a limited number of grants, EDF officials said the court’s reasoning and its legal holding would apply to “all who were subject to this unconstitutional action violating equal protection of the law.”

“The court recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law,” EDF General Counsel Vickie Patton said in a statement.

Grant terminations were vacated for projects including electric vehicle charging support, the SolSmart technical assistance program, a consumer EV education campaign, an Elevate Energy building performance resource hub and others.

“The court ruling in favor of Elevate is a step toward keeping clean energy affordable and advancing initiatives nationwide,” Elevate CEO Anne Evens said in a statement. “This decision is for the communities across the country who should not have to choose between paying their energy bills and feeding their families.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/d2DHHad9GyoNFhXfTdMplo7efzpGx8KKDXzTAjUuYUQ/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTk5NDIwMzQ3LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-13 16:13:14.965408

Trump is expected to begin his trip in Dearborn, MI, with a visit to a Ford factory that makes F-150 pickups, the bestselling domestic vehicle in the U.S., for a tour of the facilities around 12:30 p.m. His schedule also includes an address to the Detroit Economic Club at the MotorCity Casino Hotel in Detroit, MI, around 2:00 p.m.

The trip comes as consumers and businesses are feeling warry of the state of the U.S. economy coming into 2026, citing concerns about inflation and tariff uncertainty. Also in a close rearview is Ford, a key player in Michigan's manufacturing, announcing a shift away from producing electric vehicles due to a $13 billion loss and an end to production of the electric F-150 Lightning, adding an additional $20 billion in estimated lost investment.

State of the economy: Consumer sentiment starts 2026 near all-time low

The Biden administration is seen as a main driver of EVs due to the incentives brought about during his term, but with the Trump administration, those incentives are gone and lead to a shift away from investments in EV infrastructure.

Michigan, a hub for the auto industry, has seen billions already invested or planned to be into EV infrastructure, such as battery manufacturing plants and vehicle charging stations, in anticipation of the vehicles taking up a larger percent of the auto market in coming years. As polities have shifted under Trump's administration, however, these efforts are stalling out.

Trump's visit to Michigan is following economy-focused speeches he gave in Pennsylvania and North Carolina last month where he insisted his tariffs have boosted the economy, despite consumers noting the squeeze of higher prices, according to reporting from The Associated Press.

In the 2016 and 2024 elections, Trump carried Michigan, but lost the state in 2020 to Joe Biden. He marked his first 100 days in office on April 29, 2025, at Macomb Community College in Warren, MI, just outside of Detroit, briefly discussing tariffs, domestic manufacturing and promoted the ""big beautiful bill."" He also spent time discussing the 2020 election, reiterating false claims that it was stolen from him.

While at Selfridge Air National Guard Base earlier in the day, joined by U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Trump spoke to members of the Michigan National Guard and announced the addition of 21 new F-15EXs fighter jets in part of the ""game-changing"" new F15-EX fighter mission, planned to begin arriving in FY28.

Nearby, the Michigan Freedom Coalition is organizing a protest in response to Trump's visit, focusing their qualms on a rising cost of living and what they consider to be excessive aggressive federal immigration enforcement, such as the recent killing of Minneapolis, MIN, protestor Renee Nicole Good and the shooting of two Portland, OR, protestors.

The agency plans to stop considering the value of lives saved when setting regulatory limits, focusing instead on the costs to industry. The change was announced with little public attention, but it represents a significant break from decades of regulatory practice. The Clean Air Act, dating back to 1963, established a framework in which reducing pollution was understood to save lives, and those benefits were explicitly considered in policymaking. Over time, that approach contributed to substantial improvements in air quality, reductions in pollution-related illness, and longer life expectancy across the United States. Accounting for lives saved was not incidental to this progress. It was central to how public health protections were justified and sustained. Removing lives saved from regulatory analysis marks a shift away from that public health foundation. When benefits to human health are no longer counted, protections become easier to weaken and harder to defend. This decision belongs to a broader dismantling of public health infrastructure, where protections are weakened not by overt repeal, but by removing the tools that once made them defensible. https://lnkd.in/g8wTN-Az",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQGhEGo4RB7MrQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B56Zu0uydxIQAw-/0/1768263723508?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=ewnUj8aoFXxg_tzyOkf2VUNYAXmV-y3FOZ9p5ncscMc,N,,2026-01-13 19:59:22.856796

EPTCs

On Jan. 8, seventeen house Republicans voted for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ three-year extension of enhanced premium tax subsidies (EPTC); notably, several Republican members of Congress who had previously remained quiet on the issue bucked party leadership to vote in favor of the extension. Now Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) must navigate differing views within his caucus. A bipartisan group of senators is reportedly exploring a potential compromise, with discussions rumored to be led by Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio).

Hearing Recaps

The House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health held a hearing to examine several legislative proposals aimed at supporting patient access to Medicare services. Republicans emphasized that the bills under consideration would address reimbursement methodologies, improve data transparency, and help stabilize providers to better align Medicare payment with current care delivery models. Democrats acknowledged the value of the bills under discussion but criticized the failure to extend EPTCs and recent cuts to health care; members argued that rising premiums, Medicare Advantage practices, and potential coverage losses pose significant risks to patient access and should be addressed alongside narrower, Medicare‑focused legislative proposals.

The House and Senate are in session Monday through Thursday this week, with the Senate also convening on Friday.

The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions will hold an executive session on Thursday, Jan. 15, at 10 am ET, to consider several pieces of legislation, including S. 2169 – a rural hospital cybersecurity bill.

From that base, ReElement and Transition Equity Partners (TEP) said they intend to develop additional refining facilities across the United States and in select international markets.
With TEP’s backing, American Resources said the Marion plant is expected to reach an initial production capacity of more than 10,000 metric tons per annum of refined critical minerals.
The company also cited a partnership with POSCO International to support U.S.-based critical minerals and magnet production capabilities.
We believe ReElement is revolutionizing U.S. critical mineral supply chains by providing reliable, low-cost and environmentally superior processing capacity in the U.S.”","American Resources announced ReElement Technologies has closed a $200 million strategic equity facility from Transition Equity Partners that the companies plan to use to scale U.S.-based critical mineral and rare earth refining capacity, starting with an expansion of ReElement’s Marion, Indiana operations.

American Resources said the financing supports the commercial deployment of ReElement’s proprietary multi-mineral refining platform, with near-term work centered on building out the Marion site to meet domestic demand for refined critical minerals used across electrification, advanced manufacturing, and defense-related supply chains. From that base, ReElement and Transition Equity Partners (TEP) said they intend to develop additional refining facilities across the United States and in select international markets.

The Marion facility is expected to serve as an anchor for a modular, scalable platform designed to process both light and heavy rare earths, as well as other critical elements associated with defense and industrial applications. ReElement’s process uses chromatographic separation methods that the company says can be deployed in a smaller footprint than traditional refinery configurations and can be scaled in a modular way as feedstock availability and demand increase.

With TEP’s backing, American Resources said the Marion plant is expected to reach an initial production capacity of more than 10,000 metric tons per annum of refined critical minerals. ReElement said it plans to source inputs from recycled feedstocks alongside mined mixed rare earth concentrates, while maintaining the flexibility to expand capacity further in Marion and at other locations the partners consider strategically important.

The companies framed the investment as part of a broader effort to strengthen U.S. and allied-nation supply chains for minerals and materials that face persistent sourcing constraints. ReElement said it is pursuing large-scale domestic processing and refining capabilities and pointed to recent collaborations aimed at building a vertically integrated rare earth magnet supply chain in the United States. The company also cited a partnership with POSCO International to support U.S.-based critical minerals and magnet production capabilities.

ReElement said its refining platform is intended to address demand for heavy rare earth elements and other defense-relevant materials that are not currently produced at scale in the United States, including minerals such as yttrium, gadolinium, germanium, antimony, terbium, and dysprosium. The company characterized these materials as important inputs for energy technologies, advanced electronics, and defense systems, while highlighting supply constraints and export controls that can affect availability in global markets.

TEP said its investment is designed to help broaden the range of domestic and allied feedstocks that can be converted into refined outputs, supporting supply chain resilience across energy and infrastructure priorities. ReElement said the equity facility also supports its longer-term international expansion plans, including work across regions such as Africa, the Middle East, and the Commonwealth of Independent States.

ReElement, a portfolio company of American Resources, positions its platform as a multi-feedstock refining process that can handle recycled rare earth permanent magnets and lithium-ion battery materials, as well as concentrated ores, brines, and coal-based waste streams and byproducts. The company said its approach supports a circular supply chain model by converting multiple types of raw and recycled inputs into high-purity products needed for industrial and defense uses.

Transition Equity Partners, founded in 2020, described itself as a North American mid-market private equity firm focused on power generation, energy infrastructure, and clean energy supply chains and services, with offices in Chicago, New York, and Abu Dhabi. The firm said it partners closely with management teams and projects aligned with its thematic investment strategy.

KEY QUOTES:

“We are excited to partner with Transition Equity Partners. Throughout this process, it became clear that we are closely aligned culturally and mission-wise — an alignment we believe is essential to addressing supply-chain challenges quickly while building long-term shareholder value. The $200 million commitment will enable ReElement to expand its manufacturing base initially in the United States and, over time, globally, to process and refine critical minerals and rare earth elements through a cost-competitive, modular, and scalable platform. TEP’s global reach and experienced advisory network are also supporting ReElement’s international expansion across Africa, the Middle East, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). TEP is more than an equity sponsor; they are a strategic partner actively supporting ReElement’s global growth.”

Mark Jensen, CEO, ReElement Technologies

“TEP is committed and equally excited to partner with ReElement, Mark Jensen and his leading management team to help fortify the U.S. supply chain for critical energy and strategic infrastructure. ReElement’s uniquely superior processing platform enables the U.S. to leverage numerous domestic and ally feedstocks to bolster a diverse set of critical mineral supply chains that are essential for a strong U.S. economy. This capability is further supported by ReElement’s collaboration with the U.S. government, and ability to ensure access to critical minerals necessary for energy dominance, AI leadership, strategic defense industries, among numerous other U.S. priorities. We believe ReElement is revolutionizing U.S. critical mineral supply chains by providing reliable, low-cost and environmentally superior processing capacity in the U.S.”",https://cdn.pulse2.com/cdn/2021/08/American-Resources-Corporation.jpeg,N,,2026-01-13 19:59:45.903400

This proposal is a concrete example of Governor Hochul listening to our call to make New York State more competitive.","Governor Kathy Hochul today announced her “Let Them Build” agenda, a series of landmark reforms to speed up housing and infrastructure projects and lower costs as part of her 2026 State of the State. “Let Them Build” is about making government work better on behalf of New Yorkers. This initiative will spur a series of common sense reforms to New York’s State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) and executive actions to expedite critical categories of projects that have been consistently found to not have adverse environmental impacts. Together, these actions will allow projects that localities want to move forward and that will not harm the environment do so faster, while prioritizing smarter growth to ensure we continue to protect communities, preserve our environment, and conserve New York’s natural resources.

“New York has always been a place of boundless ambitions: from the Erie Canal to the Empire State Building. But for too long, unnecessary red tape has stood in the way of new housing and critical infrastructure.” Governor Hochul said. “If local leaders want to deliver new investments for their communities, I say ‘Let Them Build.’”

Today, it is too difficult to build major projects in New York: an analysis by Empire State Development found that manufacturing, housing and energy projects can take as much as 56 percent longer in New York State to get from concept to groundbreaking compared to peer states. Longer projects equal higher costs, a challenge that is especially critical in the context of New York’s housing crisis, where the only solution to high costs and scarce homes is to build more housing faster and cheaper than before. Similarly, unduly burdensome requirements delay needed investment in clean water infrastructure, child care centers, and parks.

Helping Our Communities Build Housing We Need

When Governor Hochul took office, she vowed to tackle the housing crisis and bring down costs by building the housing that New Yorkers desperately need so that more hard working families can afford a place to call home. However, too many projects in New York, including much-needed affordable housing developments, are forced to navigate a web of red tape created by state mandates that add unnecessary costs and years of needless delays, despite these projects consistently being found to have no significant environmental impact. Studies have quantified how State-mandated environmental review can slow down housing projects by an average of two years, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars per project, at a time when New Yorkers can least afford the wait for the housing they need to continue to live and thrive in New York.

To speed up the development of housing to create a more affordable and sustainable New York, Governor Hochul will propose to amend the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) to exempt certain types of housing projects that have no significant impacts on the environment, which are still subject to local zoning, from additional SEQRA review. Projects will still be required to comply with crucial State regulatory and permit requirements governing water use, air quality, environmental justice, and protection of natural resources, as well as local zoning and other permitting requirements. Projects must also be located outside of flood risk areas in order to qualify. The type of housing project that can be reclassified under SEQRA will differ according to the housing needs and contexts of different parts of the state. In New York City, the State will set caps on the size a building must be to avoid the requirement of additional SEQRA review, with caps varying on the basis of the density of the neighborhoods as determined by the City. In the rest of the state, to avoid additional SEQRA review, housing projects must be on previously disturbed land, connected to existing water and sewer systems, and subject to additional unit caps.

A review by New York City and New York State Homes and Community Renewal over the last five to ten years of over a thousand housing projects found that virtually none of such projects ultimately were found to have significant environmental impacts, but nevertheless were still subject to lengthy reviews. These reforms will accelerate the delivery of much needed housing and reduce the cost of building in ways that are consistent with sustainable and environmentally-protective development, driving down the cost of housing and rents across the state while protecting our natural resources.

Accelerating Critical Infrastructure Projects That New Yorkers Depend On

Governor Hochul will also propose to facilitate the speedier, cheaper delivery of a broad range of beneficial infrastructure projects that New Yorkers depend on. She will propose to adjust SEQRA’s classifications to allow the following important categories of projects not in need of additional SEQRA review to start serving New Yorkers faster:

Clean Water Infrastructure: Critical water infrastructure projects that avoid impacts to natural resources.

Green Infrastructure: Nature-based storm water management.

Parks and Trails: Public parks and recreational bike/pedestrian paths on previously disturbed land.

Child Care: New or renovated child care centers on previously disturbed land.

Governor Hochul’s proposal would reserve these fast-track environmental review processes for only those projects proceeding at previously disturbed areas, meaning areas that have already been developed or improved, which provides the dual benefit of protecting our natural resources and undisturbed lands, while strengthening our neighborhoods. The Governor’s approach would yield tangible environmental benefits including improved air and water quality, a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and the preservation of critical habitats when compared to policies which encourage sprawl and unchecked development of natural areas. In addition, Governor Hochul will direct the New York Power Authority and New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to update their regulations to facilitate and speed up the deployment of clean energy projects.

Combined, these actions will drastically reduce administrative steps and accelerate project timelines, while maintaining local zoning requirements and environmental standards of all other state permits, ensuring progress does not come at the expense of New Yorkers or natural resources.

Delivering Faster Decisions for Local Communities Through Clear Timelines and Accountability

Currently SEQRA review timelines vary greatly across projects, creating unpredictability for local communities, project sponsors, and state agencies alike. This unpredictability can contribute to significant project delays and add substantial costs to project budgets. To drive further accountability and streamline the environmental review process, Governor Hochul will ensure project review is subject to a two-year maximum deadline for completion of a SEQRA environmental impact statement from a positive declaration (i.e., the initial decision to move forward with an environmental impact statement) to the issuance of the final agency decision. Extensions could be evaluated in certain circumstances.

Governor Hochul will also clarify exactly when the time to challenge an environmental review begins to accrue. This change aligns the legal clock for environmental concerns with the clock for the project’s actual permits, such as a site plan or subdivision approval. By doing this, the State removes court confusion and ensures that all legal challenges follow the same schedule.

Streamlining Environmental Impact Statements To Cut Down Review Timelines

To accelerate the process of developing Environmental Impact Statements, which are time-intensive assessments of how a proposed project would impact the environment, Governor Hochul will direct the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) to develop ‘Generic Environmental Impact Statements' (GEISs). GEISs are comprehensive reviews for common project types which allow developers to quickly progress through the environmental review process and guide their upfront decision making and site selection. Governor Hochul will direct DEC to develop new GEISs to cut down environmental review timelines for selected types of renewable energy and housing projects.

Modernizing New York’s Permitting Processes to Save Time and Money for Localities

It has been decades since some of New York’s state agencies have updated their processes and technologies used to review and approve permits, which are a critical and often time-consuming step in building desired new infrastructure. Outdated permitting processes drive up costs and create needless bureaucratic hoops for projects to jump through. To modernize and expedite these processes, Governor Hochul will direct state agencies involved in permitting and environmental reviews to conduct an end-to-end review of their processes and identify opportunities to accelerate reviews and alleviate bottlenecks.

Governor Hochul will also provide support to agencies to consider and implement new technologies to help streamline reviews. As part of this effort, the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) will launch “Smart Access,” a consolidated platform for applicants and government agencies to follow the progress of permits and environmental reviews in real time and access the latest documents. In addition, to drive accountability, increase transparency, and help agencies meet timelines established in law, Governor Hochul will direct state agencies, in partnership with the newly established Office of Performance Management and Innovation (OPMI), to develop internal performance tracking systems to monitor the status of permits and environmental reviews.

Together, these efforts will help us accelerate project reviews, while maintaining our commitment to important permits and reviews intended to protect our environment and keep our communities safe.

Expediting Major State Infrastructure Projects to Serve New Yorkers Faster

To help expedite the delivery of the most significant projects in the state, Governor Hochul will establish a new program to streamline and speed up permitting processes for key economic development and infrastructure projects across New York, within the relevant legislative framework. The program would oversee and monitor the permitting process of designated projects of statewide significance such as the new Nuclear Generation Project in Upstate New York or the new IBX transit line in New York City to reduce wait times for the workers, businesses, students and families who depend on these projects while continuing to prioritize safety. For designated projects, the program would be responsible for setting and overseeing clear, transparent permitting schedules; assist with interagency, federal, and local coordination; accelerate permitting processes; and address other issues as they arise.

Supporting Local Communities Through a Permitting Academy

Many localities face significant challenges navigating the complicated web of local, state, and federal permitting requirements, especially smaller localities with limited staff. To tackle this issue, the State will provide enhanced support and education to local governments to help them better understand the SEQRA process, which will help ensure a more effective environmental review. The State, in partnership with Regional Economic Development Councils, will conduct a series of workshops with local governments to cover best practices and provide assistance for localities in need of additional support.

Driving Economic Growth by Activating Underutilized Sites in the North Country

New York’s commitment to our forest preserves, including the Adirondack Park, is defined by the “Forever Wild” clause, which is a constitutional promise that our Forest Preserve will remain a pristine legacy for generations. However, today, several former correctional facilities - Camp Gabriels, Moriah Shock, and Mount McGregor - sit dormant. These crumbling sites are more than just eyesores; they are environmental hazards and lost opportunities for the people who call the North Country home.

To address this, Governor Hochul will propose a constitutional amendment to return these underutilized sites to productive and critically-needed uses, such as for housing development, while also securing a win for conservation. By authorizing the redevelopment of these specific locations, Governor Hochul will at the same time propose adding even more land into the Forest Preserve.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said, ""We cannot address our housing crisis without making it easier to build housing in New York City. Environmental review reform would bring our regulations into the 21st century and ensure we can deliver an affordability agenda on the timetable needed,"" said New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani. ""I commend Governor Hochul for this commonsense proposal and hope it will be a part of the enacted state budget this year. New Yorkers can't wait any longer for action on housing.""

New York State Association for Affordable Housing President and CEO Carlina Rivera said, The Governor’s proposed ‘Let Them Build Agenda,’ including changes to the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) aimed at streamlining approvals for certain housing and infrastructure projects, is both welcome and necessary. NYSAFAH has consistently advocated for reforms that strike the right balance between accelerating the construction of much needed housing and maintaining strong environmental protections. These changes will help remove unnecessary delays, reduce costs, and allow responsible projects to move forward more efficiently, which is critical to addressing New York’s housing shortage at the scale the crisis demands.”

SEIU 32BJ President Manny Pastreich said, “We have a housing crisis. How we address that crisis must be balanced with the environmental impacts of new building. This policy proposal maintains environmental protections, while making it less cumbersome for housing to get built. Governor Kathy Hochul is striking the right balance here.”

President of the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council Rich Maroko said, ""New York’s housing crisis threatens the livelihoods of hardworking families across our state. Once again, Governor Hochul’s bold strategy demonstrates real leadership and a clear commitment to making New York more affordable for the people who live and work here.”

City of New Rochelle Mayor Yadira Ramos-Herbert said, “Local governments are on the front lines of delivering housing, infrastructure, and community improvements, and lengthy, duplicative review processes can slow down projects residents are counting on. Governor Hochul’s proposal to modernize SEQRA recognizes the need to protect our environment while also making it easier for communities to move forward responsibly. By reducing unnecessary delays and improving coordination, these reforms will help lower costs, increase transparency, and allow municipalities like ours to plan and build more effectively. I appreciate the Governor’s leadership in advancing thoughtful reforms that support sustainable growth and stronger, more resilient communities.”

City of Peekskill Mayor Vivian C. McKenzie said, “For local governments, time matters. Governor Hochul’s proposal to modernize SEQRA is about cutting through unnecessary delays so communities can move forward on housing, infrastructure, and quality-of-life projects residents have been waiting for. These reforms respect environmental protections while giving cities and towns the tools we need to plan, build, and grow responsibly. I appreciate the Governor’s leadership in recognizing that smart reform can strengthen both our environment and our local economies.”

Village of Pelham Mayor and Housing Council Executive Director Chance Mullen said, “Local leaders have been calling for SEQRA reform for years, and it’s encouraging to see Governor Hochul listening. I’m cautiously optimistic this proposal can help communities deliver the housing our residents need while cutting unnecessary red tape. Making it easier to build homes is essential to easing costs for everyday New Yorkers and meeting the needs of our constituents.”

Village of Fredonia Mayor Mike Ferguson said, “Governor Hochul’s proposed amendment to current items of the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) will have the largest impact by helping to eliminate more roadblocks for citizens wanting to buy small-scale and multi-family homes. This will remove yet another financial burden for homebuyers. That’s a big help to communities our size. Once again the Governor is showing that she fights for families and fights for us everyday.”

East Hampton Town Supervisor Kathee Burke-Gonzalez said, “East Hampton needs more affordable housing so the people who keep our town running can continue living here, including teachers, health care workers, first responders, town employees, and young families. I appreciate Governor Hochul for making this a priority and for backing a clearer, more consistent review process that helps communities build the homes New Yorkers need while continuing to protect our environment, our water, and our open space.”

Rochester Mayor Malik Evans said, “I applaud Gov. Kathy Hochul’s proposed regulatory reforms, which will continue to protect our environment while cutting through unnecessary red tape. These reforms will allow us to move expeditiously on projects that are critical to the health and safety of our residents.”

Partnership for New York City President and CEO Kathryn Wylde said, “The SEQRA process has long been in need of reform. It is overly bureaucratic and lengthy. It is great that Governor Hochul will take on this unnecessary contributor to the high cost of housing development in the city.”

Greater Rochester Chamber of Commerce President and CEO, and Former Lieutenant Governor Robert Duffy said, “I applaud Governor Hochul’s plan to reform and modernize the SEQR process. The current process and elongated timelines have made NYS far less attractive and competitive for construction and growth. The current SEQR process along with other regulatory impediments have dramatically slowed down home construction at a time when NYS needs housing now more than ever. The Governor is spot on with her proposal - which will have a profound impact on housing, construction, and our economy.”

Regional Plan Association President and CEO Tom Wright said, “Reforms to the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) will help fast-track the smart, sustainable infrastructure our region needs, and we commend Governor Kathy Hochul for her bold leadership in taking on this long-overdue work. For over one hundred years, RPA has focused on one core mission: improving quality of life across the tri-state region by advancing solutions that lead to economic vitality, environmental resilience, and healthy, thriving communities. SEQR modernization will greenlight the housing, energy, and transit investments New Yorkers support, and that our region needs to remain competitive, equitable, and resilient.”

Association for a Better Long Island Executive Director Kyle Strober said, ""This is a significant update for the New York economic development community. One of the biggest hurdles that economic development projects face is unpredictable timelines and prohibitive soft costs for small to mid-sized projects. These reforms, proposed by Governor Hochul, will help spur economic development, create housing and help make New York more affordable.""

Long Island Contractors’ Association Executive Director Marc Herbst said, “Contractors across Long Island welcome efforts to modernize SEQRA so essential infrastructure projects can move forward in a more timely and predictable way. Streamlining reviews for projects with minimal environmental impact will help communities deliver critical upgrades to roads, water, energy, and public facilities — supporting good-paying local jobs while maintaining strong environmental standards.”

Open New York Executive Director Annemarie Gray said, “Modernizing SEQRA is about restoring faith that our government can deliver on the things New Yorkers need. When critical projects spend five years being delayed by paperwork, people lose faith in government. Right now, we’re facing both an affordability crisis and a climate crisis—these demand immediate action, and New York families can’t afford to wait years for delays driven by frivolous lawsuits. We commend Governor Kathy Hochul for taking this on and urge the State Legislature to pass SEQRA reform in this year’s state budget.”

Citizens Budget Commission President Andrew Rein said, “We commend Governor Hochul for proposing this bold step to boost much-needed housing production. Reforming the onerous environmental review process will make building housing cheaper and faster, without additional cost to the State. That's the sort of smart choice that will make our state more affordable and competitive.”

Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA Executive Director Lisa Daglian said, ""SEQR reform is a crucial complement to transit-oriented development projects around the MTA region, simultaneously combating the housing affordability and climate change crises. We applaud Governor Hochul for taking on this common-sense legislation that will cut red tape and encourage more transit ridership across the region.""

New York State Economic Development Council Executive Director Ryan M. Silva said, “Cutting through red tape and reducing timelines for project approvals is critical to achieve our housing, economic development, and renewable energy goals. The governor’s proposal to exempt housing projects from SEQRA and install a two year cap for review is an important and necessary first step to help support New York’s business climate. These initiatives will help reduce project costs, create predictability in the permitting approval process, and create economic opportunity across the state.”

New York State Association of Counties Executive Director Stephen J. Acquario said, “Counties across New York State recognize that the State Environmental Quality Review Act plays an important role in protecting our natural resources and communities, but we also know that the current SEQR process can be overly complex, time-consuming, and costly — often delaying housing and infrastructure projects that have little or no environmental impact. We welcome the Governor’s review of the SEQR framework and look forward to working with her and the Legislature to modernize the process in a way that preserves strong environmental protections while allowing counties and municipalities to deliver the housing and infrastructure New Yorkers urgently need.”

Westchester County Association President & CEO Michael N. Romita said, “Governor Hochul’s SEQRA reforms are a very important step toward addressing the state’s critical housing shortage. Notwithstanding its noble underpinnings, over the past half century, SERQRA has become increasingly abused by overuse and modernization is overdue. These reforms do not override local control, and they don’t require communities to change their zoning. Rather, they empower local officials to meet today’s needs.”

Long Island Association President & CEO Matt Cohen said, “Red tape and overregulation stifles innovation and hinders sorely needed projects that contribute to economic growth. The LIA commends the Governor’s proposal to streamline environmental reviews for new housing, which would go a long way to addressing our existential cost-of-living crisis on Long Island.”

Adirondack Association of Towns and Villages President, Essex County Chair of Board of Legislators, and Minerva Town Supervisor Steve McNally said, “Although it’s not going to be the silver bullet for the housing crisis, it will certainly expedite things. The Governor is really listening and we appreciate the help she is giving us.”

New York State Business Council President & CEO Heather Mulligan said, “New York’s housing shortage is an ongoing economic concern in all regions of New York State. Modernizing environmental review rules — without hindering protections — can cut years of red tape, lower construction costs, and accelerate the delivery of housing that families and workers can afford. Expediting essential investment projects — will support job creation, community growth, and help make New York more competitive.”

Rockland Business Association CEO Jeffrey Greenberg said, “Governor Hochul’s proposal to cut red tape and modernize permitting is a smart, common-sense step for New York. By streamlining outdated processes while preserving environmental protections and public input, these reforms will help Rockland move critical projects forward faster and at a lower cost while simultaneously supporting economic growth across New York State.”

Westchester Business Council Vice President John Ravits said, “The BCW has always advocated for SEQR Reform. Governor Hochul’s proposal to streamline New York’s permitting and environmental review process is a practical step toward helping communities get projects built more efficiently. By reducing unnecessary delays while maintaining strong environmental safeguards and public engagement, these reforms will lower costs, improve timelines, and support the housing, infrastructure, and economic development projects our region needs.”

New York State Builders Association President Peter Florey said, “It is important that we get back to the original intent of the SEQR process which was to protect our environment. SEQR was not intended to be used as a means of slowing or preventing much needed housing production. Governor Hochul's meaningful recommendations will go a long way towards ensuring that SEQR is used to help housing production and affordability while also safeguarding our environment.”

Enterprise Community Partners Senior Vice President of Programs Baaba Halm said, “When it comes to delivering affordable housing, every second counts. Too often, SEQR creates lengthy, costly, and sometimes insurmountable barriers to affordable housing projects. Enterprise applauds Governor Hochul for recognizing sensible SEQR reform as a way to accelerate the delivery of the affordable homes that New Yorkers so desperately need.""

Real Estate Board of New York Executive Vice President of Public Policy Basha Gerhards said, “The Governor’s thoughtful reforms to SEQRA will accelerate new housing production and save significant time and money. We applaud the administration for identifying a solution to streamline this process while protecting the opportunity for local review.”

The Building & Realty Institute of the Hudson Valley CEO Tim Foley said, “""We know that good housing policy and good climate policy go hand in hand, and that well-designed, energy-efficient infill housing that repurposes already-developed sites can help solve our housing shortage and reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the same time. Too often the very projects that would be a net benefit for the environment and the community get ensnared in lengthy, unpredictable, and costly environmental reviews and challenges. We applaud Governor Hochul's leadership in proposing a way to clear these logjams and create incentives for the kind of mildly-dense, sustainably-built housing we need to secure an affordable New York for all who wish to live and work here.""

Long Island Builders Institute CEO Mike Florio said, “New York’s housing shortage is a crisis that demands action, and Governor Hochul’s proposed reforms to SEQRA are a critical step in the right direction. SEQRA was never intended to be a tool to delay or block much-needed housing for years at a time. Modernizing the review process while maintaining strong environmental protections will help communities add housing faster, reduce costs for families, and support smart, responsible growth across Long Island and New York State.”

Capital Region Chamber and Center for Economic Growth President and CEO Mark Eagan said, “Faced with so much red tape, it can be daunting to do business in New York State. This proposal is a concrete example of Governor Hochul listening to our call to make New York State more competitive. It will allow developers the ability to build more housing thereby addressing the affordability crisis.”

Orange County Partnership Center for Economic Development President & CEO Conor Eckert said, ""By modernizing SEQRA, New York can work together to advance job-creating economic development projects more efficiently while maintaining strong environmental protections. These reforms will help attract investment, strengthen regional economies, and ensure communities across the state can grow and thrive. We thank Governor Hochul for her leadership on this issue.”

Long Island Housing Services Executive Director Ian Wilder said, “On Long Island, SEQRA has long been an essential tool for protecting our drinking water, open space, and air quality, and those protections must remain strong. At the same time, a small number of bad-faith challenges have abused the statute to delay or derail lawful, environmentally responsible housing — particularly infill development, code-compliant homes with appropriate sewage systems, and accessory dwelling units. Thoughtful SEQRA reform restores balance. It preserves meaningful environmental review while reducing misuse that has worsened traffic congestion and fueled sprawl that puts greater strain on groundwater and infrastructure. On an island with limited land and a severe housing shortage, smart, compact housing is not in conflict with environmental protection — it is one of the most effective ways to achieve it.”

Central New York Fair Housing Executive Director Sally Santangelo said, “Fair housing flourishes in communities that support housing diversity, walkability, and public transportation. CNY Fair Housing supports SEQR reform that updates this important environmental protection to foster inclusive and sustainable growth in order to expand housing opportunities for all people in New York State.”",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/2023-10/Affordable-Housing-Generic-Hero.jpg?h=b08ee015&itok=ePBJGNYH,N,,2026-01-13 21:12:48.689484

That cost gets compared to the economic benefits of reduced pollution, which is obviously a bit harder to calculate.
For this reason, it is associated with a host of health impacts even beyond respiratory conditions.
Ozone pollution in the lower atmosphere results from reactions between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds emitted by various anthropogenic sources.
Currently, documentation for how the EPA previously calculated pollution regulation benefits based on research—including transparent assessments of scientific uncertainties—is still available on the EPA website.","If you were to do a cost-benefit analysis of your lunch, it would be pretty difficult to do the calculation without the sandwich. But it appears that the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is moving in this same direction—removing the benefit—when it comes to air pollution regulations.

According to a New York Times report based on internal emails and documents—and demonstrated by a recently produced analysis on the EPA website—the EPA is changing its cost-benefit analysis process for common air pollutants. Instead of comparing the economic cost of a certain pollution limit to an estimate of the economic value of the resulting improvements in human health, the EPA will just qualitatively describe health benefits while carefully quantifying economic costs.

Cost-benefit analysis has been a key component of EPA regulations. Any decision to raise or lower air quality standards or pollution limits includes evaluations of the cost that change, like the addition of new pollution control equipment at power plants, would incur, for example.

That cost gets compared to the economic benefits of reduced pollution, which is obviously a bit harder to calculate. At the more tractable end of the spectrum, they can calculate things like health care costs and lost economic productivity for people whose health worsens. Even this requires an estimate of how much of a health impact to expect for a given change in pollution.

But what’s the intrinsic dollar value of someone’s health? Attempts to tackle that thorny question in some practical way result in estimates known as “value of a statistical life.” The EPA has described this as “how much people are willing to pay for small reductions in their risks of dying from adverse health conditions that may be caused by environmental pollution.” Having this number gives us something to hold up next to the cost of that pollution control equipment.

The move to exclude the estimated benefits relates specifically to fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers (known as PM2.5) and ozone. This particulate matter, commonly produced by combustion, is small enough to make it through your respiratory system and into your bloodstream. For this reason, it is associated with a host of health impacts even beyond respiratory conditions. That has made research on those impacts the target of anti-regulation advocates who claim scientists exaggerate the harm.

Ozone is also a familiar enough pollutant in smoggy areas to be mentioned in weather forecasts as a warning for people with conditions like asthma. Ozone pollution in the lower atmosphere results from reactions between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds emitted by various anthropogenic sources.

The new EPA language claims that past analyses have failed to adequately represent the scientific uncertainty of the economic value of reducing these pollutants. The new economic impact analysis for stationary combustion turbines, for example, says this “leads the public to believe the Agency has a better understanding of the monetized impacts of exposure to PM2.5 and ozone than in reality.” It continues, “Therefore, to rectify this error, the EPA is no longer monetizing benefits from PM2.5 and ozone but will continue to quantify the emissions until the Agency is confident enough in the modeling to properly monetize those impacts.”

A 2024 regulatory impact analysis for stationary combustion turbines had estimated those benefits at $27–$92 million per year for a tightening of emissions limits.

This is not the first time that these numbers have become political targets. Between 2004 and 2008, the Bush administration reduced the EPA’s value of a statistical life by around 11 percent. But instead of moving numbers to the lower end of scientific estimates, the Trump administration is more aggressively weaponizing scientific uncertainty. Functionally, the logic is that since estimates of benefits vary from large to extremely large, the EPA will default to a value of zero. Only the costs will be calculated, and those numbers are sure to be highlighted as justification for loosening pollution limits.

Currently, documentation for how the EPA previously calculated pollution regulation benefits based on research—including transparent assessments of scientific uncertainties—is still available on the EPA website.",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2182255823-2560x1440.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 17:00:20.912448

“The bottom line is, just like it always is, we got more problems than we got money,” McAllister said.
“The AML fund is not a slush fund,” Pitzer said.
“To us here in Pennsylvania, it’s a vital and essential lifeline to doing more projects in our local communities.
“This was a promise made to these communities and raiding the fund is breaking that promise.”","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment.

When the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was signed into law in 2021, authorizing more than $11 billion in new funding to reclaim lands and waterways damaged by abandoned coal mines, the people who lead this work on the ground were ecstatic.

“We were to the moon,” said Amanda Pitzer, the executive director at Friends of the Cheat, a nonprofit organization in West Virginia that works to restore the Cheat River watershed. “Once that big influx of money was announced, with West Virginia on track to receive $2.1 billion over those 15 years, we thought, ‘Now’s the time. Now’s the time to invest in water treatment.’”

But Congress wants to claw back some of that funding.

Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed an appropriations bill that would withdraw $500 million of the money allocated in 2021 for abandoned mine cleanup projects. The states that stand to lose the most are Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Illinois and Kentucky, according to an analysis by Appalachian Voices, an environmental organization that works on conservation issues in central and southern Appalachia. The bill must still pass the Senate, which plans to take it up this week, and be signed by the president before it becomes law.

“We’re horribly disappointed,” Pitzer said. “Less money means less reclamation, period.” Among the projects that Pitzer’s organization champions are the building and maintenance of treatment systems that clean up acid mine drainage, a type of pollution that harms aquatic wildlife.

Federal budget bill would raid fund for cleaning up abandoned coal mines

In West Virginia, she said, Abandoned Mine Land funding has also been used to help build public water lines in communities where pollution has affected drinking water supplies. Although significant progress has been made in cleaning up the Cheat River since the 1990s, much more work remains to be done, Pitzer said.

The House bill proposes using the siphoned funding to pay for wildland fire management and U.S. Forest Service operations. “I think it’s highly inappropriate of Congress to rob Peter to pay Paul,” said Andy McAllister, the regional coordinator of the Western Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation.

McAllister was particularly upset about the “yes” votes from Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation in the House. All but one member voted for the bill.

Pennsylvania has the most abandoned mines of any state, McAllister said. Decades of coal mining in Pennsylvania have created a range of environmental and public safety problems, from underground fires and subsidence to sinkholes and pollution affecting more than 5,500 miles of waterways.

Last year, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection estimated it would need $5 billion to fully remediate abandoned mine lands and the waterways they contaminated. Forty-five of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties are impacted.

“The bottom line is, just like it always is, we got more problems than we got money,” McAllister said.

Experts are worried that this “repurposing” of the fund could continue beyond this year, with Congress dipping into the money for other reasons. “The AML fund is not a slush fund,” Pitzer said. “It just feels very shortsighted.”

Kevin Zedack, government affairs specialist at Appalachian Voices, said his group assumes that passing this bill will lead to an annual reduction in funding. Zedack and McAllister said they have not heard back from legislators they’ve reached out to with their concerns.

The offices of Pennsylvania’s senators, Republican Dave McCormick and Democrat John Fetterman, did not respond to requests for comment from Inside Climate News.

Zedack and McAllister both pointed out that the loss of funding will harm local economies. Unremediated mine land can’t be used for development, for example.

“Projects that are funded through this provide jobs in historically depressed areas,” McAllister said. Those opportunities can help to offset job losses from the declining coal industry.

Joe Pizarchik, the former head of the federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, which oversees AML funding, grew up in western Pennsylvania. The region is also losing out on huge amounts of tourism revenue, he said. Many waterways are so impaired by mining pollution that they can’t be used for fishing or recreation.

Pizarchik said this isn’t the first time the federal government has reduced the funding available to help communities in coal country since the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act was first passed in 1977.

“There was a fee put in place on every ton of coal produced to help clean up the messes of the past,” he said. Over time, the fees have shrunk. “Congress is taking back money again to continue to punish the impoverished communities that have been suffering for a century,” he said.

“To the federal government, it’s a drop in the bucket,” said Bobby Hughes, executive director of the Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation. “To us here in Pennsylvania, it’s a vital and essential lifeline to doing more projects in our local communities. We are living the impacts of this legacy.”

Pitzer agreed. “The program was initially structured to collect a fee to pay for sins of the past, and that money should stay in coal country. It should not be redirected to other needs and other places,” Pitzer said. “This was a promise made to these communities and raiding the fund is breaking that promise.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-96/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/lick-run-sept-2019-2-1024x6831768316449.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=Q24VKEz_,N,,2026-01-13 23:00:20.706863

That mindset is not enough. If Michigan wants to secure long-term prosperity, we must lead. Whether it’s taxes, regulations, workforce development, or education, Michigan needs to think about filling the Treasury with prosperity, not pain.

Michigan families and businesses are feeling the pressure of rising property tax assessments, which raises the cost of housing and other expenses. The “uncapping” of property taxes at the time of sale has led to a stagnant market with older adults refusing to subject themselves to increased taxes when they sell their existing home and purchase a new one.Property taxes require review and reform if Michigan is serious about affordability.

Economic development incentives deserve the same scrutiny. The state spent nearly $2 billion to land the Blue Oval battery plant in Marshall. While these jobs are welcome, we should ask a hard question: are massive, one-off incentives the most effective way to grow Michigan’s economy? A strong infrastructure and elimination of burdensome regulations would attract sustainable investments far better.

Roads, bridges, and reasonable energy costs are the backbone of economic growth. Yet Michigan often manages itself into crisis funding—waiting until systems fail before acting, then scrambling to patch the problem at a higher cost. Preventive investment and disciplined spending are not glamorous, but they are essential. Repealing the renewable energy laws is a must. All forms of energy that are affordable, reliable, and clean should be part of the solution, including nuclear and natural gas.

Today, the Legislature may pass a law, but the real impact is often determined by unelected bureaucrats through rulemaking. Regulatory burdens often exceed legislative intent and stifle innovation without accountability. The Legislature must take back final rule making approval to ensure the implementation of passed legislation meets those expectations.

Incentivizing companies to relocate or expand here without ensuring a skilled workforce only achieves half the goal. We cannot continue to push every student toward a four-year degree while neglecting the trades that keep our economy running. Trade schools and apprenticeships must be promoted with the same urgency as universities. We must refocus our career prep, so it is both student/parent chosen and meets our state’s needs.

Education reform begins earlier than job training. We need to be honest about failing schools and identify why students are falling behind. Phonics-based literacy instruction must be prioritized. Allowing students to advance without mastering fundamentals must be ended. We must be willing to have discussions about school district consolidation (beginning with large administrative services). Reduce overhead, reward better outcomes, improve teacher pay with saved costs, and focus on the student!

Leading means making choices before circumstances force them upon us. It means building systems that work for the next generation.

“Then the wind projects started to die down, and we saw more solar projects.","Editor’s note: This is the second in an eight-part series, called “Paved Over,” exploring the impact of tech-driven development on U.S. farmland. Stories will focus on data center expansion, solar development, the impact to farmers losing land and possible solutions.

Central Arizona farmer Noah Hiscox is among the last holdouts in Pinal County. So far, more than 20,000 acres of farmland have been converted to solar panels in adjacent Coolidge and Eloy counties.

“It was kind of like cancer. It just kept growing and before they realized, ‘My goodness, this could kill us.’ The community became united against it,” Hiscox said. “Nobody likes it. Nobody wants to see it. Everybody’s unhappy with it.”

Beyond aesthetics, Hiscox said the panels have created a heat island effect, driving temperatures upward.

“If it doesn’t get down into the 70s at night, cotton doesn’t pollinate,” he said. “Last summer, we had the most high-nighttime lows in history. Consequently, it hurt our yields considerably. We had a lot of nights up in the 80s. Our yields were probably off by half a bale last year.”

As domestic energy needs surge, solar development is transforming America’s agricultural landscape. Of more than 3,000 utility-scale solar projects built in rural areas between 2012 and 2020, 43% were built on cropland, according to the USDA’s Economic Research Service. That percentage is much higher in the Midwest, where 70% cover productive acres. That’s 7.25 million acres of solar arrays nationwide — and growing.

Caught between economic opportunity brought on by rising land value and farmland preservation, farmers worry about tile damage, environmental impact, and the loss of rented farmland when property owners choose solar development over agriculture.

Quality, not quantity

The American Farmland Trust, an advocacy organization, projects that more than 10 million acres of land will be needed for utility-scale solar by 2050. This expansion is targeting highly productive farmland surrounding energy transmission corridors where solar arrays cluster. Ohio’s Power Siting Board recently approved a 2,000-plus acre solar development near Jon Miller’s property, a row crop farm near Pleasantville.

“We’re in a prime location for crop production. I hate to see the loss of super-productive ground,” Miller said. “I’m all about property owners’ rights. If the landowners want to [sell], that’s up to them. But I think there’s a better place to stick solar than on a productive acre of ground.”

When compared to the nation’s 900 million farmland acres, solar’s projected allotment might seem statistically insignificant. But there’s a caveat: More than 80% will likely span highly productive farm areas.

“Not all farmland is created equal,” said Greg Plotkin, the American Farmland Trust’s senior manager for smart solar outreach and engagement. “It’s not necessarily the amount of farmland that’s being taken out of production as much as it is the quality of the land that’s being taken out of production.”

It’s a story with no villain — nor a simple solution — because farmers are often the ones selling and buying land. Market factors drive sales. It’s basic capitalism.

Or maybe in this case, it’s a consequence of America’s free market.

Increasing energy needs

Row crop farmers have long championed renewable energy. But as emerging technologies like electric vehicles, clean HVAC systems, artificial intelligence and crypto drive unprecedented energy needs, some feel agriculture is being overlooked.

Matt Riggs, a fifth-generation Illinois corn and soybean farmer, is worried about farmland loss. Without the ability to stop commercial solar development, he supports dual-use agrivoltaics arrays, which can simultaneously produce energy and support agriculture.

“Projects are happening in my home county. There are no crops being grown underneath,” he said at the Solar Farm Summit conference in Chicago. “There is angst in the ag community. [Impacted] farmers are often multigenerational farmers who have been on the land for a long, long time.”

Fourth-generation Oregon farmer John Langdon, who likewise advocates for dual-use solar development when it’s inevitable, takes land preservation a step further.

“What does the future look like for ag? You talk about trends. One of the things I look at is the next generation,” he said at the same event. “I hear, ‘Save farmland.’ I’m interested in saving the farmer.”

Expansion correlates to expected demand. Even while rolling back solar-friendly policies, the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted a 50% increase in electricity generation nationwide by 2050 in its annual Energy Outlook 2025.

Meanwhile, the U.S. grid is severely outdated. The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory proposed dramatic grid expansion in a recent study — potentially doubling its size.

“Solar now accounts for about 5% of electricity generation,” said Pete Riley, a retired Farm Service Agency economic and policy analyst, speaking at the USDA’s 2025 Farm Outlook Forum in Washington, D.C. “Obviously, there is a lot of policy uncertainty at this stage. However, we will see continued expansion in the next couple years.”

DOE projects solar power generation will eclipse 40% of the nation’s electricity supply in the next decade. Two years ago, analysts valued the U.S. solar market at $53 billion. It’s expected to triple by 2032.

In part, that’s because arrays are easy to build and comparatively cheap.

“All electrons are valued,” said Matt Beasley, chief communications officer at Nashville-based Silicon Ranch. “The ones that should be valued the most are those that come to market the fastest. Over the past decade, solar has proven to be the lowest-cost form of new electricity generation and the quickest to deploy.”

Unlike fossil fuels from coal mines, rural lands have become the infrastructural landing zone for this energy expansion because farmland is inexpensive and already clearcut. For farmers, navigating this evolution sometimes means supporting the lesser of two evils.

“I’d rather see a solar farm than houses. Traffic is bad enough without adding 600 acres of residential neighborhoods,” said Dusty Smith, a young Cardington, Ohio, corn and soybean farmer with a small livestock operation. Even so, he said development often isn’t good for agriculture.

This challenge extends from Massachusetts, where ag real estate averages $14,400 per acre, to Texas, at about $2,800 per acre, and everywhere in between. Locally, Ohio’s demand is expected to quadruple from 500 to 2,000 megawatts in Delaware and Licking counties by 2027. Infrastructure is being built quickly to meet those needs.

“From 2008 to 2018, we were seeing a lot of wind projects come into Ohio,” said Matt Butler, public information officer for the Ohio Power Siting Board, which oversees utility-scale power. “Then the wind projects started to die down, and we saw more solar projects. Solar is kind of slowing, and we’re beginning to see a lot of behind-the-meter gas projects” to power data centers.

Solar’s effect on farming

Solar expansion’s impact on U.S. farmers is complex. Some landowners are selling or leasing at price points beyond their property’s agricultural production value. Renters face a more challenging situation. Although rent tends to remain stable, the land they cultivate — often improved through their own efforts — is being sold out from under them.

Meanwhile, landowners who offer land for solar face legal and tax pitfalls if they don’t adequately protect themselves. Neighbor farmers who aren’t involved in solar-related agreements face tangential risks like physical damage to existing agricultural infrastructure or increased traffic.

Smith opened a map on his iPhone and zoomed in to where a proposed 600-acre Open Road Renewables solar farm abuts his productive land. It’s worrying because drainage runs through the planned development. He’s afraid it will harm floodwater mitigation.

“We have a main tile going through a part of the field,” he explained. “Dad and I have very much been upfront: ‘Hey, look. We have major concerns. This is part of our operation. This is our livelihood. Are you going to take care of us? What’s going to happen?’

“That’s a 90-acre field with no outlet,” he said. “If they cut it, that’s swamp ground.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt00b41504fd79f933/695feacbca52e0db44f237df/0112T1-5640a-1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-13 15:12:41.777772

That’s the crux of “Anthropause: The Beauty of Degrowth,” a new book out this month.

In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, society shut down for a few months. As humans stayed inside, animals returned to their old habitats and pollution eased as industry slowed.

Retired researcher—and new metro Detroit resident—Stan Cox looks at how that “anthropause” could be a preview of the necessary societal changes to save lives and the planet.

He spoke with All Things Considered – Detroit host Russ McNamara last month. Click on the media player to listen or read selected transcripts below.

Russ McNamara, WDET: Why did you write this book?

Stan Cox, Author: The main point I’m making in the book is imagining that we as a society, if we were to rapidly phase out fossil fuels and get by just on the energy that could be generated other ways; and if we stopped plundering the earth for minerals and cutting down forest and causing ecological damage; and we had less energy and materials, and had to allocate them carefully: people know that’s going to mean sacrifice. What am I going to have to give up and so forth?

And what I’m saying in the book is okay, yeah, there are certain things, obviously that will have to be given up. But let’s consider all of the dangers and nuisances, terrible stuff that we put up with an advanced industrial society that has all this energy and materials running through it.

We would be saying goodbye to a lot of those harms and ills by simply not doing a lot of the stuff that requires so much energy input. So the rest of the book, then, is going through specific technologies and activities and so forth that are really harmful to people and the environment, of course, that we would not have the fuel to undertake them, or we would be using resources for meeting people’s basic needs, and we wouldn’t be spending a lot of energy on these other things.

RM: You discuss this and I’m reminded of data centers to run artificial intelligence. People certainly don’t seem to want them and definitely don’t want these in their backyard because there is this concern about the high cost of electricity, and the amount of groundwater that is needed.

SC: That’s absolutely right. One of the big reasons these communities don’t want them is that they create this horrific noise at very high decibel levels and low low frequency noise, which is especially dangerous to human health. When I started writing the book, there wasn’t as much being said about A.I. and the data centers at that time, so I did eventually incorporated them, but the beginning of the second chapter is about noise pollution and and I just used it. It’s seemingly a very small thing, but it really brings out other issues. The leaf blower, especially the gas powered leaf blower, also produces this low frequency and very high volume sound—about eight times the decibel level that the World Health Organization says is safe – and they’re producing a wind about the speed of an EF five tornado. The low frequency sound can travel like three football fields. It’s still above the safe limit.

RM: So what are the societal impacts? Let’s say we start degrowth right now. What are the benefits?

SC: We can’t go on like we’re on the trajectory that we’re on now, because. A degrowth is going to happen. Either a chaotic, brutal degrowth where it’s a Mad Max kind of future, because we’ve tried to force growth to continue and have destroyed ecosystems

Or we can have a planned, rational degrowth that ensures that there’s enough for everybody and that we’re not causing ecological collapse. But there’s no way that growth can continue at this rate.

Sometime in the past three years, we passed a milestone. The quantity of human made stuff—that is everything that human society has manufactured or built or produced—if you weigh all of it up, the mass of all of that exceeds the total mass of all living things on Earth, all plants, animals, microbes, et cetera, and that quantity of stuff being produced is is doubling every 20 years. And clearly that can’t go on.",https://wdet.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AnthropauseBook.png,N,,2026-01-13 16:00:08.981177

President calls for global finance shift for developing nations

LAGOS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Nigeria is betting on green finance to drive its energy transition with the president unveiling plans for a $2 billion climate fund on Tuesday, saying oversubscribed green bonds were proof of investor appetite.

Speaking at the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week summit, President Bola Tinubu said Nigeria’s Climate Investment Platform aimed to mobilise $500 million for climate-resilient infrastructure, while the National Climate Change Fund is targeting a $2 billion capitalisation to back projects that cut emissions and boost resilience.

Tinubu also announced that Nigeria and the United Arab Emirates had signed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) that aims to boost trade and investment across sectors including renewable energy, aviation, logistics, agriculture, digital trade, and climate-smart infrastructure.

Nigeria faces major environmental and climate policy challenges including reducing gas flaring and methane emissions, as it works towards its Energy Transition Plan, which targets net-zero emissions by 2060 while delivering universal energy access.

Nigeria’s green bond programme has drawn strong investor interest. A 50 billion naira ($38 million) sovereign green bond issued in 2025 attracted 91 billion naira in subscriptions, while Lagos State’s green bond was oversubscribed by nearly 98%, the president said.

Tinubu said his government was also seeking to unlock an ambitious $25–$30 billion annually in climate finance. A new Climate and Green Industrialisation Investment Playbook will aid private investors and other stakeholders navigate manufacturing policy and the regulatory landscape.

This builds on past initiatives including the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority's $500 million Distributed Renewable Energy Fund, launched in March 2025 to catalyse local financing.

“These reforms show Nigeria is ready for business,” the president said, adding that non-oil exports have grown by 21% and investment commitments now exceed $50 billion across key sectors.

Nigeria is prioritising technology partnerships to modernise its grid and deploy artificial intelligence for efficiency, alongside pilot projects in electric mobility and green industrialisation, he added.

The president called for a shift towards more blended finance -- which combines public and philanthropic capital with private investment and can absorb initial losses if the project underperforms -- instead of sovereign guarantees, which he said unfairly penalise emerging economies.

WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a proposed rule that would return Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 401 to its proper statutory purpose, protecting water quality while eliminating regulatory overreach that has imposed unnecessary burden on critical infrastructure projects. This proposed rule would fulfill EPA's statutory role to ensure the water quality certification process operates within the clear boundaries established by Congress, maximizing permitting efficiency and eliminating unwarranted delays that have stifled economic growth. The changes directly support the essential role that state co-regulators and authorized tribes play in protecting water resources while advancing the Trump Administration's commitment to cooperative federalism.

This action would correct a fundamentally flawed 2023 Biden EPA rule that allowed delay tactics and protracted certification timelines inconsistent with the Clean Water Act. The 2023 rule's expansion of Section 401's scope enabled certain states to abuse this provision, creating substantial regulatory burdens that unnecessarily delayed or blocked vital energy, infrastructure, and development projects critical to America's economic and national security. The Trump EPA's proposal would eliminate these regulatory hurdles, restoring the law to its intended function while removing impediments to responsible development.

“Today’s proposal restores the Clean Water Act to its intended purpose, protecting America’s water quality and ending the weaponization of the law that has been obstructing infrastructure and energy projects vital to our nation’s economy,” said Administrator Lee Zeldin. “By returning Section 401 to its clear statutory boundaries, we’re strengthening the role of state and tribal partners while ensuring environmental protections are implemented lawfully, efficiently, and consistent with congressional intent.”

“The EPA’s new rule aligns with my longstanding legislative efforts to update the Section 401 certification process to streamline infrastructure development. The EPA’s update reverses costly Biden-era policies that allowed states to weaponize Section 401 to block infrastructure projects for reasons unrelated to water quality. I commend Administrator Zeldin’s work to expedite critical infrastructure development and help America build faster,” said Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV).

“I commend Administrator Zeldin for bringing common sense back to the Clean Water Act section 401 process and ensuring the Act’s focus is on clean water – not on weaponizing it to block infrastructure projects for reasons that have nothing to do with clean water. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is pursuing this same goal through the PERMIT Act, which we passed out of the House in December, and I look forward to both the rule and the PERMIT Act moving forward,” said House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Sam Graves (R-MO-06).

In response to implementation challenges with the flawed 2023 Clean Water Act Section 401 Certification rule, the Trump EPA took swift action in the spring of 2025, issuing a memo that clarified the specific roles of states and authorized tribes under Clean Water Act Section 401. The agency also sought public input this summer to inform the updates being proposed in this action.

The proposed rulemaking would ensure predictability in Clean Water Act Section 401 implementation by standardizing approaches for certification requests and decisions, eliminating back-and-forth delay tactics on certification submissions, adhering to statutory timelines for certification decisions, and defining a clear process for both applicants and certifying authorities.

Additionally, the proposed rule would ensure that states and tribes are no longer able to use Section 401 to shut down projects for reasons that fall outside of the Clean Water Act’s statutory requirements and appropriate and applicable water quality-related regulations.

Following the proposed rule’s publication in the Federal Register, EPA will open a 30-day public comment period.

The blueprint, which the 190-member Republican Study Committee developed over the past several months, represents the GOP’s first concrete step toward another party-line bill as the conference looks to score more legislative wins ahead of the November midterm elections.

Committee leaders cast the framework as a “vetted menu” of policy options for the broader conference to consider. It includes numerous proposals intended to streamline the permitting process for energy projects, as well as ideas for killing energy efficiency standards, overhauling the government’s regulatory process, and imposing new restrictions on federal grants and subsidies.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and some other Republican leaders in Congress are bullish on the prospect of advancing a sequel to last year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, even as President Donald Trump and some other key players have thrown cold water on the idea.

“It would be political malpractice if we did not pursue a reconciliation 2.0 plan,” Rep. August Pfluger (R-Texas), chair of the Republican Study Committee, told reporters Tuesday.

“There’s no reason to stop our progress right now,” Pfluger added. “We have momentum on our side, and there’s more work to be done.”

The framework includes several dozen bullet points, not legislative text, so the exact nature of some of the proposals is not completely clear. The extent of some of the proposals’ budget impacts — a requirement for inclusion in a reconciliation law — is also unclear.

Republicans want to try again to pass a version of the “REINS Act” through reconciliation. The legislation, a conservative priority, would restrict an administration’s ability to implement major rules without Congress’ approval.

Under the heading “Energy Independence and Economic Security for All Americans,” the RSC included multiple proposals to ease permitting-related obstacles for energy and infrastructure projects.

One would establish a program called “Keeping the American Promise” that would “provide economic protection” against future administrations canceling approved permits, licenses and investments for fossil fuel projects. The framework does not mention renewables or energy sources with broad bipartisan support, such as nuclear and geothermal.

Another proposal would impose “royalty-style fees” on plaintiffs suing the federal government for alleged violations of “procedural environmental laws.” The fees’ revenues would go toward the Department of Justice’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.

Republicans included a plan to establish categorical exclusions — presumably under the National Environmental Policy Act — for “forest management-related activities.” The goal would be “protecting natural resources and promoting effective wildfire management,” according to the framework.

The framework also includes a proposal to impose a fee on states’ applications for waivers that would allow them to set more stringent pollution limits than those imposed by the Clean Air Act.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/36/20/a0fa00a8446abc255149acb38849/u-s-congress-92081.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 15:01:22.213350

GM had a record year for EV sales in 2025, tapering off in the fourth quarter due to the end of the tax credits.

The automaker may bring back hybrids in the future.

General Motors had to make several difficult decisions last year. After the Trump administration axed the $7,500 federal tax credit and heavily revised fuel-economy rules to end the push for a mostly-electric market by the 2030s, the automaker scaled back its battery-powered ambitions.

The Orion Assembly Plant in Michigan, which was earmarked for EV-only production, will now produce gasoline trucks. GM also sold its stake in the Ultium Cells battery plant to LG Energy Solution, due to potentially less demand for EV batteries amid slowing sales.

“It will take longer without the incentives, but I still think we’ll get there over time,” Barra told Reuters reporter and APA President Kalea Hall, referring to the cooling period for EV sales after the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit last September.

“Once someone buys an EV, they're 80% more likely to buy another EV,” Barra said. “Our destination is to get to the all-EV future we've been talking about,"" she added.

Barra's optimistic remarks came just a day before President Donald Trump’s visit to Michigan to speak at the Detroit Economic Club and visit Ford’s Dearborn Assembly plant, where the F-150 pickups are made. Whether the president will address EVs in his talk was not immediately clear, but the Trump administration's regulatory reset has been costly for the American auto industry.

Just last week, GM disclosed in an SEC filing that pumping the brakes on EVs resulted in $6 billion in associated charges in the final quarter of the year due to things like contract cancellation fees for suppliers.

Ford also faced a similar outcome, although on a much larger scale, booking over $19 billion in charges for dialling down its EV ambitions, which included ending production of the F-150 Lightning.

And Stellantis said last week that it was canceling its plug-in hybrids in North America, with the Jeep Wrangler 4xe, Grand Cherokee 4xe, and Chrysler Pacifica Plug-In Hybrid all getting discontinued. That’s despite the Jeeps being the top-selling PHEVs of 2025, as per research firm Recurrent.

“I’m a little surprised at some [automakers] that are really pulling away very quickly, because we don’t know what will be in ‘29, ‘30, ‘32,” Barra said, referring to a potential recovery in EV sales in the years to come.

Apart from the Corvette E-Ray, GM does not sell any hybrids or PHEVs in the U.S. currently. But that could change in the future, Automotive News reported. “We have plans to do those, and we’ll have hybrids where we think we need to,” Barra said.

“But again, we’re mainly investing and continuing to work on EVs because we think that’s the end game,” she said.

Margaret Walls: Hello, and welcome to Resources Radio, a weekly podcast from Resources for the Future (RFF). I’m your host, Margaret Walls. My guest today is Benji Backer.

Benji is the founder and CEO of Nature is Nonpartisan, which is a nonprofit organization that’s focused on redefining the environment as a nonpartisan issue. He also serves on the board of the American Conservation Coalition, or ACC, which is a conservative environmental organization that he founded—during his freshman year of college, mind you. I’m not sure what all of you were doing your freshman year of college, but I was not doing that!

Benji is also the author of a really interesting book that was published in 2024 entitled The Conservative Environmentalist: Common Sense Solutions for a Sustainable Future. He’s been named a New York Times changemaker and awarded the Fortune 40 under 40, Forbes 30 under 30, and various other awards, as well. Benji is really one of the leading youth environmental voices in the country, and he’s been said to be someone who has the ear of the Trump administration on conservation and environment issues.

We’re going to talk with Benji about what it means to be a conservative environmentalist, Nature Is Nonpartisan and the organization’s goals and priorities, his views on climate change, his engagement with the administration and Congress, and much more. Stay with us.

Hello, Benji. Welcome to Resources Radio. Thanks so much for coming on the show.

Benji Backer: It’s absolutely great to be here. Thanks for having me.

Margaret Walls: Benji, we always start the show with the “get-to-know-you question.” I just want to learn a little bit more about you and want our listeners to learn a little bit more about you. How did you come to be passionate about environmental issues? And how did you have the courage, I guess, to jump into this—what I would call a new brand of environmental advocacy—and do it at such a young age? Just tell us a little bit about how you got into what you’re doing.

Benji Backer: Well, I appreciate the question. It really honestly comes from genuine passion. Most people ask me that question about how I got active in politics and environmental activism at such a young age, and I really don’t have a clear answer other than the fact that I cared a lot at a young age.

My parents were not active politically. They cared a lot about conservation in the environment, but they weren’t also active environmentally either. It just was something that really was important to me.

In elementary school, every single time that we had the chance to do a project, (which, of course, was like an art project or something visual), I always would do it around the environment and environmental issues. I learned about climate change in grade school, and it was very important to me from that age.

At around the same time, probably, as I was learning about climate change in the latter end of grade school, I was also watching the 2008 presidential debate between John McCain and Barack Obama. The democratic process, as it was back then—I think it’s very, very toxic, compared to then, today—really inspired me to be active.

I have a grandpa who’s a Marine veteran, and John McCain reminded me of him. I love my grandpa, and I also believed in the values that John McCain was espousing. I was 10 years old, but my parents were start-up founders. Seeing how hard they worked for our family—and for the community that they helped employ people in—I think his values, just from a physical perspective, resonated with me. I asked my parents if I could volunteer for him. I was injured at the time, physically, so I couldn’t do the sports that I wanted to do.

Fast-forward 15 years from then, and I’ve combined both of those passions of politics (which was strange at the time) and environmentalism (which was, also, a little bit strange at the time), and continued learning, becoming more passionate, and becoming more worried—but more optimistic, at the same time, which we can get into at some point.

Margaret Walls: Yeah, we’ll investigate that more. That’s great. It’s really interesting. So, Benji, I first learned about your work earlier this year when the idea of selling federal lands was part of the budget reconciliation bill. Let me just remind listeners, or tell listeners if they didn’t know this, that some members of Congress offered up various versions of a bill that would’ve sold US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands—or, in some versions, it was both BLM lands and the US Forest Service lands.

This was ostensibly, I would say, to be used for housing development around Western communities that had some housing affordability challenges, and so forth. Ultimately, the idea failed, and I believe that you were one of the most prominent opponents of that. There were some others, but talk about that if you would—that one policy issue that was going on, where you stood on it, and what role you played.

Benji Backer: Well, it’s been a difficult first year of the administration, because there’s been so many things that have happened every single day. When I launched this organization, Nature Is Nonpartisan, early in 2025, we got an onslaught of, “Are you commenting on this? Are you commenting on that? Are you pushing back against this, and pushing back against that?” You can’t do it all. But when I saw this come across the radar—I actually had a congressman flag it for me before it went public—that this land sale was going to be in the reconciliation bill (the Big Beautiful Bill is what the president called it), I became incredibly, incredibly alarmed.

Going back to my story: Public lands are the reason I care about the environment in the first place. It’s the reason I care about climate change in the first place. I spent most of my childhood in national forests, which was what was on the chopping block here. Then, almost all of my college experience—I grew up in Wisconsin and moved out to Seattle for college—when I wasn’t working and running the nonprofit that I founded, I was out skiing and hiking in national forests.

When the proposal was to sell off national forests—it was three million acres of unidentified land. No one knew what parcels,, and could have literally been anywhere that was a national forest or BLM land—I decided that this was something, early on in the organization, that we had to take on. Again, we couldn’t take on everything—let alone, really, anything—because of how new we were. But I knew that this was a hill I was willing to die on.

I remember it was a Monday morning before it was announced, and I tweeted out, “Hey, there’s going to be this public land sell-off, and it’s three million acres, and here are some pictures of me in those places that could be sold off. They are fully eligible with the language of the bill.” And it went viral. It was crazy to see the reaction. The reason why being viral, in this case, mattered was twofold: One, it was all across the spectrum. You had the furthest Left and the furthest Right, and the center-Left and the center-Right, all uniting around opposition for this, in the midst of the most divisive time in my lifetime, honestly. And seeing that happen, during this divisive moment, was really powerful.

The second thing was: Eventually, the senator who introduced it, Mike Lee, caved. The reason he caved was not due to a technicality, which is what it was blamed on—there was some technicality through Senate rules that was, supposedly, not allowing this policy to go through. It was actually because so many senators across the political spectrum were against it, including those of his own party. And the reason they were against it was because the general public, across the spectrum, was also against it. It was really a showcase of the power of grassroots, and really a showcase of the power of culture, because it was social media and cultural figures.

I was the first one, I think, to sound the alarm nationally, but then I became drowned out by all these huge voices, in a good way. People like Joe Rogan, Patagonia, REI, and everyone in between were voicing opposition against this. I think that’s the future of environmentalism that I see. It’s one that, yes, we don’t see eye to eye on a lot of things, but there’s a few things that our Venn diagrams do overlay on: Clean air, clean water, protection of our wild spaces, protection of the places that we recreate, and restoration of the natural world around us. These are things that every American wants. And for the first time in a decade, this pretty bad idea, actually, had a really big silver lining, which is that it showed the power of working across the aisle on conservation again.

Margaret Walls: That’s interesting. Benji, I went to your event that you hosted on the Hill, which announced the Stewardship—Is that what they’re calling themselves? The Stewardship Conference?

Benji Backer: Yeah, Stewardship Conference.

Margaret Walls: Yeah. So, since you’re bringing up how it brought people and senators together, maybe just tell our listeners a little bit about that and what their effort is going to be with that.

Benji Backer: It was really interesting. Earlier this year—and thanks for attending that—I realized that there was really no domestic conservation caucus in the Senate. The reason that matters, for those who don’t know what a caucus is, is that there’s really no convening group for senators who care a lot about just general conservation, public land, water, and forest issues. I knew that earlier this year, and I was like, “Okay, that has to be started, but I’ll do that later. I’ll do that a couple of years from now, or something.” Then, when this public land sell-off was proposed, it unearthed the fact that there were all these senators on the Right and the Left—but, of course, helpful to know the senators on the Right—who were willing to say, “Hey, no, this is too far. I care a lot about conservation, and I’m willing to die on this hill, too.”

In the weeks following the defeat of this proposed bill, I talked to a few of the Republicans who had stood up against it, and they’re like, “Yeah, we need to have a convening mechanism to not just oppose bad things—because that’s only so helpful—but actually to propose good ideas, and get bipartisan policies across the finish line.”

So, we worked with Senator Heinrich and Senator Sheehy—who are two of my favorite lawmakers in this current moment—who were willing to put partisan politics aside and, during the historic-length government shutdown (as partisan as it gets), were willing to launch an eight-senator (four Republican and four Democrat) caucus to help promote conservation in the United States across party lines. We’re beginning to work on many bipartisan bills that have either already been introduced and just need to be accelerated, or new ones, to protect our forests, to protect our air, to protect our water, and to protect our public lands.

Margaret Walls: That’s great. Also, I’m not sure if this is related to what you have to say about this, but the president signed an executive order establishing the president’s Make America Beautiful Again Commission. I did read that you had something to do with that, as well, Benji. I don’t know if there’s anything going on with that. What the executive order says is that it’s tasked with developing options for improving conservation, recovering fish and wildlife populations, improving water quality, and increasing access to public lands and outdoor recreation. Do you know much about this and what’s going on with it? Is there activity around this? Tell us about that.

Benji Backer: Yeah. So, when the president won in 2024, I was in the midst of starting to launch my organization. We were trying to position ourselves so that no matter who won, we could make a difference. That’s, again, the future of environmentalism that I want to have, which is that it doesn’t matter who’s in office—things are happening that are good for conservation and good for the environment. We might not have voted for somebody, but we can put that aside and work toward a greater goal. At the end of the day, nature doesn’t really care who’s in office. Our environment needs to be protected and conserved in either situation.

When President Trump won, we started working with his cabinet on the Make America Beautiful Again executive order and commission—which is tasked to come up with policies through the US Department of the Interior, US Department of Agriculture, and other related agencies—for the president to have a conservation platform and policy agenda for good things for our public lands and private lands. There has not been a lot of progress on that yet, admittedly, and there’s three years left to this administration, so we’re going to keep pushing for durable conservation policy.

We have been waiting and pushing hard to make sure that things happen, but one of the things that’s really powerful about this Senate caucus is that there’s almost more momentum in the Senate than anywhere else right now to build this bipartisan consensus. Our goal as an organization is to work on culture and policy; to move the public narrative; to show leaders that there’s bipartisan, and nonpartisan, buy-in for conservation; and to push the policymakers. We’re going to go wherever the juice is going to be worth the squeeze. So, we have the commission and the White House agenda that we are ready to act on whenever they’re ready, and whenever they want us to work with them. Until that happens, we’re going to be focusing on the Senate and the cultural push.

That’s all to say, we did help get that together, and we will be helpful anytime that there’s going to be positive conservation action. So far, it’s been a secondary priority, and I think that’s also a symptom of a larger problem—which is that, for most Americans, the environment is not a top-five issue, and leaders do not feel like they will be held accountable if they don’t work across party lines to do good things for the environment. That’s an incentive we have to change, because President Trump, and any other president that doesn’t act on conservation going forward, should be held accountable. Also, they should want to do good things because they feel like they’re going to get rewarded. What I would rather have is not this negative accountability, but this positive accountability. Right now, there isn’t that.

I will say, as much as President Trump has not done a lot on conservation, if he changed on a dime tomorrow and said, “Hey, we’re going to do some great things in conservation across the party lines,” there are a lot of groups who would not give him the credit for it—they don’t want to give President Trump the credit, because he’s somebody that they don’t like.

We have to get past this political baseball that we’ve played on the issue and provide an incentive for someone like President Trump to act on it. We’re going to keep pushing as hard as we can while we’re building up that grassroots movement that America needs, across party lines, for this issue.

Margaret Walls: Yeah. I’m going to come back to some of your priority-setting, but I want to ask you first about climate change, Benji.

I know that you feel that climate change is a serious problem that needs to be addressed, but you’re not a fan of some of the ways that we have tackled this problem. And I know that you have concerns about the messaging and communication around it, which, I think, you feel has alienated people. Can you talk about all that a little bit? Where do you come out on this issue, and what do you think have been some of the problems? Then, we’ll talk about some of the solutions.

Benji Backer: Look, as I mentioned in my opening, climate change has been a deep passion of mine since I was a kid. Growing up in Wisconsin, I know climate change is real, because I’ve seen it with my own eyes. I’ve seen snow days become less and less common in Wisconsin where I grew up, and white Christmases are not the constant that they once were when I was growing up. Those are the sorts of things that are just undeniable.

However, the fear mongering of saying that the world’s going to end, and that we’re going to not have snow by 2000, and then we’re not going to have snow by 2020, and then we need to go a hundred percent this or a hundred percent that by 2030, otherwise the planet’s going to burn—those sorts of predictions and, honestly, unscientific claims (because even the scientists have been frustrated with the overdramatization of climate change) have really frustrated me. It’s made our job harder, it’s made it more political, and it’s made it more difficult to get good things done.

Most Americans who don’t believe in climate change care deeply about the environment. They just don’t like to be told that the world’s going to end and then have it not happen. They also don’t like the solutions that have been proposed, which have been very one-sided and, honestly, benefit certain people and really hurt others.

So, two things are true. Climate change and human-caused climate change is absolutely real, and we need to do something about it. I always will say that, and that is something that, honestly, every American should believe. But I can understand why they don’t, because what also is true is that it has been overpoliticized, overdramatized, and overextended to the point where if you don’t care about this, you’re evil. If you don’t switch your car to electric, you’re evil. If you don’t believe that we should just ban fossil fuels, you’re evil. If you even try to work in the energy industry, you’re evil. And there’s just been a lot of villainization and overdramatization.

The way forward, I think, is to reconnect people back to the land that they love. What I’ve heard a lot, recently, is this idea of “patriotism of place.” People don’t care, necessarily, about something thousands of miles away. They don’t care about the polar bears, but they also don’t care about sea level rise if they live in Arizona. If you can hear it in the background, it’s thundering—it’s one of the rare rainstorms in Arizona. People here care about what’s coming down right now—this rain that doesn’t happen as often as it needs to in Arizona. People in Florida don’t really care about the drought in Arizona. So, can you start to rally people for pro-climate solutions in a way that’s relevant to their own day-to-day lives?

I think the best way to do that is to do it with nature-based solutions. Of course, we need to transition to clean energy sources and transportation over time. Honestly, it’s more about efficiency than clean [energy]. It’s like, How can we make people’s lives easier, better, and more productive, so that they can spend more time with their family and more money on putting food on the table? Those are the sorts of things that we need to transition to.

To get people connected to the issue again, instead of thinking about it from a political lens, we should be thinking about it from an environmental lens. I care about climate change, not because I care that much about polar bears, but because I care a lot about the environment that I love hiking and recreating in. And that’s the conversation that we need to have around climate change if we’re going to build the political coalition needed to get the policies that we also need.

Margaret Walls: Yeah. I know in the book you talk a bit about empowering local communities, and you talk about both sides of this. So, communities that are fossil fuel communities that feel beat up over the issues—like they’re the problem—but also that local communities are part of the solution. Maybe just say a little bit more about that. What I took away from that part of the book was that people have different things to bring to the table based on where they live. It’s all about—well, I like what you just said—“patriotism of place.” Is that the term you used? I haven’t heard that before, but anyway, can you just talk about that?

Benji Backer: Absolutely. You look at a Tribal leader, or you look at a farmer, or you look at a rancher. These are people who maybe don’t know how to take care of a place near New York City or thousands of miles away, but they sure as heck know how to take care of their backyard. They know how to do that better than anybody else.

And Tribal leaders are a perfect example of this. For generations, they have been the best stewards of their land imaginable. They managed forest fires, they knew how to cultivate the land for resources without destroying it, and they knew how to rely on the land while also conserving it.

Honestly, it’s the same approach that a lot of America’s farmers and ranchers use where they have to have the health of the environment to have the health of their family and the health of their community. That is a very different approach than somebody who doesn’t have that background and isn’t living in those communities, but is maybe telling them what to do or how to live their lives.

When you look at a to-do list, every day when you wake up, there’s a lot of things to do on it. When you look at the to-do list for climate change, there’s a lot of things on it, and we’re not going to do it all at once. So, we might as well solve it community by community, and locality by locality, because that’s actually the fastest way to do it over time. Look at, again, where the majority of the action has actually come from for fighting climate change, and just seeing environmental progress in general. It hasn’t really come from wide-sweeping efforts as much as it has from a collective progress made by all these different communities combined.

You look at the energy transition, and some of the emissions that have been reduced since the early 2000s in the United States—it wasn’t because of a massive mandate. Actually, at the time, it was states like Iowa—there’s a lot of wind, so they put up a lot of windmills. It’s that local solution that depends on your geography, it depends on your income, and it depends on what job you have. And finding a way to strike more of a balance when it comes to the policy—where it’s not just top down, but a mixture of top down, bottom up, and corporate—that’s the future.

That’s not to say that it’s just corporate, or it’s just bottom up. Of course, there needs to be federal investments made and standards met. But when the default is always top down, you lose that localization that is so powerful. The justification for it is, “If we don’t do this, we’re not going to act fast enough.” But when we’re only doing top down, you get this political back and forth of, “This is too far. We’re going to sue. We’re going to revoke it. We’re going to undo it.” And then you end up not making any progress. Imagine if you were battling that out while you were also really incentivizing the local solutions. I think that’s where a lot of the power is going to come from.

Margaret Walls: That’s an interesting point. I’m going to turn back to your organization, Nature Is Nonpartisan. You mentioned this earlier, and you mentioned it when we talked before, about [how] you’re stretched thin and you don’t have the bandwidth to cover every single environmental issue. I’m interested in where things stand now. What are some of the challenges you face on how to focus and prioritize? And what are you coming to as some of the main issue areas that you’re going to work on in the near future—like, over the next year, let’s say?

Benji Backer: Yeah. Soon, we’re going to be launching United by Nature, which is going to be our national initiative to bring the coalition of organizations and the general population toward environmental progress in this country, and really try to make it part of the American ethos again. Within that initiative, we’re going to have a few core issues: the conservation of public lands, making sure that every American has clean drinking water, making sure that we are restoring wildlife and ecosystems, disaster proofing communities, and restoring forests so that we don’t have megafires. Those are going to be the core issues. It sounds like a lot, but we’re going to be tackling them bite by bite.

The first campaign we’re going to launch is around public lands, because, right now, there are a bunch of really important initiatives that we need to get done and that Americans really want, which is funding of our national park system, better maintenance of our national forests and public lands, and making sure that we can actually maintain them—there’s a huge backlog of funding for that maintenance. So, helping rally Americans around their love of public lands—again, not just to oppose something, but to get something across the finish line as our first campaign.

The second one will be about clean drinking water. 94 percent of Americans drink water with microplastics in it. There’s a really big problem across the country, whether that be floods or droughts, toxic water because of the Salt Lake drying up, or toxic water because of microplastics. We have a water crisis in America, so we’re going to tackle that, as well. After that, we’ll start to add on some of these other issues.

But the core—and how we think about this—is, Where is there the most overlap politically? Where is there a winning coalition of Americans that we know is ready, but they maybe just haven’t been activated, or [don’t] know how to be activated, yet? Also, where is the most urgent issue? In my opinion, and in our organization’s opinion, there’s a desperate need to better maintain our public spaces and lands to make sure that we can have healthy habitats and healthy places to recreate. And then also, that we have healthy water for our kids and our grandkids, and also for ourselves. So, that’s what we’re going to focus on first.

I would just say, this Trump-era environmentalism of pushing back against everything that is deemed “wrong,” I think has really made it difficult for the movement to focus on what they actually want to be for. When, every day, you wake up, and you think about, “Okay, what announcement do I need to be against today?” you’re not trying to prepare for the future. How do you build that coalition? If you think that that’s a problem—that’s a symptom of the problem. The fact that people think that they can get away with antienvironmental action is a symptom of a larger problem, which is that we don’t have a winning coalition to get things done yet on conservation. So, our goal is to figure out where that winning coalition is in terms of their priority, but then also where the most urgent priorities are from a conservation perspective.

Margaret Walls: That seems like, if you get some wins in some of these, then that lays the groundwork for others, doesn’t it?

Benji Backer: It sure does. That’s the diabolical master plan. Announcing it here on the show.

Yep, once you start building consensus on some things, you’re able to do it on others; we’ve seen that work in the past. Honestly, I used to think we could do it all at once, and that’s the impatient young person in me that wanted that to happen. But yeah, you’ve got to lay the groundwork, and that’s what we’re trying to do.

Margaret Walls: Yeah. Well, Benji, we’re getting near the end here, and we always close our podcast with a regular feature that we call Top of the Stack. I didn’t warn you about this, but I’m going to ask you to recommend to listeners a book, a podcast, a movie, an article, or any content that has caught your attention lately and that you would like to recommend to people. What’s on the top of your stack, Benji?

Benji Backer: Well, there is an amazing story about Teddy Roosevelt going down the Amazon River, or this very difficult river in the Amazon. I’m actually forgetting the name of it, because I read it a couple of months ago, but it was really an interesting book—if you look up “Teddy Roosevelt Amazon River,” you’ll find it—because it really showed how up and down Teddy Roosevelt’s life was. And when you think about environmental activism, there’s a lot of ups and downs—there are some really hard moments, and there are some really high moments. It’s, honestly, just trying to go in this upward trajectory that Teddy Roosevelt really embodied during his life.

The River of Doubt is actually what it’s called. It just came to me.

That’s how I think we need to embody environmental activism, is living by the Teddy Roosevelt life-spirit.

Margaret Walls: Great, I’m going to look for that book. That’s awesome.

Well, Benji, this has been a pleasure having you on Resources Radio, talking about public lands, climate change, and your new organization Nature Is Nonpartisan. Thank you so much for coming on the show.

Trump issued a series of executive orders invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs on most U.S. trading partners (IEEPA tariffs). According to the government, importers had paid approximately $129 billion in estimated duty deposits for entries covered by most of the IEEPA tariffs as of December 10, 2025. Several importers and states have filed lawsuits challenging the President's authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA, and multiple courts have held that IEEPA does not authorize the challenged tariffs. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments to review those lower court decisions in November 2025.

This In Focus analyzes potential paths and obstacles for importers to obtain refunds of the IEEPA tariffs, as well as options for Congress, in the event that the Supreme Court holds that some or all of these tariffs are unlawful.

Background on Collection of Tariffs

There are generally two processes for the entry of goods into the United States and the collection of duties—formal (19 U.S.C. § 1484) and informal (19 U.S.C. § 1498).

Formal entry is required for goods with a value greater than $2,500. In general, the importer posts a bond with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and pays estimated duties on the merchandise. Later, the government makes a final ascertainment of the duties owed on those goods, known as ""liquidation."" Under 19 U.S.C. § 1504, liquidation must occur within one year of the entry of goods, although the Secretary of the Treasury may extend the period in certain circumstances. Per CBP's practice, liquidation typically occurs automatically 314 days after entry.

Informal entry uses simplified procedures and generally does not require the posting of a bond. Informal entries are generally considered to have been liquidated upon payment of estimated duties.

Potential Paths to Tariff Refunds

Liquidated Versus Unliquidated Entries

Because the first IEEPA tariffs took effect in February 2025, a significant percentage of imports affected by the IEEPA tariffs have not yet been liquidated. The government has stated that, as of December 10, 2025, approximately 19.2 million of the approximately 34 million entries subject to the IEEPA tariffs remained unliquidated. For unliquidated imports, the government may be required to issue refunds upon liquidation if the Supreme Court rules that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful. The Secretary of the Treasury holds statutory authority to refund duties ""[w]henever it is ascertained on liquidation or reliquidation . . . that more money has been deposited or paid as duties than was required by law."" Customs regulations generally require refunds to be issued in such cases unless the discrepancy is less than $20. Customs regulations also acknowledge that refunds may be required following court-ordered reliquidation, a scenario discussed below.

Millions of informal entries subject to the IEEPA tariffs were considered liquidated at or near the date of their entry. Beginning in mid-December 2025 (314 days after the initial IEEPA tariffs took effect), many formal entries likely also began to be liquidated. Based on statutory authorization and limitations, current CBP regulations provide that CBP may voluntarily reliquidate an entry within 90 days of its original liquidation ""to correct errors in appraisement, classification, or any other element entering into the liquidation or reliquidation, including errors based on misconstruction of applicable law."" This authority may allow CBP to reliquidate and provide refunds for entries that were liquidated within the preceding 90 days. Once this deadline has passed—or if CBP does not use this voluntary reliquidation authority—importers may have other paths to seek refunds of any unlawful tariffs, as discussed below.

Protests for Liquidated Entries

One potential avenue for importers to seek refunds for already-liquidated entries is to file a formal protest with CBP. Under 19 U.S.C. § 1514(c)(3), an importer may file a protest of a decision of CBP within 180 days after the date of liquidation or, in some circumstances, the date on which the decision was made. Some law firms have advised importers to file protests pending the Supreme Court's decision in case the Court invalidates the IEEPA tariffs.

Under 19 U.S.C. § 1515(a), CBP must either ""deny"" or ""allow"" a protest ""in whole or in part."" If CBP allows the protest, ""any duties . . . found to have been assessed or collected in excess shall be remitted or refunded . . . ."" Section 1515 gives CBP up to two years to review a protest but allows a protester to request ""accelerated disposition."" If CBP does not decide the protest within 30 days of a request for accelerated disposition, the protest is ""deemed"" (considered to be) denied. CBP's denial of a protest allows the protester to seek judicial relief, as discussed below.

There may be some doubt as to whether CBP's collection of the IEEPA tariffs may be protested under Section 1514, since CBP collected these tariffs pursuant to executive orders issued by the President. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (which has exclusive jurisdiction to hear intermediate appeals of certain trade cases) has held that some ""purely ministerial"" actions taken by CBP are not protestable decisions under Section 1514. To be subject to protest, the court has held, CBP must make ""substantive determinations or undert[ake] . . . discretionary actions."" For example, the court has found that CBP's ministerial implementation of rate determinations made by the Commerce Department in antidumping and countervailing duty investigations was not subject to protest under Section 1514. One court decision held protesting CBP's collection of IEEPA tariffs to be futile because CBP lacks authority to assess the legality of the President's executive orders.

Uncertainty about Section 1514 protestability may cast doubt on the proper path to sue the government for refunds, as shown by an earlier set of court decisions. In its 1998 decision United States v. U.S. Shoe Co., the Supreme Court held that a harbor maintenance tax (HMT) enacted by Congress partly violated the Constitution's Export Clause, which bars taxation of U.S. exports. In some lawsuits, the Federal Circuit held that the collection of the HMT was not protestable, because ""Customs is powerless to perform any active role in the determination of the constitutionality of the [HMT]."" Thus, the court held that plaintiffs could sue the United States for refunds of the HMT without first exhausting the protest process. In another instance, the Federal Circuit held that the denial of an HMT refund request was a protestable decision, giving plaintiffs a separate avenue to seek judicial relief with a different statute of limitations but also an exhaustion requirement.

Lawsuits in the U.S. Court of International Trade

Importers who are otherwise unsuccessful in obtaining refunds may attempt to obtain relief by suing the United States in the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT). The CIT is a specialized court with exclusive, nationwide jurisdiction over certain trade cases, including (1) civil actions commenced to contest the denial of a protest, under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(a), and (2) other civil actions arising out of laws providing for revenue from imports and tariffs, duties, fees, and other taxes on importation, under 28U.S.C. § 1581(i) (so-called ""residual"" jurisdiction). Lawsuits seeking refunds of IEEPA tariffs could conceivably fall under either of these jurisdictional grants, depending on whether or not CBP's collection or retention of these tariffs is protestable under 19 U.S.C. § 1514, as discussed above. Under the statute of limitations (29 U.S.C. § 2636), lawsuits to contest the denial of a protest must be filed within 180 days after the denial, while lawsuits under the CIT's residual jurisdiction must be filed within two years ""after the cause of action first accrues""—potentially, the point in time when the tariffs were paid.

Some court decisions have held that the CIT may reliquidate entries to provide for refunds in Section 1581(i) cases, while others have raised doubts about the scope of this authority. In litigation challenging the IEEPA tariffs, the CIT has held that it has the authority to order reliquidation and that the government may not contest this authority given its assertion to the court that it will ""not oppose"" reliquidation or resulting refunds to plaintiffs if the Supreme Court holds that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful.

Potential Limits on Judicial Relief

The CIT generally has authority under 28 U.S.C. § 2643 to order money damages, injunctions, and any other ""appropriate"" relief. Yet it is uncertain whether the CIT has the power to order refunds for importers other than plaintiffs. Class action lawsuits may potentially provide a means for large numbers of importers to obtain tariff refunds without bringing individual lawsuits. The CIT's Rule 23 permits the claims of numerous individuals or entities to be aggregated into a single class action proceeding where a case meets the rule's requirements (concerning, e.g., the numerosity and commonality of the class), although past cases may cast doubt on whether class certification would be available for importers seeking IEEPA tariff refunds. In 1996, the CIT decided not to certify a class of persons who had paid the HMT, suggesting instead that ""Congress should decide whether to create a special procedure to refund small amounts to individuals who choose not to sue . . . ."" At least one class action lawsuit seeking refunds of IEEPA tariffs has been filed in the CIT, although that suit was voluntarily dismissed (withdrawn) before any substantive proceedings.

Under Supreme Court precedent, refunds might arguably be considered a form of equitable (i.e., injunctive) relief insofar as they seek ""to restore to the [importer] particular funds . . . in the [government's] possession."" This argument raises the question of whether the CIT could enter a so-called nationwide injunction ordering that refunds of IEEPA tariffs be paid to all importers, regardless of whether they are parties to a lawsuit. In June 2025, the Supreme Court held in Trump v. CASA, Inc. that federal courts may not issue injunctions that are broader than needed to provide complete relief to the parties. The Court left open the possibility that nationwide injunctions might sometimes meet this standard, and lower courts have found such injunctions to be needed to provide relief to state plaintiffs in some circumstances. CASA's implications for the CIT's ability to order tariff refunds for nonparties may be unclear, in part because states as well as private parties have filed lawsuits challenging the IEEPA tariffs. In 1998, the CIT ordered a streamlined claims resolution procedure to obtain HMT refunds, but this procedure was available only to plaintiffs who filed lawsuits in the CIT.

“It will also ensure states and authorized tribes adhere to their Section 401 role.” The Clean Water Act allows states and some authorized tribes to review what effect pipelines, dams and other federally regulated projects have on water quality within their borders.
In 2023, the Biden administration strengthened states’ and tribes' authority to conduct water quality reviews.
They are doing so at a time when fewer waters are federally regulated by the Clean Water Act.","Washington — The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday proposed limiting states’ and Native American tribes’ power to wield the Clean Water Act to block major projects like natural gas pipelines, advancing the Trump administration's goal of accelerating the construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure and data centers.

The agency said new constraints on local water quality reviews for federally regulated projects will still allow states to protect their environment while preventing unnecessary delays. Successive administrations have seesawed on the scope of states' power. President Donald Trump's first administration reduced it, the Biden administration restored it and now the Trump administration is once again adding constraints to what's called Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.

“When finalized, the proposed rule will increase transparency, efficiency and predictability for certifying authorities and the regulated community,"" said Jess Kramer, EPA's assistant administrator for water. “It will also ensure states and authorized tribes adhere to their Section 401 role.”

The Clean Water Act allows states and some authorized tribes to review what effect pipelines, dams and other federally regulated projects have on water quality within their borders. Pipelines, for example, might cross rivers, streams and wetlands — disruptions that states can scrutinize and that have caused holdups before. In 2017, for example, New York regulators rejected a permit for a pipeline, saying there weren't sufficient protections for hundreds of streams and wetlands.

The proposed change is similar to EPA’s rule in Trump's first term. They proposed a clear description of what applicants need to submit to states, strict deadlines for reviews and a requirement that states fully explain why any conditions were placed on a developer or why their permit was rejected.

In 2023, the Biden administration strengthened states’ and tribes' authority to conduct water quality reviews. Activists at the time praised the change, saying it would help protect the local environment. The agency said then that states should be able to look beyond pollution that’s released directly into waters and instead “holistically evaluate"" the impact of a project on local water quality.

The Trump administration wants to do away with that broader authority to focus reviews on direct releases to federally regulated waters. They are doing so at a time when fewer waters are federally regulated by the Clean Water Act. In 2023, the Supreme Court in Sackett v. EPA limited the federal government's power to regulate millions of acres of wetlands.

Under Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA expanded its traditional focus on the environment and public health to include several economic “pillars"" like restoring America's energy dominance — Trump's shorthand for fossil fuels — and making the U.S. “the artificial intelligence capital of the world.” As demand for new data centers increases, some of these projects will need state water quality permits. Kramer said the update will make the rules for these reviews clear.

“This makes what we are doing in the 401 space crucial, right? Those projects, they need to be able to move forward with certainty,” said Kramer.

A final rule is expected in the spring after a public comment period.

Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a rule interpreting Section 401 of the Clean Water Act that undercuts and states’ authority to protect their water quality. In response, Moneen Nasmith, Director of National Climate, Fossil Fuel Infrastructure at Earthjustice, released the statement below:

“From what we’ve seen so far, this effort by EPA is solving for a problem that doesn’t exist. States and tribes exercise the authority given to them by Congress in the Clean Water Act to review and reject projects that pose unacceptable threats to their waterways and wetlands. States and tribes that take that responsibility seriously are not abusing their authority, they are following the law.”

Background

To protect water quality, Section 401 of the Clean Water Act creates a state-tribal-federal partnership, giving individual states and some tribes the ability to review the impacts of federally licensed projects, like oil and gas pipelines, on waterways and wetlands within their borders.

Under the first Trump administration, EPA finalized a rule that significantly altered past interpretations of Section 401 and attempted to substantially limit states’ and tribes’ authority to review and potentially reject projects that would harm their waterways and health.

Earthjustice represented three tribes and two environmental organizations in a lawsuit against the Trump rollback, which made its way to the Supreme Court. In April 2022, the Supreme Court reinstated the Trump rule while the U.S. 9th Circuit of Appeals heard the case — a decision made without explanation and over the objection of four justices. The 9th Circuit later sided with the Supreme Court, overturning the district court’s decision to vacate the Trump rollback on procedural grounds and remanding back to the district court for further proceedings, which were stayed, pending EPA’s issuance of the final rule.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/cuyahoga-river_getty.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 15:01:36.705537
,Texas American Energy ,2026-01-13 18:56:35+00:00,Odessa American,TXOGA's annual report forecasts energy market stability - Odessa American,"Bob Campbell, www.oaoa.com",,,,,https://www.oaoa.com/local-news/txogas-annual-report-forecasts-energy-market-stability/,"Notwithstanding low oil and gas prices and other challenges, the Texas energy industry came through big again in 2025 for cities, counties, schools, hospitals and other public concerns.
“Beyond this essential tax revenue Texas oil and natural gas deliver energy security at home and global stability for our allies,” he said.
Addressing market commentary related to a potential global energy glut, Staples said, “Headlines aside our data show markets adjusting, not breaking.
“These fundamentals, not short-term sentiment, underpin the strong economic contribution detailed in TXOGA’s 2025 Energy & Economic Impact Report.
“At a time when energy debates are often driven by competing narratives this report focuses on facts.","Notwithstanding low oil and gas prices and other challenges, the Texas energy industry came through big again in 2025 for cities, counties, schools, hospitals and other public concerns.

That’s according to the Texas Oil & Gas Association, which says in its annual Energy & Economic Impact Report that the industry paid $27 billion in state and local taxes and state royalties in fiscal 2025 — the second-highest total in state history.

“In Texas lasting progress is built on performance, not opinion,” TXOGA President Todd Staples said from Austin, crediting the Permian Basin for its key role. “Talk doesn’t grow jobs, keep homes warm or cars running.

“Action, investment and innovation drive greatness across the Texas economy. Even during a year dominated by market challenges, Texas oil and natural gas have proved once again to be the power behind Texas’ progress.”

Staples said the taxes translate to nearly $74 million every day for Texas’ public schools, universities, roads, first responders and other essential services. “Beyond this essential tax revenue Texas oil and natural gas deliver energy security at home and global stability for our allies,” he said. “Since 2007 when TXOGA first started compiling this data, the industry has paid more than a quarter of a trillion dollars in state and local taxes and state royalties, a figure that does not include the hundreds of billions in payroll for some of the highest-paying jobs in the state, taxes paid on office buildings and personal property and the enormous economic ripple effect that benefits other sectors of the economy.”

Staples said public education again got a major infusion from oil and natural gas royalties.

“The Permanent University Fund received $1.72 billion and the Permanent School Fund $1.4 billion,” he said. “Together the market value of these funds exceeds $100 billion.

“With a balance of $66.5 billion the Permanent School Fund alone is larger than Harvard’s endowment and is the largest educational endowment in the nation.”

He said the Texas Rainy Day or Economic Stabilization Fund has derived over $35.9 billion from oil and natural gas production taxes since its inception in 1987 with the ESF and State Highway Fund each garnering $2.7 billion last year.

“In FY 2025 Texas school districts received $2.6 billion in property taxes from mineral properties producing oil and natural gas, pipelines and gas utilities,” he said. “Counties received an additional $1 billion in these property taxes.”

Staples said the Pecos-Barstow-Toyah ISD ranked first statewide with $309.3 million in oil and natural gas property taxes while Reeves County ranked first among counties with $109.4 million.

“In FY 2025 the industry employed more than 495,500 Texans who earned an average of $133,095 — 68 percent more than the average paid to the rest of Texas’ private sector,” he said. “Conservatively these jobs generate approximately two more jobs with nearly 1.4 million total jobs supported across the Texas economy.

“Some economic analyses suggest that the industry’s employment multiplier could approach three additional jobs per direct job, bringing the total to over 2 million jobs supported by the industry across Texas.”

Despite market challenges, Staples said, the industry shattered another string of records.

“Non-stop innovation and investment and operational efficiency raised the bar for performance once again,” he said. “Texas crude oil production set a new record in July 2025, reaching 5.85 million barrels per day, and marketed natural gas production reached 35.4 bcf/d in August.

“Most of these impressive totals are coming out of the Permian Basin where innovation and efficiency are driving record production in the most important basin in the world.”

He said the state also set records for exports of crude oil and condensate, liquefied natural gas and total natural gas.

“To transport these volumes pipeline infrastructure grew to 472,790 miles and LNG export capacity from Texas and Louisiana approached 13 billion cubic feet per day with another 19 bcf/d of projects already being commissioned or under construction,” Staples said.

Addressing market commentary related to a potential global energy glut, Staples said, “Headlines aside our data show markets adjusting, not breaking.

“Texas energy remains productive, reliable and globally essential and fundamentals, not sentiment, continue to drive outcomes for our economy and consumers.”

He said TXOGA does not see evidence of a disorderly oversupply but rather markets adjusting as long-lead projects sanctioned years ago come online.

“As global energy demand continues to grow, U.S. production gains reflect productivity and efficiency and Texas remains uniquely resilient due to its infrastructure, export capacity and innovation,” Staples said. “These fundamentals, not short-term sentiment, underpin the strong economic contribution detailed in TXOGA’s 2025 Energy & Economic Impact Report.

“At a time when energy debates are often driven by competing narratives this report focuses on facts. It underscores a simple truth: Texas runs on oil and natural gas made possible by hundreds of thousands of skilled men and women who rise before the sun to keep our economy moving and our communities secure.

“In the coming year we look forward to continuing our partnership with state leaders and communities to keep Texas powered, prosperous and prepared for what comes next.”",https://www.oaoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/020322_Winter-pumpjack-file.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 14:01:05.496960

[13] View Rule: EPA/OAR Proposed Revision to “Begin Actual Construction” in the New Source Review Preconstruction Permitting Program, Office of Info.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has expressed its intent to propose a rule to revise the regulatory definition of “begin actual construction” under the Clean Air Act’s (CAA) New Source Review (NSR) preconstruction permitting program, with a proposed rule expected in 2026.[1] The EPA has indicated that the rule, if proposed and finalized, will provide “flexibility” to developers to begin construction on ancillary structures that are not themselves components of the emitting structures, such as concrete pads and external walls, before obtaining the requisite air permit.[2]

CAA permit reform arrives at a time when energy demand, driven by artificial intelligence (AI) development, data center expansion, and electrification, is projected to surge over the next decade.[3] Against this backdrop, the EPA’s potential permitting reform aims to provide stakeholders with greater flexibility for early-stage site developments and accelerated project timelines.

Regulatory Background

Under the CAA, a new or modified major stationary source of air pollutants cannot “begin actual construction” without first obtaining an NSR permit.[4] EPA regulations define “begin actual construction” as the “initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit,” which “include, but are not limited to, installation of building supports and foundations, laying underground pipework and construction of permanent storage structures.”[5]

For decades, the EPA interpreted this definition broadly. In a 1986 memorandum issued by then-EPA Director Edward Reich (the Reich memo), the agency adopted the position that the construction of structures “necessary to accommodate” emissions units could themselves constitute “actual construction” of emissions units and therefore trigger the need for an NSR permit.[6] The Reich memo effectively prohibited construction of structures that are not emission units — like footings, foundations, storage structures, and retaining walls — until developers obtained an NSR permit.

The result: often slower timelines and higher costs. Indeed, one study found that from 2002 to 2014, the average time to process an NSR permit was 420 days.[7] Of course, permitting timelines may vary depending on the type of project. For example, the same study found that natural gas permits on average were processed the fastest (319 days), whereas refinery project permits took the longest to assess (537 days).

In March 2020, however, the EPA issued draft guidance (the 2020 draft guidance) that adopted a less restrictive interpretation of the term “begin actual construction.”[8] Returning to the original regulatory text, the 2020 draft guidance confirmed that the only construction prohibited prior to issuance of an air permit is construction “on an emissions unit.” The EPA explained that its prior interpretations were “unnecessarily restrictive,” and that the revised interpretation “better conforms to the regulatory text” that defines “begin actual construction.”[9]

EPA Announces Permitting Reform

In September 2025, the EPA reaffirmed its 2020 guidance on the definition of “beginning actual construction” to provide “much needed clarity” and “flexibility,” motivated primarily by the global AI race.[10] EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated that, “[f]or years, Clean Air Act permitting has been an obstacle to innovation and growth” and identified “Permitting Reform” as a key pillar of the agency’s new “Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative.”[11] A stated goal of CAA permit reform is to promote the development of data centers “critical to making the U.S. the Artificial Intelligence (AI) capital of the world.”[12] A proposed rule to further clarify the meaning of “beginning actual construction” is expected by January 2026, with a final rule targeted for September 2026.[13] Proponents hope the rule will accelerate project timelines.

The latest guidance from the EPA is found in a letter to the Maricopa County Air Quality Department (MCAQD) regarding a proposed semiconductor facility in Phoenix, Arizona (the TSMC letter).[14] MCAQD sought guidance from the EPA on whether Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, could begin construction on the “core and shell” of the semiconductor facility — i.e., foundation, steel superstructure, and external walls — prior to MCAQD’s issuance of an NSR permit. TSMC agreed to defer the installation of semiconductor manufacturing equipment that could be classified as emissions units, foundations for such units, and piping until after the issuance of a permit.

The EPA referred back to its 2020 draft guidance and concluded that TSMC could proceed with the initial phase of construction because the structures to be built were not specifically configured for emissions units and therefore did not constitute “begin[ning] actual construction.”[15] But the EPA cautioned that any construction activities undertaken prior to issuance of an NSR permit would be at the developer’s “own risk” and that the developer’s “time and resources expended on construction prior to obtaining a permit” may not be used as justification to grant the air permit.[16] And until the EPA officially proposes and finalizes a rule, the EPA stated that it may advise on “begin actual construction” questions on a “case-by-case basis.”[17]

Takeaways

The effects of the EPA’s permitting reform will certainly vary by the particulars of a project, and likely by state as well, because state permitting agencies have broad discretion to enforce NSR requirements.[18] Developments that include significant non-emitting structures, such as manufacturing facilities and data centers, may benefit from accelerated timelines. However, construction of emission units cannot be completed without an NSR permit. And while permitting reform may allow for faster construction times, proceeding with pre-permit construction activities is unlikely to be a risk-free endeavor. At least in one response to a state agency — the MCAQD — the EPA expressed that the time and resources expended on pre-permit construction will not influence permitting decisions. Developers therefore retain potentially significant exposure by proceeding with construction of even non-emitting structures. Indeed, permits could impose conditions requiring modification to work that was already in progress or, even be outright denied.

While the full effects of the promised permitting reform will not be understood for some time, it is not too early for stakeholders to start to evaluate their potential risks and develop risk mitigation measures for their current and future projects. Potential risks that project participants may think through include:

Permit conditions that require modifying or rebuilding work already in progress

What happens to the project if a permit is delayed, or even denied outright

How risk and delay-related costs are allocated in both prime and downstream contracts (e.g., subcontracts and purchase orders), including, but not limited to, idle labor, storage and preservation of equipment, and extended insurance or bonding costs

Financing risks, such as the loss of financing or the inability to close on a construction loan due to permit delays or denial

Of course, each project brings with it unique circumstances, challenges, and risks, which may only be compounded as project stakeholders navigate permitting requirements.

“It will also ensure states and authorized tribes adhere to their Section 401 role.” The Clean Water Act allows states and some authorized tribes to review what effect pipelines, dams and other federally regulated projects have on water quality within their borders.
In 2023, the Biden administration strengthened states’ and tribes' authority to conduct water quality reviews.
The Trump administration wants to do away with that broader authority to focus reviews on direct releases to federally regulated waters.
They are doing so at a time when fewer waters are federally regulated by the Clean Water Act.","WASHINGTON(AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday proposed limiting states’ and Native American tribes’ power to wield the Clean Water Act to block major projects like natural gas pipelines, advancing the Trump administration's goal of accelerating the construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure and data centers.

The agency said new constraints on local water quality reviews for federally regulated projects will still allow states to protect their environment while preventing unnecessary delays. Successive administrations have seesawed on the scope of states' power. President Donald Trump's first administration reduced it, the Biden administration restored it and now the Trump administration is once again adding constraints to what's called Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.

“When finalized, the proposed rule will increase transparency, efficiency and predictability for certifying authorities and the regulated community,"" said Jess Kramer, EPA's assistant administrator for water. “It will also ensure states and authorized tribes adhere to their Section 401 role.”

The Clean Water Act allows states and some authorized tribes to review what effect pipelines, dams and other federally regulated projects have on water quality within their borders. Pipelines, for example, might cross rivers, streams and wetlands — disruptions that states can scrutinize and that have caused holdups before. In 2017, for example, New York regulators rejected a permit for a pipeline, saying there weren't sufficient protections for hundreds of streams and wetlands.

The proposed change is similar to EPA’s rule in Trump's first term. They proposed a clear description of what applicants need to submit to states, strict deadlines for reviews and a requirement that states fully explain why any conditions were placed on a developer or why their permit was rejected.

In 2023, the Biden administration strengthened states’ and tribes' authority to conduct water quality reviews. Activists at the time praised the change, saying it would help protect the local environment. The agency said then that states should be able to look beyond pollution that’s released directly into waters and instead “holistically evaluate"" the impact of a project on local water quality.

The Trump administration wants to do away with that broader authority to focus reviews on direct releases to federally regulated waters. They are doing so at a time when fewer waters are federally regulated by the Clean Water Act. In 2023, the Supreme Court in Sackett v. EPA limited the federal government's power to regulate millions of acres of wetlands.

Congress has said that when federally backed projects like oil pipelines or nickel mines affect water quality, fishing and drinking water, states and tribes get to review them and reject proposals that will do too much damage, according to Moneen Nasmith, director of national climate, fossil fuel infrastructure at the nonprofit Earthjustice.

“EPA’s claims that states and tribes are overreaching are baseless,"" she said. “This proposed rule is trying to solve for a problem that does not exist.”

Under Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA expanded its traditional focus on the environment and public health to include several economic “pillars"" like restoring America's energy dominance — Trump's shorthand for fossil fuels — and making the U.S. “the artificial intelligence capital of the world.” As demand for new data centers increases, some of these projects will need state water quality permits. Kramer said the update will make the rules for these reviews clear.

“This makes what we are doing in the 401 space crucial, right? Those projects, they need to be able to move forward with certainty,” said Kramer.

A final rule is expected in the spring after a public comment period.

Looking back nearly two decades, Sommers reminded the audience that in 2007 the U.S. produced just 5 million barrels of oil per day and relied heavily on imports, including from Venezuela.
“Energy strength doesn’t happen by chance,” he said.
Over the past decade, the U.S. has shipped more than 8,000 LNG cargoes, contributing nearly half a trillion dollars to the economy and supporting 275,000 jobs.
At the same time, Sommers noted, American producers have driven down emissions per barrel through efficiency and innovation, arguing that “no other country has matched America’s ability to produce more energy with fewer emissions.” But production alone will not be enough.","At the American Petroleum Institute’s annual State of American Energy event, API President and CEO Mike Sommers framed the coming decade in blunt terms: energy demand is rising fast, and pretending otherwise is no longer a political luxury that the United States can afford.

Looking back nearly two decades, Sommers reminded the audience that in 2007 the U.S. produced just 5 million barrels of oil per day and relied heavily on imports, including from Venezuela. “Energy strength doesn’t happen by chance,” he said. “It is a choice.” That contrast, he argued, explains how the U.S. became the world’s leading oil and natural gas producer while Venezuela collapsed under what he described as “state-sponsored theft and corruption.”

Sommers referred to the next ten years as “the Demand Decade,” warning that “multiple forces are converging to drive up energy needs dramatically.” The question, he said, is not whether demand will materialize, but whether the U.S. energy system can deliver “with the speed, scale and reliability that this moment demands.”

The United States now produces more than 13 million barrels of oil per day and has become the world’s top LNG exporter. Over the past decade, the U.S. has shipped more than 8,000 LNG cargoes, contributing nearly half a trillion dollars to the economy and supporting 275,000 jobs. At the same time, Sommers noted, American producers have driven down emissions per barrel through efficiency and innovation, arguing that “no other country has matched America’s ability to produce more energy with fewer emissions.”

But production alone will not be enough. Infrastructure, Sommers said, is “the hinge point of the Demand Decade.” He pointed to the Mountain Valley Pipeline as a cautionary tale, saying it “took longer to permit and build than the entire Apollo space program,” adding that “a system that requires an act of Congress to build a pipeline is a system that’s broken.”

Sommers said voters are rejecting scarcity politics. “We’re done with that,” he said. “The mainstream has moved decisively toward abundance, affordability, and growth.” The choice, he concluded, is clear: “We choose energy success, not surrender.”

While the federal electric vehicles credits are gone and some EV sales have predictably dropped, a number of US states still have their own incentives. At the same time, the number of new public EV chargers is steadily expanding.

Some people might be focusing too much on a decline in the sales of some EVs in the US and overreacting to that data point. The current expansion of public EV charging is an important data point as well.

The new public chargers at Walmart locations are very fast — 400 kW — not Level 2 chargers that require hours of charging. Level 2 chargers are just fine in some situations, but for long-distance travel EV drivers typically want to charge in less than one hour.

Adding fast chargers at Walmart locations can draw EV drivers from out of town and in town who want a quick charge while they shop and perhaps have a beverage, a bite, or a biobreak. EV drivers tend to have some cash so providing charging opportunities for them at retail stores makes sense.

The new fast chargers are planned for about 78 Walmart locations, locations that will soon be providing a great service to EV drivers. You may notice some of the locations are in charging deserts or near charging deserts. Adding new fast chargers particularly matters in these areas.

But the party didn't last long. Following years of losses, manufacturing difficulties, and a shifting electric vehicle environment, Lucid's stock has cratered 88% since its initial public offering.

Some view this as a buying opportunity, with massive potential upside if Lucid becomes a major player in the global EV industry. The hope is that the company's advanced electric vehicles could eventually help propel Lucid ahead of its competition and push shares high enough to mint millionaires.

Unfortunately, I think those hopes are misplaced. Here are a few reasons Lucid isn't likely to make you rich anytime soon.

Lucid has significant losses and minimal revenue

Growth companies typically don't generate significant profits when they're just getting started, and that's been true for Lucid. The company's third-quarter 2025 net loss was approximately $1 billion, a very substantial amount.

Instead, most growth companies generate a lot of revenue and reinvest some of it into their company to spur new growth. The problem for Lucid is that has modest sales, reaching just $337 million in the third quarter (which ended Sept. 30), an increase of 68% from the year-ago quarter. That type of growth isn't enough to help the company invest in new technology, significantly ramp up production, or close the gap on its losses.

Designing and building electric vehicles is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. So to help offset all of its spending and lack of revenue, Lucid has had to receive multiple rounds of investment capital from the Saudi Public Investment Fund to keep the business going. While it's helped Lucid keep the company running, it's unclear whether or not it will have to raise additional capital in the future.

Adding to its difficulties is the fact that Lucid wants to launch a new, $50,000 midsize SUV sometime next year. While selling a car at a lower price point than its current models could be a way to drive sales, launching a new product and ramping up production will continue to sap Lucid's limited resources.

Electric vehicle competition is fierce

Another significant reason Lucid's shares may struggle to make substantial gains is that the EV market is currently experiencing a challenging period, and it remains unclear how long it will last.

Consider that the Trump administration ended the EV tax credits years before they were scheduled to expire, essentially dismantling many consumers' incentive to buy EVs. The effects are already being felt in the industry, with consumer EV sales estimated to drop from 11% of new car sales in December 2024 to about 6.6% in 2025.

While Lucid's vehicles were too expensive to benefit directly from the tax credit, buyers could take advantage of a leasing loophole with the credit. But that's no longer the case.

On top of all this, competition is fierce among global EV makers. Tesla, once the top electric vehicle seller, lost its title as the top-selling global EV brand to BYD, a Chinese automaker, last year. With BYD selling 2.26 million electric vehicles worldwide, not even Tesla's 1.6 million vehicle deliveries was enough to stay ahead of the competition.

While it's not quite an apples-to-apples comparison, it's worth noting that Lucid delivered just 15,841 vehicles in 2025. BYD and Tesla sell in far more markets globally and are much larger companies than Lucid. However, if Lucid wants to compete globally, its shareholders need to understand that its vehicles will eventually have to compete against those of BYD, Tesla, and others.

There's little chance for Lucid to mint millionaires

Lucid makes impressive electric vehicle technology that has earned numerous accolades, including holding the world record for the longest distance driven on a single charge -- a remarkable 749 miles. But even its stand-out technology isn't enough to help the company generate significant sales.

Without a massive ramp-up in vehicle production and sales -- spurred by an influx of consumer demand -- I think it's very unlikely for Lucid's shares to gain enough to help shareholders become millionaires. Competition is too fierce, the company is spending too much money, and production and sales are too low for Lucid.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F850286%2Flucid_gravity_dirt.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-13 13:59:42.398028

“The State’s Renew NC program is already helping homeowners across Western North Carolina.","The City of Asheville and State of North Carolina have formalized their partnership using $3 million in City of Asheville disaster recovery funding to support home repair and reconstruction for Asheville homeowners impacted by Tropical Storm Helene. North Carolina Secretary of Commerce Lee Lilley signed the agreement on January 7, 2026. The application period, open since June 2025, remains open for eligible residents through January 31 at RenewNC.org.

The funding is part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Community Development Block Grant–Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) allocation to the City of Asheville and is dedicated specifically to the Renew NC Single-Family Home Repair Program, which assists homeowners across 28 counties whose primary residences were damaged by Tropical Storm Helene in September 2024.

Meeting the need

In January 2025, HUD allocated disaster recovery funding to Asheville to support long-term housing recovery efforts. Asheville’s CDBG-DR Action Plan designated $3 million to address unmet repair and reconstruction needs for owner-occupied, single-family homes via the Renew NC program.

The City of Asheville is partnering with the State of North Carolina Department of Commerce’s Renew NC Single-Family Housing Program to administer the program on the City’s behalf. Renew NC will manage application intake, eligibility determination, environmental reviews, case management, and construction activities and the City of Asheville will reimburse the State only for eligible construction costs incurred within city limits and monitor program compliance and execution.

“This partnership represents a critical turning point for our community,” said CDBG-DR Program Manager Elma King. “While emergency aid helped us get through the immediate aftermath of Tropical Storm Helene, these CDBG-DR funds are about long-term stability – ensuring that our residents aren’t just back in their houses, but are safe in homes that are fully repaired or rebuilt.”

Tiered assistance approach

Assistance will be provided through a tiered approach that prioritizes households earning less than 60% of Area Median Income (AMI) that include children, elderly residents, or individuals with disabilities, before moving to serve applicants in higher income categories if funds remain. Funding per household is limited to $50,000 for home rehabilitation and up to $450,000 for reconstruction, depending on eligibility and need.

“The State’s Renew NC program is already helping homeowners across Western North Carolina. By joining forces with the State’s Renew NC program, we are working to make the most of every dollar and every day since the Helene,” King said. “We are using Asheville’s recovery funding to pay for hard construction costs, allowing us to efficiently provide high-quality reconstruction and rehabilitation services that meet federal standards without duplicating administrative efforts.”

Asheville City Council authorized the subrecipient agreement with the State in October 2025, enabling the City to move forward with utilizing the $3 million allocation for single-family housing repairs.

Application Deadline & Link

The Renew NC application period will close at the end of the month. Homeowners impacted by Tropical Storm Helene are encouraged to apply as soon as possible. The deadline to apply is Saturday, January 31.

Higher oil prices would help the energy industry, which he has prioritized in his second term in office.","One of the campaign promises of President Donald Trump was to secure affordable energy for Americans. Even at the time, this promise put him at odds with the oil industry, already suffering from low oil prices. Now, the rift has deepened as the prospect of cheap Venezuelan crude pressures everyone but Big Oil. Thankfully for the industry, geopolitics still plays a role in price-setting. It’s good news for oil producers and bad news for consumers.

Almost every oil market forecaster predicted prices would go even lower this year than they were in 2025, when the benchmarks shed around a fifth of their value. Brent crude was forecast at an average of below $60, with West Texas Intermediate seen closer to $50, and possibly even falling below that level over the course of the year.

Another thing that forecasters agreed on was that such low prices would prompt a production response from non-OPEC countries, notably the United States. Shale drillers, who are responsible for the bulk of U.S. oil output, would find it hard to make ends meet at $50 or less per barrel so they would start curbing production, the argument went. It is a solid argument, based on historical evidence. Yet producers’ reaction would lead to higher oil prices, and that would go against President Trump’s campaign promise to Americans.

It was a risky proposition from the start, at least for the independent oil companies in the shale patch and outside it. Big Oil is not called Big Oil for nothing – it can survive low oil prices for much longer than independents. But for independents, Trump’s promise to jumpstart a revival in oil and gas—which had never stopped growing, by the way—has been a mixed bag. Sure, his federal government started making life easier for oil and gas companies from day one, easing the regulatory burden on the industry and opening up new acreage for exploration. But that promise of cheap oil has made it difficult for industry players to enjoy those changes.

It is not just U.S. industry players, by the way. The sustained decline in oil prices last year pushed capital expenditure on exploration and production lower than it had been in 2024. This year, upstream capex is also seen booking a decline on 2025, according to Wood Mackenzie. Notably, the energy consultancy expects a decline in capex in North America and Europe, while spending in Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa is set to increase.

Mostly, the bearish outlook for oil is based on estimates of oversupply. Record amounts of oil on water—including sold cargoes en route to their destinations—are often cited as one reason for that perception. China’s gap between oil processing rates and imports is another. The International Energy Agency and the U.S. Energy Information Administration both expect the supply of crude oil to exceed demand by six figures this year. No wonder oil prices are weak, making President Trump happy.

Only they are now on the climb yet again as protests in Iran intensify, prompting worry among traders for the security of supply from OPEC, which exports its oil almost exclusively to China. It appears that worry is substantial enough to override the bearish mood following President Trump’s declaration that the United States had already started selling Venezuelan oil. Of course, countering that mood were reports that not all Big Oil majors are looking forward to rebuilding Venezuela’s oil industry, with Exxon specifically calling the country “uninvestable”. The statement prompted President Trump to threaten to block the supermajor from working in Venezuela.

Trouble in Iran, meanwhile, could spill over, jeopardizing oil transport in the Strait of Hormuz—the hottest chokepoint in global oil markets that everyone immediately thinks about when there is any violence in or around Iran. The current protests are no exception, in the context of threats made by President Trump against the Iranian government. With the Venezuelan incursion taking pretty much everyone by surprise, now everyone seems to expect more military action from the Trump administration, and not just in South America.

That expectation by itself is not enough to push oil prices much higher, MST Marquee’s head of energy research, Saul Kavonic, told Reuters. “The market is saying show me the disruption to supply before materially responding,” Kavonic said. The market may yet do just that: “There have also been calls for workers in the oil industry to down tools amid the protests,” ANZ energy analysts said in a note, as quoted in the above Reuters report. “The situation puts at least 1.9 million barrels per day of oil exports at risk of disruption,” they added.

This, and any plans President Trump may have regarding Iran, puts him in a complicated situation. Higher oil prices would help the energy industry, which he has prioritized in his second term in office. But higher prices would interfere with the affordable energy promise. Meanwhile, OPEC might yet reverse its production policy and start cutting output again. It is going to be another interesting year in oil.

• Meeting the region’s 2050 energy needs with natural gas would cost $106.9 billion and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 24.5%.
• Meeting the region’s 2050 energy needs with a mix of nuclear and natural gas plants would cost $195.8 billion and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent.
That’s $399.5 billion more than it would cost to go nuclear and $708 billion more than it would cost to build more natural gas plants.
The report did not calculate the cost savings to New Hampshire residents by our state’s continued reliance on natural gas.","New Englanders would save hundreds of billions of dollars and avoid deadly power blackouts by replacing state-mandated renewable energy projects with nuclear and natural gas power, a study released today by a coalition of New England think tanks finds.

Alternatives to New England’s Affordability Crisis, a new study released by a coalition of New England’s free-market think tanks, estimated the effects of trying to meet the region’s energy needs through 2050 with nuclear and natural gas plants instead of wind and solar power.

The findings are striking:

• Meeting New England’s 2050 energy needs with nuclear power would cost $415.3 billion and reduce the region’s total annual greenhouse gas emissions by 92%.

• Meeting the region’s 2050 energy needs with natural gas would cost $106.9 billion and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 24.5%.

• Meeting the region’s 2050 energy needs with a mix of nuclear and natural gas plants would cost $195.8 billion and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent.

Each of these options comes with the added benefit of avoiding power blackouts caused by relying too heavily on wind and solar power, which cannot run continuously, as nuclear and natural gas plants can.

All of the nuclear and natural gas options are significantly more affordable than the construction required by current renewable energy mandates imposed by five of the six New England states.

Meeting the region’s energy demand by sticking with those renewable energy mandates due to the NetZero by 2050 climate mandate would cost New Englanders a stunning $815 billion, the coalition found in its previous 2024 study. That’s $399.5 billion more than it would cost to go nuclear and $708 billion more than it would cost to build more natural gas plants.

“Again, we see that New England states would better serve their residents by adopting reality-based energy policies that prioritize reliability and costs. And again, New Hampshire leads the way,” said Drew Cline, President of the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy.

“Affordability is the No. 1 political issue in the United States as we head into 2026. Any New England politician who wants to actually make substantial progress on affordability needs to read this report. Electricity prices are a top contributor to New England’s high cost of living. In building enough energy generation to meet the region’s needs in 2050, our report shows that energy prices would increase by 64.8 percent in the Nuclear scenario, 26.5 percent in the Happy Medium scenario, and just 13 percent in the Natural Gas scenario. These increases are a fraction of the Renewable scenario, which would increase prices by 126.4 percent,” Cline said.

The report did not calculate the cost savings to New Hampshire residents by our state’s continued reliance on natural gas. Instead, those cost savings are spread throughout the region.

By building a network of energy generation already focused on nuclear and natural gas, New Hampshire has kept its own costs lower than they otherwise would be, and also kept costs lower for the entire region.

This report shows that if the rest of New England adopted New Hampshire’s approach, the entire region would save hundreds of billions of dollars, avoid dangerous energy shortages, and still make progress on emissions reductions.

Our previous report in 2024 found that “the Granite State’s lack of electrification mandates for transportation and home heating reduces the projected peak system demand from 57 GW to 52.5 GW, and the continued use of natural gas provides critical dispatchable capacity for the system, allowing it to perform better during periods of low wind and solar output.”

“New Hampshire’s current energy policies would save all New Englanders $56.5 billion during the time period studied,” the report found.

New Hampshire has been a political pariah in New England for pursuing a reality-based energy policy focused on reliability and affordability. Political and media leaders from around the region boasted that their policies were virtuous and New Hampshire’s were selfish and immoral. Now, with the challenges of relying on wind and solar power in our region more clearly understood, policymakers in the Northeast have begun shifting more toward New Hampshire’s way of thinking about energy generation.

The new study was conducted by Always on Energy Research on behalf of the Maine Policy Institute, the Fiscal Alliance Foundation, the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy, the Rhode Island Center for Freedom & Prosperity, and the Yankee Institute, along with Americans for Prosperity Foundation.

The study draws on data from ISO-New England, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and the Weldon Cooper Center and includes detailed modeling of generation capacity, cost-of-service, and peak demand scenarios through 2050.

“Not monetizing DOES NOT equal not considering or not valuing the human health impact,” Hirsch said in an emailed statement, saying the agency remains committee to human health.
For every $1 spent on reducing PM2.5, the agency said, there could be as much as $77 in health benefits.
Emissions of nitrogen oxide, also known as NOx, form smog and soot that is harmful to human health and linked to serious heart and lung diseases.
The new rule does not estimate the economic value of health benefits from reducing NOx and other types of air pollution under the Clean Air Act.","WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency says it will stop calculating how much money is saved in health care costs and preventable deaths avoided from air pollution rules that curb two deadly pollutants.

The change means the EPA will focus rules for fine particulate matter and ozone only on the cost to industry, part of a broader realignment under President Donald Trump toward a business-friendly approach that has included the rollback of multiple policies meant to safeguard human health and the environment and slow climate change.

The agency said in a statement late Monday that it “absolutely remains committed to our core mission of protecting human health and the environment"" but “will not be monetizing the impacts at this time.” The EPA will continue to estimate costs to businesses to comply with the rules and will continue “ongoing work to refine its economic methodologies” of pollution rules, spokeswoman Brigit Hirsch said.

Environmental and public health advocates called the agency's action a dangerous abdication of one of its core missions.

“The EPA’s mandate is to protect public health, not to ignore the science in order to eliminate clean air safeguards that save lives,'' said John Walke, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

He called the change in how public health benefits are calculated “reckless, dangerous, and illegal,'' adding: “By pretending real health benefits do not count, EPA wants to open the door for industry to foul the air, while communities and families pay the price in asthma attacks, heart disease and premature deaths.”

The change in how the EPA calculates health benefits was first reported by The New York Times.

The move comes as the Trump administration is seeking to abandon a rule that sets tough standards for deadly soot pollution, arguing that the Biden administration did not have authority to set the tighter standard on pollution from tailpipes, smokestacks and other industrial sources.

In a court filing in November, the EPA said the Biden-era rule was done “without the rigorous, stepwise process that Congress required” and was therefore unlawful.

The EPA said it continues to recognize the “clear and well-documented benefits” of reducing fine particulate matter, also known as PM2.5, and ozone.

“Not monetizing DOES NOT equal not considering or not valuing the human health impact,” Hirsch said in an emailed statement, saying the agency remains committee to human health.

Since the EPA’s creation more than 50 years ago, Republican and Democratic administrations have used different estimates to assign monetary value to a human life in cost-benefit analyses.

Under former President Joe Biden, the EPA estimated that its proposed rule on PM2.5 would prevent up to 4,500 premature deaths and 290,000 lost workdays by 2032. For every $1 spent on reducing PM2.5, the agency said, there could be as much as $77 in health benefits.

But the Trump administration contends that these estimates are misleading. By failing to include ranges or other qualifying statements, EPA’s use of specific estimate “leads the public to believe the Agency has a better understanding of the monetized impacts of exposure to PM2.5 and ozone than in reality,” the agency said in an economic impact analysis for the new NOx rule.

“Therefore, to rectify this error, the EPA is no longer monetizing benefits from PM2.5 and ozone but will continue to quantify the emissions until the Agency is confident enough in the modeling to properly monetize those impacts.”

The United States has made substantial progress in reducing PM2.5 and ozone concentrations since 2000, the agency said.

But critics said a new EPA rule that revises emission limits for dangerous nitrogen oxide pollution from new gas-burning turbines used in power plants demonstrates the risks of the new approach.

Emissions of nitrogen oxide, also known as NOx, form smog and soot that is harmful to human health and linked to serious heart and lung diseases. EPA’s final NOx rule, issued Monday, is substantially less restrictive than a proposal under the Biden administration. For some gas plants, the rule weakens protections in place for two decades.

The new rule does not estimate the economic value of health benefits from reducing NOx and other types of air pollution under the Clean Air Act. Critics said the change means EPA will ignore the economic value of lives saved, hospital visits avoided and lost work and school days prevented.

Under Trump, the EPA ""recklessly refuses to place any value on protecting the health of millions of Americans from nitrogen oxides pollution in the face of mountains of medical science finding that this pollution contributes to asthma attacks, heart disease and other serious health problems.” said Noha Haggag, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund, another environmental group.

“EPA is leaving millions of people in harm’s way when common sense solutions are at hand for modern national limits on nitrogen oxides pollution,'' Haggag said.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/2e507a25-f342-4656-9d36-b2d6acab2b91/wirestory_771218fb0059f4c1b07981755d3453a1_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-13 13:01:04.427190

GFL Environmental and LRS recently acquired assets from each other in a deal that went into effect at the start of the year. LRS sold two hauling yards and a C&D landfill in Mayflower, Arkansas, while GFL sold unspecified assets in Indiana, according to sources.

Heavy equipment operators at the Mayflower, Arkansas, landfill voted last year to join International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 373 and are still negotiating their first contract. Chuck Stiles, assistant director of the Teamsters solid waste and recycling division, confirmed the deal and said local labor negotiators plan to meet with GFL next month.

The companies involved in the transaction declined to comment. The deal comes as LRS orients itself around its new Indianapolis hub, where it began providing waste and recycling collection services at the start of the year.

Dive Insight:

The two companies have a history of dealmaking. GFL acquired LRS’ Wisconsin assets last year, and LRS acquired GFL assets in Illinois and Minnesota in 2021. Previously, GFL acquired large hauler WCA Waste from a Macquarie-backed fund for $1.2 billion in 2020. Macquarie, which owns the fund that backs LRS, was a major investor in GFL before a recapitalization deal in 2018. GFL later went public.

LRS secured the waste collection contract for the city of Indianapolis, a service previously provided by WM and Republic Services, a year ago. LRS is now offering residents an opt-in recycling subscription service through the end of 2027, after which the hauler is set to roll out universal curbside recycling services.

LRS established a significant presence for itself in Indiana when it acquired Michiana Recycling & Disposal Service in January 2023. Rolled together with Michigan-based Modern Waste Systems, it was LRS’ largest acquisition to date, netting the company an operation with more than 200 employees and about 125 trucks. In August 2025, LRS expanded on its presence in the Indianapolis market with its acquisition of local hauler GHW.

LRS acquired the Mayflower landfill in 2021 as part of a broader deal for Ramco-Alternative Waste Management, which served the Little Rock market. That transaction also included a sizable fleet and operations in Kansas and Wisconsin.

GFL had a presence in Arkansas prior to the deal with LRS, including three landfills, two transfer stations and multiple hauling locations, according to the company’s website. Stiles said workers’ healthcare was switched to GFL’s plan on Jan. 2, and he said about 75 Arkansas workers in total were included in the deal.

Teamsters represents landfill workers but not the drivers. In the past, Stiles said the union has had largely productive conversations with LRS, and hundreds of LRS workers are now Teamsters. Stiles said the union has less experience with GFL, though he noted productive experiences with GFL in Canada and with WCA Waste in the past. Labor leaders expect to meet with GFL to discuss the Arkansas landfill contract on Feb. 18 and 19.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/tq3y-LkKZKmnwBEdblC_3HdgSQAgkypHY8kOnxyYJoU/g:nowe:0:113/c:4032:2278/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9MUlNfUmVzaV9UcnVja18uanBn.webp,N,,2026-01-13 13:01:49.829629

Ørsted’s court hearing was the first, and judges are set to consider the fate of the other in-progress offshore wind projects this week.
A hearing for Dominion Energy’s massive 2.6-gigawatt Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is scheduled for Friday.
In addition, grid operators have been banking on the arrival of these large-scale offshore wind projects, several of which are more than halfway complete.
When he was reelected in 2024, BloombergNEF expected 39 GW of offshore wind capacity to come online in America by 2035.","A federal judge has ruled that Ørsted can resume the construction of its nearly complete, 704-megawatt Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island.

The decision on Monday comes after the Trump administration issued stop-work orders to all five of the offshore wind projects under development in the U.S. in late December, the culmination of President Donald Trump’s yearlong war against the renewable energy source

Revolution Wind, a $6.2 billion project that is nearly 90% complete, was hit with an earlier federal stop-work order in August from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, a division of the Interior Department. A federal judge ruled in favor of Ørsted in September, allowing the project to move forward until December’s order, which cited unspecified issues of ​“national security.”

On Monday, the Danish developer said it will ​“resume construction work as soon as possible” while its complaint against the Trump administration is heard by the courts.

Judge Royce Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who issued the injunction, said from the bench on Monday that the bureau’s August suspension order was ​“the height of arbitrary and capricious” and that the December order’s vague claims of national security risks did ​“not constitute a sufficient explanation for the bureau’s decision to entirely stop work on the Revolution Wind project.” He noted that the government’s argument for halting construction was ​“unreasonable and seemingly unjustified.”

Each offshore wind project has been repeatedly vetted by the Department of Defense since being proposed, and developers said they were blindsided by the Trump administration’s latest security concerns.

Ørsted and two other offshore-wind developers, Equinor and Dominion Energy Virginia, all sued to vacate the Trump administration’s 90-day construction freeze from December. Ørsted’s court hearing was the first, and judges are set to consider the fate of the other in-progress offshore wind projects this week.

On Wednesday, a court could decide on Equinor’s 810-MW Empire Wind project, which also previously received and defeated a stop-work order. A hearing for Dominion Energy’s massive 2.6-gigawatt Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is scheduled for Friday. In addition to energy developers, the states of Connecticut, New York, and Rhode Island have all sued to get the projects going again.

The stakes are high: In total, the five offshore wind farms affected by the Trump administration’s December order would bring nearly 6 GW of capacity to the grid, or enough to power roughly 2.5 million homes across the East Coast.

The U.S. can’t afford to lose any of these projects. Energy demand is climbing across the nation, causing household utility bills to soar. More power plants are needed to keep bills from rising even further — especially in regions swamped with power-hungry data centers, like Virginia.

In addition, grid operators have been banking on the arrival of these large-scale offshore wind projects, several of which are more than halfway complete. In August, ISO-New England issued an unprecedented warning that the Trump administration’s first pause on Revolution Wind created ​“unpredictable risks” that could ​“undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future.”

At least one project could be abandoned imminently. Equinor, which already lost nearly $1 billion because of the first stop-work order on Empire Wind, says the beleaguered project faces ​“likely termination” if it can’t continue work by this Friday.

Meanwhile, industry groups applauded Monday’s decision.

Kat Burnham, the New England policy lead for Advanced Energy United, said the D.C. court ​“rightly saw through a politically motivated stop-work order that would have caused real harm: driving up costs, delaying power for Rhode Island and Connecticut, and putting good-paying jobs at risk.” In a statement, she said the decision is ​“good news for workers, ratepayers, and anyone who recognizes the need for a fair energy market.”

The latest skirmish over offshore wind comes after a year of assault from the Trump administration. Trump has gummed up the build-out of onshore wind and solar power, too — but no energy source has been targeted like offshore wind.

The impact of Trump’s war on the sector is profound.

When he was reelected in 2024, BloombergNEF expected 39 GW of offshore wind capacity to come online in America by 2035. The research group hedged that number to 21.5 GW if Trump managed to repeal wind tax credits during his term. He did. As of October, BNEF expected just 6 GW to get online by 2035 — a number that will be even lower if any of the in-progress projects buckle under the weight of the latest order.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/REV_082025_18040001.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=788ab51081678b7571903c12d5d717f6,N,,2026-01-13 13:59:52.483637

We recently submitted comments to the EPA voicing concern and opposition to its proposed “Waters of the United States” rule that redefines which wetlands and waters have Clean Water Act protections.
We’re opposing the weakening of federal clean water protections because polluters should not get special treatment over the health of our people and environment.
These include the Site Location of Development Act, the Mandatory Shoreland Zoning Act, and the Natural Resources Protection Act.
Robust clean water protections are critical to prevent industrial polluters from bending the rules and threatening the health and safety of people and wildlife.","For more than half a century, the Clean Water Act has helped curb pollution flowing into our rivers, lakes, and streams. And now the safeguards that are embedded in this landmark environmental law are at risk due to changes being proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin.

The Clean Water Act has deep ties to Maine. It was a crowning accomplishment for Senator Edmund Muskie, who grew up in Rumford and was prompted into action because he saw that our rivers were being treated as open sewers. His determination to remedy that resulted in one of the nation’s most important environmental laws, and now, our waterways and drinking water are safer and cleaner because of it.

The Natural Resources Council of Maine has always stood with Mainers to protect clean water. We recently submitted comments to the EPA voicing concern and opposition to its proposed “Waters of the United States” rule that redefines which wetlands and waters have Clean Water Act protections. The proposed change would leave up to 97% of non-tidal wetlands in Maine without these federal protections, removing a crucial policy backstop and creating uncertainty for our drinking water, flood protections, and critical habitat.

We’re opposing the weakening of federal clean water protections because polluters should not get special treatment over the health of our people and environment.

Maine is known for clean water. As the most forested state in the country, with a relatively small population concentrated in urban areas along the coast, Mainers today reap the benefits of high water quality in our inland lakes, rivers, streams, and wetlands. The state’s pristine waters are a principal driver of tourism here in Maine, where “Vacationland” is proudly printed on our license plates, and, as an industry, attracted more than 15 million visitors and contributed $9 billion to the economy in 2023. It also directly supports jobs in the fishing, outdoor recreation, and real estate sectors, to name a few. It’s the reason why our state is home to the last stronghold of native brook trout in the eastern U.S.

Around the same time that the Clean Water Act was created, several state laws were also passed here in Maine that protect water resources. These include the Site Location of Development Act, the Mandatory Shoreland Zoning Act, and the Natural Resources Protection Act.

As a result of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 decision on Sackett v. EPA, many wetlands and small streams around the country that lack a “continuous surface connection” to “traditional interstate navigable waters” were stripped of protections awarded under the Clean Water Act.

Fortunately for us here in Maine, these resources still have substantial protection under the three state laws mentioned previously. However, with the Clean Water Act no longer in play, we are missing an important safeguard that served as a critical second line of defense for decades.

We also know we can’t take our state’s clean water laws for granted. Back in 2011, several pieces of state legislation designed to rollback key environmental protections under these three laws were introduced in Maine as part of an anti-regulatory campaign brought forward by Governor LePage. This included an effort to substantially weaken the Site Location of Development Act (LD 159), five different efforts to weaken the Mandatory Shoreland Zoning Act (LDs 219, 339, 434, 888, and 1108), and three different efforts to weaken the Natural Resources Protection Act (LDs 156, 387, and 872).

These proposed changes were fought by environmental groups across the state, and although they were each threatening in their own ways, organizations like NRCM felt assured at the time that no matter what happened, our waterbodies would still be subject to federal protection under the Clean Water Act. If these changes go into effect, that assurance will be gone for many streams and wetlands here in Maine whose protection now lies solely with state and local governments.

EPA Administrator Zeldin’s proposed rule change favors polluters and fails to listen to the thousands of Mainers who are demanding strong protections for clean water. If finalized, the rule would fail to meet the needs and protections of communities, ecosystems, and waterways in Maine and across the United States.

After recent federal rollbacks, a strong definition of the “Waters of the United States” rule is even more essential for protecting wetlands and waterways. Robust clean water protections are critical to prevent industrial polluters from bending the rules and threatening the health and safety of people and wildlife.

We can’t protect Maine’s future if we don’t protect the health of our environment. Maintaining strong, common-sense environmental laws are needed to protect the outdoor spaces we all love.

How the Battleship North Carolina got to its home in Wilmington

Sixty-five years ago, a state-wide fundraising effort saved a more than 70 million-pound, 700-foot long behemoth of a WWII warship from being scrapped. The USS North Carolina is now a museum in Wilmington, and it would not have made it there without the contributions of thousands of North Carolina children.

The museum now has an effort underway to collect the stories of the “kid heroes” who helped save the ship back in 1961.

And as we consider the cybersecurity of our energy systems we also have to recognize the importance that energy reliability plays in our way of life.
But unfortunately, I am concerned that Secretary Wright’s actions at the Department of Energy are undermining that reliability.
In October of last year, the Trump Administration and Secretary Wright illegally canceled 300 energy projects across the country – stealing $8 billion in grants for energy projects when we desperately need more energy.
These actions and the Big Ugly Bill are going to seriously undermine energy reliability.","Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ) delivered the following opening remarks at today's Energy Subcommittee legislative hearing on addressing threats to America’s energy infrastructure:

America’s energy system is under increasing threat. Russia and China have developed sophisticated offensive cyber weapons, and the proliferation of artificial intelligence technology means that every day those offensive cyber weapons grow stronger. It also means that less sophisticated adversaries – terrorist organizations without the backing of nation-states – will be able to pull off devastating cyberattacks, whether it is against the federal government, utilities, or directly against energy infrastructure assets themselves.

That is why I am pleased to see a suite of draft legislation in this hearing, including some bills reauthorizing important cybersecurity programs created by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. I’m encouraged to see my Republican colleagues now acknowledge the importance and benefits of some of the provisions of that law. Others, like the Energy Threat Analysis Center Act, are completely new, and are based off valuable testimony that this Subcommittee received last year.

I look forward to hearing from our witnesses about these bills because it is critical that we work in a bipartisan fashion to secure our nation’s energy infrastructure from cyber and physical threats.

And as we consider the cybersecurity of our energy systems we also have to recognize the importance that energy reliability plays in our way of life. But unfortunately, I am concerned that Secretary Wright’s actions at the Department of Energy are undermining that reliability.

In October of last year, the Trump Administration and Secretary Wright illegally canceled 300 energy projects across the country – stealing $8 billion in grants for energy projects when we desperately need more energy. In July, the Administration put out an analysis desperately calling for every available megawatt of power, but Secretary Wright is directly responsible for killing projects that would have added enormous amounts of clean power to the grid.

These projects were authorized by Congress and funded through bipartisan laws. Thankfully, just yesterday, a court reversed the termination notices for a number of the illegally canceled grants, and I am hopeful that more projects sue the Department for its actions and get their funding restored.

Now the problem is it doesn’t end there. Since Trump took office, the Department of Energy has shed roughly 3,500 staff, and is so understaffed in some areas that its Office of Nuclear Energy is asking for volunteers from universities to help them review novel nuclear reactor designs. That doesn’t really sound like energy security to me. And late last year, the Department of Energy underwent a reorganization, closing important offices like the Grid Deployment Office, the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, and the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains.

Throughout the entire process, Secretary Wright has refused to answer questions, leaving Congress with zero information and no opportunity as to what is happening at the Department. So I am hopeful, Mr. Fitzsimmons – a number of your DOE colleagues have appeared before us in the last year, but have given unsatisfactory answers, or claimed to not have any information to share. So I am hoping that you will be more responsive today.

And let’s also not forget the Big Ugly Bill – or as Republicans call it beautiful, I say it’s the ugly bill – which is slated to increase electricity prices by 61 percent, and endanger more than 300 gigawatts of reliable, clean generation just when we need it most. Electricity prices are up 13 percent just since Trump took office, and companies have either delayed or canceled over $53 billion in investment in the energy sector and we’ve lost over 165,000 jobs in this sector.

These actions and the Big Ugly Bill are going to seriously undermine energy reliability. I am hopeful that these cybersecurity bills will be helpful – but to be honest, and I’m not taking away from them, they’re really just a drop in the bucket when you look at the energy reliability problems that Republicans are creating for the American people. And those problems are just getting worse every day. In New Jersey, electricity bills are up over 20 percent. So, you know, this is a major problem for the public and I hope we can deal with it more effectively on a bipartisan basis.

With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

,American Energy,2026-01-13 16:29:07+00:00,Utility Dive,America's energy innovation crossroads: why federal investment matters now | Utility Dive,"Robert Walton, Ethan Howland, Evan Chapman",,,,,https://www.utilitydive.com/news/americas-energy-innovation-crossroads-why-federal-investment-matters-now/806098/,"The path forward is clear: Now is the time to rebuild American energy innovation leadership to create a more affordable, cleaner and secure energy future.
If America acts now, we can lower costs for families, create jobs across the country and ensure our energy future is developed domestically.
That’s the promise of energy innovation for Americans nationwide, and that’s why our team has released our new report, Re-Energizing America.
DOE remains at the heart of American energy innovation.
To adequately address these key imperatives, we must prioritize American energy innovation.","A new frontier in energy is emerging — and that leaves us with an important choice that will determine whether the United States continues to lead the world in energy innovation, as we have for the previous 150 years, or cedes that leadership to other countries.

Our energy system has historically represented American ingenuity and dominance. If we fail to develop and deliver clean energy technologies at scale here at home, the consequences will be significant. America’s national security, economic might and global standing will all suffer.

The path forward is clear: Now is the time to rebuild American energy innovation leadership to create a more affordable, cleaner and secure energy future. If America acts now, we can lower costs for families, create jobs across the country and ensure our energy future is developed domestically. That’s the promise of energy innovation for Americans nationwide, and that’s why our team has released our new report, Re-Energizing America.

Our history offers a blueprint for progress. Half a century ago, a global oil crisis sent shockwaves through our economy. With foreign producers and global markets determining the price of oil, our weaknesses were exposed. In response, we did what Americans do best: we took action. Our leaders founded the Department of Energy, launched massive investments in energy research and committed to making and powering things right here at home.

DOE remains at the heart of American energy innovation. From the first viable solar cells invented in New Jersey to the infrastructure and ingenuity enabling the shale boom in Texas and Pennsylvania, American innovation has allowed these technologies to flourish. Continued leadership of the next generation of energy tech, however, will require smart economic strategy, a competitive edge on the global stage and sustained federal investment.

Four policy priorities drive the need for renewed federal commitment: energy security, affordability, economic opportunity and decarbonization. Our dependence on foreign supply chains — alongside China’s dominance in emerging energy technologies — is creating new national security risks. Meanwhile, rising energy costs have reminded us how closely power prices shape economic stability and household budgets.

To adequately address these key imperatives, we must prioritize American energy innovation. With major federal funding set to expire this year, our nation faces an innovation cliff. To ensure we lead the world in energy innovation, the solution is straightforward: a federal investment of $25 billion for DOE’s research, development and demonstration programs by 2030. This budget, representing less than one percent of the total 2030 federal budget, is built from a strategic assessment of technology priorities, historic investment and comparison of the U.S. to global peers and competitors.

Success in meeting America’s energy challenges will also require a fundamental change in how federal agencies approach innovation. Transforming DOE will take both structural reforms and cultural shifts that prioritize collaboration, speed and long-term thinking. The goal must be to create an institution built for sustained engagement — one that serves as a reliable partner to American innovators and a trusted engine for our nation’s energy security and economic future.

The scale and urgency of today’s energy challenges demand future-forward investments and a renewed sense of national purpose. The next 50 years will be defined by how we respond to transformational forces such as electrification, AI-driven industrial change and the global transition to cleaner energy systems — all while ensuring America’s global standing, resilient supply chains and the economic benefits and jobs that come from successfully navigating this transition.

Now is the time to choose our energy future. The choice is ours to make, but we must decide to act. Let’s show the world that America can meet this moment decisively, boldly, and on our own terms.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/IwlSklLkilxwyxrjny5PmILhTK8Ru4JrJpDjf2nU3HE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9QZW1icm9rZV9waW5lc19GbG9yaWRhX3RyYW5zbWlzc2lvbi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2026-01-13 12:13:39.069537

Kennedy Jr., publicly urged Donald Trump to fire Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin.

In a petition circulated online, MAHA proponents made a straightforward case: The EPA chief has prioritized corporate interests “over the well-being of American families and children.”

A month later, their case against Zeldin got even stronger. The New York Times reported:

Not anymore. Under President Trump, the E.P.A. plans to stop tallying gains from the health benefits caused by curbing two of the most widespread deadly air pollutants, fine particulate matter and ozone, when regulating industry, according to internal agency emails and documents reviewed by The New York Times.

The Times’ report, based on EPA materials that have not been independently reviewed by MS NOW, added that the change represents “a seismic shift” that’s plainly at odds with the reason the EPA exists.

Zeldin slammed the newspaper’s report as “dishonest,” but the Natural Resources Defense Council’s John Walke, a clean air advocate and former EPA lawyer, shredded Zeldin’s response to the Times’ article.

But it can’t do both.

Indeed, these conflicts are becoming increasingly common. When RFK Jr. campaigned for the Republican ticket in 2024, for example, the conspiracy theorist delivered a promise to voters: If he joined Trump’s team, he’d “ban the worst agricultural chemicals.”

A year later, the Trump administration is approving agricultural pesticides containing “forever chemicals” as an active ingredient, despite concerns raised by some scientists and environmental activists.",https://www.ms.now/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260113-air-pollution-zz.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2026-01-13 12:00:25.873100

Additionally, over the next four years, NextEra Energy has plans to invest an additional $120 billion in America’s energy infrastructure.","NextEra Energy is one of the biggest names in the energy sector. Tracing its origins to the launch of Florida Power & Light Company in 1925, the company has grown to become the largest energy infrastructure builder in the country, with a presence in 49 states, representing 76 gigawatts of battery storage, solar, natural gas, nuclear, and wind. NextEra Energy’s subsidiary, NextEra Energy Resources, spans 41 states and has 42 gigawatts of generating capacity, in addition to building transmission infrastructure.

NextEra Energy is contributing to cheaper, more reliable energy for Americans across the country. The company maintains a diverse portfolio of energy sources “to offer customers the lowest bill possible,” with renewables accounting for 57%, natural gas 34%, nuclear 8%, and other resources 1%. “From keeping the lights on today to modernizing transmission networks and developing next-generation energy projects,” NextEra Energy Resources explains, it is “helping America achieve true energy dominance and independence… Every project we build strengthens America’s energy security and economic leadership.” In Iowa, for example, the upcoming Lake Mills Wind project will provide 320 megawatts (MW) of clean energy to Winnebago County, while the Rock Creek Solar project will provide 150 megawatts of solar energy and 100 megawatts of battery storage to Clinton County and the cities of Clinton and Camanche.

These projects contribute to local economies in big ways. Over the past decade, NextEra Energy has invested $154 billion in local economies and paid approximately $8 billion in property taxes, which fund local schools, roads, other infrastructure, and emergency response services. Meanwhile, NextEra Energy Resources has struck deals with about 30,000 landowners, particularly in rural communities, offering them support from a dedicated team and stable compensation that they can reinvest in their operations. As Megan Murphy Salyer, a developer with NextEra, described this relationship: “You hear from the landowners who care deeply about the land. They’ve invested their lives in the land. They are the caretakers of it. Seeing them trust us to continue that role of caretaking in a way that provides them a stable income for generations and keep the land in the family is huge.”

In Iowa alone, NextEra Energy Resources has invested more than $3 billion since 1999, with $68 million in annual payroll impact, $11 million in annual property taxes, and $12 million in annual land payments. The upcoming Rock Creek Solar project represents an additional $320 million investment that will generate $11.6 million in tax revenue for Clinton County and the cities of Clinton and Camanche. The upcoming Lake Mills Wind project, meanwhile, will generate $200 million in tax revenue for Winnebago County, plus $180 million in landowner payments over its lifetime.

Additionally, over the next four years, NextEra Energy has plans to invest an additional $120 billion in America’s energy infrastructure. These investments will continue to “ripple through the economy, boosting local businesses in hospitality, transportation, and retail throughout both project development and operation,” the company wrote.

NextEra is also a vital local employer. As of the end of 2024, NextEra Energy employed more than 16,000 Americans. The Lake Mills Wind project, in particular, is creating up to 770 construction jobs, while the Rock Creek Solar project is creating up to 300. The company also invests in the future workforce by donating funds and tools, such as 3D printers and virtual reality technology, to community colleges through its STEM Classroom Makeover Grant.

Through its Renewable Energy Training (RET) initiative, meanwhile, it supports STEM programs and workshops for hundreds of students each year. For example, at Barstow College in Iowa, students can learn about a wide range of renewable technologies at a STEM camp. Internally, the Renewable Training Center in Iowa recorded more than 1,100 solar course completions last year alone. As David Smith, a member of the NextEra training team, summarized, “By encouraging our employees to push the boundaries of what’s possible, we tap into their creativity.”

These investments position America to excel across numerous industries. “As the nation faces surging electricity demand to foster technological innovation and power a resurgence in domestic manufacturing,” NextEra Energy Resources notes, “we’re building the infrastructure America needs to compete, grow and lead.”

NextEra Energy Resources is also at the forefront of innovation in new and important technologies. The company is planning to reopen the Duane Arnold Energy Center, the state’s sole nuclear power plant, which was shut down in 2020 after sustaining damage from a windstorm. Once operational, it will be a reliable, home-grown power source, generating 615 megawatts and providing electricity to American homes and businesses, reducing reliance on foreign energy imports. In partnership, Google entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement to buy this energy for its cloud and AI infrastructure in the state, with the remainder set to be purchased by the Central Iowa Power Cooperative (CIPCO). NextEra and Google also plan to explore more nuclear development across the country.

The economic impact cannot be understated here, either. Over the next 25 years, the center is expected to generate $9 billion in economic benefits for Linn County and the state, raise $75 million in taxes, and create 400 long-term jobs. As NextEra chairman and CEO John Ketchum reflected, “Google and NextEra Energy are answering the call of America’s golden age of power demand, creating thousands of jobs, strengthening Iowa’s economy, delivering long-term value to our shareholders and helping power America’s future through innovation and technology.”",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/482076898_1078809167608798_291436744535838906_n-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 13:59:56.292316
